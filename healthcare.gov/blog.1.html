            <div class="blog-post-content img-responsive"><p>Did you know that having health insurance when you can afford it is the law? If you can afford health insurance, but choose not to get it for 2016, you may be required to <a href="what-if-someone-doesnt-have-health-coverage-in-2014/index.html">pay a fee</a> — sometimes called the "penalty," "fine," or "individual mandate" — when you file your 2016 federal income taxes.</p>

<p>The good news is, affordable coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace is available. After financial help, 7 out of 10 people can find plans with premiums of less than $75 dollars per month. <strong>If you enroll by December 15, 2015, your coverage will start January 1, 2016.</strong></p>

            <div class="blog-post-content img-responsive"><p>If you enrolled in a plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace for 2014, you should’ve received an important tax statement in the mail, called <strong>Form 1095-A</strong>. This statement has information you need to fill out your 2014 federal income tax return.</p>

<p>Most people received a correct Form 1095-A. However, if we contacted you because your Form 1095-A is incorrect, here's one reason why. Some forms included the monthly premium amount of the second lowest cost Silver plan for 2015 instead of 2014. The incorrect amount is listed in Part III, Column B of the Form 1095-A. This doesn't mean your tax credit was incorrect; this is purely an error in what was printed on the form.</p>

<p>It’s important that you know where to go for medical care when you need it. There are some big differences between visits to your primary care provider and visits to the emergency room, such as cost, time spent waiting for care, and follow up.</p>

<p><strong><a href="using-your-new-marketplace-coverage/getting-medical-care.html">Getting regular medical care:</a></strong> Primary care providers work with you to ensure that you get the right preventive services, manage your chronic conditions, and improve your health. Before you go to the doctor’s office, clinic, or health center, visit your health plan’s website and check their provider directory online. You can also call your insurer directly with questions or call a provider to see if they accept your health plan.</p>

<p>When sickness or injury strike, having health insurance can mean the difference between falling and getting back up and dropping out of the game.</p>

<p>I know, because I was at the top of my game - I felt invincible - but when I went for my regular team physical it turned out I had a serious kidney disease. Thankfully it was caught in time to treat it and luckily, I was insured.</p>

<p><strong>More robust window shopping.</strong> You can now see detailed information about each Marketplace health insurance plan offered in your area before you apply. This new tool will allow you to see plan prices displayed much more accurately, based on the household information you supply. You can compare plans, covered benefits, physician and hospital networks, and more. No login or application required. Just answer a few simple questions to <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/find-premium-estimates/">see plans and prices in your area</a>. You will still need to complete the application to find out how you can get lower costs, but this is a much enhanced version of earlier information and one more way you can get the information you need to help you get ready to enroll and find a plan that fits your needs and budget.</p>

<p>In particular, many people told us they had problems creating their Marketplace accounts – that things got “stuck” somewhere along the way and they never got across the finish line. We’re working hard to fix all of the technical problems on HealthCare.gov and we can report that most users are now able to successfully create online Marketplace accounts.</p>

<p>You’ll know if you had problems with your account if you never got to see a big “SUCCESS” screen. Maybe the security questions froze, or you never got an email with a verification link, or the email link didn’t work. If this sounds like your experience, now is the time to try again to create a Marketplace account.</p>
