<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for investigating complaints alleging a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) "integration regulation," which requires that individuals with disabilities receive public services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. Typically, these "most integrated setting" complaints filed with OCR allege a violation of ADA rights as set out in the Supreme Court 1999 decision, Olmstead v. L.C., which interpreted the integration regulation. (<a href="#note1">Note 1</a>)</p>
<p>OCR's response to Olmstead complaints has had a significant impact in facilitating the community integration of individuals with disabilities. OCR has received complaints filed by or on behalf of a wide range of individuals, including individuals with physical, psychiatric, developmental and cognitive impairments, and individuals of all ages, including children, young and middle-aged adults, and elderly persons. As a result of OCR's efforts, many individuals have been able to move from an institution to the community, and many individuals have avoided unnecessary institutionalization. For example:</p>
<ul><li>OCR's intervention and assistance have helped secure community services for individuals who had been institutionalized for decades.</li>
	<li>OCR's efforts have resulted in the provision or restoration of community services for individuals who lost their housing and/or community-based supportive services when they entered institutions due to an acute health care problem.</li>
	<li>OCR's work with complainants, states and other parties have resulted in providing community services to individuals with disabilities through "waiver" programs.</li>
	<li>OCR's efforts have resulted in individuals receiving increased hours of personal care and assistance.</li>
	<li>OCR's work has resulted in individuals with disabilities having greater control over their community-based care and services.</li>
	<li>OCR has helped ensure that individuals are provided reasonable accommodations where they resided, rather than having to move to a more restrictive setting.</li>
</ul><p>In March 2002, in response to President Bush's Executive Order 13217, Community-Based Alternatives for People with Disabilities, HHS committed to broadly disseminate individual accounts of how its civil rights compliance activities have facilitated community integration. (See Delivering on the Promise, HHS' Report to the President on Executive Order 13217, available at www.hhs.gov/newfreedom/final/hhs.html.) Accordingly, OCR is providing the following accounts of satisfactorily resolved complaints affecting approximately 250 individuals.</p>
<p>More than 160 individuals involved in these cases moved from institutional to community settings, and more than 80 individuals who resided in the community avoided institutionalization as a result of OCR's work. As can be seen from these accounts, the resolution of these matters varied according to each set of facts and circumstances, and was tailored to appropriately and practically address the interests of the parties involved. Complainants, government entities and other parties worked cooperatively with OCR, often devising creative solutions to the issues involved in the complaints.</p>
<p>Some of OCR's activities resulted in systemic change. In Kentucky, OCR obtained a Voluntary Resolution Agreement in which the State agreed to undertake a variety of actions to identify, assess and transition to the community individuals residing in State-owned and -contracted psychiatric hospitals. In Virginia, following OCR's intervention and assistance, the State provided community services to OCR complainants with developmental disabilities and established a Task Force for the development of an Olmstead Plan. Virginia also issued an Executive Order which, among other things, increased the State's Medicaid waiver slots for individuals with mental retardation. In Oklahoma, OCR was already working with the State on its Olmstead planning and identification of barriers to community living when OCR began investigating complaints alleging that eligibility criteria for one of the State's Medicaid waiver programs put complainants at risk of unnecessary institutionalization. Following OCR's intervention, the State requested and received approval from the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to amend the waiver program's eligibility criteria in a manner that addressed the complainants' concerns. In Delaware, OCR's investigative and case resolution strategies resulted in the community placement of more than 50 individuals who had resided in a State psychiatric facility. In addition, as some of these examples reflect, OCR continued its efforts to serve as a catalyst for the development of State "comprehensive, effectively working plans" for services to people with disabilities discussed in the Olmstead decision. (A detailed report about state planning efforts is available from the website of the National Conference of State Legislators, at <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/health/forum/olmsreport2001.pdf">http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/health/forum/olmsreport2001.pdf</a>)</p>
<p>Descriptions of these cases follow. The summaries are grouped by state, and identified by the governmental or other entity against whom the complaint was filed. Some personal details about the complaints have been omitted to protect the complainants' privacy. For more information about these cases, please contact OCR, using the OCR docket number or numbers provided at the conclusion of each description.</p>
<p>Finally, OCR continues to be an integral part of HHS' response to Executive Order 13217 and the President's New Freedom Initiative for individuals with disabilities. (The text of Executive Order 13217, more information about the New Freedom Initiative and HHS' role in carrying out the initiative can be found at www.hhs.gov/newfreedom.) OCR works with the HHS Office on Disability (www.hhs.gov/od), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (www.cms.hhs.gov) and other HHS and other federal agency offices in joint ventures to promote the community integration of people with disabilities. OCR will continue both the investigation and resolution of complaints, and broad-based systemic activities as part of its continuing work in this important civil rights area.</p>
<h2>Case Descriptions</h2>
<h3>Colorado</h3>
<p><strong>Adams County, Colorado Department of Social Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of an individual with a brain injury who resided in the community. The complainant, who received services under a Medicaid waiver for persons with brain injury, alleged that a County jeopardized his ability to remain in the most integrated setting by making it unnecessarily difficult for him to apply for a Medicaid waiver for individuals who are elderly, blind and disabled (EBD). The complainant alleged that he would require the EBD waiver upon the expected expiration of his brain injury waiver services.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	OCR and the county negotiated an agreement that satisfactorily resolved the complaint. The complainant never experienced a break in services provided under the brain injury waiver. As part of the resolution, the OCR provided civil rights training for the county's home and community based services waiver staff.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing and Adams County, Colorado Department of Social Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a 30-year-old man with a brain injury who resides in the community with his family. The complaint alleged that the complainant is at risk of institutionalization because the State and a County denied him appropriate services and supports to enable him to live in the community.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	Through OCR's intervention and assistance, a number of issues involved in this complaint were resolved. The State arranged for the complainant to have a week of in-home services so that the complainant's mother could have respite from her care-giving responsibilities. The State replaced rehabilitation equipment used by the complainant. The State reimbursed the complainant's family for specialized glasses. The State investigated the complainant's assertion that a mechanical device used to lift the complainant was not working properly, and identified and paid for a replacement device. </p>
<p><strong>Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a woman with Multiple Sclerosis. The complainant, who lives at home, alleged that the State's policies put her at risk of unnecessary institutionalization because she could not obtain the daily and overnight care she needed to continue living in her home when the complainant's husband was carrying out responsibilities related to his National Guard service.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	OCR worked with the State and the complainant to resolve the issues in this matter. The complainant began receiving two additional Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) visits a day when her husband is away for National Guard duty. The complainant found this level of care adequate for her needs. The State also provided information as to the complainant's options should she believe that the level of home health care services she receives is inadequate. The complainant continues to receive Medicaid waiver services, including cleaning, meal preparation, and the use of certain medical equipment. </p>
<p><strong>Health Care Quality Improvement Organization, Denver, Colorado</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complainant, a person diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and lupus, alleged that the State discriminated against him of the basis of disability and national origin when he was determined ineligible for Home and Community-Based Services for the Elderly, Blind and Disabled (HCBS-EBD) waiver program. The complainant contended that without the HCBS-EBD waiver services he was at risk for unnecessary nursing home placement.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	As a result of OCR intervention and assistance, the complainant's HCBS-EBD services were restored. With his services restored, the complainant, after a short nursing home stay, was able to return to his own home. </p>
<p><strong>Assisted Living Facility, Durango, Colorado</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a person diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The complainant alleged that the State failed to make reasonable accommodations for her disability that would ensure her continued residency in an assisted living facility. The complainant feared that without reasonable accommodation she would be evicted from the assisted living facility and risked being unnecessarily institutionalized.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	OCR proposed that the parties enter into mediation to resolve their dispute. An initial mediation session was held in person with all the parties and numerous teleconferences followed. As a result of OCR's mediation efforts, the parties executed a Settlement Agreement that prevented the complainant's eviction from the assisted living facility and resolved the issue of reasonable accommodation. </p>
<p><strong>Colorado Department of Human Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a person diagnosed with Down syndrome, vision and speech impairments, neck fusion, and a bladder disease requiring daily catheterization. The complaint alleged that the State failed to provide him with residential services even though he had been approved for these services more than two years earlier. The complainant alleged that he was at risk of unnecessary institutionalization because his caretaker was unable to continue caring for him.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	As a result of OCR intervention and assistance, a settlement was reached that 1) enrolled the complainant in the home and community-based services waiver program for individuals with developmentally disabilities, 2) placed him in an apartment, and 3) met his catheterization needs, including training of staff on methods of catheterization. The settlement also ensured development of an individual plan to provide appropriate services and supports to ensure his successful placement in the community. </p>
<h3>Connecticut</h3>
<p><strong>Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a 22 year old woman with cerebral palsy and other health impairments. The complainant had lived in the community previously and was placed in a nursing home because of changes in her living situation and health care status. She wanted to move back into the community.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	Through the intervention and assistance of OCR, the complainant leased an apartment and enrolled in an Outreach and Engagement Program for counseling and case management services. OCR was directly involved with ensuring that services were in place for the complainant to leave the nursing home and move to a community-based setting. The complainant received a variety of community-based services, including counseling and intensive case management. </p>
<p><strong>Connecticut Department of Mental Retardation/Connecticut Department of Children and Families</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complainant alleged that the State failed to provide her son, who has numerous mental and physical disabilities including mental retardation and a seizure disorder, with services in the most integrated setting appropriate to his needs. The complainant sought corrective action with the desired end of receiving personal and home health care for her son.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	As a result of OCR's investigation, both State agencies took actions to support the individual's return to community living. Through the collaborative actions of OCR, the State, and the complainant, it was agreed that the following services would be provided: home health, nursing, respite care, repairs to the family van, money for clothing, and modifications (for physical accessibility) to the family's home. </p>
<p><strong>Connecticut Department of Mental Retardation</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed by a mother on behalf of her son, a young man who has a variety of disabilities including severe mental retardation, obsessive compulsive disorder, and seizure disorder. He received respite care in a State-run intermediate care facility for individuals with mental retardation, but sought community placement.</p>
<p><em>Disposition</em>:<br />
	The State agency agreed that the young man should be placed in the community with supportive services. The process was delayed due to the cost submitted by one of the contractors. Through OCR's intervention and assistance, all parties agreed on the plan and timetable for finding a suitable roommate and a provider to deliver the supportive services. OCR will monitor this case until all elements of the plan are implemented. </p>
<p><strong>Nursing Home, New Haven, Connecticut</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The Connecticut chapter of a nationwide advocacy group filed complaints with OCR on behalf of individuals who were then residents in a number of long-term care facilities. When OCR conducted an on-site visit to one of these facilities, a facility resident told OCR that like his roommate, he would like to be discharged to a less restrictive setting with appropriate housing and employment support. He has a variety of disabilities including traumatic brain injury and seizure disorder.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	Upon OCR's intervention and assistance, the facility's discharge planning staff worked cooperatively with the pertinent State agency to comply with the complainant's wish. As a result, he was placed on a waiting list with the New Haven Housing Authority and eventually moved into an apartment. </p>
<p><strong>Nursing Home, Avon, Connecticut</strong></p>
<p>Allegation:<br />
	The Connecticut chapter of a nationwide advocacy group filed this complaint on behalf of an individual living in a nursing home for more than 4 years. The individual has a variety of disabilities including mobility impairments. The Director of Nursing at the nursing home determined that he should be discharged into a community setting. The complainant alleged that the State agency was uncooperative.</p>
<p>Disposition:<br />
	Upon OCR's intervention, the State agency moved more promptly and placed the individual in an apartment using a Medicaid waiver for individuals with acquired brain injury. </p>
<p><strong>Nursing Home, Hartford, Connecticut</strong></p>
<p>Allegation:<br />
	The Connecticut chapter of a nationwide advocacy group filed this complaint on behalf of an individual living in a nursing home for more than 7 years. He sought community placement.</p>
<p>Disposition:<br />
	At the time the complaint was filed, the State agency was evaluating whether the individual would be eligible for an Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) waiver. He stayed in the nursing home primarily because of the lack of affordable housing, the need for the right roommate, and supportive services. OCR's intervention resulted in the State agency providing the complainant with community services through the ABI waiver. </p>
<h3>Delaware</h3>
<p><strong>Delaware Department of Health and Social Services and Delaware Psychiatric Center</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	An advocacy group filed this complaint on its own behalf, and on behalf of nine individuals and a purported class of individuals with mental illness who resided at a State psychiatric hospital. The complaint alleged that hospital residents who sought discharge and whose treating professionals had determined that community placement was appropriate were subjected to inappropriate institutionalization.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	Through nearly four years of OCR's intervention and assistance, the State took actions to address the individual and systemic issues involved in this complaint, including placing into the community more than 50 individuals. After OCR made a preliminary finding that six of the nine individuals identified in the complaint were ready for discharge, the State discharged these individuals to community-based settings. The State also agreed to provide OCR with a list of an additional 66 individuals who were ready for discharge, to work toward placing these individuals into the community and to review with OCR the progress in discharging these individuals after one year. The State placed 45 of these 66 individuals into the community within one year.</p>
<p>After OCR asked the State for information about additional individuals ready for discharge, OCR investigated the State's assertion that there were no additional individuals for whom community placement was appropriate. Specifically, OCR reviewed information regarding several individuals identified by complainants as allegedly ready for discharge, and concluded that the State's actions with respect to these individuals did not violate the ADA's integration regulation. </p>
<p><strong>Delaware Department of Health and Social Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of an individual diagnosed with cerebral palsy and osteoarthritis. The complainant uses a wheelchair for ambulation and requires substantial assistance in all aspects of daily living. The complainant, who had lived in an institution for approximately 25 years, expressed a desire to live in the community. Treatment professionals determined that she was eligible and qualified to receive services in the community. However, after more than 12 months of delay in providing a community-based residential placement, a complaint was filed that alleged that the State had failed to provide services in the most integrated setting.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	As a result of OCR intervention, the complainant was discharged from the institution to a community-based apartment. </p>
<h3>Georgia</h3>
<p><strong>State of Georgia</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a person with a disability who resided in an institution for more than 27 years.

	This complaint was filed on behalf of a 32-year-old man with quadriplegia, who had previously lived in an apartment with the assistance of a home health aide. The complainant lost his apartment and was involuntarily transferred to an institution. The complainant was subsequently offered a wheelchair accessible apartment that was suitable to his needs, but was unable to move to the apartment because of his inability to obtain home health care services. The complainant alleged that he was verbally denied home health care services because he was not able to provide appropriate back-up for these services.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	With OCR's intervention, the complainant was accepted into a Consumer Directed Program which allowed him to coordinate and employ his own personal care assistance aides. OCR assisted the complainant in securing an aide and the complainant was discharged from the institution and is now living in his own apartment in the community. (OCR Docket # 02013023)</p>
<p><strong>New York State Department of Health/ Monroe County, N.Y. Department of Social Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complainant has multiple sclerosis and had lived in the community with home care for over 20 years. For the last 13 years, she had received 8 to 10 hours of care per day, including a Personal Emergency Response System (PERS), which allowed her to be left alone for a limited period of time. During a hospitalization, the State agency providing the complainant with home care closed her case. Efforts to secure home health services from other sources were unsuccessful and the complainant was allegedly placed in an institution against her will.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	Working with the Consumer Directed Personal Assistance program and the State, OCR was able to put in place an arrangement which permitted the complainant to move back into her home and receive an increase to 16 hours per day of attendant services. </p>
<p><strong>New York State Department of Health</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complainant, who has quadriplegia, lives at her home and uses a motorized wheelchair. She requires a great deal of help in bathing, dressing, bowel and bladder assistance, and other activities of daily living. She is in the Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program where aides are paid $6.00 an hour. She is responsible for locating, hiring, training and scheduling the aides. The complainant believed that discrimination existed because the county in which she lives pays a lower hourly rate in Medicaid funds to medical assistants than other counties in the State. The complainant alleged that this low pay rate puts her at risk of unnecessary institutionalization since it is extremely difficult to find aides because of the low reimbursement rate.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	In collaboration with the State and other stakeholders, OCR negotiated an increase in the reimbursement for home health aides in the county where the complainant resided, from $6 to $10 per hour. At this new rate, the complainant was able to secure a home health aide and remain in a community setting. </p>

<h3>Oklahoma</h3>
<p><strong>Oklahoma Department of Human Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation</em><br />
	Five complainants with quadriplegia filed complaints with OCR regarding a change in eligibility criteria for a Medicaid waiver program to provide community services to individuals who are elderly or have physical disabilities. The complainants alleged that they were at risk of unnecessary institutionalization due to a change to eligibility criteria concerning the age of onset of disability.</p>
<p><em>Disposition</em><br />
	OCR initiated its efforts to resolve these complaints in the context of work with the State on its Olmsteadplanning process and identification of barriers to community living. After OCR began its investigation, the State requested and received approval from the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for an amendment to the waiver program's eligibility criteria. The amendment raised the age of onset of disability for eligible individuals. When this amendment took effect, all of the complainants were once again eligible for the waiver program. OCR documented that the State resumed providing each complainant with appropriate community-based services through the waiver, and closed the complaints. </p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma Department of Human Services (ODHS)</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complainant alleged that Oklahoma's Advantage Waiver program (a Medicaid waiver program for individuals with physical disabilities) failed to provide him a full range of services to allow him to continue living in the most integrated setting in the community. The complainant has quadriplegia and uses a wheelchair. The complainant alleged that ODHS allowed contractors to endanger his well being by providing no back-up services for providers who fail to show for work and by failing to provide enough hours to let him live independently (a minimum of 42 hours a week). The complainant lived on his own in an apartment on his mother's property. His mother provided additional care in the evening. However, his dependency on his mother strained their relationship, and the complainant paid for his own aides for about 15 months. The complainant's aide could not be certified to provide the service through a Medicaid home health agency due to felony convictions. The complainant had his services terminated by several home health agencies due to his reportedly uncooperative and inappropriate behaviors.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	OCR and ODHS worked together to resolve the complainant's individual issues. He now lives in his own Section 8 apartment and is receiving 42 hours (AM and PM) of home visits 7 days a week to provide personal care and homemaking chores; skilled nursing visits; medication; and medical supplies and equipment. </p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma Department of Human Services (ODHS)</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a 35-year-old woman with quadriplegia. She is a graduate student at a local university. The complaint alleged the university's program for persons with physical disabilities failed to provide her with sufficient services to enable her to live in on-campus housing which was alleged to be the most integrated setting appropriate to the complainant's needs.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	OCR and ODHS worked together to resolve the issues raised by this complainant through an informal resolution process. The complainant now receives 45 hours a week of home health services to provide her daily personal care and housekeeping services; skilled nursing visits; medication; medical supplies and equipment; and a mechanical lift. The complainant is able to live in on-campus housing and continue her education. </p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma Department of Human Services (ODHS)</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a 47-year-old man who has quadriplegia and who lives in his own apartment. The complainant alleged that ODHS discriminated by failing to provide continuous services, in the least restrictive and most appropriate integrated environment. Also, the complaint alleged that the State is forcing people with disabilities into nursing homes because they cannot receive the necessary services to live independently.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	This complaint was resolved through the informal resolution process. The complainant is now receiving the following services through Oklahoma's waiver program for individuals with physical disabilities: 1) AM and PM visits 7 days a week to provide personal care and homemaking chores; 2) total assistance to transfer from bed to wheelchair; 3) skilled nursing visits; and 4) medical supplies and equipment.

<h3>Pennsylvania</h3>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The Philadelphia chapter of a nationwide advocacy group alleged that the State fails to provide services in the most integrated setting to persons with disabilities.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	After OCR initiated its investigation, the State took a number of actions to address issues presented by this complaint. The State developed a long term plan to address the waiting list for mental retardation services in Pennsylvania and created ongoing regional planning groups to address community mental health for adults and a program for reducing beds in State mental institutions and transferring funds to the community. The State also initiated a home and community based services stakeholder planning team to examine services to people with disabilities. OCR concluded that the State had made progress in systemic planning and involving interested parties in the planning process. OCR also stated, however, that the work to achieve the goals outlined in theOlmstead decision is a long-term process and thus continues to monitor the development and implementation of the State's long-range planning to ensure that services are provided to people with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. </p>
<h3>Rhode Island</h3>
<p><strong>Rhode Island Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a woman with mental illness, mental retardation and physical impairments who resided with her parents. The complaint alleged that the State denied the complainant services in the most integrated setting appropriate to her needs by attempting to force the complainant to live in a group home setting instead of in her own apartment with a coordinated plan of care.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	OCR's intervention and technical assistance to the State resulted in the State agreeing to adopt a comprehensive plan, proposed by the complainant's family, to evaluate and provide services to the complainant so that she could live in her own apartment.</p>

<h3>Texas</h3>
<p><strong>Texas Health &amp; Human Service Commission/Texas Department of Human Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complainant, who has a mobility impairment, depression and asthma, alleged that she was unnecessarily confined to a nursing home as a result of the determination by a State contractor that the she did not require Home- and Community-Based Waiver services.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	OCR worked with the complainant, an advocacy organization, the State and the State's contractor to resolve this complaint. The complainant agreed to provide the State's contractor with a letter from her doctor that outlined her need for community based services. The contractor then deemed the complainant eligible for community-based services. Shortly thereafter, the complainant moved from the nursing home back into her own home, where she received the necessary supports. </p>
<p><strong>Texas Department of Human Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complainant alleged that her daughter, who resided at home, was at risk of unnecessary institutionalization because the skilled nursing care provided the daughter by the State's Comprehensive Care Program (CCP) would be eliminated when the daughter turned 21, and would no longer be eligible for CCP services. The complainant's daughter has cerebral palsy and allegedly requires constant care.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	After OCR initiated its investigation, the complainant's daughter began receiving 16 hours a day services from an attendant who is supervised by and consults with a nurse. Following conversations between OCR, the State and the complainant, the complainant determined that she was satisfied with these "nurse-delegated" services, and OCR closed the complaint. </p>
<p><strong>Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a man with mental retardation and mobility impairments. The complainant, a former nursing home resident, lived in his own apartment with supportive services. The complaint alleged that the State and complainant's service provider, a State contractor, intended to terminate the complainant's community services. The complaint alleged that the complainant was at risk of inappropriate institutionalization.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	This complaint was resolved as a result of OCR's intervention and assistance. OCR gave the complainant's provider information about the ADA's integration requirement and the Olmstead decision. The provider then decided to continue the complainant's community services. </p>
<p><strong>Texas Department of Human Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a 10-year-old boy with mental retardation and physical impairments. The complaint alleged that the State failed to provide the child with full home and community-based services when he was found ineligible for Primary Home Care Medicaid Waiver services.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	OCR determined that while the child was not eligible for the Primary Home Care Medicaid Waiver, he was qualified for similar services available under the State's Mental Health and Mental Retardation home and community services program. Since application for these services had not been received, the State, at the behest of OCR, is working closely with the complainant to ensure that the child receives all services for which he is eligible. The child continues to live in the community. </p>
<p><strong>Texas Department Mental Health and Mental Retardation</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a person with a mobility impairment and mild mental retardation. The complainant alleged that he was in danger of unnecessary institutionalization due to recommendations from his health care provider that he immediately be moved to a nursing home.</p>

<p><strong>Mental Health and Mental Retardation Services of Tarrant County (MHMRTC), Texas</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complainant alleged that the County discriminated against him based on disability by providing him with inadequate care and services. The complainant has a number of psychiatric and physical impairments. He uses a wheelchair in order to be mobile and requires oxygen 24 hours a day, seven days a week. He alleged that he was not receiving necessary and appropriate mental health services from the County, was unable to access certain services due to his mobility impairment, and feared that the lack of services would result in his becoming institutionalized and/or in drastic and unnecessary deterioration of his physical and mental health. The complainant stated that he was receiving inadequate food and experiencing problems with emergency response, a lack of accessible transportation, and inadequate progress towards community reintegration.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	OCR worked with the County and other parties to resolve the issues of this complaint. OCR initiated a meeting among the service providers, the complainant and the complainant's legal advocate to assess the situation. The meeting led to an agreement among the parties, which resolved all of the issues included in the complaint. </p>
<h3>Utah</h3>
<p><strong>Utah Department Health and Utah Department of Human Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a 27-year-old woman with physical impairments, mental retardation and other medical conditions. The complainant resided with her parents, but wanted to live independently. While residing at home, the complainant received supportive services, including participation in a day training program, respite for her parents, financial assistance for services to assist her in participating in community activities, transportation to the day program and case management. The complaint alleged that the complainant had been on a waiting list to receive residential services in the community for 11 years. Allegedly, the complainant's family was told that she would receive community residential services if her parents died and if no siblings were available to care for her.</p>
<p><em>Disposition</em><br />
	This case was resolved following OCR's intervention and assistance.

<p><strong>Utah Department of Human Services and Utah Department of Health</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a 57-year-old woman who was residing in a nursing home and who has a variety of neurological, physical, development and psychiatric impairments. The complaint alleged that the State failed to provide the complainant with appropriate community-based services and instead placed her in a nursing home and on a waiting list for community care. The complaint alleged that the affected party was unnecessarily institutionalized.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	OCR worked with the State and the complainant's advocate to address the issues raised by this complaint. OCR learned that resolving this complaint would require finding an appropriate placement both for the complainant and for her husband, a fellow nursing home resident with his own serious impairments. The State demonstrated to OCR that it was actively engaged in efforts to locate an appropriate placement where the complaint and her husband could live together. Ultimately the State completed an assessment process for the complainant and her husband and solicited bids from providers interested in serving the complainant and her husband. The complainant and her husband visited some of these placements. Based on these developments and following discussions with the complainant's advocate, OCR terminated its investigation and monitoring of this complaint. </p>
<p><strong>Utah Department of Health and Utah Department of Human Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of an individual with multiple physical impairments and mental retardation. The complainant alleged that although the State had approved him for residential services, he has remained on a waiting list for such services for more than eleven years. The complainant contends that the State informed him that he would only be able to access residential services if there were a critical need (i.e., death of a parent and the other parent of siblings are unable to care for him).</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	As a result of OCR intervention, the complainant was removed from the waiting list and placed in an apartment with two other persons. This placement has resulted in the complainant's receipt of increased community-based services, specifically residential services which permit him to live independently in the community. </p>
<h3>Virginia</h3>
<p><strong>Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	Thirty-two individuals with mental retardation who resided in the community complained of inability to obtain services from the State's Mental Retardation (MR) Waiver Program. These individuals alleged that the State's failure to provide them with waiver services put the complainants at risk of inappropriate institutionalization.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	OCR urged the State to develop strategies to address the issues presented by these complaints, including through developing and implementing an Olmstead plan that addresses the MR Waiver Program and its waiting list, making a commitment to increase the number of MR Waiver slots and developing a budget plan for submission to the state legislature seeking necessary funds for MR Waiver services. Ultimately, the State took action consistent with OCR's request. The State established a Task Force for the development of an OlmsteadPlan and issued a Final Report of that Task Force. The Governor issued an Executive Order to begin implementing the recommendations contained in that report, which included increasing MR waiver slots by 160 over a two-year period, and specific budget strategies to address ongoing issues of community integration.</p>
<p>In addition, as a result of OCR's intervention and assistance, the State provided community-based services to the majority of the individual complainants, and provided OCR with detailed information about the status of the complainants who had not received services. Thus, OCR closed this complaint but notified the State that OCR will continue to investigate any future individual complaints, and will monitor the development and implementation of the State's long range planning and activities to ensure the provision of services in the most integrated setting. </p>
<h3>Washington</h3>
<p><strong>Washington Department of Social and Health Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complainant, an individual with quadriplegia, alleged that the State violated the Olmstead decision in that Medically Needy Medicaid clients whose income exceeded the Categorically Needy level could receive long-term services only in a nursing home. As a result, because of his income level, the complainant was able to receive the Medicaid long-term personal care services he needed only if he resided in a nursing home.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	As a result of OCR intervention and the State’s long-term efforts, the State established two new waiver programs under which the State could provide long-term personal care services to both Categorically Needy and Medically Needy clients in the full-range of settings, from institutional to in-home. The State also agreed to commit State funds to equalize the personal needs allowance provisions available for Medically Needy and Categorically Needy individuals, thus making home-based services equally available to Medically Needy individuals. </p>
<p><strong>Eastern State Hospital</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complainant, a woman with mental illness who had been institutionalized for 12 years in a State psychiatric hospital, alleged that she requested discharge from the facility and that she wanted to leave the facility for years, but to no avail. She alleged that she was not receiving services in the most integrated setting appropriate to her needs.</p>
<p><em>Disposition</em><br />
	For several months, OCR worked with the parties to resolve this complaint. OCR contacted officials at the hospital, including members of the complainant's treatment team. OCR's information-gathering included discussing with State and hospital officials ongoing efforts to place the complainant in a more integrated setting in the community and obstacles to community placement. Following OCR's intervention and assistance, the complainant was placed in a community facility that was appropriate to her needs. </p>
<p><strong>Washington Department of Social and Health Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a person diagnosed with mental illness and unspecified physical disabilities who lived in a facility for people with mental illness. The complainant alleged that despite her best efforts, and those of her treatment team, she was unable to move to a more integrated setting because of the difficulty of finding community-based services for persons with mental illness.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	At OCR's urging, the State accelerated its efforts to provide the complainant with community placement, and the complainant moved to the community shortly after filing the complaint. </p>
<p><strong>Washington Department of Social and Health Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	OCR received a complaint filed by a patient at one of the public psychiatric hospitals in the State of Washington. The complainant, a person with a mental disability, alleged that she had lived in psychiatric hospitals for more than three years and all her attempts to be moved into a more integrated setting appropriate to her needs had been unsuccessful. The complainant alleged that the State's failure to move her into the community constituted discrimination on the basis of disability.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	Working closely with the State, OCR helped establish a new procedure to accelerate the turn-around time for acceptance of an individual into the community resource network. As a result of these efforts, the complainant was moved into a group home. In addition, other similarly situated individuals were helped by the new procedure to remove barriers to the expeditious placement of individuals in particular communities. </p>

<p><strong>West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of an individual with muscular dystrophy who is ventilator dependent and requires 24-hour nursing services. These services, which the complainant has been receiving for several years, allowed him to live in his own apartment. The complainant alleged that these services were scheduled to be discontinued in the near future. He alleged that discontinuation of these services would put him at risk of unnecessary institutionalization.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	Working with the State, OCR was able to find another provider who agreed to provide the services the complainant requires through the State's Developmental Disabilities waiver.</p>

	The complaint was filed on behalf of a 55-year-old man with a spinal cord injury who uses a wheelchair and had lived in a nursing home for more than four years. Allegedly, the State had determined that the complainant was eligible for a Medicaid waiver program that would provide him with community-based care, but the complainant expected to remain on the waiver program waiting list for approximately five years. The complainant alleged that he was denied services in the most integrated setting appropriate to his needs.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	After OCR initiated its investigation, the State provided the complainant with services in an eight-bed community residential facility. In addition, the complainant's service plan indicated that the eight-bed setting would offer the opportunity to assess the possibility of a more independent living arrangement in the future. The positive result in this complaint was accomplished based on persistent intervention by OCR staff. OCR made continued efforts to seek information about and resolve this case despite a County's initial reluctance to consider community-based placement for the complainant and expressed concerns -- although treating professionals had recommended community-based care -- that placement might not be successful. After repeated inquiries from OCR, the placement was ultimately achieved. </p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services/Dunn County, Wisconsin Department of Human Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	A woman filed this complaint on behalf of her 25-year-old son, who was diagnosed with the genetic disorder Prader-Willi Syndrome. The complainant's son had been alternating between living at home and in various institutional placements for two years. The complainant alleged that her son wanted community-based services through a Medicaid waiver program, but that the State had failed to provide him with these services due to a very long waiting list for the waiver program.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	Following OCR's intervention and assistance, the complainant moved to a supervised apartment with a variety of supportive services, including pre-vocational activities, transportation, case management, and two hours of personal care services each day. Based upon its investigation, OCR found that, because of the County's long waiting list for community placements, the complainant had been moved several times to different institutional placements, several of which his family asserted were not programmatically appropriate. OCR contacted the State and worked with it to devise a unique solution, in which the State approved an enhanced payment rate for the placement, and funding for a waiver slot was "loaned" to the County so that the community placement could be made. </p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	OCR received a number of complaints filed on behalf of individuals with mental retardation and in some cases other impairments, who resided in an institution for people with mental retardation. Each of these complainants alleged that they were denied services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. Each complainant wanted to move from the institution to a community-based setting, such as a group home or an apartment.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	After OCR began its investigation of these cases and as a result of the closure of an institution, each of these complainants was provided with a community based placement. Some complainants moved to group homes; others were provided with assisted living arrangements. OCR compliance activities in the State of Wisconsin were a factor in the State's decision to assess and provide community services to these complainants. In each case, after confirming that the complainants were satisfied with their placements, OCR closed the complaint. </p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin Department of Health &amp; Family Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complainant alleged that the State failed to provide a person with cerebral palsy with an opportunity to live in the most integrated setting appropriate to his needs. The complainant had been living at home with his parents but was not receiving Medicaid waiver services due to lack of funding. The complaint further alleged that continued home placement under those circumstances came at great personal sacrifice by the family and posed the risk of unnecessary institutionalization.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	As a result of OCR intervention and assistance, the complainant was approved for Community Integration Program services. Among the services provided to the complainant via this Medicaid waiver program are workshops, day programming and respite care. Transportation was also authorized but was on hold until the provider had an opening. </p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	This complaint was filed on behalf of a man with cerebral palsy who lived in a nursing home for 28 years, since the age of 18, and wished to move to a community setting. The complainant alleged that the State failed to provide him with an opportunity to live in the most integrated setting appropriate to his needs in violation of the ADA's integration regulation. He had been on a waiting list for 5 years and was told that his name would not come up to the top of the list for 1 or 2 more years.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	With OCR intervention and assistance, the complainant moved from the nursing home to an apartment. The move was facilitated by COP (Community Option Program) Waiver Funding for Nursing Home Relocations for one year. The County will receive funding annually in its COP-Waiver allocation to continue the placement. </p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin Department of Health &amp; Family Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complaint alleged that the State failed to provide the complainant, a person with cerebral palsy and cognitive disability, with an opportunity to leave a nursing home and live in a community setting.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	Working with the State, OCR helped secure the complainant's move from the nursing home to an adult family group home. Funding for the relocation became available when the complainant, with OCR assistance, was placed in the County's family care management program. </p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin Department of Health &amp; Family Services/Sheboygan County, Wisconsin Department of Human Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complaint alleged that the State discriminated against a man with cognitive and physical impairments on the basis of disability by failing to provide him the residential and supported employment services that he had tried to obtain on his own for 5 years. As a result, the complainant alleged he was at risk of unnecessary institutionalization.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	Working with the State, OCR helped secure 7 hours per month of Supported Employment job coaching for the complainant; 3 hours of support per week for housekeeping, shopping, and other tasks the complainant cannot perform on his own; and 2 hours of support 2 days per week to help the complainant develop additional self-help skills. In addition, the State bore the cost for the complainant's specialized transportation service. </p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin Department of Health &amp; Family Services/Milwaukee County, Wisconsin Department of Human Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complainant, a person with developmental and neurological impairments, alleged that the State discriminated against her on the basis of disability by failing to provide her with appropriate home and community-based services and by placing her on a waiting list, thus failing to place her in the most integrated setting appropriate to her needs.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	OCR worked with the State for nearly a year to provide a placement in a group home or an apartment with community services. However, the complainant chose to move out of state to live with her extended family. The State assisted the complainant with moving expenses. </p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin Department of Health &amp; Family Services/Dunn County, Wisconsin Department of Human Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complaint alleged that the State failed to find an appropriate community placement for a person with neurological and physical disorders , therefore, the complainant had no choice other than to reside in a nursing home.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	As a result of OCR intervention, the complainant was moved from the nursing home to a community-based Adult Family Home. The move was made possible when the State provided the County with COP (Community Option Program)Waiver Funding for Nursing Home Relocations. (OCR Docket # 05013127)</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services/Dane County, Wisconsin Department of Human Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complainant, a 79-year-old woman who uses a wheelchair and is unable to communicate due to a stroke, had lived in a 20 bed Community-based Residential Facility (CBRF) for more than two years. Her stay at the CBRF was paid for through private funds. When the complainant's funds were exhausted, she contacted the State about Medicaid assistance. She was reportedly told that there was a waiting list for Medicaid waiver services and that it was possible she would have to move to a nursing home, where Medicaid would pay the cost of the placement. As a consequence, a complaint was filed alleging that the State had failed to provide the necessary resources to permit her to live in the least restrictive setting.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	Working with the State and other stakeholders, OCR helped secure Community Options Program (COP) funds which allowed the complainant to remain in the community.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin Department of Health &amp; Family Services/Dunn County, Wisconsin Department of Human Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complaint alleged that the State discriminated against a man who had suffered a stroke on the basis of disability, by denying him participation in the Community Options Program (COP) and the additional home services that would enable him to continue to live at home.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	OCR worked with the State for a year to secure the State provided-services sought by the complainant. The State purchased a lift chair and installed a hand railing on the stairs of the complainant's mobile home. In addition, the complainant is currently participating in the Senior Citizen Center's Meals on Wheels program. </p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin Department of Health &amp; Family Services/Milwaukee County, Wisconsin</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	Seven complaints were filed with OCR by the Wisconsin Coalition for Advocacy (the State Protection and Advocacy agency) alleging that the State discriminated against the complainants on the basis of disability by failing to place them in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. All complainants lived in an Intermediate Care Facility for individuals with mental retardation. All had expressed an interest in living in the community, but were on waiting lists with an estimated wait of between 5 and 10 years before waiver funds would be available.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	OCR worked with the State to resolve these complaints. Due to financial and programmatic concerns, the State took over receivership of the facility and adopted a plan to move 90% of the residents to community settings and close the facility. All seven complainants moved into the community. </p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin Department of Health &amp; Family Services/Grant County, Wisconsin Department of Human Services/Iowa County, Wisconsin Unified Board</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complainant, a woman with cerebral palsy, alleged that the State failed to provided a community placement that would enable her to leave a nursing home and live in the community.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	Working with the State, OCR helped secure community placement for the complainant. </p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services/Sauk County, Wisconsin Department of Human Services</strong><br /><em>Allegation:</em><br />
	The complaint alleged that the State failed to provide assistance to enable a man with a neurological and cognitive impairments to remain at home, thus putting him at risk of unnecessary institutionalization.</p>
<p><em>Disposition:</em><br />
	As a result of OCR intervention and assistance, the State conducted a comprehensive review to determine appropriate services for the complainant. The State assigned a new case manager to ensure that the programs for which the complainant was eligible were made available. In addition, an independent team of stakeholders was put in place to assist the case manager in overseeing service delivery.</p>
<p>----------------------------</p>
<p><a id="note1" name="note1"></a>Note 1: In Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the Supreme Court held that the unnecessary institutionalization of qualified individuals with disabilities in institutions is a form of discrimination prohibited by the ADA. The Court held that states are required to provide community-based services for people with disabilities who would otherwise be entitled to institutional services when: (a) treatment professionals reasonably determine that such placement is appropriate; (b) the affected person does not oppose such treatment; and (c) the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the state and the needs of other individuals with disabilities.</p>
