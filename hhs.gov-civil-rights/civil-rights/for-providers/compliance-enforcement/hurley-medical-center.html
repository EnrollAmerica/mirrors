<p>Between the</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</p>
<p>Office for Civil Rights</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Hurley Medical Center</p>
<p>OCR Transaction Number: 13-156114</p>
<h2>I. Introduction</h2>
<p>This Resolution Agreement (Agreement) is entered into by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office for Civil Rights (OCR), and Hurley Medical Center (Hurley), a public safety net hospital and medical center which provides roughly two-thirds of all uncompensated medical care in the Flint, Michigan area.  This Agreement resolves OCR transaction number 13-156114, a compliance review opened on February 27, 2013, in response to media reports about Hurley’s alleged discriminatory assignment of nurses in Hurley’s Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in response to a request by the father of a baby patient, beginning October 31, 2012.</p>
<p>OCR conducted an investigation to determine Hurley’s compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §2000d, and its implementing regulation, 45 C.F.R. Part 80 and 81 (collectively, “Title VI”), in Hurley’s assignment of hospital employees to care for patients.  OCR’s investigation revealed that on the evening of October 31, 2012, Hurley re-assigned an African-American nurse who was providing care to a Caucasian infant in the NICU based on the father’s request that no African-Americans provide care to his child. Hurley staff members indicated that prior to this request, the father had discussed his prison record with them and made racist remarks regarding African-Americans. Hurley staff members also indicated that they observed a swastika tattoo on the father’s arm. In light of the father’s comments about his prison record and African-Americans and the swastika on his arm, Hurley staff stated that they had concerns for the NICU nurses’ safety if the father’s request was not granted. OCR’s investigation further revealed that on November 1, 2012, around 3:30 p.m., a written note was placed on the NICU nurses’ patient assignment sheet that stated, “Please no African American nurses to care for [name redacted] baby per Dad’s request Thank You.” The written note was removed from the assignment sheet around 5 p.m. on the same afternoon, once Hurley’s Vice President General Counsel informed the staff, the father’s request could not be granted.</p>
<p>Hurley cooperated with OCR throughout its investigation. Hurley confirmed that the written note was placed on the NICU patient assignment sheet for a brief period of time on November 1, 2012. Hurley also stated that it did not have a specific policy or procedure in place as of November 1, 2012, governing how staff should respond to patient requests for staff or room assignments based upon race. Since OCR opened its compliance review, Hurley has either enacted new policies and procedures or modified existing policies and procedures that address the issues raised in OCR’s review, (collectively “Nondiscrimination Policies and Procedures”). OCR reviewed Hurley’s Nondiscrimination Policies and Procedures and approved them prior to the execution of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Assigning staff on the basis of a patient’s racial preference or on the basis of the racial preference of the parent of a minor child or other family member who is authorized to act as a decision maker for a patient violates Title VI. See November 1969 OCR Guidelines for Compliance of Hospitals with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.</p>
<p>The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) also conducted an investigation of the events of October 31 and November 1, 2012 at Hurley, in response to an employment discrimination complaint filed by Tonya Battle, a Hurley nurse, on November 6, 2012, alleging that Hurley’s discriminatory assignment of African-American nurses in the NICU constituted employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e, <i>et seq.</i> and its implementing regulations (Title VII). As a result of its investigation, the EEOC determined that “reasonable cause” existed to find that Hurley had engaged in discriminatory conduct, but that in accordance with the EEOC’s customary practice of making “efforts to conciliate the discriminatory issues which gave rise to the initial charge,” <sup>i</sup> it entered into a Conciliation Agreement with Hurley in September 2013, <sup>ii</sup> resolving the Title VII discrimination issues through Hurley’s voluntary corrective actions.</p>
<h2>II. Parties to the Agreement</h2>
<ol type="A"><li>OCR; and</li>
	<li>Hurley<sup>iii</sup>.</li>
</ol><h2>III. Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>OCR is the HHS office charged with enforcing civil rights laws as they pertain to programs funded by HHS, and so has jurisdiction over this compliance review under Title VI. Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in the administration of any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance (FFA). Hurley receives FFA from HHS in the form of Medicare Part A payments.</p>
<h2>IV. Purpose of this agreement</h2>
<p>To resolve these matters expeditiously and without the further burden or expense of administrative action or litigation, Hurley agrees to the terms stipulated in this Agreement and to adhere in all respects to Title VI. The promises, obligations, or other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement constitute the exchange of valuable consideration between Hurley and OCR. The actions described in this Agreement fully address the issues that were raised and investigated in the compliance review. This Agreement shall not be construed as an admission or as evidence of any violation of any law or regulation or of any liability or wrongdoing on the part of Hurley.</p>
<h2>V. Definitions</h2>
<p>For purposes of this Agreement, the terms listed below shall have the following meaning:</p>
<p>A. <u>Patient</u></p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">Any individual who is seeking or receiving health care services, including in-patient or outpatient treatment and consultations.</p>
<p>B. <u>Family Member and Companion</u></p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">A person who is one of the following: (a) a person whom the Patient designates to communicate with Hurley on his or her behalf regarding the Patient’s condition or care or to help the Patient act on the information, advice or instructions provided by Hurley Staff; (b) a person legally authorized to make health care decisions on behalf of the Patient, such as a parent of a minor child or the holder of a power of attorney for health care; or (c) such other person with whom Hurley Staff would ordinarily and regularly communicate regarding the Patient’s medical condition.</p>
<p>C. <u>Title VI Coordinator</u></p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">The individual designated by Hurley management to coordinate Hurley’s efforts to comply with and carry out its Title VI responsibilities.</p>
<p>D. <u>Hurley Staff</u></p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">All Hurley employees, as well as contractors working with Hurley, including, without limitation, nurses, physicians, social workers, technicians, dieticians, and all volunteers, who have or are likely to have direct contact with Patients and Family Members and Companions as defined herein. The term also includes all physicians or other health care professionals who have medical staff privileges that permit them to see or treat Patients at Hurley facilities.</p>
<h2>VI. General Obligation</h2>
<p>Pursuant to Title VI, no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in the administration of any program or activity receiving FFA.</p>
<p>In addition, in 1969 OCR issued Guidance to hospitals that receive FFA, such as Medicare Part A, regarding appropriate means of compliance with Title VI. The Guidance is titled “Guidelines for Compliance of Hospitals with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.” OCR makes clear in the Guidance that non-discrimination extends to all activities affecting the care and treatment of patients. In particular, the Guidance states:</p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">Hospitals which are in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act are characterized by an absence of separation, discrimination or other distinction on the basis of race, color, or national origin in any activity conducted by, for, or in the institution affecting the care and treatment of patients.</p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">Compliance with Title VI requires adherence to the following policies and practices: ....</p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">3. <u>Services and Physical Facilities Provided by the Hospital….</u></p>
<p style=" margin-left: 100.0px;">e. Assignment of staff to patients is not governed by the race, color, or national origin of either patient or staff.</p>
<p>The Guidance is attached to this Agreement as Attachment A and all of its terms are incorporated herein.</p>
<h2>VII. General Provisions</h2>
<p>A. <u>Facilities Covered by the Agreement</u></p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">This Agreement covers all Hurley facilities that provide patient treatment services and receive FFA from HHS.</p>
<p>B. <u>Effective Date and Term of the Agreement</u></p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">This Agreement shall become effective on the last date upon which the Agreement is signed by either party (the “Effective Date”) and shall remain in effect for twenty-four (24) months after the Effective Date (the “Term”). At such time, if OCR determines that Hurley has completed all actions required of it by the Agreement and has demonstrated to OCR’s satisfaction an ability to sustain compliance, OCR’s review and monitoring of this Agreement shall terminate. Notwithstanding the Term of this Agreement, Hurley acknowledges that it shall comply with Title VI in all respects for so long as it continues to receive FFA.</p>
<p>C. <u>Failure to Comply with the Agreement</u></p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">Throughout the Term of this Agreement, if at any time OCR determines that Hurley has failed to comply with any provision of this Agreement, OCR shall notify Hurley in writing (Notice Letter). The Notice Letter shall include a statement of the provisions with which Hurley has failed to comply and the factual basis for OCR’s determination and shall allow Hurley fifteen (15) calendar days to either: (a) describe the remedial actions that Hurley has taken to achieve compliance with this Agreement; or (b) dispute the accuracy of OCR’s findings. In the Notice Letter to Hurley, OCR may shorten the 15-day period if it determines that a delay would result in irreparable injury to affected parties. If Hurley does not respond to the Notice Letter, or if, upon review of Hurley’s response, OCR determines that Hurley has not complied with the provisions of this Agreement or taken sufficient corrective action to comply with the provisions of this Agreement, OCR may unilaterally terminate this Agreement and take any action authorized by law to secure compliance with Title VI, including but not limited to: (a) referring the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice; (b) taking steps to suspend, terminate, refuse to grant or continue FFA to Hurley; or (c) commencing an investigation(s) of Hurley, as OCR deems appropriate.</p>
<p>D. <u>Effect on Other Compliance Matters</u></p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">The terms of this Agreement do not apply to any other issues, investigations, reviews, or complaints of discrimination that are unrelated to the subject matter of this Agreement and that may be pending before OCR or any other Federal agency.This Agreement does not preclude OCR from conducting future compliance reviews of Hurley orfrom conducting investigations of complaints filed against Hurley that are received after the Effective Date of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or restrict OCR’s statutory and regulatory authority to conduct compliance reviews or complaint investigations.</p>
<p>E. <u>Prohibition Against Retaliation and Intimidation</u></p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">Hurley shall not retaliate, intimidate, threaten, coerce or discriminate against any person who has filed a complaint or who has assisted or participated in the investigation of any matter addressed in this Agreement.</p>
<p>F. <u>OCR’s Review of Hurley’s Compliance with the Agreement</u></p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">At any time, OCR may review Hurley’s compliance with this Agreement. As part of such review, OCR may interview witnesses, examine and copy documents, and require Hurley to provide written reports and permit inspection of Hurley facilities and services. Throughout the term of this Agreement, Hurley shall retain records required by OCR to assess Hurley’s compliance with the Agreement and shall submit the requested records to OCR. OCR will maintain the confidentiality of all documents, files and records received from Hurley and will not disclose their contents, except when necessary in formal enforcement proceedings or when otherwise required or allowed by law.</p>
<p>G. <u>Technical Assistance</u></p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">OCR agrees to provide appropriate technical assistance to Hurley regarding its compliance with this Agreement, as requested and as reasonably necessary.</p>
<p>H. <u>Non-Waiver Provision</u></p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">Failure by OCR to enforce this entire Agreement or any provision thereof with respect to any deadline or any other provision shall not be construed as a waiver of OCR’s right to enforce other deadlines or any provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>I. <u>Entire Agreement</u></p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between Hurley and OCR in resolution of OCR Transaction Number 13-156114. Any statement, promise or agreement not contained herein shall not be enforceable through this Agreement.</p>
<p>J. <u>Modification to Agreement</u></p>

<h2>Attachment A</h2>
<h3>GUIDELINES FOR COMPLIANCE OF HOSPITALS WITH TITLE VI</h3>
<h3>OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF 1964</h3>
<p align="left">Section 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides:</p>
<p align="left">“No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”</p>
<p align="left">Hospitals which are in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act are characterized by an absence of separation, discrimination* or other distinction on the basis of race, color, or national origin in any activity conducted by, for, or in the institution affecting the care and treatment of patients.</p>
<p align="left">Compliance with Title VI requires adherence to the following policies and practices:</p>
<p>1. <u>Admission to Hospital</u>:</p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">All patients are admitted to the hospital for inpatient, outpatient and emergency care without discrimination and no inquiries are made regarding race, color, or national origin prior to admission. The hospital ensures that staff physicians do not consider race, color, or national origin as a factor in selecting hospitals for their patients. Where there is significant variation between the racial composition of the patient census and available population census data for the service area or potential service area, the hospital has a responsibility to determine the reason for such variation and to take whatever action may be necessary to correct any discrimination.</p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">Hospital policies regarding deposits, extension of credit and other financial matters are applied uniformly and without regard to race, color, or national origin.</p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;">Information regarding the price and availability of accommodations is uniformly made available to all without regard to race, color, or national origin.</p>
<p>2. <u>Records</u>:</p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;" align="left">Records are maintained uniformly without discrimination for all patients. Identification by race, color, or national origin on records is not considered to be discriminatory and maybe used to demonstrate compliance with Title VI.</p>
<p>3. <u>Services and Physical Facilities Provided by the Hospital</u>:</p>
<ol type="a"><li style=" list-style: none;">
		<ol type="a"><li>All therapeutic, diagnostic, preventive, nursing, and personal care services are provided without discrimination.</li>
			<li>All clinics, emergency and outpatient services are available without discrimination as to quality of care and as to days or hours, and all patients are treated in turn, or in accordance with the urgency of their medical needs. Patients in these services who require inpatient care are being assigned or referred to such care on a nondiscriminatory basis.</li>
			<li>Paramedical care, ancillary services such as pharmacy, social services, ambulance services, dietary and laundry services, and facilities such as waiting rooms, lounges, entrances and exits, dining rooms, snack bars and gift shops are provided and used without discrimination.</li>
			<li>Rules of courtesy are uniformly applied without regard to race, color, or national origin in all situations including face-to-face contact, written records and communications.</li>
			<li>Assignment of staff to patients is not governed by the race, color, or national origin of either patient or staff.</li>
			<li>Hospitals which formerly had dual facilities (buildings, waiting rooms, entrances, dining facilities, labor rooms, operating rooms, etc.) have a particular responsibility to demonstrate that such facilities are no longer being operated in a discriminatory manner.</li>
		</ol></li>
</ol><p>4. <u>Room Assignment and Transfers</u>:</p>
<ol type="a"><li style=" list-style: none;">
		<ol type="a"><li>Patients are assigned to rooms, wards, floors, sections, buildings and other areas without regard to race, color, or national origin. Such assignment will result in a degree of multi-racial occupancy of multi-bed accommodations which reflects the proportion of minority use of the facility.</li>
			<li>Patients are not asked whether they are willing to share accommodations with persons of a different race, color, or national origin. Requests from patients for transfer to other rooms in the same class of accommodations are not honored if based on racial, or ethnic considerations. Exceptions may be made only if the attending physician or hospital administrator certifies in writing that in his judgment there are valid medical reasons or special compelling circumstances in the individual case. However, such certifications may not be used to permit segregation as a routine practice in the facility.</li>
		</ol></li>
</ol><p>5. <u>Staff Privileges</u>:</p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;" align="left">Staff privileges (full, courtesy, consulting, etc.) in all areas and specialties are granted, maintained, upgraded and withdrawn in a nondiscriminatory manner, and standards for professional qualification are applied uniformly without regard to race, color, or national origin.</p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;" align="left">No requirement for membership in an organization may be established if at the time covered by such requirement the organization discriminated. Disciplinary actions of all kinds, including the withdrawal of staff privileges, are administered without discrimination. Restrictions on the granting of staff privileges are not applied so as to perpetuate past discrimination. For example, if a hospital, which formerly admitted general practitioners but excluded minority group physicians from its staff, subsequently adopts a policy restricting staff membership to specialists while retaining general practitioners already on staff, it must admit any general practitioner who would have been qualified formerly but for his race, color, or national origin.</p>
<p>6. <u>Training</u>:</p>
<ol type="a"><li style=" list-style: none;">
		<ol type="a"><li>All aspects of all training programs--those operated by the hospital, those of other institutions for which the hospital provides clinical facilities, and others in which the hospital participates--are conducted without discrimination.</li>
			<li>A hospital must demonstrate that all reasonable efforts have been made to recruit minority group students. Such efforts would include an active recruitment and informational campaign and would be evidenced by minority group students in reasonable proportion to their presence in the population of the area from which the hospital obtains students.</li>
		</ol></li>
</ol><p align="left">These requirements apply to training at all levels, including professional, semi-professional, skilled and unskilled.</p>
<p>7. <u>Notification of Availability of Services and Nondiscrimination Policy</u>:</p>
<ol type="a"><li style=" list-style: none;">
		<ol type="a"><li>The hospital has adopted and where appropriate provided its staff, employees and patients with copies of written statements which set forth the hospital’s non-discrimination policies and practices. These policies are included in any publication of staff regulations or public informational brochures, kept current and periodically reviewed with staff and employees.</li>
			<li>A hospital which formerly discriminated or had limited utilization by minority group patients effectively conveys to the minority community its present nondiscriminatory policy and the extent and nature of the services available.</li>
		</ol></li>
</ol><p align="left">8. <u>Referrals</u>:</p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;" align="left">Hospital referrals, including but not limited to referrals to physicians, extended care facilities and other post-hospital care programs, are made in a manner which does not result in discrimination.</p>
<p style=" margin-left: 60.0px;" align="left"><u>Revised and Issued by</u>:</p>
