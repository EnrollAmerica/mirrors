		<h5><strong>Adams County, Department of Social Services</strong></h5>
		<ul><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Allegation</span>: This complaint was filed on behalf of a man with a brain injury who resided in the community by receiving services under a Medicaid waiver for persons with brain injury. The complaint  alleged that the man’s  ability to remain in the most integrated setting was in jeopardy because Adams County was making it unnecessarily difficult for him to apply and transition to a Medicaid waiver for individuals who are elderly, blind and disabled (EBD). The complaint alleged that the man would require the EBD waiver upon the expected expiration of his brain injury waiver services.
				<ul><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Disposition</span>: OCR and the county negotiated an agreement that satisfactorily resolved the complaint. The man never experienced a break in services provided under the waivers. Furthermore, as part of the resolution, OCR provided civil rights training for the county's home and community based services waiver staff.</li>
				</ul></li>
		</ul><h5><strong>State Departments of Health Care Policy and Financing, Social Services, and Adams County</strong></h5>
		<ul><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Allegation</span>: This complaint was filed on behalf of a 30-year-old man with a brain injury who resides in the community with his family. The complaint alleged that the man is at risk of institutionalization because the State and County denied him appropriate services and supports to enable him to live in the community.
				<ul><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Disposition</span>: Through OCR's intervention and assistance, the State provided the man with a week of in-home services so that his mother could have respite from her care-giving responsibilities. Furthermore, the State replaced rehabilitation equipment he used and reimbursed his family for specialized glasses they had purchased for the man. The State also investigated the complainant's assertion that a mechanical device used to lift the man was not working properly, and identified and paid for a replacement device.</li>
				</ul></li>
		</ul><h5><strong>State Department of Health Care Policy and Financing</strong></h5>
		<ul><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Allegation</span>: This complaint was filed on behalf of a woman with Multiple Sclerosis who lives in her own home. The complaint alleged that the State's policies put the woman at risk of unnecessary institutionalization because she could not obtain the daily and overnight care she needed to continue living in her home when her husband was carrying out responsibilities related to his National Guard service.
				<ul><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Disposition</span>: Through OCR's intervention and assistance, the woman began receiving two additional Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) visits a day when her husband was away for National Guard duty. The woman found this level of care adequate for her needs and the State also provided information to her regarding the woman’s options, should she believe that the level of home health care services she receives is inadequate. The woman continues to receive Medicaid waiver services, including cleaning, meal preparation, and the use of certain medical equipment.</li>
				</ul></li>
		</ul><h5><strong>Health Care Quality Improvement Organization, Denver</strong></h5>
		<ul><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Allegation</span>: The complainant, a person diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and lupus, alleged that the State discriminated against him on the basis of disability and national origin when he was determined ineligible for Home and Community-Based Services for the Elderly, Blind and Disabled (HCBS-EBD) waiver program. The complainant contended that without the HCBS-EBD waiver services he was at risk for unnecessary nursing home placement.
				<ul><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Disposition</span>: As a result of OCR intervention and assistance, the complainant's HCBS-EBD services were restored. With his services restored, the complainant, after a short nursing home stay, was able to return to his own home. </li>
				</ul></li>
		</ul><h5><strong>Assisted Living Facility, Durango</strong></h5>
		<ul><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Allegation</span>: This complaint was filed on behalf of a woman diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The complainant alleged that the State failed to make reasonable accommodations for her disability that would ensure her continued residency in an assisted living facility. The woman feared that without reasonable accommodation she would be evicted from the assisted living facility and risked being unnecessarily institutionalized.
				<ul><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Disposition</span>: OCR proposed that the parties enter into mediation to resolve their dispute and as a result of OCR's mediation efforts, the parties executed a Settlement Agreement that prevented the complainant's eviction from the assisted living facility and resolved the issue of reasonable accommodation.</li>
				</ul></li>
		</ul><h5><strong>State Department of Human Services</strong></h5>
		<ul><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Allegation</span>: This complaint was filed on behalf of a man diagnosed with Down syndrome, vision and speech impairments, neck fusion, and a bladder disease requiring daily catheterization. The complaint alleged that the State failed to provide him with residential services even though he had been approved for these services more than two years earlier. The complaint alleged that the man was at risk of unnecessary institutionalization because his caretaker was unable to continue caring for him.
				<ul><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Disposition</span>: As a result of OCR intervention and assistance, a settlement was reached that 1) enrolled the man in the home and community-based services waiver program for individuals with developmental disabilities, 2) placed him in an apartment, and 3) met his catheterization needs, including training of staff on methods of catheterization. The settlement also ensured development of an individual plan to provide appropriate services and supports to ensure his successful placement in the community.</li>

		<ul><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Allegation</span>: This complaint was filed on behalf of a 41-year-old man with moderate mental retardation who had lived with a parent until the parent began experiencing health problems. The man’s family applied for Medicaid waiver services however, the man was placed on a waiting list. The complaint alleged that the man had waited for services for more than two years while living in group homes that the man and his family found inappropriate. Shortly before the complaint was filed, the man’s sister moved the him to an apartment she located, where family members provided him with his only community supports. The complaint alleged that the man had been denied a "priority" waiver by the State and thus was at risk of inappropriate institutionalization.

		<h5><strong>State Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation Services</strong></h5>
		<ul><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Allegation</span>: OCR initiated a compliance review of the Kentucky Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation Services (DMHMRS) and its four state-owned or contracted psychiatric hospitals in order to evaluate whether DMHMRS moved psychiatric hospital patients from the institution to the most integrated settings appropriate to their needs. Through the review, OCR identified concerns regarding timely discharge of patients, the adequacy of assessments, the existence of formalized transition plans, the scope of outplacement efforts, and the adequacy of community resources to meet the complex needs of some patients. Prior to the conclusion of the review, DMHMRS agreed to work voluntarily with OCR on these issues.
				<ul><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Disposition</span>: Through a Voluntary Resolution Agreement with OCR, DMHMRS agreed to undertake a variety of actions, including: (a) transitioning institutionalized patients who are identified as appropriate for community placement to more integrated settings; (b) developing a formalized procedure for identifying and assessing psychiatric hospital patients who are appropriate for community placement; (c) assessing current resources and providers to identify barriers to their use and the need for any specific new services or providers; and (d) creating a timeline for the transition of psychiatric hospital patients determined appropriate for community placement and a formal transition plan for each of these individuals. DMHMRS also provides OCR with certain information each month, including the names of individuals discharged and the reasons for the continued institutionalization of individuals who have not been discharged.
						<ul><li>The steps taken by DMHMRS pursuant to this agreement helped facilitate the community placement of persons residing in psychiatric hospitals, including individuals who filed complaints with OCR.

<h5><strong>State Departments of Health, and Human Services</strong></h5>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Allegation:</span> This complaint was filed on behalf of a 27-year-old woman with physical impairments, mental retardation and other medical conditions.

<ul type="disc"><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Allegation:</span> This complaint was filed on behalf of a 57-year-old woman who was residing in a nursing home and who has a variety of neurological, physical, development and psychiatric impairments. The complaint alleged that the State failed to provide the  woman with appropriate community-based services, and instead, placed her in a nursing home and on a waiting list for community care. The complaint alleged that the woman was unnecessarily institutionalized.
		<ul type="circle"><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Disposition:</span> Working with the State and the woman's advocate, OCR learned that resolving this complaint would require finding an appropriate placement both the woman and for her husband, a fellow nursing home resident with his own serious impairments. The State demonstrated to OCR that it was actively engaged in efforts to locate an appropriate placement where the couple could live together, having completed an assessment process for the couple and soliciting bids from providers interested in serving them.</li>

<ul type="disc"><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Allegation:</span> This complaint was filed on behalf of a man with multiple physical impairments and mental retardation. The complaint alleged that although the State had approved him for residential services, he has remained on a waiting list for services for more than 11 years.

<h5><strong>State Department of Medical Assistance Services</strong></h5>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Allegation:</span> Thirty-two individuals with mental retardation who resided in the community complained of an inability to obtain services from the State's Mental Retardation (MR) Waiver Program.

		<ul type="circle"><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Disposition:</span> Following OCR’s intervention and assistance, the State created a Task Force to develop an Olmstead plan to address the MR Waiver Program and its waiting list in order to resolve the issues presented by these complaints.  The Governor issued an Executive Order to begin implementing the recommendations of the Task Force, which included increasing MR waiver slots by 160 over a two-year period, and specific budget strategies to address ongoing issues of community integration.  As a result,  the State provided community-based services to the majority of the individual complainants, and provided OCR with detailed information about the status of the complainants who had not yet received services.</li>

<h5><strong>State Department of Social and Health Services</strong></h5>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Allegation:</span> The complainant, an individual with quadriplegia, alleged that the State violated the Olmstead decision by maintaining that Medically Needy Medicaid clients whose income exceeded the Categorically Needy level could receive long-term services only in a nursing home. As a result, because of his income level, the complainant was only able to receive the Medicaid long-term personal care services he needed if he resided in a nursing home.
		<ul type="circle"><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Disposition:</span>  As a result of OCR’s intervention, the State established two new waiver programs under which the State could provide long-term personal care services to both Categorically Needy and Medically Needy clients in the full-range of settings from institutional to in-home. The State also agreed to commit State funds to equalize the personal needs allowance provisions available for Medically Needy and Categorically Needy individuals, thus making home-based services equally available to Medically Needy individuals.</li>

</ul><h5><strong>State Department of Social and Health Services</strong></h5>
<ul type="disc"><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Allegation:</span> This complaint was filed by a patient at one of the public psychiatric hospitals in the State of Washington. The complainant, a woman with a mental disability, alleged that she had lived in psychiatric hospitals for more than three years and all her attempts to be moved into a more integrated setting appropriate to her needs had been unsuccessful. The woman alleged that the State's failure to move her into the community constituted discrimination on the basis of disability.
		<ul type="circle"><li><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Disposition:</span> Working closely with the State, OCR helped establish a new procedure to accelerate the turn-around time for acceptance of an individual into the community resource network. As a result of these efforts, the woman was moved into a group home. In addition, other similarly situated individuals were helped by the new procedure to remove barriers to the expeditious placement of individuals in particular communities.</li>
