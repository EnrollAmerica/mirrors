<h3>Additional Medicare Tax</h3>

<p align="left">A new Additional Medicare Tax went into effect on Jan 1, 2013..&nbsp;The 0.9 percent Additional Medicare Tax applies to an individual’s wages, Railroad Retirement Tax Act compensation and self-employment income that exceeds a threshold amount based on the individual’s filing status. The threshold amounts are $250,000 for married taxpayers who file jointly, $125,000 for married taxpayers who file separately and $200,000 for all other taxpayers.&nbsp;An employer is responsible for withholding the Additional Medicare Tax from wages or compensation it pays to an employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. On Nov. 26, 2013, the IRS and the Department of the Treasury issued <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2013-28411.pdf">final regulations</a> which provide guidance for employers and individuals relating to the implementation of Additional Medicare Tax, including the requirement to withhold Additional Medicare Tax on certain wages and compensation, the requirement to report Additional Medicare Tax, and the employer process for adjusting underpayments and overpayments of Additional Medicare Tax. In addition, the regulations provide guidance on the employer and individual processes for filing a claim for refund for an overpayment of Additional Medicare Tax. For additional information on the Additional Medicare Tax, see our&nbsp;<a href="/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/questions-and-answers-for-the-additional-medicare-tax">questions and answers</a>.</p>

<h3>Adoption Credit</h3>

<p>For tax years 2010 and 2011, the Affordable Care Act raised the maximum adoption credit per child and the credit was refundable. For more information related to the adoption credit for tax years 2010 and 2011, see our <a href="/uac/irs-issues-guidance-on-expanded-adoption-credit-available-for-tax-year-2010">news release</a>, <a href="/uac/seven-facts-about-the-expanded-adoption-credit">tax tip</a>, <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-10-66.pdf">Notice 2010-66</a>, <a href="/pub/irs-drop/rp-10-31.pdf">Revenue Procedure 2010-31</a>, <a href="/pub/irs-drop/rp-10-35.pdf">Revenue Procedure 2010-35</a> and Revenue Procedure 2011-52.</p>

<p>For tax year 2012, the credit has reverted to being nonrefundable, with a maximum amount (dollar limitation) of $12,650 per child. If you adopted a child in 2012, see <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc607.html">Tax Topic 607</a> for more information.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Expatriate Health Plans</h3>

<p>On June 10, 2016, the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Labor (the Departments) issued <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-10/pdf/2016-13583.pdf">proposed regulations</a> that implement the Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act of 2014 (EHCCA).&nbsp; The EHCCA generally provides that most ACA provisions do not apply to expatriate health plans covering individuals traveling to or from the United States.&nbsp; More specifically, the EHCCA provides that the requirements of the ACA do not apply to expatriate health plans, expatriate health insurance issuers for coverage under expatriate health plans, and employers in their capacity as plan sponsors of expatriate health plans, except that:&nbsp; (1) an expatriate health plan shall be treated as minimum essential coverage under section 5000A(f) of the Code and any other section of the Code that incorporates the definition of minimum essential coverage; (2) the employer shared responsibility provisions of section 4980H of the Code continue to apply; (3) the health care reporting provisions of sections 6055 and 6056 of the Code continue to apply but with certain modifications relating to the use of electronic media for required statements to enrollees; (4)&nbsp;the excise tax provisions of section 4980I of the Code continue to apply with respect to coverage of certain qualified expatriates who are assigned (rather than transferred) to work in the United States; and (5) the annual health insurance providers fee imposed by section 9010 of the ACA takes into account expatriate health insurance issuers for certain purposes for calendar years 2014 and 2015 only. &nbsp;The EHCCA proposed regulations provide that the market reform provisions enacted as part of the ACA generally do not apply to expatriate health plans, any employer solely in its capacity as a plan sponsor of an expatriate health plan, and any expatriate health insurance issuer with respect to coverage under an expatriate health plan.&nbsp; Further, the EHCCA proposed regulations define the benefit and administrative requirements for expatriate health issuers, expatriate health plans, and qualified expatriates, and provide clarification regarding the applicability of certain fee and reporting requirements.</p>

<h3>Health Coverage for Older Children</h3>

<p>Health coverage for an employee's children under 27 years of age is now generally tax-free to the employee. This expanded health care tax benefit applies to various work place and retiree health plans. These changes immediately allow employers with cafeteria plans –– plans that allow employees to choose from a menu of tax-free benefit options and cash or taxable benefits –– to permit employees to begin making pre-tax contributions to pay for this expanded benefit. This also applies to self-employed individuals who qualify for the self-employed health insurance deduction on their federal income tax return. Learn more by reading our <a href="/uac/tax-free-employer-provided-health-coverage-now-available-for-children-under-age-27">news release</a> or this <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-10-38.pdf">notice</a>.</p>

<h3>Health Flexible Spending Arrangements</h3>

<p>Effective Jan. 1, 2011, the cost of an over-the-counter medicine or drug cannot be reimbursed from Flexible Spending Arrangements (FSAs) or health reimbursement arrangements unless a prescription is obtained. The change does not affect insulin, even if purchased without a prescription, or other health care expenses such as medical devices, eye glasses, contact lenses, co-pays and deductibles. This standard applies only to purchases made on or after Jan. 1, 2011. A similar rule went into effect on Jan. 1, 2011, for Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and Archer Medical Savings Accounts (Archer MSAs). Employers and employees should take these changes into account as they make health benefit decisions. For more information, see news release <a href="/uac/irs-issues-guidance-explaining-2011-changes-to-flexible-spending-arrangements">IR-2010-95</a>, <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-10-59.pdf">Notice 2010-59</a>, <a href="/pub/irs-drop/rr-10-23.pdf">Revenue Ruling 2010-23</a> and our <a href="/uac/affordable-care-act-questions-and-answers-on-over-the-counter-medicines-and-drugs">questions and answers</a>. FSA and HRA participants can continue using debit cards to buy prescribed over-the-counter medicines, if requirements are met. For more information, see news release <a href="/uac/irs-offers-new-guidance-on-fsa-and-hra-debit-cards">IR-2010-128</a> and <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-11-05.pdf">Notice 2011-5</a>. Additionally, <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-13-57.pdf">Notice 2013-57</a> provides information about the definition of preventive care for purposes of high deductible health plans associated with HSAs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, starting in 2013, there are new rules about the amount that can be contributed to an FSA. <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-12-40.pdf">Notice 2012-40</a> provides information about these rules and flexibility for employers applying the new rules. On Oct. 31, 2013, the Department of the Treasury and IRS issued <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-13-71.pdf">Notice 2013-71</a>, which provides information on a new $500 carryover option for employer-sponsored healthcare flexible spending arrangements. Learn more by reading the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2202.aspx">news release</a> issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</p>

<p>Further, <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-13-54.pdf">Notice 2013-54</a> provides guidance regarding the application of the Affordable Care Act’s market reforms to certain health FSAs.<br>
<br>
On February 5, 2016, the Treasury Department and IRS issued <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-16-17.pdf">Notice 2016-17</a>, which provides guidance on the application of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act<sup> </sup>to premium reduction arrangements offered in connection with student health plans.&nbsp; The notice also provides temporary transition relief from enforcement by the Treasury Department, DOL and HHS in certain circumstances.&nbsp; On February 5, 2016, DOL issued similar guidance in <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/newsroom/tr16-01.html">Technical Release 2016-01</a> and HHS issued similar guidance in an <a href="https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Regulations-and-Guidance/Downloads/student-health-bulletin.pdf">Insurance Standards Bulletin</a>.</p>

<h3>Individual Shared Responsibility Provision</h3>

<p>Starting in 2014, the individual shared responsibility provision calls for each individual to either have minimum essential coverage for each month, qualify for an exemption or make a payment when filing his or her federal income tax return. On June 26, 2013, the IRS released <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-13-42.pdf">Notice 2013-42</a>, which provides transition relief for employees eligible to enroll in a non-calendar year employer-sponsored health plan that begins in 2013 and ends in 2014. On Aug. 27, 2013, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-08-30/pdf/2013-21157.pdf">final regulations</a> on the individual shared responsibility provision. This amount is used to determine the maximum individual shared responsibility payment that may be due. On Nov. 21, 2014, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued <a href="https://federalregister.gov/a/2014-27998">final regulations</a> addressing the treatment of health reimbursement arrangements, cafeteria plans, and wellness program incentives for purposes of determining the unaffordability exemption for individuals with offers of employer sponsored coverage.&nbsp;The regulations also provide that certain limited benefit Medicaid and TRICARE coverage is not minimum essential coverage (<a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-14-10.pdf">Notice 2014-10</a>, issued on Jan. 23, 2014, provides transition relief from the shared responsibility payment for months in 2014 in which individuals have this limited benefit coverage).&nbsp;On Nov. 21, 2014, the IRS issued <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-14-76.pdf">Notice 2014-76</a>, which identifies the hardship exemptions from the individual shared responsibility payment that a taxpayer may claim on a federal income tax return without obtaining an exemption certification from a Health Insurance Marketplace. For additional information on the individual shared responsibility provision, see our <a href="/irs.gov-affordable-care-act/individuals-and-families/individual-shared-responsibility-provision.html">ISRP page</a> and <a href="/irs.gov-affordable-care-act/individuals-and-families/questions-and-answers-on-the-individual-shared-responsibility-provision.html">questions and answers</a>.

For additional information on the Net Investment Income Tax, see our&nbsp;<a href="/uac/newsroom/net-investment-income-tax-faqs">questions and answers</a>.</p>

<h3>Premium Tax Credit</h3>

<p>Starting in 2014, individuals and families can take a new premium tax credit to help them afford health insurance coverage purchased through an Affordable Insurance Exchange (also known as a <a href="/irs.gov-affordable-care-act/individuals-and-families/the-health-insurance-marketplace.html">Health Insurance Marketplace</a>). The premium tax credit is refundable so taxpayers who have little or no income tax liability can still benefit. The credit also can be paid in advance to a taxpayer’s insurance company to help cover the cost of premiums. On May 18, 2012, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-23/pdf/2012-12421.pdf">final regulations</a>, which provide guidance for individuals who enroll in qualified health plans through Marketplaces and claim the premium tax credit, and for Marketplaces that make qualified health plans available to individuals and employers. On Jan. 30, 2013, the Department of the Treasury and IRS released <a href="http://www.irs.gov/PUP/newsroom/TD%209611.pdf">final regulations</a> on the premium tax credit affordability test for related individuals. <a href="http://www.irs.gov/file_source/pub/irs-drop/n-13-41.pdf">Notice 2013-41</a>, issued on June 26, 2013, provides information for determining whether or when individuals are considered eligible for coverage under&nbsp;certain Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, TRICARE, student health or state high-risk pool programs. This determination will affect whether the individual is eligible for the premium tax credit. On November 7, 2014, the Department of the Treasury and IRS issued <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-14-71.pdf">Notice 2014-71</a>, which advises that an individual enrolled in a qualified health plan who becomes eligible for Medicaid coverage for pregnancy-related services that is minimum essential coverage, or for CHIP coverage based on pregnancy, is treated as eligible for minimum essential coverage under the Medicaid or CHIP coverage for purposes of the premium tax credit only if the individual enrolls in the coverage.</p>

<p>On April 30, 2013, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued <a href="http://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-05-03/pdf/2013-10463.pdf">proposed regulations</a> relating to minimum value of eligible employer-sponsored plans and other rules regarding the premium tax credit. On November 4, 2014, the Department of the Treasury and IRS issued <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-14-69.pdf">Notice 2014-69</a>, which provides additional guidance regarding whether an employer-sponsored plan provides minimum value coverage if the plan fails to substantially cover in-patient hospitalization services or physician services. Notice 2014-69 also advises taxpayers that the Department of Treasury and the IRS intend to propose new regulations providing that plans that fail to provide substantial coverage for inpatient hospitalization or physician services do not provide minimum value. On August 31, 2015, the Department of Treasury and the IRS issued <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-09-01/pdf/2015-21691.pdf">proposed regulations</a> supplementing the prior proposed regulations and amending the definition of minimum value. On December 16, 2015, the Department of Treasury and IRS issued <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2015-31866.pdf">final regulations</a> providing guidance on the Premium Tax Credit.&nbsp; The final regulations adopted some of the proposed rules regarding the Premium Tax Credit, including the definition of Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI); rating areas for purposes of determining benchmark plans used in determining applicable credits; the effect of eligibility for COBRA continuation coverage on Premium Tax Credit eligibility; coverage months for newborns and new adoptees; proration of monthly premiums for individuals enrolled for less than a month; and determining the benchmark plan for family members living at different addresses.&nbsp; The final regulations also withdrew and re-proposed some of the rules relating to minimum value of eligible employer-sponsored plans and reserved on other proposed rules relating to minimum value of eligible employer-sponsored plans.&nbsp; The re-proposed and reserved rules will be finalized separately.</p>

<p>On July 24, 2014, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued <a href="http://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2014-17696.pdf">proposed, temporary</a> and <a href="http://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2014-17695.pdf">final</a> regulations providing further guidance on the premium tax credit. In particular, the regulations provide relief for certain victims of domestic abuse or spousal abandonment from the requirement to file jointly in order to claim the premium tax credit. In addition, the regulations provide special allocation rules for reconciling advance credit payments, address the indexing in future years of certain amounts used to determine eligibility for the credit and compute the credit, and provide rules for the coordination between the credit and the deduction under section 162(l) for health insurance costs of self-employed individuals. <a href="/pub/irs-drop/rp-14-41.pdf">Rev. Proc. 2014-41</a>, also released on July 24, 2014, provides methods for determining the section 162(l) deduction and the premium tax credit for health insurance costs of self-employed individuals who claim the deduction under section 162(l).&nbsp;</p>

<p>On May 2, 2014, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued <a href="http://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=https://federalregister.gov/a/2014-10419">final regulations</a> on the reporting requirements for Marketplaces.</p>

<p>On Jan. 26, 2015, the IRS issued <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-15-09.pdf">Notice 2015-9</a>, which provides limited penalty relief for taxpayers who have a balance due on their 2014 income tax return as a result of reconciling advance payments of the premium tax credit against the premium tax credit allowed on the tax return. Specifically, Notice 2015-9 provides relief from the penalty under section 6651(a)(2) for late payment of a balance due and the penalty under section 6654(a) for underpayment of estimated tax. The relief applies only for the 2014 taxable year.</p>

<p>The Affordable Care Act requires employers to report the cost of coverage under an employer-sponsored group health plan on an employee’s Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, in Box 12, using Code DD. Many employers are eligible for transition relief for tax-year 2012 and beyond, until the IRS issues final guidance for this reporting requirement.</p>

<p>The amount reported does not affect tax liability, as the value of the employer excludible contribution to health coverage continues to be excludible from an employee's income, and it is not taxable. This reporting is for informational purposes only, to show employees the value of their health care benefits.</p>

<h3>Effect of Sequestration on Small Business Health Care Tax Credit</h3>

<p>Pursuant to the requirements of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, refund payments issued to certain small tax-exempt employers claiming the refundable portion of the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit under Internal Revenue Code Section 45R, are subject to sequestration. This means that refund payments processed on or after Oct.1, 2015, and on or before Sept. 30, 2016, to a Section 45R applicant will be reduced by the fiscal year 2016 sequestration rate of 6.8 percent, irrespective of when the original or amended tax return was received by the IRS. Affected taxpayers will be notified through correspondence that a portion of their requested payment was subject to the sequester reduction and the amount. &nbsp;The sequestration reduction rate will be applied unless and until a law is enacted that cancels or otherwise impacts the sequester, at which time the sequestration reduction rate is subject to change. Note that the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/51038-Sequestration.pdf">sequestration for fiscal year 2016</a> will not be required.</p>

On February 23, 2015, the IRS and Treasury Department issued <a href="http://www.ofr.gov/OFRUpload/OFRData/2015-03944_PI.pdf">temporary regulations</a> providing further guidance on the definition of a covered entity for the 2015 fee year and each subsequent fee year.</p>

<p>On March 30, 2015, the Treasury Department and IRS issued <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-15-29.pdf">Notice 2015-29</a>, which provides guidance on how the special rule for expatriate health plans for the 2014 and 2015 fee years under the Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act of 2014 applies to the annual fee on health insurance providers. This notice obsoletes Notice 2014-24, which provided a temporary safe harbor for covered entities that reported direct premiums written for expatriate plans on a Supplemental Health Care Exhibit (SHCE).</p>

<p>On January 29, 2016, the Treasury Department and IRS issued <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-16-14.pdf">Notice 2016-14</a>, which provides guidance for fee year 2016 on how the definition of expatriate health plans under the Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act of 2014 applies to the annual fee on health insurance providers. This notice provides that, solely for the 2016 fee year, the definition of expatriate health plan will be the same as provided in the Department of Health and Human Services MLR final rule definition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, Title II, § 201, Moratorium on Annual Fee on Health Insurance Providers, suspends collection of the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year. Thus, health insurance issuers are not required to pay these fees for 2017. This moratorium does NOT affect the filing requirement and payment of these fees for 2016. Form 8963 (Rev. February 2016) must be filed by April 18, 2016.</p>

<h3>Medical Device Excise Tax</h3>

<p>On Dec. 5, 2012, the IRS and the Department of the Treasury issued <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2012-29628.pdf">final regulations</a> on the new 2.3-percent medical device excise tax (IRC §4191) that manufacturers and importers will pay on their sales of certain medical devices starting in 2013.

<h3>Medical Loss Ratio (MLR)</h3>

<p>Beginning in 2011, insurance companies are required to spend a specified percentage of premium dollars on medical care and quality improvement activities, meeting a medical loss ratio (MLR) standard. Insurance companies that are not meeting the MLR standard will be required to provide rebates to their consumers beginning in 2012. For information on the federal tax consequences to an insurance company that pays a MLR rebate and an individual policyholder who receives a MLR rebate, as well as information on the federal tax consequences to employees if a MLR rebate stems from a group health insurance policy, see our <a href="/uac/medical-loss-ratio-mlr-faqs">frequently asked questions</a>.</p>

<h3>Medicare Shared Savings Program</h3>

<p>The Affordable Care Act establishes a Medicare shared savings program (MSSP) which encourages Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) to facilitate cooperation among providers to improve the quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries and reduce unnecessary costs. More information can be found in <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-11-20.pdf">Notice 2011-20</a>, which solicited written comments regarding what additional guidance, if any, is needed for tax-exempt organizations participating in the MSSP through an ACO. This guidance also addresses the participation of tax-exempt organizations in non-MSSP activities through ACOs. Additional <a href="http://wayback.archive-it.org/3926/20140108162229/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/03/20110331a.html">information on the MSSP</a> is available on the Department of Health and Human Services website.</p>

<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has released final regulations describing the rules for the Shared Savings Program and accountable care organizations. <a href="/uac/tax-exempt-organizations-participating-in-the-medicare-shared-savings-program-through-accountable-care-organizations">Fact Sheet 2011-11</a> confirms that Notice 2011-20 continues to reflect IRS expectations regarding the Shared Savings Program and ACOs, and provides additional information for charitable organizations that may wish to participate.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute Fee</h3>

<p>The Affordable Care Act established the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. Funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund, the institute will help patients, clinicians, purchasers and policy-makers make informed health decisions by advancing clinical effectiveness research. The trust fund will be funded in part by fees paid by issuers of certain health insurance policies and sponsors of certain self-insured health plans.</p>

<p>The IRS and the Department of the Treasury have issued <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-12-06/pdf/2012-29325.pdf">final regulations (PDF)</a> on this fee.

<h3>Retiree Drug Subsidies</h3>

<p>Under § 139A of the Internal Revenue Code, certain special subsidy payments for retiree drug coverage made under the Social Security Act &nbsp;are not included in the gross income of plan sponsors. Plan sponsors receive these retiree drug subsidy payments based on the allowable retiree costs for certain qualified retiree prescription drug plans. For taxable years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2013, new statutory rules affect the ability of plan sponsors to deduct costs that are reimbursed through these subsidies.&nbsp;See our <a href="/uac/newsroom/frequently-asked-questions-retiree-drug-subsidy">questions and answers</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Section 162(m) Amended - Limitation on Deduction for Compensation Paid by Certain Health Insurance Providers</h3>

<p>The Affordable Care Act amended section 162(m) of the Code to limit the compensation deduction available to certain health insurance providers. The amendment goes into effect for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2012, but may affect deferred compensation attributable to services performed in a taxable year beginning after Dec. 31, 2009. On Sept. 18, 2014, the Treasury Department and IRS issued <a href="https://federalregister.gov/a/2014-22317">final regulations</a> on this provision.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Tax-Exempt 501(c)(29) Qualified Nonprofit Health Insurance Issuers</h3>

<p>The Affordable Care Act requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan program (CO-OP program). It also provides for tax exemption for recipients of CO-OP program grants and loans that meet additional requirements under section 501(c)(29). IRS <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-11-23.pdf">Notice 2011-23</a> outlined the requirements for tax exemption under section 501(c)(29) and solicited written comments regarding these requirements as well as the application process.<a href="/pub/irs-drop/rp-15-17.pdf">Rev.

<h3>Tax-Exempt Hospitals - Additional Requirements</h3>

<p>The Affordable Care Act added <a href="/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/new-requirements-for-501c3-hospitals-under-the-affordable-care-act">new requirements</a> for charitable hospitals (see <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-10-39.pdf">Notice 2010-39</a> and <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-11-52.pdf">Notice 2011-52</a>). On June 26, 2012, the IRS published proposed regulations that provide information on the requirements for charitable hospitals relating to financial assistance and emergency medical care policies, charges for emergency or medically necessary care provided to individuals eligible for financial assistance, and billing and collections. On April 5, 2013, the IRS published proposed regulations on the requirement that charitable hospitals conduct community health needs assessments (CHNAs) and adopt implementation strategies at least once every three years. These proposed regulations also discuss the related excise tax and reporting requirements for charitable hospitals and the consequences for failure to satisfy the section 501(r) requirements. On August 15, 2013, the IRS published <a href="/PUP/newsroom/TD 9629.pdf">emtporary regulations</a> and <a href="/PUP/newsroom/REG-115300-13.pdf">proposed regulations</a> providing information on which form to use when making an excise tax payment for failure to meet the CHNA requirements and the due date for filing the form. <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-14-02.pdf">Notice 2014-2</a> confirms that hospital organizations can rely on proposed regulations under section 501(r) of the Internal Revenue Code published on June 26, 2012 and April 5, 2013, pending the publication of final regulations or other applicable guidance. &nbsp;On December 29, 2014, the IRS issued final regulations <a href="http://www.irs.gov/irb/2015-5_IRB/ar08.html">TD 9708</a> providing guidance on the requirements described in section 501(r), the entities that must meet these requirements, and the reporting obligations relating to these requirements under section 6033.&nbsp; In addition, the final regulations provide guidance on the consequences for failing to satisfy the section 501(r) requirements.&nbsp; The regulations apply to taxable years beginning one year after December 29, 2014, which is the date the regulations were posted for public inspection by the Federal Register. &nbsp;On March 10, 2015, the IRS issued <a href="/pub/irs-drop/rp-15-21.pdf">Rev. Proc. 2015-21</a>, which finalizes, with some modifications, the correction and disclosure procedures proposed in <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-14-03.pdf">Notice 2014-3</a>, under which certain failures to meet the requirements of section 501(r) will be excused. On June 26, 2015, the IRS issued <a href="/pub/irs-drop/n-15-46.pdf">Notice 2015-46</a>, which clarifies how a charitable hospital organization may comply with the requirement in the final regulations that a hospital facility include a provider list in its financial assistance policy (FAP).&nbsp;</p>
