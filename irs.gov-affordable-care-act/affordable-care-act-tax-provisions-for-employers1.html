<p><b>Employer Shared Responsibility Provision</b></p>

<p>The Affordable Care Act establishes that certain employers must offer health coverage to their full-time employees or a shared responsibility payment may apply. On Feb. 10, 2014, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-02-12/pdf/2014-03082.pdf">final regulations</a> on the Employer Shared Responsibility provisions.

<p>The Affordable Care Act’s market reforms apply to group health plans.

The notice also provides guidance on employee assistance programs or EAPs and on section 125(f)(3), which prohibits the use of pre-tax employee contributions to cafeteria plans to purchase coverage on an Affordable Insurance Exchange (also known as a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/affordable-care-act/individuals-and-families/the-health-insurance-marketplace">Health Insurance Marketplace</a>).

<p>On December 16, 2015, the Treasury Department and IRS issued <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-15-87.pdf">Notice 2015-87</a> which provides further guidance on the application of various provisions of the ACA to employer-provided health coverage.&nbsp; Notice 2015-87 provides guidance on the application of the market reforms that apply to group health plans under the ACA to various types of employer health care arrangements.&nbsp; The notice includes guidance that covers: (1) health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs), including HRAs integrated with a group health plan, and similar employer-funded health care arrangements; and (2) group health plans under which an employer reimburses an employee for some or all of the premium expenses incurred for an individual health insurance policy, such as a reimbursement arrangement described in Revenue Ruling 61-146, or an arrangement under which the employer uses its funds to directly pay the premium for an individual health insurance policy covering the employee (collectively, an employer payment plan).&nbsp; The notice supplements the guidance provided in <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-13-54.pdf">Notice 2013-54</a>; <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-aca22.html">FAQs about the Affordable Care Act Implementation</a> (Part XXII) issued by the Department of Labor on November 6, 2014; <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-15-17.pdf">Notice 2015-17</a>; and <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-11-18/pdf/2015-29294.pdf">final regulations</a> implementing the market reform provisions of the ACA published on November 18, 2015.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>High Cost Employer-Sponsored Health Coverage Excise Tax</b></p>

<p>Section 4980I, which was added to the Code by the Affordable Care Act, applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2019.&nbsp; Under this provision, if the aggregate cost of applicable employer-sponsored coverage provided to an employee exceeds a statutory dollar limit, which is revised annually, the excess is subject to a 40 percent excise tax.&nbsp; On February 23, 2015, the IRS issued <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-15-16.pdf">Notice 2015-16</a>, which is intended to initiate and inform the process of developing guidance about the excise tax on high cost employer sponsored health coverage.&nbsp; Notice 2015-16 describes potential approaches that could be incorporated in future guidance and invites comments on these potential approaches and other issues under section 4980I.</p>

<p>On July 30, 2015, the IRS issued <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-15-52.pdf">Notice 2015-52</a>, which is intended to continue the process of developing regulatory guidance regarding the excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health coverage under section 4980I.&nbsp; The notice supplements Notice 2015-16 by addressing additional issues under section 4980I, including the identification of the taxpayers who may be liable for the excise tax, employer aggregation, the allocation of the tax among the applicable taxpayers, the payment of the applicable tax and further issues regarding the cost of applicable coverage that were not addressed in Notice 2015-16.</p>

<p>The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), signed into law on Dec. 18, 2015, delayed the effective date of the excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health coverage from taxable years beginning after Dec 31, 2017, to taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2019.</p>

<p><b>Information Reporting on Health Coverage by Employers (Section 6056)</b></p>

<p>On March 5, 2014, the Department of the Treasury and IRS issued <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2014-05050.pdf">final regulations</a> on employer health insurance coverage information reporting by applicable large employers to the IRS and its employees. The information reporting relates to health insurance coverage that is offered by certain employers, referred to as applicable large employers, and reporting is to be provided by each member of an applicable large employer. Additionally, on July 9, 2013, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-13-45.pdf">Notice 2013-45</a>, announcing transition relief for 2014 from this annual information reporting.

This Notice also provides guidance to individuals who, as a result of these extensions, might not receive a Form 1095-B or Form 1095-C by the time they file their 2015 tax returns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On November 18, 2016, IRS issued <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-16-70.pdf">Notice 2016-70</a>, which extends the due date for the 2016 requirement to furnish ACA-related statements to individuals for insurers, self-insuring employers, and certain other providers of minimum essential coverage under I.R.C. § 6055, and for applicable large employers under I.R.C. § 6056, and extends good-faith transition relief from section 6721 and 6722 penalties to the 2016 information-reporting requirements under sections 6055 and 6056.&nbsp; Specifically, this Notice (1) extends the due date for furnishing the 2016 Form 1095-B, Health Coverage, and the 2016 Form 1095-C, Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage, from January 31, 2017, until March 2, 2017, and (2) extends good-faith transition relief from section 6721 and 6722 penalties to the 2016 information-reporting requirements under sections 6055 and 6056.

<p>On April 26, 2012, the Department of the Treasury and IRS issued <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-12-31.pdf">Notice 2012-31</a>, which provides information and requested public comment on an approach to determining whether an eligible employer-sponsored health plan provides minimum value. Additionally, on April 30, 2013, the Treasury Department and the IRS issued <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-05-03/pdf/2013-10463.pdf">proposed regulations</a> relating to minimum value of eligible employer-sponsored plans and other rules regarding the premium tax credit. Starting in 2014, whether such a plan provides minimum value will be relevant to eligibility for the premium tax credit and application of the employer shared responsibility payment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On November 4, 2014, the Department of the Treasury and IRS issued <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-69.pdf">Notice 2014-69</a>, which provides additional guidance regarding whether an employer-sponsored plan provides minimum value coverage if the plan fails to substantially cover in-patient hospitalization services or physician services.</p>

<p><b>Reporting Employer Provided Health Coverage in Form W-2</b></p>

<p>The Affordable Care Act requires employers to report the cost of coverage under an employer-sponsored group health plan on an employee’s Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, in Box 12, using Code DD. Many employers are eligible for transition relief for tax-year 2012 and beyond, until the IRS issues final guidance for this reporting requirement.</p>

<p>The amount reported does not affect tax liability, as the value of the employer excludible contribution to health coverage continues to be excludible from an employee's income, and it is not taxable. This reporting is for informational purposes only, to show employees the value of their health care benefits.</p>

<p>More information about the reporting can be found on <a href="https://www.irs.gov/affordable-care-act/form-w-2-reporting-of-employer-sponsored-health-coverage">Form W-2 Reporting of Employer-Sponsored Health Coverage</a>.</p>

<p><b>Small Business Health Care Tax Credit</b></p>

<p>This credit helps small businesses and small tax-exempt organizations afford the cost of covering their employees. It is specifically for employers with low- and moderate-income workers. The credit is designed to encourage small employers to offer health insurance coverage for the first time or maintain coverage they already have. In general, the credit is available to small employers that pay at least half the cost of single coverage for their employees.&nbsp;On June 26, 2014, the Department of Treasury and the IRS issued <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2014-15262.pdf">final regulations</a> on the credit, which include information on the requirement to purchase health insurance coverage through the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace. The final regulations are applicable for taxable years beginning in or after 2014. Additionally, IRS <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-14-06.pdf">Notice 2014-06</a> provides transition relief for employers in certain counties in Washington and Wisconsin with no SHOP coverage available in 2014, IRS <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-15-08.pdf">Notice 2015-8</a> provides similar relief for employers in certain counties in Iowa with no SHOP coverage available in 2015 and IRS <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-16-75.pdf">Notice 2016-75</a> provides similar relief for employers in certain counties in Wisconsin with no SHOP coverage available in 2016. For taxable years beginning in 2010 through 2013, taxpayers can rely on the guidance in the <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2013-20769.pdf">proposed regulations</a>, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-10-44.pdf">Notice 2010-44</a> and <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-10-82.pdf">Notice 2010-82</a>.

<p><b>Effect of Sequestration on Small Business Health Care Tax Credit</b></p>

<p>Pursuant to the requirements of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, refund payments issued to certain small tax-exempt employers claiming the refundable portion of the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit under Internal Revenue Code Section 45R, are subject to sequestration. This means that refund payments processed on or after Oct.1, 2015, and on or before Sept. 30, 2016, to a Section 45R applicant will be reduced by the fiscal year 2016 sequestration rate of 6.8 percent, irrespective of when the original or amended tax return was received by the IRS. Affected taxpayers will be notified through correspondence that a portion of their requested payment was subject to the sequester reduction and the amount. &nbsp;The sequestration reduction rate will be applied unless and until a law is enacted that cancels or otherwise impacts the sequester, at which time the sequestration reduction rate is subject to change. Note that the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/51038-Sequestration.pdf">sequestration for fiscal year 2016</a> will not be required.</p>

<p><b>Tanning Tax - Excise Tax on Indoor Tanning Services</b></p>

<p>A 10-percent excise tax on indoor UV tanning services went into effect on July 1, 2010. Payments are made along with <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-access/f720_accessible.pdf">Form 720</a>, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return. The tax doesn't apply to phototherapy services performed by a licensed medical professional on his or her premises. There's also an exception for certain physical fitness facilities that offer tanning as an incidental service to members without a separately identifiable fee. For more information on the tax and how it is administered, see the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/indoor-tanning-services-tax-center">Indoor Tanning Services Tax Center</a>.</p>
