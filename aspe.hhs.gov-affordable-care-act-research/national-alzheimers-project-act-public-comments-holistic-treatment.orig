<ul><li>In conjunction with November being National Alzheimer's Awareness Month, AFA will be holding National Memory Screening Week from November 1st - November 7th.</li>
<li>NMSW grew out of an earlier AFA initiative, National Memory Screening Day.</li>
<li>During NMSW, sites across the U.S. offer free, confidential memory screenings to the public and distribute educational materials about memory concerns, dementia, caregiving and successful aging.</li>
<li>A memory screening is a good conversation starter about memory concerns and brain health.</li>

<li>Memory screenings, however, are not a diagnosis.</li>
<li>Individuals who score below the normal threshold or who still have concerns about their memory are encouraged to follow up with their physician for a thorough evaluation.</li>
<li>Moreover, all of the NMSW materials clearly emphasize that memory screenings are used as an indicator of whether a person might benefit from an extensive medical exam, but that they are not used to diagnose any illness or to replace an exam by a qualified healthcare professional.</li>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE UNDATED DRAFT<br />
					NATIONAL PLAN TO ADDRESS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>March 31, 2012</strong></p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p>The comments presented in this paper are based on my experience as the primary care giver for someone with Alzheimer's dementia and on a book that I read as part of my research on Alzheimer's dementia. The book is titled <em>The Myth of Alzheimer's Disease</em> by Dr. Peter Whitehouse, a leading researcher in Alzheimer's disease for over 30 years.</p>
<p>Eight years ago at age 60, my wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Dementia (AD). She lived at home for four and a half years, and has lived in an assisted living facility for the past three years and nine months. She has had three different kinds of brain scans (CAT, MRI, and PET), been evaluated for vitamin B-12 deficiency, been evaluated for "water on the brain", been evaluated at the University of Virginia and John Hopkins University, seen four different neurologists, and has taken both of the medications typical given to people with AD all to no avail. I concluded several years ago that the only thing left was to ensure that she is taken care of. Not only to pay for the care but to participate in it, which I do on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Dr. Whitehouse's book summarizes most of the experiences that I have been through in the last eight years and confirms my conclusion about care for my wife. In my view, everyone who has a loved one diagnosed with AD should read this book. I also believe that Dr. Whitehouse should be considered for inclusion on the Advisory Council established by the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA).</p>
<p>The last part of this paper contains a brief discussion of a grant program through which funding could be provided for the care of people with AD.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL COMMENT </strong></p>
<p>I agree with the goals in the draft plan. I do not agree, however, with the distribution of funding for the goals. Of the $156 million dollars included in the draft plan, $130 million (83 percent) are allocated for research. Only $26 million are allocated for care. In my view, the funds for research and care should be reversed. At some point, everyone with either AD or another type of dementia is going to need care. That is where most of the federal funds and private funds should be spent.</p>
<p>The final plan should include more details for each of the goals. This includes the office responsible for each strategy and the tentative completion date, funds, and expected outcomes or products for each strategy. Without the details, there is no way to tract the progress on each strategy. The plan also should indicate who will provide oversight for each strategy.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIFIC COMMENTS </strong></p>
<p>1. Care</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I concluded several years ago that the only thing that I can do for my wife is to see that she is taken care of. For this reason, I believe that the first goal on Page 6 of the national plan should address care and that care should be the major theme throughout the plan.</p>
<p>I am not recommending that no research be done on AD. Certainly, research should continue on AD, but not at the funding distribution in the draft plan (i.e., 83 percent of the total amount in the draft plan). In my view, the only way to find a cure for AD is to find a cure for the aging process. This is highly unlikely.</p>
<p>2. Use of the Word "Disease"</p>
<p>In his book, Dr. Whitehouse concludes that Alzheimer's is not disease. It is aging of the brain that can be caused by a number of factors (e.g., stroke, lifestyle, injury, or environmental exposure). Because it is not a disease, there is no cure for AD.</p>
<p>I recommend that the work "disease" no longer be used to describe Alzheimer's dementia . Use of the word stigmatizes the person with AD often resulting in depression, loss of friends, and lack of understanding on what is really occurring. Even though the end result is the same (all persons with AD and other dementias need care), calling the condition what it really is (i.e., dementia) is a better approach for dealing with the condition. In his book, Dr. Whitehouse described an approach whereby the patient and the patient's family are told that the patient has dementia and then given help through a team approach. The team consists of the doctor, a dietitian who helps the patient improve their diet, a physical therapist who works with the patient to increase their physical activity, and a social worker who emphasizes the importance of staying connected both mentally and socially. Use of the team approach is more compassionate then just telling the patient they have Alzheimer's disease, and to take Aricept and come back for another doctor's visit in six months, which is what happened to my wife. Using the word "disease" to describe AD implies there is a cure for AD. This gives the patient and the patient's family false hope because, as previously mentioned, I do not believe there is a cure for AD.</p>
<p>3. Ethnic and Racial Minority Populations</p>
<p>During the eight years that I have had direct involvement with AD, I have never read anything or had any experiences that indicate ethnic and racial minority populations have higher cases of AD than the general population. Unless there is compelling evidence that those populations do experience disproportionate cases of AD, I recommend that this issue not be emphasized in the national plan. In my view, it is more important to spend funds on the care of all people with AD.</p>
<p>4. Assisted Living Facilities</p>
<p>The draft plan fails to recognize that a viable option for people with AD is care in a secure area at an assisted living facility. My wife has been cared for in such facility for three years and nine months, and I expect her to continue to be cared for in an assisted living facility for many more years (she is very healthy except for AD).</p>
<p>An issue related to caring for a person with AD in an assisted living facility is cost. Funds are not available from either Medicare or Medicaid for people who receive care in an assisted living facility. In my view, there is no difference between care of a person with AD in a nursing home and care of such a person in a secure area of an assisted living facility. This disparity needs to be addressed. An example of the cost of care in an assisted living facility is the $75,600 annual fee for my wife plus the cost of incontinence supplies and medications. At present, my long term care insurance pays for part of these costs and I pay the remaining part. When my long term care insurance expires, I will have to pay the total costs.</p>
<p>5. Strategy 2.A</p>
<p>Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and emergency room personnel should be included in the healthcare providers who receive education in AD. In my experience, general physicians also need to be educated about AD. All too often, they just want to prescribe a medication. For example, seroquel often is prescribed for people with AD. Every article that I read on seroquel said that it is not recommended for people with dementia. When I told the doctor that, he said they give it to people with AD anyway.</p>
<p>6. Action 2.A.4</p>
<p>The training discussed in this action should be made available to all direct-care workers and not just workers in nursing homes. In particular, direct-care workers in assisted living facilities and those who provide home care should receive this training.</p>
<p>7. Action 2.B.2</p>
<p>My wife was diagnosed with AD through a process of elimination. In her first visit to a neurologist, she could not pass some simple tests. At later appointments, those same tests were given to her with worst results that the results of the earlier tests. Eventually, the neurologist concluded she had AD. In my view, this process is most likely the only way to diagnose AD.</p>
<p>8. Action 2.E.2</p>
<p>In my experience, the cost of home care for a person with AD is not that much less than the cost of care in an assisted living facility. In addition, home care is much more difficulty for the primary care giver even with the help of direct-care personnel who come to the home. In too many cases, the primary care giver is the one who suffers the most when care is provided in the home.</p>
<p>9. Strategy 2.H</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I have not seen that racial and ethnic minorities are affected disproportionally by AD. All people with AD need care no matter what their race or ethic group. The available resources should be spent on improving care for all AD patients instead of focusing on any racial or ethnic group.</p>
<p>10. Action 3.D.1</p>
<p>It is extremely important that primary care givers understand the legal documents a person with AD should have. These include a general power of attorney, a medical power of attorney, a will, and, where appropriate, a trust. Also, the primary care giver should ensure their name is on the appropriate bank accounts. The importance of these documents should be stressed in the plan.</p>
<p>11. Goal 5</p>
<p>I agree that it is important to track progress on all of the strategies in the plan. As part of that effort, oversight on all strategies and actions must be provided. Without oversight, there is no way to assess progress.</p>
<p><strong>CARE PROPOSAL </strong></p>
<p>Throughout the above comments I have emphasized the importance of care for people with AD. To provide quality care, funding is required. One way to provide that funding is through a grant program.</p>
<p>To help defray the cost of care for people with AD, a grant could be provided to nursing homes, assisted living facilities, home heath care companies, and, potentially, to individuals. Such a program could be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services or funds could be provided to a state and they could administer the program. To receive a grant, specific requirements would have to be met. In addition, oversight would have to provided to ensure that the grants funds are spent properly.</p>
<ul><li>Grant funds could be used to.</li>
<li>Develop standards of the care of AD patients.</li>
<li>Develop design standards for new facilities or modifications to existing facilities where care for people with AD is provided.</li>
<li>Construct new facilities or modifications to existing facilities where care for people with AD is provided.</li>
<li>Train direct-care workers</li>
<li>Provide funds to increase the pay of direct-care workers. . " Provide funds to defray the costs that family members have to pay for care.</li>
<li>Provide funds for the oversight of the grant requirements and to ensure quality care is provided.</li>
</ul><p>To receive a grant, an entity would have to submit an application to the agency who administers the grant program. The application would have to contain detailed information about on the facility and the care they provide.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for signing NAPA and putting creation of our first National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease on the fast track.</p>
<p>I preface my comments with brief personal history.</p>
<p>I joined the national Alzheimer's Association early in 1980, co-founded both the Chicago and Detroit area chapters as I moved around the country, joined the National Board of Directors circa 1981 and rose to become a national Vice Chair and Chair of the Public Policy Committee. In 1984 I co-founded the Alzheimer's Disease International. I am also proud to have single-handedly suggested the idea of what became the federally funded program to states to create innovative Alzheimer's programs with special emphasis on serving minority populations. While Chair of the Public Policy Committee for the national Alzheimer's Association I was also successful in getting our board to hire full time professional public policy staff, create our annual spring "Public Policy Forum" to bring our citizen advocates to Washington DC to be educated and meet with their Congressional representatives. We also developed our first coalition efforts, e.g. with the then Long Term Care campaign, and the National Citizen's Coalition for Nursing Home Reform and helped support the nursing home reform bill that became law (OBRA 1987). We also held our first meetings with members of the CBO and Medicare/Medicaid administration officials to examine what information was needed to start developing a plan for how to meet the service and funding needs of people with dementia and their families. Later, in the 1990's while at Wellesley Centers for Women we looked at the scary prospects of the diminished numbers of people available (the baby bust era e.g. my children's birth cohort) to serve as care partners to those baby boomers who would be developing Alzheimer's and other brain/body diseases in 2040-2050. I then was asked to join Boston University's NIH funded Alzheimer's Disease Center and Department of Neurology to continue my clinical intervention studies; I currently have a small phase I trial of nutritional supplements underway, funded by the U.S. Alzheimer's Association.</p>
<p>My work over the past 30 plus years on behalf of Alzheimer's disease and now the broader field of brain health, is all inspired by my mother Frances Fink Emerson who developed Alzheimer's disease in her early 50's, lived 25 years and died in 1990 with no ability for willed action or movement of any sort, and a brain shrunk to half its original size. She received great care both at home -9 years-and in a nursing home -- 16 years- (and thus lived a long time despite her disabilities....no other health issues) in an era when we knew only a fraction of what we know now, thanks primarily to the work of the Alzheimer's Association, and research funding by NIH, Alzheimer's Association and WHO and other organizations and caring people around the world.</p>
<p>Today I am an Alzheimer's researcher connected with Boston University School of Medicine, actively serve on my local chapter board (Alz. Assn of Massachusetts and New Hampshire) as member of the Medical Scientific Advisory Committee, serve as a Board Member Emeritus of the national Alzheimer's Association (an inactive role), and actively attend and present scientific papers or posters at the Alzheimer's Disease International. I also have a small business that brings evidence-based knowledge about brain healthy lifestyles to organizations and individuals and families. My centerpiece is the evidence-based Memory Preservation Nutrition program, which I am proud to be bringing to 6 Boston area Assisted Living communities to help them improve the healthfulness of the foods their residents are served and eating. I am also a popular speaker, mainly on the topic of "Healthy Eating for a Healthy Brain and Body." And was featured as part of a Medical Journal TV news report on Boston Channel 5's Chronicle on March 20, 2012 and November 18, 2011.</p>
<p>I am excited by the breadth and content of the draft national Alzheimer's plan and want to make just a few pointed comments about moving forward. I am also attaching a couple documents that might be of interest in summarizing some of the recent work related to brain healthy lifestyles and reducing risk of Alzheimer's and other brain diseases. Here also is the direct link to the article I wrote for Sage Encyclopedia 'Alzheimer's Disease: Encyclopedia of Lifestyle Medicine and Health' See it at: <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=6kqwthjab.0.ptfnnijab.rplxpbdab.1&amp;ts=S0737&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sage-ereference.com%2Fview%2Flifestylemedicinehealth%2Fn18.xml%3Fp%3DemailAIi5pJ5vQDTvY%26d%3D%2Flifestylemedicinehealth%2Fn18.xml">http://www.sage-ereference.com/abstract/lifestylemedicinehealth/n18.xml</a></p>
<p>First, I am gratified that the draft plan calls for research and program development in the realm of healthy lifestyles, not just innovations in the realm of pharmaceutical and medical research, which of course is needed as we would all like to find the magic bullet(s) to prevent and cure this disease. But given the complexity of this mysterious disease and the delicacy and intricacy of the brain, such magic bullets may not exist. Alzheimer's may be as challenging to reduce risk as has been heart disease, stroke and diabetes, since they are all interrelated in ways we are still seeking to understand. Thus major public health initiatives based on evidence uncovered in the fields of nutrition, physical exercise, sleep, stress reduction and much more may be what works to help our society avoid the catastrophe of doubling, then quadrupling the numbers of Americans with Alzheimer's disease as the numbers of people who could serve as care partners and paid professional providers shrinks in relative numbers.</p>
<p>Second, as an active member of the international Alzheimer's research and practice communities I strongly urge that the HHS Administrative offices charged with designing, refining and implementing the plan be in close liaison with international efforts to combat Alzheimer's disease. People in the US are often very parochial and have no idea of the great strides being made elsewhere. Also, because our healthcare system is presently dominated by for-profit organizations and pharmaceutical companies, it is harder for us to see clearly public health priorities that might be the best use of resources. The international community faces graver restraints in resources but at the same time has the power of being able to find collective solutions that benefit the most people. For instance at our most recent conference of ADI, held in London, the closing debate was whether enough evidence now exists to mount a major public health initiative targeting improvements in healthy lifestyles for middle-aged adults....vs. an even broader public health initiative to improve the health and wellbeing, especially nutrition, of babies and pregnant women and through that route decrease the numbers of future adults with brain diseases. Meanwhile we are all gearing up to try to be ready to serve the millions of adults who already have Alzheimer's, who will develop it if we don't find a way to slow down the progression and delay the age of onset.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's Disease International's small but very competent staff (Mark Wortman is the CEO, based at the UK Alzheimer's offices in London) and with several groups of collaborative research groups who are keyed in on finding practical solutions to this world wide crisis we are all facing together.</p>
<p>One of these research groups is called "10-66" which receives both NIH and WHO funding to conduct important cross-cultural studies in the developing world to establish true and comparable prevalence/incidence rates of both Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, has conducted international clinical trials of caregiver interventions to determine usefulness and costs in a variety of different countries and financial settings, and is now looking at some broader public policy and public health issues. Their annual reports can be found on the ADI website:</p>
<p>In addition, there is a collaborative effort of several country based large research projects examining whether certain lifestyle interventions could help reduce the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, or delay the age of initial symptoms. Each initiative has different founding sources and different specific research objectives and methods, but by combining and collaborating they hope to increase the robustness of their findings. One of the three studies is taking place in Finland, led by Miia Kivipelto with major funding from Finland's Health Department, and some additional funding from the U.S. Alzheimer's Association and perhaps other sources as well. I touch on that study in one of the two papers I have attached to this email.</p>
<p>Another perspective that was discussed at this last London meeting was, how best to proceed in planning CARE in the depressing scenario that we can't prevent most of the cases of Alzheimer's. What public policy is best. One that is disease specific, or that is based on disabilities, across diseases and health conditions. This was very interesting to me arising among a group of people who has fought hard for over 25 years to get their home countries to give proper recognition to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and to develop national plans. But once one has raised awareness, achieved sufficient specific research dollars and developed specific care programs, then one is freer to look at the broader public policy perspectives and see what is the best use of resources for a country, and what is most likely to be politicall feasible.</p>
<p>As you could gather from my resume, I stand ready to volunteer my time and attention to helping you in your efforts should you see a way I could be helpful.</p>
<p>In the meantime I applaud all the work you are doing and say THANK YOU. You all are fulfilling a dream I've held since the 1980's of a true national effort to combat Alzheimer's disease, both through research, public health and programmatic efforts at the local, state and federal levels.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Disease &amp; Lifestyle</strong></p>
<p><strong>Entry Citation: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Lombardo, Nancy B. Emerson. "Alzheimer's Disease." <em>Encyclopedia of Lifestyle Medicine and Health</em>. Ed. James M. Rippe, MD. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2012. 120-42. <em>SAGE Reference Online</em>. Web. 29 Feb. 2012. 6000 words on-line accessed 2 29 2012 </strong></p>
<p>This entry (a) describes the evolving definition of <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> disease (AD) and its prevalence; (b) summarizes evidence for nutrition, physical exercise, and other healthy lifestyle interventions that may delay onset, prevent occurrence, or slow the progression of AD and other dementias and maintain the emotional and physical health of both the person with dementia and his or her care partners; (c) identifies key lifestyle strategies for preserving brain health--both cognitive and emotional--and how they may be related to body health strategies; and (d) highlights some clinical trial results and introduces a groundbreaking multi-domain study under way in Finland and the body of evidence leading to this seminal trial.</p>
<p>Readers may take away confirmation of the importance of some of the things they are already doing and gain ideas and motivation to adopt brain-healthy nutrition and lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>Prevalence </strong></p>
<p><em>The World Alzheimer Report 2010: The Global Economic Impact of Dementia</em>, published by <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Disease International, reported that around 0.5% of the world's total population live with dementia, predominantly AD, and that the total estimated worldwide costs of dementia were US$604 billion in 2010, equivalent to around 1% of the world's gross domestic product. The <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association reports that there are nearly 15 million caregivers for <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> and dementia patients in the United States. AD is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the one growing most rapidly (by 50% from 2000 to 2007). The growth rate of this epidemic is expected to further accelerate with the aging of the baby boomer generation, increasing personal costs to families, which provide the bulk of care, and rapidly escalating economic costs from $172 billion today to more than $1 trillion by 2050. The U.S. National <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Project Act was enacted into law in January 2011 to create a coordinated national strategy to address this national public health emergency with widespread social and economic consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of AD and Diagnostic Criteria </strong></p>
<p>AD is the most common form of dementia, causing multiple impairments in thinking and cognition, including planning and organization (executive function), attention, short-term episodic memory (especially the recording of events and experiences), and sometimes visual-spatial function. The pathological hallmarks of AD are extracellular plaques composed of a protein called beta-amyloid (also called "A-beta") and the intracellular accumulations of neurofibrillary tangles, the insoluble paired helical filaments of an abnormally phosphorylated tau protein, and a cytoskeletal protein critical to the brain cell structure. Studies suggest that the soluble forms of A-beta, not the more visible plaques, are the toxic form. The normal function of A-beta is to kill microbes, as part of the innate immune system. It is the large amount of A-beta present in AD that is abnormal. Moreover, plaques and tangles appear to be late-stage developments and may or may not reflect the initiating biological sequelae, which may include injury, inflammation, disruptions of cell signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and disruptions in glucose and/or lipid metabolic processes.</p>
<p><strong>New Criteria for Diagnosing and Redefining AD </strong></p>
<p>National Institutes of Health/<strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association working groups in 2010-2011 updated the criteria for diagnosing <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia, added criteria for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to underlying <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology, and set the framework for identifying and testing biomarkers that in the near future could be used to diagnose "preclinical AD." Thus, the definition of AD has expanded beyond dementia and cognitive impairment to include a presymptomatic stage of the disease.</p>
<p>Biomarkers may improve the accuracy of diagnoses of both <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia and MCI due to <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology during life and serve as clinical trial end points. Prominent among the new biomarkers are neuroimaging (e.g., of A-beta levels, glucose processing, and the size and shape of brain structures) and measuring the presence of A-beta and tau in cerebrospinal fluid. These criteria will replace those established in 1984 as the "NINCDS-ADRDA" criteria. These criteria, developed by the National Institute of Neurological Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA), were universally adopted and have been in use, without modification, for more than 25 years. One of the challenges of prevention and treatment trials, both with preclinical AD and in MCI, is the inadequacy of cognitive tests to catch early changes reliably. The emergence of other outcome markers, namely brain imaging, and other biomarkers, is revolutionizing the field.</p>
<p>Scientists participating in the work groups formulating the new guidelines note that the updates were urgently needed for establishing the next generation of clinical trials for possible pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions. In medical practice, the proposed changes represent refinements of existing criteria for the diagnosis of <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia. The guidelines suggest, for example, that physicians recognize that complaints of loss of memory may not always be the first or most prominent presenting symptom. A decline in other aspects of cognition (e.g., word finding, vision/spatial issues, and impaired reasoning, judgment, and problem solving) may be the first presenting or the most prominent symptoms. Many research scientists in the field are concerned that current biomarker criteria give too much emphasis to A-beta and tau (especially A-beta) and too little to the role that oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular pathology, white matter, and other lesions or injuries may play in cognitive decline, in clinical symptoms of dementia, and in the development of abnormal levels of A-beta and tau. Ignoring a large body of evidence could hinder identifying proper treatments and preventive interventions, particularly lifestyle interventions. It is also important to guard against reductionist AD theories because what is now called "<strong>Alzheimer's</strong> disease" may be one or more multifactorial disorders and thus may require "multitherapies."</p>
<p>The evolving understanding of AD includes the recognition that individuals with a diagnoses of AD and MCI can still learn new information and acquire new habits, using a variety of preserved functions such as other forms of memory (e.g., visual, emotional, procedural). In addition, it is important to realize that while people with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> may have lost many brain cells and synapses, they still retain many healthy brain cells, so it is important to work with them to maintain brain health in the hope of slowing progression, maintaining positive emotion, and improving quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Causes or Etiology of AD as Related to Lifestyle </strong></p>
<p>The exact causes and etiology of AD are still not fully known. As of 2011, there are still no methods of perfect diagnosis during life or ways to cure or completely prevent AD. Age remains the biggest risk factor for AD, with (lower) education levels the only other consistent risk factor across all ethnic groups. However, much has been learned in the past 30 years, lifestyles are at the heart of this new knowledge.</p>
<p>Research now recognizes AD as a complex chronic disease with many environmental and genetic factors, whose pathology may begin to accumulate 10 to 30 or more years before the appearance of noticeable clinical symptoms. With such a long prodromal stage, preventive interventions are needed that can be safely used for decades. While a few families have an autosomnal dominant form of AD, most individuals have what is called the "sporadic" form, without clear genetic patterns. The <em>APOE4</em> type of allele confers a dose-related risk for persons of European origin but not typically for those of African origin. While other risk-conferring genes have been identified, most scientists have found that environmental factors are probably at least as important as genetic ones. Recognition of the importance of lifestyle flows directly from the multiple studies that have shown that brain and cognitive health is dramatically affected by the rest of the body, especially the cardiovascular, glucose metabolism, and cell energy systems.</p>
<p>Observational and prospective studies have confirmed this logical relationship and spawned numerous animal studies to explore the relationships between particular lifestyle factors, cognition, and the mechanisms of action. For instance, physical exercise as well as many nutrients and food substances with anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory properties have proven to lower the amount of A-beta in animal models and also lower inflammation. Some nutrients also improve neuronal cell signaling, lipid metabolism, and glucose metabolism and/or decrease oxidative stress.</p>
<p>This sort of evidence, together with numerous observational studies with a variety of human populations in different countries, has established that appropriate nutrition and physical activity are good candidates for helping reduce the risk of dementia, cognitive decline, and AD in humans. In 2010, gold-standard randomized clinical trials for integrated evidence-based nutrition programs had not yet been undertaken, and those for various forms of exercise had just begun. These kinds of lifestyle interventions are very difficult to get funded and then carry out, so scientists cannot yet say with certainty that the various lifestyles indicated by an array of other studies will be sufficient to delay the onset of cognitive symptoms or slow progression. However, scientists have already proven with certainty the link between nutrition, physical exercise, and certain other lifestyle factors to prevent, slow, or even reverse other related chronic diseases such as stroke, other cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and insulin resistance. Therefore, most researchers and clinicians are ready to recommend lifestyle approaches as these offer probable additional benefits to cognitive health. Lifestyle interventions are also of keen interest since, given the multiple decades of presymptomatic development of AD-related pathology, preventive interventions need to be safe and tolerable.</p>
<p>A growing body of research suggests that a variety of nutritional factors, social engagement, mental stimulation, physical exercise, complex activities incorporating multiple domains, and management of stress and depression all help preserve brain health. Managing both emotional and physical stress is important because heightened cortisol levels have been connected to cognitive decline as well as to faster rates of decline in persons with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia. Moreover, research reports an association between cortisol levels, hippocampal shrinkage, and insulin resistance. Adequate sleep is also essential for a healthy brain, neuroplasticity, and memory. Music, art, acupuncture, T'ai Chi, meditation, and certain other spiritual practices, as well as having a meaning and purpose in life, also appear to enhance brain health. Many of these lifestyle factors are related to neuronal plasticity and the generation of new brain cells as well as prevention of deterioration of existing brain cells.</p>
<p>Research indicates some common factors for both cognitive and emotional health. Intervention studies indicate the independent and synergistic efficacy of nutrition, cognitive rehabilitation, physical exercise, and various alternative medicine practices in improving cognition, mood, and quality of life of persons who already live with AD or other memory or brain disorders. The challenge is in actually making behavioral changes to adopt these protective lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>Why Lifestyle Factors Are Important to Brain Health </strong></p>
<p>Epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of AD doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 (with 13% of individuals over the age of 65 having AD and about 40% over 85 years having AD). If lifestyle interventions can delay the onset of AD by 5 years, the prevalence of the disease would be halved, along with all the attendant human and financial costs.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that healthy brain tissue is better able to withstand the ravages of age, genetic vulnerabilities, environmental stresses, accidents, toxins, and disease. Further, healthy lifestyles help enhance and strengthen neurons, dendrites, and other body and brain cells.</p>
<p>Many studies, including gold-standard clinical trials in the case of many other chronic diseases, have suggested that a healthy lifestyle, especially with regard to nutrition and exercise, may help prevent and treat most human chronic diseases. Thus, healthy lifestyles are helpful to both the person with dementia and his or her care partners, who are at extra risk of depression and illness because of caregiving.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular health and normal glucose metabolism contribute to brain health, while the rise in obesity and other chronic illnesses has a direct negative impact on brain health. Dozens of studies have established that each vascular risk factor adds to the risk for AD and severity of dementia.</p>
<p>Diabetes and prediabetes increase the risk of cognitive decline, MCI and dementia, and, according to some scientists, AD in particular. Studies using imaging techniques in adults and teenagers show that diabetes, prediabetes, or abnormally high insulin resistance as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) shrinks the hippocampus, the major site for short-term memory and spatial memory, encoding of new information and experiences, as well as some aspects of emotional function. These findings should raise serious public health concerns because study results show that the hippocampi are already shrinking in obese teenagers with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as in middle-aged nondiabetic adults with insulin resistance. Cognitive impairments in nondiabetic adults were found to be associated with the degree of insulin resistance. Related memory impairments and related white-matter changes were observed in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels were reduced in adults with insulin resistance.</p>
<p>Inflammation is believed to play a key role in the etiology of AD and has been associated with an increased risk of AD. Existing inflammation, as well as inflammatory events such as infections, surgery, or heart attacks, hastens progression in people with AD. Oxidative stress also plays a key role in AD etiology, including increasing inflammation and oxidation of brain lipids. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction is part of AD etiology and relates to the energy systems within the brain cells.</p>
<p>In summary, whatever hurts the heart and blood vessels harms the brain. Problems with glucose metabolism and insulin levels also threaten the brain. The organ and disease silos are disintegrating, with increasingly similar clinical recommendations for better nutrition and exercise and for managing stress to treat or prevent a wide range of chronic diseases affecting nearly every organ in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Lifestyle Approaches for Cognitive Health </strong></p>
<p>Many leaders in the field of brain health believe that the evidence is already sufficient to suggest that regardless of personal risk factors, and with or without pharmacologic intervention, a healthful lifestyle is likely to reduce risk, delay onset, and slow the progression of AD and vascular dementia. Some of these researchers and clinicians conclude that the evidence suggests that it is the combination of vascular lesions (e.g., microstrokes or white-matter lesions) with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology that together result in symptoms of MCI and dementia. If these hypotheses are correct, then they offer another argument in favor of practicing healthy lifestyles to reduce cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Nutrition, physical exercise, and other lifestyle interventions work on multiple pathways to improve overall health in multiple organs with minimal or no side effects, even over many decades, which is important since scientists now believe that the pathology of AD--that is, the development of excess A-beta and abnormal phosphorylated tau--begins several decades before the appearance of cognitive symptoms.</p>
<p>Multiple lifestyle factors can have synergistic or additive effects. One of the most interesting trials involved the 2-year study of aged beagle dogs conducted by Carl Cotman's group at the University of California, Irvine, which showed that an enriched diet alone improved performance on a cognitive task from 25% in the control group to 67% of the experimental animals. A third group, with increased physical activity and social play, improved performance to 80%, while combining enriched diet and exercise-play interventions resulted in 100% of a fourth group of dogs being able to perform the difficult learning task.</p>
<p>Given the well-established connection between cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and diabetes and cognitive function and cognitive decline, and the evidence-based certainty that good nutrition, physical activity, and certain other lifestyle changes help treat or prevent these diseases, more and more people in the AD field have concluded that it is good clinical practice to recommend these healthy lifestyles to persons concerned about their brain health or who already have a diagnosis of MCI or dementia, including AD.</p>
<p><strong>Multidomain Lifestyle Study Under Way in Finland </strong></p>
<p>Many people in the field agree that the preventive intervention most likely to be effective will be multifaceted to be potent enough to delay the onset of AD or slow it down. There is one such multicenter randomized clinical trial under way in Finland, called the <strong>Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability</strong> (FINGER) Trial, under the leadership of Miia Kivipelto and funded by the Finnish government, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the national <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01041989). Persons between 60 and 77 years of age who are determined to be at increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia are randomized to a control group (standard health counseling at baseline) or to a preventive intervention for 2 years. The latter receive multidisciplinary treatment that includes nutritional guidance, physical exercise, cognitive training and social activity, and intensive monitoring and management of metabolic (e.g., diabetes) and vascular risk factors. Importantly, each intervention includes a coach to guide and encourage the implementation of each lifestyle change. In addition to cognitive end points, a variety of potential biomarkers are monitored in relationship to any cognitive change, including biochemical markers of inflammation or oxidation, hormones controlling blood sugars and fats, as well as brain imaging.</p>
<p>Dr. Kivipelto's study reflects the combined wisdom of many leaders in the field, including the International Academy of Nutrition and Aging. The FINGER study builds on more than a decade of research, suggesting the importance of each domain of this combined program. The collective findings of some of these studies are summarized in the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Selected Findings of Lifestyle Studies </strong></p>
<p>Observational studies have established that each of the following lifestyle behaviors may be independently related to a lower risk of dementia: (a) nutrition, (b) physical fitness, (c) social activities and social engagement, (d) organization memberships, (e) productive (meaningful) activities, (f) mental activities (e.g., reading, word spelling/recognition, numbers, and other games), and (g) management of stress. Several researchers, using meta-analyses, have concluded that the most potent activities are complex activities that involve multiple domains, especially activities that include physical activity and social interaction as well as cognitive challenge, such as dancing and golf. Examples of activities involving 2 domains are board or card games, knitting, gardening, T'ai Chi, chi gong or yoga, and doing exercise in a group. Complex and novel activities such as learning a new language, especially sign language, traveling to new places, and playing a musical instrument, especially a new one, are also particularly recommended.</p>
<p>A 2010 Institute of Medicine Consensus conference and a Cochrane review of certain lifestyle interventions for preserving cognitive health concluded that there was insufficient evidence on which to base clinical recommendations. The Cochrane reviews and the Institute of Medicine, however, used very strict criteria for acceptable clinical trials, and for physical exercise, they reviewed only a few clinical trials of very small size or pilot in nature, which were underpowered. Both panels tended to be overly conservative and looking backward rather than forward in a brand new research field where rigorous clinical trials were just beginning to be designed, funded, and reviewed and where, logically, these interventions might have their biggest impact in the preclinical or MCI stage of AD, where outcome measures are still under development. Most reviews also do not integrate the combined weight of observational studies with clinical trials in animal models of AD, which are the first phase of testing some of the factors observed in human longitudinal studies and of researching mechanisms of action. Nutritional trials, especially those with integrated complex nutritional programs, are difficult to design and gain adherence to, and physical exercise programs to some extent suffer the same challenges. Published randomized controlled trials in the nutrition field as of 2011 were limited to single substances or small groups of vitamins.</p>
<p>Nonetheless the body of evidence is growing rapidly.</p>
<p><em><strong>Nutrition </strong></em></p>
<p>One well-structured prospective study published in 2010 found that persons with the highest levels of all 8 forms of vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols) had half the risk of AD, whereas previous studies and intervention trials, less knowledgeable about the necessity of all forms of vitamin E in the brain and body, had looked at only <em>a</em>-tocopherol. This Karolinska Institutet (Sweden) study concluded that it was the combination of the 8 vitamin E forms that was important to brain health.</p>
<p>Various nutritional studies using animal models have shown the power of various single nutrients to lower A-beta levels, reduce oxidative stress, and improve cognitive function. Clinical trials of persons with MCI or AD have been few in number and show mixed results but some limited promise. A Swedish clinical trial of fish oil capsules using a daily dose of 1.7 mg of docosahexaenoic acid and 0.6 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (2 long-chain omega-3 fatty acids abundant in the human brain) reported preliminary results suggesting a slowing of cognitive decline in persons with early-stage AD. A larger trial of just algae-derived docosahexaenoic acid had no effect across all AD patients. One study of 3 B vitamins (B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, and folate) had no effect in persons with AD, but another using lower doses of the same 3 B vitamins improved cognition in people with MCI, but only in those with high homocysteine levels. These results suggest that while combination dietary programs may produce stronger effects on cognition than current pharmacological treatments for AD, single nutrients may be insufficient, and nutritional interventions may have more effect in MCI and very early-stage AD. Continued clinical research is needed.</p>
<p>Of greater interest for clinical study is combining multiple nutrients since the most recent observational studies have suggested that it is combinations of whole foods, such as in the Mediterranean or DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets, that really make a difference. A 2006 integrative review presents evidence of how various nutrients appear to work on the multiple different pathways leading to AD and/or dementia, including inflammation, oxidative stress, glucose or insulin abnormalities, levels of A-beta and tau, cell signaling, and mitochondrial dysfunction. A recent animal study showed that a combination of whole foods-based nutrients, including vegetable, fruit, and herb and spice nutrients combined with fish oil, appears to restore mitochondrial dysfunction in triply transgenic AD mice, and a clinical trial is now under way in healthy older adults. A series of pilot studies with both mice and humans conducted by Thomas Shea and colleagues have shown preliminary success in improving short-term memory and attention in both cognitively normal adults and patients with AD, with a novel combination of vitamins and nutrients: namely, vitamin E, folic acid, vitamin B12, <em>N</em>-acetyl-l-cysteine, acetyl-l-carnitine hydrochloride, and <em>S</em>-adenosylmethionine. These preliminary studies suggest an important focus for continued studies in nutrition and brain health.</p>
<p><em><strong>Physical Activity </strong></em></p>
<p>Most of the meta-analyses of physical activity that had less strict criteria for study inclusion than the Cochrane reviews reported consistently positive results, backing up the observational studies that had linked physical activity to reduced incidence of AD and slower rates of conversion from MCI to AD dementia. An array of intervention studies in healthy older adults, people with MCI, and people with early AD, all found evidence of decrease in the rates of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Animal studies have established that physical activity increases cognitive function and identified at least 2 newer mechanisms of action beyond the known cardiovascular mechanisms: (1) decrease in levels of A-beta in the brain and (2) increased amount and rates of neurogenesis, especially in the hippocampus. Human studies have established that people who exercise more have higher levels of hippocampal BDNF, a brain chemical related to neurogenesis. Increased serum BDNF levels have been correlated with larger hippocampi and better memory performance.</p>
<p>Kirk I. Erickson's randomized controlled study using magnetic resonance imaging as an outcome measure established that aerobic exercise (specifically 1 year of walking 3 times a week for 40 minutes) can increase the size of critical brain structures. Consistent with the expected 1% to 2% annual hippocampal loss in dementia-free seniors, the control group (which spent an equal amount of time stretching) lost about 1.4% volume in this brain region by the end of the 12-month trial. In contrast, the hippocampi of the walkers grew by roughly 2%. In addition, researchers found that greater elevations in serum BDNF were linked to greater gains in hippocampal volume.</p>
<p>The benefit of walking exercise seemed specific to the anterior part of the hippocampus (including the dentate gyrus). Similar effects did not appear in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, or posterior hippocampus. The dentate gyrus is the most metabolically active part of our brain and is involved in spatial memory, short-term memory, and new learning. Neurogenesis is most prominent in this part of the adult brain; many surmise that it is so because creation of new brain cells and dendritic connections is essential to the production of new memories.</p>
<p><em><strong>Meditation and Spiritual Practices </strong></em></p>
<p>Stress management and spiritual practices may also contribute to brain health. For example, a recent study using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in live human participants reported that persons participating in an 8-week mindfulness meditation program experienced measurable increases in the hippocampus regions associated with memory, sense of self, and empathy while reducing areas of the amygdala associated with stress. Numerous studies demonstrate that other spiritual practices such as forgiveness improve emotional and mental health. By relieving stress and depression and decreasing cortisol levels, such practices may also improve cognitive health.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cognitive Training, Cognitive Rehabilitation, and Cognitive-Kinetic Interventions </strong></em></p>
<p>With regard to cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation strategies to improve and preserve cognition, the evidence is particularly strong. Observational studies suggested that "use it or lose it" applies to keeping one's mind active. The groundbreaking ACTIVE randomized clinical trial study demonstrated that even short-term cognitive skills practice interventions had persistent effects in the healthy elderly. A number of later studies suggest that the most effective interventions combine modalities--for example, cognitive training with physical exercise and support groups.</p>
<p><em><strong>Multifaceted Relationship Between Physical Activity and Cognition </strong></em></p>
<p>In population and clinical studies, physical activity and exercise have been shown to have a positive effect on cognitive function in people of all ages. Recent studies have found that physical exercise stimulates a positive increase in executive control processes, including planning, scheduling, working memory, inhibitory processes, and multitasking. The impact of physical activity on cognitive abilities also continues through the entire lifespan. Physical exercise, for example, has been found to be a key facilitator in neurogenesis, particularly in the hippocampus as well as in other areas of the brain. In general, the rate of neurogenesis and other cognitive benefits is related to the intensity, novelty, and dose of physical activity and exercise. Both endurance (aerobic) and strength (resistance training) exercise benefit both cognitively intact and cognitively impaired individuals.</p>
<p>With regard to improvement in individuals with MCI and AD, substantial clinical trial evidence suggests that various cognitive rehabilitation and training strategies may help restore lost function and slow progression of cognitive decline. Different strategies appear to have more or less potent effects in only one area or in multiple areas. For example, a cognitive training strategy targeting episodic memory benefited only episodic memory. A more holistic strategy that combined physical movements based on kinetic/cognitive theory with cognitive training benefitted areas of attention, spatial abilities, language, memory executive functions, and daily functions. Arkin's pioneering study, initially published in 1999, found a combination of simultaneous physical exercise and conversation, and language practice and word games, interspersed with volunteer activity, particularly effective.</p>
<p><strong>Barriers to Adopting Lifestyle Initiatives </strong></p>
<p>There are several barriers to adopting lifestyle changes, including cultural and psychological barriers. Cultural challenges include the overdependence of the American health care system, and therefore of most individuals, on pharmaceuticals and surgery, which have limited preventive roles for many chronic diseases or could be more potent if combined with lifestyle changes. Perhaps the biggest challenge for implementing these interventions as standard clinical practice is financial. Generally, lifestyle interventions are not covered by most current health insurance plans, although the concept of health promotion and prevention of illness is starting to develop. For instance, because research has established that having a "coach" or personal trainer helps individuals make lasting lifestyle changes, some private insurers will supply a free "health coach" even if the actual interventions are not reimbursed.</p>
<p>To promote brain health, prescribed cognitive training and physical activity may be the modalities most likely to be recognized with some incentives. Nutrition for brain health promotion is not currently covered, although individuals with diagnoses may find some limited coverage for counseling with licensed nutritionists. For families working together to provide a healthier home environment for both a patient with brain disease and his or her care partners, one possible source of funding is the National Family Caregiver Support program, which can be accessed online at <a href="http://www.aoa.gov/prof/aoaprog/caregiver/caregiver.asp">http://www.aoa.gov/prof/aoaprog/caregiver/caregiver.asp</a>. Individuals who have long-term care policies also may be able to gain coverage for these services. The future major solutions lie in the realm of public health, public education, public policy, and research envisioned with the 2011 passage of the National <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Project Act.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>4.2.0. Memory and Cognitive Impact of Foods</strong></p>
<p>Research is proceeding rapidly on the connection between diet, including individual nutrients, on memory and other aspects of our thinking.</p>
<p>Most of the research to date has examined how foods relate to memory and cognition. This research has consisted of either animal studies of specific foods or nutrients, or of epidemiological studies of large groups of people (which can show an association, but not prove a direct cause). These studies have explored the relationship between aspects of what we eat and the likelihood or risk of developing general cognitive problems, mild cognitive impairment (including of the amnestic type i.e. involving memory problems), any kind of dementia (i.e. problems in thinking in multiple areas serious enough to cause problems in daily life or work) or specific diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The mechanisms of action (for how specific foods might help or hurt the brain) identified to date appear to vary, and in the case of many whole foods, multiple actions could be working simultaneously (See for example, Emerson Lombardo NB et al. 2006, Sun AY et al 2008. Tian J et al 2010, Howes and Perry 2011, Williams RJ, 2011). Some ways specific foods could enhance brain health include increasing the availability of the memory neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain (apple juice, sage, Melissa, saffron) (e.g. by directly increasing production, slowing its metabolic breakdown, similar to the action of the cholinesterase inhibitors currently on the market), anti-oxidant and/or anti-inflammatory action, regulating amount of various forms of Abeta peptides, slowing or preventing oligomerization or fibrilization of the Abeta molecule (Wang 2008, Frydman-Marom, A.,2011), protecting omega-3 fatty acids in brain cell membranes or fatty acids, regulating blood sugar and insulin, and/or cholesterol, estrogenic effects that can be neuro-protective, promoting creation of new brain cells or connective parts, or slowing their destruction, improving neuronal signaling and synapse activity, restoring mitochondrial function (related to energy) of brain cells, and retarding tau pathology (the "other" problem protein in AD) (Green 2007) . This list is only partial!</p>
<p>The number of human clinical trials is still small but growing.</p>
<p>The body of evidence suggests a clear connection between foods, overall diet and our brain health, including memory and other cognitive skills such as attention and executive function (ability to organize and plan), and is growing each year.</p>
<p>This website and our brain healthy newsletters will keep you informed of this growing body of evidence.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<p>Several studies using various mouse models of Alzheimer's disease demonstrated the positive effects of a wide variety of food substances chosen for their believed health benefits such as strong anti-oxidant properties. Each food type may be comprised of thousands of nutrients. Foods tested that improved cognitive behaviors and/or lowered Abeta levels in TG mice include: apple juice, blueberries, spinach, strawberries, green tea, melatonin, DHA, plum juice, Concord grape juice, resveratrol, grape seed extract and others (Chan A et al, 2006, Rogers EJ et al.2004, Joseph JA. Et al. 1999, 2009, Lee JW, et al 2009, Mandel SA et al. 2011, Calon, F et al, 2004 and Green et al, 2007, Shukitt-Hale B et al, 2009, Shukitt-Hale B et al 2006, Lagouge, M., et al, 2006, Wang et al., 2008). Both almonds and walnuts helped Alzheimer transgenic mice perform better in cognitive tests and lowered levels of A-beta (Chauhan N et al. 2004, Muthaiyah B, et al, 2011 - no published citation for almonds- see continued work by Neelima Chauhan, PhD, of the University of Illinois-Chicago, as reported in 2005 by Society for Neuroscience. <a href="http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=news_111405">http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=news_111405</a>). An unrelated Indian study in aged rats reported almond paste reversed scopolamine-induced amnesia, reduced cholinesterase activity in the brain, and also significantly reduced cholesterol and triglycerides in these aged rats (Kulkarni KS, et al. 2010).</p>
<p>Epidemiological studies have also identified a long list of brain healthy foods. More recently, innovative studies have begun to identify GROUPS of foods that appear to reduce risk of cognitive decline and onset of dementia, MCI or Alzheimer's disease, such as foods typical of the Mediterranean diet (Féart, C et al 2009, Gu Y, et al 2009, Scarmeas N et al., 2006, 2009a, 2009b, or the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet (LINK <a href="http://dashdiet.org/dash_diet_book.asp?google&amp;gclid=CMDj8qOMsq0CFUTc4Aodvz0FlQ">http://dashdiet.org/dash_diet_book.asp?google&amp;gclid=CMDj8qOMsq0CFUTc4Aodvz0FlQ</a> ) (see unpublished study led by Heidi Wengreen, RD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Nutrition at Utah State University).</p>
<p>Combination supplement studies are also gaining interest. Professor Thomas Shea, Ph.D., Director of the Cellular Neurobiology and Neurodegeneration Research Centerat U Mass Lowell (<a href="http://www.uml.edu/research_labs/Cellular_Neurobiology/Staff.html">http://www.uml.edu/research_labs/Cellular_Neurobiology/Staff.html</a> ) is examining, first in mice and now in humans with and without memory impairments, a combination of certain B vitamins, amino acids and anti-oxidants, with some encouraging results. Another study led by Jon Valla in Arizona uses a combination of fruit and vegetable powers, anti-inflammatory spices and herbs, and fish oil, yielding some positive results in TG mice. A similar combination with the addition of vitamin D is currently undergoing a pilot Phase I clinical trial with healthy older adults at Boston University. Also, Nutricia, a subsidiary of the French Danone Company, is pursuing human clinical trials in both Europe and the US, of Souvenaid® (<a href="http://souvenaid.com/">http://souvenaid.com/</a>) a combination of neuron building substrates identified (and patented) by Dr. Richard Wurtman at MIT, together with anti-oxidant isolated vitamins (Kamphuis and Scheltens, 2010), featured at a company sponsored symposium at MIT (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fighting-alzheimers.html">http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fighting-alzheimers.html</a>). The consumer needs to be aware of the differences between medical foods such as Souvenaid, and nutritional supplements such as "Great Mind, as the rules of evidence and FDA regulations are different. The Alzheimer's Forum engaged in an excellent discussion of this topic in 2009, <a href="http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2258">http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2258</a></p>
<p>A Swedish placebo-controlled clinical trial using fish oil containing both DHA and EPA reported that fish oil appeared to slow cognitive decline only in a few persons with early stage Alzheimer's disease. In persons with mid stage disease the main positive effect was to reverse weight loss, which can be a serious problem in some people (Freund-Levi Y. et al, 2006). A larger, more recent clinical trial of just DHA derived from algae, in persons with AD, reported no significant effect on cognition; however the trial neglected to include EPA, the more highly anti-inflammatory long chain Omega 3 which, in nature, usually occurs in conjunction with DHA and which humans typically consume (and synthesize) along with DHA. Since other AD research has established that AD has an inflammatory aspect to its etiology, we believe that EPA may prove to be as important as DHA in its treatment and prevention. Also, psychiatric and attention-deficit disorders research has established that EPA rather than DHA appears to be the active long chain Omega 3 in achieving the desired treatment effect. See for example Jazayeri S, 2008 (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18247193">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18247193</a> ) and work by Andew Stoll, MD (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Omega-3-Connection-Groundbreaking-Anti-depression-Program/dp/0684871386">http://www.amazon.com/Omega-3-Connection-Groundbreaking-Anti-depression-Program/dp/0684871386</a>) and Ned Hollowell, MD. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delivered-Distraction-Getting-Attention-Disorder/dp/034544230X">http://www.amazon.com/Delivered-Distraction-Getting-Attention-Disorder/dp/034544230X</a>).</p>
<p>Cinnamon helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar, is a potent anti-oxidant (see ORAC chart...link) and is anti-inflammatory, and thus through these 4 pathways is thought to be positive for brain health. A January 2011 publication of an animal study (transgenic mice and flies) by a group of Israeli scientists suggests that cinnamon may also have a positive direct brain effect - cinnamon helps retard the development of Alzheimer's pathology by preventing the oligomerization ("clumping") of single Abeta molecules, leading to toxic forms that kill brain cells (Frydman-Marom A). To learn more, see our newsletter on the topic (Link to Cinnamon newsletter CHANGE THIS TO NEW WEBSITE POSITION <a href="http://healthcareinsights.net/home/newsletter-2011/august-2011-newsletter/">http://healthcareinsights.net/home/newsletter-2011/august-2011-newsletter/</a>). Grape seed extract also prevents or slows oligomerization and fibrilization.</p>
<p>A proof of concept RCT in 12 older adults with MCI found significant improvements in one test of memory (verbal learning) in the 6 randomized to drinking Concord Grape Juice for 12 weeks (Krikorian R et al 2010).</p>
<p>Three small pilot randomized controlled studies of three different spices/herbs in Alzheimer's patients, all led by the same medical researcher in Iran, all published in reputable peer-reviewed journals, suggested positive effects in slowing cognitive decline compared to placebo (sage and lemon balm, also known as melissa) or slowing at same rate as a current prescription drug, without the usual gastro-intestinal side effects (saffron). (See Akhondzadeh, S. et al. 2003a, 2003b, 2010)</p>
<p>Diets high in sugar and/or saturated fats appear to be harmful for the brain. A preclinical study in AD transgenic mice demonstrated that simply spiking water with 10% sugar (while offering same healthy mouse chow to two groups of identical, randomized mice) resulted in speedier cognitive decline of the mice drinking the sugared water, higher levels of Abeta in the brain, and abnormal cholesterol levels. Cao D et al. 2007, Suzanne Craft group's proof of concept randomized clinical trial in 50 older adults for just 1 month demonstrated that a high glycemic index, high saturated/high fat diet, compared to a low glycemic, low saturated fat/low fat diet, resulted in significantly worse cognitive performance (using a visual memory test), and undesirable changes in levels of Abeta in cerebral spinal fluid.

<p>The National Association of States United for Aging and Disabilities (NASUAD) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, as published on February 22, 2012.</p>
<p>NASUAD represents the nation's 56 state and territorial agencies on aging and disabilities. As part of the National Aging Network, each of our members oversees the implementation of the Older Americans Act (OAA), through funds awarded by the Administration on Aging (AoA). Additionally, many member-states also serve as the operating agency for Medicaid home and community based services (HCBS) waivers that serve older adults, and in some cases, individuals with disabilities. The Association's principal mission is to design, improve, and sustain state systems delivering home and community based services and supports for people who are older or have a disability, and their caregivers.</p>
<p>The enactment of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) has created a long-overdue opportunity to focus the nation's attention on Alzheimer's disease, and the Association applauds the Administration's recognition of both the vital need to address the many challenges facing people with the disease, their families, and caregivers; and the urgency with which this must be done. Additionally, we find the draft plan's guiding principles, which seek to optimize existing resources and improve and coordinate ongoing activities, to support public-private partnerships, and to transform the way we approach Alzheimer's disease, to be an appropriate reflection of the ambitious, yet attainable, goals embodied by the plan itself.</p>
<p>Guided by a vision of a nation free of Alzheimer's disease, the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease outlines goals, strategies and actions that directly affect the Aging Network. Consequently, NASAUD respectfully submits for your consideration the following comments and recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces.</strong><br />
					NASUAD applauds the Department's efforts to strengthen state aging workforces that are "capable and culturally competent" through AoA. While implementing this action, it is important that efforts to improve state strategies do not further burden states' abilities to apply for and utilize funds from AoA. States should maintain flexibility to implement strategies that address the unique needs of the state populations through their state infrastructures.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.6: Support state and local Alzheimer's strategies. </strong><br />
					NASUAD applauds states for recognizing the need to develop comprehensive plans to address Alzheimer's disease, but we are concerned that these plans are being conceptualized and developed without involvement from the Aging Network. State agencies on aging and disabilities play a critical role in the oversight and delivery of services that are designed to support older adults, including those with Alzheimer's disease, in their homes and communities. For these reasons, NASUAD recommends that state agencies on aging and disabilities, and other relevant stakeholders, should be involved at all stages of Alzheimer's state plan development.</p>
<p>Additionally, in accordance with the Older Americans Act, state agencies must develop a State Plan on Aging, which is envisioned by AoA as a comprehensive plan document that articulates the direction in which state long-term care efforts are moving, key strategies to address the strong desires of the rapidly growing new generation of long-term care consumers to be served in their homes and communities, and how the state will address the challenges of America's budgetary constraints and competing priorities in today's society. Given these existing requirements, State Plans on Aging may be the most appropriate place for states to describe their short and long-term strategies for addressing Alzheimer's disease. The integration of Alzheimer's state plans into State Plans on Aging would align with the need for a holistic approach to combatting the disease itself, as well as AoA's intent that State Plans serve as valuable tools for planning and tracking all of the state's efforts on behalf of older adults.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services. </strong><br />
					NASUAD supports the Department's approach of expanding linkages between existing disease support and community information centers supported by AoA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In order to successfully connect members of the public with the necessary services and supports, NASUAD recommends that HHS also examine the capacity of these existing structures, particularly those within the Aging Network, such as ADRCs, I&amp;R/A, and SHIPs, to ensure that these resources are adequately funded to meet the needs of this growing population.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs. </strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that any strategy to strengthen the Aging Network's capacity to provide families and people with AD access to appropriate services and specialized long-term care planning should be implemented in such a manner that does not overly burden these existing systems. Rather, any approach should provide the Aging Network with the necessary resources to meet these unique needs and to develop innovative practices for doing so. In addition, HHS should compile an inventory of tools to assist caregivers from federal and state agencies, as well as patient advocacy organizations, and make these tools readily available within the next year for distribution through the Aging Network.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease.</strong><br />
					NASAUD supports the Department's recognition of the potential for the ADRC Evidence Based Care Transitions program to implement evidence-based care transition models that meaningfully engage older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their informal caregivers. Throughout this evaluation process, NASUAD recommends that HHS consider the impact that additional resources could have on the ability of ADRCs to build their capacity and successfully support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.3: Develop an AD-specific toolkit on care transitions. </strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that this toolkit be developed in consultation with state agencies on aging and disabilities, and be available for distribution throughout the Aging Network within the year.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.H.2: Identify steps to ensure access to long-term services and supports for younger people with AD.</strong><br />
					NASUAD supports the proposed collaboration between the Administration on Aging (AoA), the Office on Disability, and Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) to address access to long-term services and supports across the lifespan, and believes these agencies should be consulted as stakeholders throughout the plan's development and implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.1: Identify culturally sensitive materials and training.</strong><br />
					NASUAD supports HHS efforts to give caregivers the information and training that they need in a culturally sensitive manner, and recommends that plans to do so include input from the Aging Network. To facilitate the identification and distribution of culturally-appropriate materials to caregivers, NASUAD recommends that within the year, HHS should convene an expert panel to develop an inventory of culturally-sensitive materials and trainings that are currently available, and identify gaps that should be filled by government and patient advocacy organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS utilize its current inventory of federal agency programs and materials and make these resources readily available to all caregivers through the Aging Network.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term services and supports system.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS distribute the identified best practices in a manner that recognizes the variance in long-term services and supports systems across, and within, states. Since what may be a promising practice in one state may be ineffective in another, NASUAD encourages HHS to recognize the importance of state flexibility in meeting the unique needs of individuals within each state.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that this action include identifying interventions that are successful in improving the health and wellness of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Many successful evidence based programs have been proven to work for both people with Alzheimer's and other dementias, so it is important that the evaluation of such programs not be limited to only Alzheimer's specific interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.4: Develop and disseminate evidence-based interventions for people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</strong><br />
					To successfully implement the strategies defined in Action 3.B.3, NASUAD recommends that HHS quickly work to ensure that more people with Alzheimer's disease, and their families, have access to successful evidence based intervention programs. There are existing programs that NASUAD recommends HHS should expand as part of this effort:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Older Americans Act</strong> -- Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging. Funding should also be increased for the programs funded by the Act.</li>
<li><strong>Lifespan Respite Care Act</strong> -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services. Additional funds should be allocated to the Act.</li>
<li><strong>National Family Caregivers Support Program</strong> -- At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems.</strong><br />
					As HHS works to connect caregivers with appropriate supportive services, NASUAD recommends that HHS build upon the existing capacity of ADRCs to serve as "No Wrong Doors" through which individuals, their families, and caregivers can access available services and programs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.6: Share lessons learned through VA caregiver support strategies with federal partners. </strong><br />
					NASUAD recognizes and applauds the successes of the VA in providing home and community based care, and realizes the importance of sharing lessons learned from the implementation of these programs across agency and state lines. NASUAD recommends that the quarterly meetings identified in this action step commence as soon as possible, so that important information is gathered and shared not only among federal programs, but also throughout the Aging Network.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.C.1: Examine awareness of long-term care needs and barriers to planning for these needs. </strong><br />
					Once HHS completes this barrier-identification process, NASUAD recommends that HHS work with federal stakeholders, including CMS and AoA, as well as state and local agencies on aging, to develop and implement solutions to the identified obstacles.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.C.2: Expand long-term care awareness efforts.</strong><br />
					In looking to expand public outreach and awareness about Alzheimer's disease and the importance of long-term care planning, NASUAD recommends that HHS build upon the successes of the Aging Network in providing outreach and education, such those achieved by ADRCs, I&amp;R/A, SHIPs, and state and local agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the dignity, safety and rights of people with Alzheimer's disease.</strong><br />
					To successfully implement this strategy, NASUAD recommends that HHS consider implementing the Elder Justice Act (EJA), as established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The EJA fully realizes the need to protect our most vulnerable citizens from financial exploitation, as well as from physical and emotional abuse and neglect, and it creates structures and programs for doing so. Though the EJA was signed into law in 2010, it has yet to receive any federal dollars. Without a strong financial commitment to address the growing problem of abuse and neglect among older adults, it will be impossible to fully secure the dignity, safety, and rights of people with Alzheimer's disease. NASUAD recommends that HHS work with Congress to fully fund the Elder Justice Act.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease.</strong><br />
					NASAUD recommends that these efforts take into consideration the existing framework and resources for legal services that are available through the OAA. Additionally, training should be offered to legal professionals throughout the Aging Network, and the curriculum should address the importance of cultural competence. Training should also be extended to state Adult Protective Services workers as well as to other individuals as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report, and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes.</strong><br />
					To leverage existing successful systems, NASUAD recommends that federal and state representatives from AoA's National Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program be involved in this collaborative effort.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that this action include the evaluation of innovative interventions aimed at helping older adults and individuals with disabilities, including those with Alzheimer's and other dementias, remain in the community rather than in institutional settings. With a focus on programs and strategies undertaken by AoA, state agencies on aging and disabilities, and area agencies on aging, NASUAD recommends that HUD and HHS work with the Aging Network to identify innovative practices, barriers to success, and solutions to these barriers.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure adequate resources for programs and services supported by AoA's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP)</em>. </strong><br />
					ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community based care systems to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve Goal 3 in the Draft Plan, funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families at the community level.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation<em>: Include services for mental and behavioral health services</em>.</strong><br />
					Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of necessary health services available to individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias, their families, and their caregivers. Mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with these individuals, their families, and caregivers in primary care, institutional, and home and community based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of effective behavioral and mental health interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 4.A.1: Design and conduct a national education and outreach initiative.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS use existing "No Wrong Door" systems, such as ADRCs, to link individuals to accurate information, resources, services, and supports, in a manner that recognizes the potential need to enhance the capacity of ADRCs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 4.B.1: Convene leaders from state and local governments.</strong><br />
					NASUAD recommends that HHS include state directors on aging and disabilities in this collaboration, as well as state long-term care directors.</p>
<p>On behalf of NASUAD, I thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule. We look forward to continuing to work with HHS to develop a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease that seeks to achieve the vision of a nation free of the disease, while maintaining the dignity and independence of those with Alzheimer's disease, their families and their caregivers. Please do not hesitate to contact me, or Lindsey Copeland, NASUAD's Director of Policy and Legislative Affairs to further discuss any of these issues.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTARY RE: "DRAFT NATIONAL PLAN TO ADDRESS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE"</strong></p>
<p>With all due respect to the contributors and authors of this draft plan, I submit that, if finalized as written, it will do more to destroy the Alzheimer's community and set back any hope of progress toward a solution than anything seen to date in my lifetime.</p>
<p>WHY?</p>
<p>As written this is a blatantly politicized piece of campaign rhetoric. I, perhaps surprisingly, am a life-long Democrat and strong supporter of liberal causes who has burned a lot of shoe leather knocking on doors on behalf of liberal candidates starting with Adlai Stevenson in 1952, but I am and have been also a dementia caregiver for over 20 years. This Alzheimer's Disease issue SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY! THE PROBLEM IS APOLITICAL, AND SO SHOULD BE THE SOLUTION!</p>
<ol><li>Starting with the Vision Statement. There is NO better vision than that of The Alzheimer's Association - "A world without Alzheimer's Disease".</li>
<li>Certainly President Obama should be given credit for his support, and his supporting statement deserves recognition in the plan, but other people such as former House Speaker Gingrich deserve equal recognition for their contributions toward developing and supporting these efforts as well.</li>
<li>This entire issue of age related cognitive impairment (I've read that there are nearly 100 probable types/causes) deserves the support of EVERY citizen, whatever their political persuasion, and this draft plan mitigates any possibility of achieving that necessary broad level of support.</li>
<li>Further, in the 27 pages of text, I count at least 8 specific references to the "wonderful" AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. Why? One should be more than enough, Zero would be better since a) The administration is wavering on implementation with refusal to implement some parts of the law, b) the administration is providing multi-state waivers to other parts, c) there seems to be little agreement or consensus on interpretation of key elements among those few who have struggled to review those nearly 3000 pages, and lastly d) this controversial law has yet to be reviewed for constitutionality by The Supreme Court (partiallly or completely).</li>
</ol><p>I suggest that the intent of those statements can be preserved in a much less controversial way by simply replacing "Affordable Care Act" language with something like "existing and proposed legislation". I think that the PLAN might also allow for the possibility for proposing new, additional legislation should it be considered useful.</p>
<p>With respect to Strategy 1C, I feel it would be most appropriate to add an additional action to address the legal and ethical aspects of early detection. What about those people that show no signs of dementia but are discovered to have major plaque accumulations? Should they be told?</p>
<p>I agree that measurement of the disease's progression is extremely valuable to the caregivers, researchers, and medical professionals, but I think that more than imaging and biomarkers is needed. Today, the "gold standard" of American neurologists and gerontologists is probably the MMSE (Mini Mental State Exam), although many more assessment tools have been developed and found useful around the world. Of even more significance is the Allen Cognitive Scale measuring patients ability to contribute to their care in later stages. The PLAN should include recommendations for assessment tool standards to be applied nationwide in evaluating AD/Dementia progression for use in clinical trials, medical reporting, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Another observation formed from my having read the proposed draft report numerous times is that the research portion, despite expressing some valid points, still appears to be another somewhat disorganized "hip-shoot" relying on far too much luck and too little deliberate, well thought out planning. Dr. Eric Kandel said it best when he applauded the successes so far and recognized that this whole issue was extremely complex and we had a lot more to learn. The complexity of the challenges clearly represents a "system of systems" which the late Russell Ackoff defined to be a "mess". This entire program cries out for a well-organized systems engineering approach if any progress is to be made in an affordable, rapid manner. Ackoff would have been our guy, but perhaps a colleague or student of his might be found to accomplish this task as soon as possible. A few calls to the systems thinking community in Academia or the International Federation for Systems Research might identify some key people.</p>
<p>Speaking of complexity, I think we can rely on the following:</p>
<ol><li>Age related dementias (other than major vascular events) are slow in development (Some have said that AD may begin in a persons twenties).</li>
<li>AD mechanisms change as the disease progresses and as damage occurs.</li>
<li>Each stage may require markedly different treatments to achieve delay or prevention.</li>
</ol><p>Is it possible that we are discarding treatments because we are applying trials to an inappropriate stage of the disease? (or even to those that may be incorrectly diagnosed?) Can we confidently rely on the FDA to make the appropriate treatment decisions for all stages of AD? I assure you that the "front-line" families become more desperate as the disease continues it's slow progression. I further suspect that most people in the AD community care very little if the treatment is "FDA Approved". The issues really boil down to:</p>
<ol><li>Is the treatment available (anywhere in the world)?</li>
<li>Is the treatment affordable?</li>
<li>Where, when, and how can I get it?</li>
</ol><p>An example of a layman's assessment of possible "treatments" as of today is shown as Attachment 1 to this commentary.</p>
<p>With regard to rapidity, I also have seen other criticisms of the 2025 goal suggesting that a 2020 goal might be better. Certainly, I would like to see a goal of 2010, but I believe that 2025 might be attainable only if we restrict ourselves to those things that are in the "pipeline" today, which in turn have no guarantee of success. I would urge you to consider scheduling several goals, with separate time objectives, recognizing that we are in a cancer or AIDS-like program that might take 50 years to find a "cure". By the way, I also noted that "finding a cure" is not in the list of research objectives. Have you given up?</p>
<p>I would suggest starting as follows:</p>
<ol><li>Identify and treat risks (2012) - Suggestions for good/bad environmental and diet approaches (subject to vary with time and knowledge -- remember discarding our aluminum cookware?) This is like "No Smoking" in the fight against cancer.</li>
<li>Slow and/or stop degradation (2015) This is partially available now for those who respond to Aricept/Namenda combo treatment. Solutions are needed for the large number of people who do NOT respond favorably.</li>
<li>Early Prevention (2020)</li>
<li>Minimize Symptoms (2022)</li>
<li>Delay Onset (2025)</li>
<li>Reversal of Afflictions (2050) - "THE CURE"!!!!</li>
</ol><p>Of course, the above dates are unsupported figments of my imagination, but I hope you see the concept here.</p>
<p>I also found some statements and titles in the described actions that gave me a "where did this come from" moment. Namely, Action 1.B.3 that discusses clinical trials and international outreach. Do you intend to request non-citizens, off-shore, to participate in our clinical trials? This needs some explanation. Another point that underwhelmed me was Action 1.B.4. Is this just pro-forma government speak or is there a real point? Frankly, I am of the very solid opinion that Alzheimer's Disease is about as racially and ethnically diverse and unbiased in selection as is possible in all of humanity. Are you implying that there is bias in the clinical trial community? Is there managed selectivity in who gets the "stuff" and who gets placebo? I highly doubt that! In fact, I doubt that your assumption of higher risk for AD being either racially or ethnically related has any validity at all. I submit that the REAL reason for those observations lie in differences in life-long histories of environment, diet, and health care practices. For example, we are fairly certain that Americans (of my generation) of Greek or Italian ethnic heritage are at lower AD risk levels, most likely due to preferences for a mostly Mediterranean Diet. This risk reduction may not apply to younger generations if they've switched to Drive-Thru Bacon Cheeseburgers. In any case, I suggest that tracking data on historical environment, diet, and health care practices will be much more meaningful, and tracking racial/ethnic populations as suggested will provide little or no contribution toward improved outcomes.</p>
<p>A small, but significant, item that I have some issues with is the stated expected cost of nursing home care at $78,000. A much more representative (and far more meaningful) number can be shown if it were expressed as a range of state cost averages ($70,000 to $150,000) and further adjusted to determine the level of pre-tax retirement income required to sustain the nursing home option (don't forget to include costs for incidentals like toothpaste, shaving cream, haircuts as well as Medicare parts B,C, and D with those costs adjusted for "means testing").</p>
<p>I suspect you will be looking at $150,000 to $250,000 per year. Thus it will be much easier to understand the future economic pressures on Medicaid and will go a long way toward determining the adequacy of an individual's long-term-care planning.</p>
<p>Also, I am very disappointed that this draft plan promulgates the social stigmas so dreaded by those in the Alzheimer's community. I understand the enticement to encourage high funding levels and popular support through fear, but I believe this is counterproductive to the tasks of living with and caring for those with AD. I am also a strong supporter of redefining those people as being "deeply forgetful" as opposed to "Alzheimer's victims", "Alzheimer's sufferers", "Senile individuals", "People with Dementia" or "Cognitively Impaired". Please realize that NOBODY wants to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It WILL rapidly result in loss of life-long friendships, loss of independence, loss of self, loss of peer respect, etc. This is clearly why early diagnoses seldom happen, and why public education is SO important. The stigma extends and becomes tragic when overzealous and uneducated agents of Adult Protective Services who believe the unsupported and unproven claims spread throughout the Elder Abuse channels of government that "most elder abuse comes from spousal and parental relatives/caregivers". I believe that too many malicious prosecutions are executed throughout the country due to proliferation of this myth. Occasionally, States have admitted to errors, documented those errors, and revised state policies (see "HANDCUFFED" by Wisconsin DHS). Other states rigidly support their mistaken beliefs, and I have seen personally the destruction of families, and early, wrongful patient deaths not to mention large legal costs to these families or to the states if public defense is necessary.</p>
<p>Many caregiving families are threatened daily by the health care/ adult protection bureaucracy. Has no one heard of self-inflicted injuries due to agitation? This is why nursing homes use Posey Mitts (soft handcuffs) and load their patients with unwanted drugs. Should patients be arrested and confined if a caregiver is injured? Should caregivers be arrested and confined if a patient exhibits self-inflicted injuries? Should a caregiver be arrested and confined if a patient is inadvertently injured or bruised during an effort to protect another innocent person? Or attempting to protect the general public? Should families be destroyed, Power of Attorney ignored, and spouses of 50 years be separated without visitation upon arrest, with NO conviction? The Plan's legal advisors would provide a great service to the community by prioritizing for both home and professional caregiver's a list of who should get protection/arrest first: a) the general public, b) close bystanders, c) professional caregivers, d) home caregivers, e) spouses and children/parents, or f) the "deeply forgetful" themselves.</p>
<p>Lastly, some comments on caregiving support needs. The PLAN needs to clearly state as part of Goal 2 that the priority is to provide for in-home care as long as possible in order to provide more favorable outcomes, extend life and quality of life at less cost to both families and government taxpayers. My own personal experiences indicate that respite care for family caregivers and supervised productive day care experiences for the "deeply forgetful" are absolutely mandatory to the achievement of this objective. The only successful application that I have seen was a 1991-1992 experimental program in the State of Georgia with several counties participating. While I understand this program has ended, I believe it was well documented, and I guarantee that as implemented it was indeed a lifesaving experience for participants and caregivers.</p>
<p>As to Nursing Homes, reducing the inappropriate use of anti-psychotics is a good start, but further improvements are necessary, and should begin with significant modification to the criteria by which state licensing authorities evaluate these facilities. Current criteria covers physical safety very well, but ignore many quality of life issues that affect the "deeply forgetful" residents. We often need to remind ourselves that the deeply forgetful are NOT "empty shells", but simply require unique communication techniques. The Plan should look specifically at the results achieved by advanced compassionate thinking in facilities modeled after Lakeview Ranch, those practicing The Eden Alternative, Montessori based care for the "deeply forgetful" and suggest significant modifications to existing licensing and evaluation criteria that could be addressed by all State Licensing Authorities. Also, I am told that many facilities consider it to be too costly to maintain and update resident's care plans, apparently in direct violation of federal laws. This may be lack of education, but certainly indicates lack of enforcement.</p>
<p>Hospitalization offers additional caregiver challenges. "Deeply forgetful" patients require special care, and have special needs above and beyond normal expectations. Electronic (although privacy protected) records are a great idea but should be expanded to include primary caregiver advice and concerns. Hospital personnel need to understand time, behavior, and observation problems as well as the patient's inability to express needs, particularly if in discomfort and pain. Similar observations might be made about any social situation that is not a part of daily routine and familiar people. Examples such as travel (particularly by air), home care visitations, family outings, and especially holidays come readily to mind. People that interact with the "deeply forgetful" need to know that respect and personal dignity are paramount.</p>
<p>If you made it this far, thanks for listening.</p>

<p>I received a notice that your organization will be evaluating ideas from Alzheimer's caregivers. I would be greatly honored to provide some ideas on my holistic Assisted Living Practice, which has been successful in stablelizing both, Alzheimer's and Dementia conditions in a short time frame. We work closely with the resident's MD and their prescribed medications at the beginning, then we immerse the resident in a completely holistic diet, where their medications are much more effective and over a short period (2-3 weeks), the resident's medications can be reduced, therefore, improving their alertness and ability to maintain their independence in many of their daily activities.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me if you should wish to discuss our program. I am working on a book at this time and will be sharing very helpful cases and our holistic approach within a peaceful residential environment.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments Submitted on the<br />
					Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease<br />
					February 3, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease</em>. CCAL is a national advocacy organization working to ensure that person-centered practices are always the foundation of all aging services and supports. Ensuring that person-centeredness is integrated into healthcare practices elevates the experience from a clinical one to a humanistic one. The human emotional experience is important to achieving well-being as are clinical outcomes. The bond between the person receiving services and the individual (as well as the organizations' culture) that provides a healthcare service must be based on the following four principles all working in harmony:</p>
<ul><li>Relationships - valuing the uniqueness of each person</li>
<li>Compassion -caring to build a connection and bond with the person</li>
<li>Empowerment - providing information and options to the person and their caregiver(s)</li>
<li>Autonomy/Choice - respecting the right of the person and their caregiver(s) to make their own choices</li>
</ul><p><strong>Global Recommendations: </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Person-Centeredness </strong></em></p>
<p>Nowhere can principles and practices of honoring the personhood of each individual be more significant than in a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, yet the draft framework is silent on person-centeredness. We respectfully submit that this National Plan should include person-centeredness in its philosophical foundation, core principles , strategies and goals as does the Department of Health and Human Services' National Health Care Quality Strategy and Plan (NHCQS): "Person-centeredness and family engagement will guide all strategies, goals, and improvement efforts". This is "one of the core principles intended to serve as the underpinning of NHCQS and should be reflected not only in the framework, but in how goals, targets, and plans are developed across health care and long-term care settings."</p>
<p>Person-centered language should be used throughout the National Plan. To honor the personhood of each individual and recognize that patient only refers to clinical services and not the broader holistic context, the term "patient" should be changed to "person" throughout the Plan; i.e., "Educate and Support the <em>Person</em> and their Family Members Upon Diagnosis". Indeed, person-centeredness should be a fundamental component of all prevention and treatment plans; i.e. Strategy 2.D - "Guidelines for delivery of high-quality <em>person-centered</em> care and measures of quality are needed…"</p>
<p><em><strong>Enhancing Quality of Life as well as Quality of Care </strong></em></p>
<p>This framework does not reflect our national commitment to providing meaningful lives for all older Americans. Enhancing quality of life and meaningful engagement for individuals with Alzheimers and related dementias must be a fundamental principle and a goal, implemented through training, education, and outreach strategies in tandem with, and comparable to, those for Goal 2 Enhancing High Quality of Care.</p>
<p>Meaningful relationships, purposeful engagement, social interactions and impromptu conversations all serve to enhance the individual's psychological, social and emotional well-being. All should incorporate the person's interests, preferences, strengths, and skills to best maintain their sense of self and to slow down the deleterious effects of the disease. The National Plan should include training for family, caregivers, and staff to heighten their sensitivity to and understanding of positive pathways for communication, interactions, relationships, and meaningful engagement.</p>
<p><em><strong>Family Engagement </strong></em></p>
<p>For those of us who care for loved ones with Alzheimers' and related dementias, we know this National Plan must move beyond encouraging "family engagement" to encouraging caregiver/family/ provider partnerships to best guide and enhance person-centered quality of care and quality of life.</p>
<p>Individuals and families should be empowered through interactions and resources so that they are prepared to make informed choices and be active participants and decision-makers regarding their loved one's care. We recommend the following goals and approach from "Partnering with Patients and Families to Design a Patient and Family-centered Health Care System: A Roadmap for the Future, A Work in Progress" (<em>2006, Institute for Family-centered Care and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement</em>)</p>
<p>"…Develop a shared vision and action plan for improving health care by advancing the practice of patient-and family-centered care and creating partnerships with patients and families in all health care settings and within the organizations and agencies having an impact on health care"</p>
<p><em><strong>Utilize Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) Methodological Approach </strong></em></p>
<p>We suggest adopting the CBPR methodological approach to AD applied research efforts to best inform the work through multiple perspectives and expertise of community-based partners (representing key stakeholders, including family members, direct care staff, practitioners, social workers, long-term service providers, etc.) to inform the research, ensure its relevancy, and enhance understanding and dissemination across research, policy and practice sectors.</p>
<p><em><strong>Public Education Campaign </strong></em></p>
<p>We firmly believe that any public education campaign should highlight non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatment options for enhanced quality of life and care.</p>
<p>We would encourage sustained community-based outreach to the general public through the creation of a "Real People; Real Life with AD" component of this campaign to enable the general public to meet, greet and hear from regular individuals and families who are going through this journey of AD-related life experiences and challenges. We are not suggesting celebrities or authors who have written about family caregiving. We do suggest including the voices, perspectives, and insights of individuals who are living with AD or whose loved one has AD.</p>
<p><em><strong>Improve Coordinated Dissemination of Information </strong></em></p>
<p>We suggest adding this goal as there is no national coordinated network of information about Alzheimer's and related Dementias for professionals or non-professionals. DHHS funds numerous AD research centers, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, and initiatives throughout the country, i.e., Administration on Aging's AD Demonstration Grants; but information and findings are not networked and easily made available.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Recommendations: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1 - Prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>Psychosocial treatment modalities (non-pharmacologic) for AD should also be included in the framework for the national plan</p>
<p><strong>1.A</strong> Ensure that invited expert participants to NIH's May 2012 summit include an appropriate number of non-research, non-clinical dementia experts as well as family caregivers in order to best inform and shape the national plan.</p>
<p><strong>1.C</strong> Consider : a) ethical issues related to such efforts; and b) the potential psychological, social-emotional, medical and economic impact (and unintended consequences) on individuals and their families receiving a diagnosis 10 years prior to emergence of symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>1.E</strong> Consider educational campaign on appropriate and safe use of psychoactive drugs and sedatives and non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatment modalities as related to individual's quality of life</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2 - Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. A</strong> The plan should address solutions for recruiting and retaining high-quality direct care and paraprofessional workers. Best-practice models for AD training should be noted.</p>
<p><strong>2.C &amp; 2.D</strong> The plan should address how individuals and families can be actively engaged in decision making and act as partners on the care team if they so choose. Some individuals and families may just wish to receive counseling, support and information. Both should be addressed.</p>
<p>Palliative care and end-of-life care should be addressed. What interventions are available; what decisions need to be made to have personal wishes carried out by healthcare and long-term support system(s); i.e., individuals with Alzheimer's may want to leave a living will; families should understand the decisions that they may need to make.</p>
<p><strong>2. D CCAL</strong> suggests using a community-based participatory process in which individuals, families, and direct care staff can be partners with experts in developing the guidelines. We suggest examining the national Center for Excellence in Assisted Living (CEAL) "Person-centered Care Domains of Practice" for HCBS which identifies domains of: personhood, relationships and community, governance/ownership, leadership, workforce practices, meaningful life and engagement, services, environment, and accountability.</p>
<p><strong>2.E</strong> Even "safe and effective" transitions can be traumatic for people with Alzheimer's disease, particularly for people with advanced Alzheimer's who are sent to emergency rooms for relatively minor conditions. Emphasis should be on: 1) limiting transitions; and 2) when transitions are necessary--how to make them safe and effective.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3. Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>We strongly recommend including families and direct care staff as active partners in the process of Expanding Person &amp; Family Support, from creating and disseminating culturally sensitive education and support materials to serving as Person &amp; Family Support Guides.</p>
<p>CCAL commends all who were involved in creating the framework for a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias; and appreciates the opportunity to contribute to the process by providing person-centered feedback on its contents.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the comments I provided on January 17, 2012 during the Public Input session of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services meeting. In addition, I have also included other comments based on discussions heard over the 17-18 Jan meeting.</p>
<p>As a sibling, caregiver, registered nurse, health care executive, and advocate to improve the care and support for individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their families and caregivers, I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to provide the following comments for the Council's consideration and action. The work and commitment of the Health and Human Services staff and the Advisory Council in developing a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease is to be commended.</p>
<p>My youngest brother, Carl Srsic, who was born with Down's syndrome, died from the advanced stages and complications of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 50 years old on October 13, 2010. My experiences in caring and coordinating my brother's care first with my parents and then his group home staff, parallel the issues identified by the thousands of family members and caregivers who provided input for the National Alzheimer's Plan. The issues however, are compounded for individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities. Therefore, the National Plan must address the needs of these individuals. I will address my comments in general and within the framework of the national Alzheimer's plan framework presented on 17 Jan 2012.</p>
<ul><li>In general:
<ul><li>Funding must be prioritized to address the devastating and growing impact of Alzheimer's disease particular in the baby boomer's general and for caregivers, particularly family caregivers. In the past, this nation prioritized funding to combat heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and HIV/AIDs. The time is now to prioritize funding to combat Alzheimer's disease. We cannot afford to delay.</li>
<li>I also encourage a balance between research and building evidence-based prevention, slowed progression, and ultimately effective treatment and cure for Alzheimer's disease with meeting the current day to day needs and support of individuals, families, and caregivers.</li>
<li>Fragmentation and 'silos' must be eliminated so that collaboration and coordination can provide the synergy needed to address effective action and outcomes.</li>
<li>One size does not fit all in terms of prevention, screening, treatment, and ultimately a cure. For instance, individuals with intellectual disabilities and Alzheimer's have confounding cognitive and other medical conditions that can make screening and assessment challenging and they react differently to medications and other treatment modalities. Therefore, individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities must be considered as a special population affected by Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>I applaud and encourage applications to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to develop new guidelines and creative care management and service support programs.</li>
<li>At some point, Alzheimer's disease must be incorporated into the National Quality Strategy. Much discussion occurred about the need for data and metrics - process and outcome success measures must be developed to measure success. In addition, as CMS developed evidence-based core measures for heart failure, community acquired pneumonia, etc. , so too, there should be core measures developed for care management and service support for Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>The Center to Advance Palliative Care should be consulted to collaborate on palliative care guidelines for individuals with AD.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Goal 1 - Prevent and Effectively Treat AD by 2025</strong>: Individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities (IDD) must be included as a population within and specific to all the goals of the National Alzheimer's Plan. Research priorities must include studies specifically focused on individuals with IDD as the prevention, screening, and treatment methods may not be applicable as in the general population. To even gather an adequate sample of individuals for potential research study samples, more effective means of identifying individuals with IDD must be developed and databases established locally, regionally, and nationally. Individuals with IDD are not a socioeconomic or race or ethnic population that is commonly associated with health care disparity groups; they are a special population in and of themselves that must be recognized and identified as such in the national plan.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 2 - Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong>: While there are health care providers who are limited in their knowledge and plan of care about AD in the general population, there are even less providers who have the knowledge and skill to manage individuals with both IDD and AD. Finding a qualified, competent, and compassionate provider to guide and coordinate care management is difficult, for individuals who even know and work in the health care system. Current centers for the aging may not have the knowledge and skill for managing individuals with IDD and AD and centers for those with developmental disabilities many times do not have the knowledge and skill for managing individuals in various stages of aging and AD. Support to family members and caregivers is crucial -- as these individuals have had to deal with multiple challenges in caring for a son, daughter, or sibling from birth and then that caregiving becomes even more overwhelming when AD develops. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines must address the multiple needs of individuals with IDD and AD. Aging in place, such as in group home settings with augmented services and supports must be explored as a cost -effective alternative to nursing homes. Consistency, familiarity, and minimizing transition are key to the overall well-being for individuals with IDD and those elements of care are even more relevant for an individual with IDD and AD. With the advent of ACOs and medical homes, models of care coordination management and transition within types of care should be developed to include individuals with IDD and AD. These new approaches to care center on the patient in a truly more holistic approach to care. As in many approaches used for management of other diseases, such as multidisciplinary care coordination or the use of patient navigators or specific case managers, so too should such strategies be considered for individuals with AD.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 3 - Expand Patient and Family Support</strong>: Many individuals with disabilities still live at home with aging parents who also may be developing or have Alzheimer's disease. Families may not be within any support system to specifically help them manage and cope with AD in addition to IDD. They need information about AD, resources, safety, coordination of care, respite care, end of life care, etc. Community supports and easy to find information about resources must be developed and/or incorporated into services for families. It is not just a matter of disseminating information - reaching individuals, helping them know how to access resources from a central location rather than fragmented searching is critical.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 4 - Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Parents of individuals with IDD need to be alerted to potential early onset Alzheimer's. Caregivers, particularly those in group homes, day programs, etc must have required training in not only IDD but also aging and AD care management. The state Developmental Disability Services must also incorporate timely resources to support individuals, families, and caregivers specifically addressing the needs of those with IDD and AD. The need for services (e.g., increased staffing, environmental safety measures, etc) must be available when there are acute needs and not delay care and services due to bureaucratic processes. Collaboration among agencies and services must develop synergy and cost-effective strategies rather than having 'silo' services that are limited, fragment, or overlap.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 5 - Improve Data to Track Progress</strong>: Data about individuals with IDD is often lacking and not uniformly centralized which compounds accurate data collection for those with IDD and AD. Tracking for high 'at-risk' populations with IDD and progress in care management is crucial for effective and efficient resourcing.</li>
</ul><p>While I realize there are many competing priorities and limited funding, the Plan must address the needs of all people with Alzheimer's disease/ related dementias. Our nation made it a health priority to address other major diseases in the past such as cardiac/stroke, diabetes, cancer, and HIV/AIDS with remarkable advances. Action to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease must be now. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments for your consideration into the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p>My name is Lane Simonian. I am an historian. Seven years ago when my aunt and cousin were in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease and my mother was in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, I began searching for ways to prevent and treat the disease. As an historian, I began to collect a mass of abstracts and articles in an attempt to tell the story of Alzheimer's disease. At first with a limited background in biology, I made very slow progress in understanding Alzheimer's. Now, though, I can explain almost every new finding in regards to the disease with the attached hypothesis. What used to take me months to figure out now usually only takes a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>The critical finding in regards to Alzheimer's disease was made by Mark Smith and his colleagues in 1997: Peroxynitrite-mediated damage is widespread in Alzheimer's disease. This damage includes the oxidation (loss of electrons and hydrogen) of glucose transport systems, choline transport systems, the enzyme cholineacetyltransferase, g protein-coupled receptors (muscarinic, serotonin, dopamine, olfactory, adrenergic), the nitration of tau proteins, lipid peroxidation, and the influx of calcium. This damage results in a lack of focus and energy, impaired short-term memory due to a shortage of acetylcholine, disturbed sleep and mood, lack of awareness, impaired smell, behavioral problems (in some instances), disrupted neurotransmission, damage to cellular membranes, and neuronal cell death.</p>
<p>The factors that lead to peroxynitriteformation include (but again are not limited to) high glucose levels, high blood pressure, the APOE4 gene, presenilin gene mutations, bisphosphonate osteoporosis drugs, late estrogen replacment therapy, mercury, aluminum fluoride, and stress. Most or all of the factors that lead to peroxynitrite formation also lead to Alzheimer's disease (the connection has not been made as of yet between bisphosphonateosteoporosis drugs and Alzheimer's disease, but the fact that the numbers of cases of Alzheimer's disease has skyrocketed since the introduction of these drugs is perhaps concerning).</p>
<p>Phenolic compounds in various fruits, vegetables, spices, and essential oils and polyunsatured fats inhibit peroxynitrite formation and thus inhibit the development of Alzheimer's disease. The most direct and concentrated way to deliver phenolic compounds to the brain is through aromatherapy with essential oils high in phenoliccompounds.</p>
<p>An impressive number of animal studies, case studies, and clinical trials indicate that Alzheimer's disease can be treated effectively with peroxynitrite scavengers (compounds that are hydrogen donors convert peroxynitrites into a nitrogen dioxide anion and water). These scavengers partially reverse or prevent all of the damage done by peroxynitrites listed above (for example, they add hydrogen back to muscarinicreceptors allowing more choline to enter cells). In the reference section of the attached hypothesis you will find a partial list of peroxynitrite scavengers (most of them are phenolic compounds) which have helped correct cognitive deficits in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. These include rosmarinic acid, grape seed extract, cinnamon extract, eugenol in Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil, and thymol and carvacrolin Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil. In addition, Jimbo and colleagues in Japan were able to improve cognitive function in dementia patients after giving them rosemary and lemon to smell in the morning and lavender and orange to smell in the evening for 28 days. Akhondzadeh and his colleagues achieved similar results using tinctures of sage and lemon balm essential oils for four months. One reviewer looking at this (and perhaps other clinical trials) concluded "excellent results have been obtained with peroxynitrite scavengers, with reversals of Alzheimer's disease in human clinical trials being repeatedly demonstrated."</p>
<p>Several case studies add further validity to the findings from animal studies and clinical trials. Dramatic improvements in alertness and awareness and modest improvements in short-term memory have been noted. In my mother's case she recognizes her home again, feels comfortable around her brother who she used to think was an impostor, sleeps through the night, can recall her name and sometimes spell it, can sometimes remember the order of days and months, can complete phrases such as I scream, you scream, we all scream for...ice cream and April showers...bring May flowers, and is much more alert and aware than she was four years ago before we began aromatherapy.</p>
<p>Essential oils high in methoxyphenols (such as rosemary, sage, thyme, oregano, clove, and cinnamon leaf) and citrus based essential oils appear to work the best. The patient can smell them under each nostril for a few seconds. It takes about a month to begin seeing some improvement (perhaps because it takes time to reverse the damage that peroxynitrtes do to smell).</p>
<p>Let me highlight the critical points:</p>
<ul><li>Peroxynitrite-mediated damage is widespread in Alzheimer's disease and directly or indirectly causes all the features of the disease.</li>
<li>Most or all of the factors that lead to peroxynitrite formation can cause Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Compound which inhibit peroxynitriteformation inhibit the onset of Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>In animal studies, clinical trials, and case studies, peroxynitrite scavengers have lead to improvements in cognitive function.</li>
<li>Phenolic compounds can be used both to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease. In both cases, aromatherapy is likely the most effective way to deliver these compounds to the brain.</li>
<li>This disease can be treated effectively immediately with few side effects.</li>
</ul><p>I wish you good luck in your work. If the opportunity arises, I would like to meet each of you in person. In the meantime, please feel free to contact me. Nothing pleases me more when I receive questions from people interested in my research.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Hypothesis for Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The three factors which increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease are high levels of myo-inositol (a precursor to phosphatidylinostiol 4, 5 biphosphate), increased phospholipase C gamma activity (whose substrate is phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 biphosphate) and the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3/AKT pathway (the PI3 kinase converts phosphatidylinostiol 4,5 biphosphate into phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 triphosphate). Factors which increase myo-inositol levels are high glucose levels (due to the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate into myo-inositol), high blood pressure (due to the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter), and Down syndrome (because people with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome containing the sodium/myo-inositol transporter). Factors which reduce levels of myo-inositol are certain blood pressure medications, certain diabetes medications, estrogen, tamoxifen, lithium, and scyllo-inositol. Factors that increase phospholipase C gamma are glucose, estrogen, and angiotensin II (a cause of high blood pressure). Factors which lower phospholipase C gamma activity are fish oil (and other polyunsaturated fats) and phenols in various fruits, vegetables, spices, and essential oils. Factors that prevent or inhibit the activation of the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway are presenilin gene mutations, APOE4, and bisphosphonate osteoporosis drugs. Insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and drugs which increase high density lipids can to a limited degree stimulate this pathway. These are the main risk factors and preventative measures for Alzheimer's diseas</p>
<p>e Phospholipase C gamma increases the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (via inositol 1, 4, 5 triphosphate) which in turn stimulates Protein Kinase C. Protein Kinase C processes the amyloid precursor protein and a calcium dependent enzyme cleaves this protein to form amyloid plaques. Phospholipase C gamma exports zinc and zinc and copper are entombed in the amyloid plaques. This results in higher levels of homocysteine and a decline in the superoxidase dismutase which converts the superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide. Protein kinase C increases choline uptake (and phospholipase C beta) and phospholipase C gamma increasing the number of plaques created. Homocysteine via Protein Kinase C increases the production of the superoxide anion and inducible nitric oxide. The two combine to form peroxynitrites.</p>
<p>The effects of peroxynitrites are as follows:</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites lower levels of intracellular magnesium which allows more calcium into the cells via the now open gate of the NMDA receptor.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites cause lipid peroxidation (including the final product of lipid peroxidation--HNE)</p>
<p>The combination of peroxynitrites, HNE, and calcium influx leads to neuronal cell death. Peroxynitrites oxidize g-protein coupled receptors and nitrate tyrosine. The result is the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Moreover, peroxynitrites nitrate tau proteins preventing them from being reconstituted for proper neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize choline transport systems, muscarinic receptors (a g protein-coupled receptor involved in the uptake of choline), and the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, thus resulting in a critical shortage of acetylcholine which is needed for the retrieval of short-term memories.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize a series of other g-protein coupled receptors including olfactory, serotonin, and dopamine receptors. The results respectively are impaired smell, poor sleep and depression, and lethargy and apathy.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize glucose transporters resulting in a lack of energy and focus.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites can be scavenged using phenolic compounds (one or more OH groups). Phenols in essential oils can be breathed directly into the hippocampus via aromatherapy. They accomplish the following conversion (ONOO- + 2H+ + 2 electrons--&gt;NO<sub>2</sub>- + H<sub>2</sub> 0). Essential oils add hydrogen back to g-protein coupled receptors and partially reverse the nitration of tyrosine (including tyrosine residues on tau proteins). They thus partially reverse many if not all of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's has a very simple and avoidable cause: steam-refined polyunsaturated vegetable oils. I have been working this out since 1990.</p>
<p>The unsuspected vitamin E deficiency in these widely consumed food oils leads to brain cell membrane oxidation, that impairs the function of important enzymes that normally degrade the beta-amyloid protein. This protein therefore accumulates, incredibly slowly, in the brain of a regular consumer of deodorized vegetable seed oils.</p>
<p>After the age of 65 or so, accumulated beta-amyloidmay release highly toxic soluble aggregates (called oligomers), that are the immediate cause of synaptic toxicity and neuronal death.</p>
<p>That is exactly how over 5 million Americans have ended up with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>My suggestion to your Government, is simply to legislate a requirement for all refined seed oils in your country to have any vitamin E deficit (usually 30%) corrected before distribution and sale. This simple step will also prevent ADHD occurring during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Already, this basic preventive step is under consideration by the Australian Government's Food Standards Authority, and we may be the first nation in the world to eliminate the twin brain epidemics of Alzheimer's and its prenatal partner, ADHD.</p>
<p>The USA--where vacuum steam-refining of seed oils was invented, in 1899 (David Wesson, Savannah)--has no shortage of brain power. What you lack is a safe level of vitamin E in your brain-oxidizing vegetable oils.</p>
<p>Can you fix the problem, and catch up with Australia?</p>
<p>When your Norfolk, Virginia shipyards were mass-producing Liberty ships for WW2 Atlantic convoys, a large banner was hung across the docks, saying:</p>
<p>IT CAN AND WILL BE DONE!!</p>
<p>Can you make vegetable oils safe? Can you do this too?</p>
<p>I attach a draft hypothesis for your inspection: I shall be trimming it down shortly, for submission to The Lancet, in London.</p>
<p>Here, at long last, is the direct cause of the disease: knowing this, we can easily prevent it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Disease And Attention Deficit Disorder May Share A Single Cause: Refined Vegetable Oil</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>By Dr Robert Peers, General Practitioner, North Carlton, MELBOURNE</strong></p>
<p>In 1990 I identified a potential cause of typical late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), reporting my findings (a small case/control study) in a letter to the New Zealand Medical Journal [Ref 1] in 1993 (letter: "Alzheimer's Disease And Vegetable Oils"). I found that 12 cases of diagnosed AD had all consumed refined polyunsaturated seed oils for many years, contrasting with 20 age-matched control subjects with good memories, none of whom used such oils.</p>
<p>The reason for seeking a dietary cause was simple and compelling: AD had been seen to sometimes affect only one of a pair of identical twins [Ref 2], a striking finding that points strongly to some toxic or dietary cause. In addition, it was very unlikely to be caused by ageing itself, since the other twin was the same age, but remained unaffected in the long term; and because most older people do not in fact get the disease. I reasoned that those who were affected were somehow getting it from their diet, but how?</p>
<p>My initial reading even disclosed a likely dietary suspect: Professor Scott Henderson, an Australian research psychiatrist, cites in his 1988 AD review/hypothesis paper [Ref 3] a remarkable study [Ref 4] done by Professor Denham Harman in 1976, in Nebraska. Harman had a free radical theory of ageing, and knowing that both seed oils and the brain are rich in oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids, he wondered whether feeding safflower oil to his rats might cause free radical damage to the brain: it certainly did, as his rats soon lost their way in a maze. Furthermore, giving vitamin E to a new group of rats, fed the same oil, prevented these cognitive deficits--a finding that suggests that his oil, and perhaps other seed oils too, were low in vitamin E.</p>
<p>This work made me very curious about common vegetable seed oils, which were well known to reduce cholesterol and heart disease risk, but nobody had previously suspected them of actually causing a disease, and here they were evidently oxidizing the brain!</p>
<p>Soon after setting out on my library search for a dietary factor in 1990, I discovered that deodorized seed oils lose about a third of their antioxidant vitamin E during refining [Ref 5]--a potentially serious deficiency not seen in the soft margarines made from the same oils, which suffer polyunsaturate losses during hydrogenation, restoring the vitamin E/polyunsaturate balance. I realized immediately how important this deficiency would be in the brain, whose nerve cell membranes are very rich in highly oxidizable long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>Since the main function of vitamin E is to protect these vulnerable essential fatty acids against oxidation, a low level of vitamin E in the nerve cell membrane would invite cerebral "lipid peroxidation". Oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids breaks up the fatty acid chain, and among the fragments are neurotoxic aldehyde molecules.</p>
<p>Oxidized Omega-6 fatty acids, in particular, release the highly reactive aldehyde 4-hydroxy nonenal (4-HNE), whose toxic effects on nerve synapses may account for the faulty memory seen in "Seed Oil Syndrome", described below. But 4-HNE does more than that: it activates a key enzyme involved in AD development, and may also--more importantly--mediate the impaired beta-amyloid clearance caused by cerebral lipid peroxidation.</p>
<p>Elena Tamagno, in Turin, has shown [Ref 6], in recent years, that 4- HNE indirectly activates the pivotal AD enzyme beta-secretase (BACE 1), a small rise in the activity of which causes a sharp increase in betaamyloid formation [S Cole, Ref 7]. Beta-amyloid is a peptide--a small protein fragment--that is the molecular cause of AD, as in rare genetic cases, where a gene mutation increases the production of a more toxic form of this peptide (the longer form, with 42 aminoacids, rather than the 40 residues seen in the much less toxic and more abundant form).</p>
<p>Although small amounts of this important protein fragment are produced in the normal brain, it is easily cleared away by degrading enzymes, and it can also exit the brain through the blood-brain barrier. However, people consuming refined vegetable oil will be forming increased beta-amyloid in abnormal oxidizing conditions, that may damage the clearance mechanism, resulting in progressive betapeptide accumulation and, ultimately, Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>One possibility is that lipid peroxidation products, like the same 4-HNE, might inhibit a key clearance enzyme, called Insulin-Degrading Enzyme (which also degrades beta-amyloid). In fact, an amyloid clearance problem is all that is required to cause AD, since even a mild over-production of beta-amyloid--as I postulate above--may still be successfully cleared.</p>
<p>So my theory does require a clearance defect, whether or not amyloid production is increased. And now, in 2009, Dr Y Nishida in Japan has shown [Ref 8] that by blocking vitamin E transport to mouse brain, lipid membrane peroxidation ensues, which impairs beta-amyloid clearance, by somehow reducing the expression of the gene coding for the above Insulin-Degrading Enzyme. Vitamin E-depleted seed oils, likewise, lower vitamin E levels in most tissues, causing lipid peroxidation [Y H Wang, Ref 9], which must include the brain, as shown by the early cognitive deficits seen in Harman's pioneering work (above), and their notable prevention with vitamin E.</p>
<p>Common Omega-6 seed oils, which are usually steam-deodorized, have been linked to cognitive decline in Holland [S Kalmijn, Ref 10], and also in Greece [D Psaltopoulou, Ref 11]), and to over double the risk of incident dementia (70% being AD) in the prospective "Three Cities Study" in France [P Barberger-Gateau, Ref 12]. Processed safflower oil, as discussed above, was shown many years ago (1976!) to cause memory faults in rats, which could be prevented with vitamin E. For some reason, Dr Harman did not alert the US food safety authorities to this alarming discovery.</p>
<p>Low vitamin E levels in corn, soya and safflower oils were first demonstrated by Dr David Herting in Rochester, New York State (Ref 5--see "herting d and 1963" on <a href="http://www.pubmed.gov">http://www.pubmed.gov</a>, to find and download his free Journal of Nutrition paper). He concluded that widespread vitamin E deficiency would occur in populations consuming processed polyunsaturated seed oils. However, he did not realize the extreme peroxidation vulnerability of the brain and retina, where reduced vitamin E levels mean rapid lipid peroxidation of long-chain Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, in synapses and in retinal rod cell disc membranes. Had he known this, he could have predicted a new disease of the brain, with the further possibility of a new childhood brain disorder, arising in the fetal brain during pregnancy.</p>
<p>It was precisely these most vulnerable tissues that were tragically ignored in the landmark nutritional study, completed in 1960 in Illinois, on which current recommended daily intake of vitamin E is based [Ref 13]. Although lead investigator Dr Max Horwitt should have been aware of the brain's rich concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (mentioned, for example, in 1950s biochemistry texts), he judged vitamin E requirement exclusively by testing the fragility of red blood cell membranes in vitamin E-deprived human subjects, finding even greater fragility when the subjects were given vitamin E-stripped corn oil.</p>
<p>It did not occur to Horwitt to ask his vitamin E-deprived subjects about higher mental functions like memory or mood. Memory difficulties (and glare sensitivity and night-blindness from retinal damage) are likely to occur long before the red cell test becomes positive in response to gradual dietary vitamin E depletion, because the oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids are much less concentrated in the red cell membrane, than in retina and brain. Lipid peroxidation is a very rapid chain-reaction, that proceeds much faster in a vitamin E-depleted cell membrane containing a high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially when those fatty acids--as in brain and retina--are of the long-chain variety, full of oxidizable double bonds.</p>
<p>To his credit, Horwitt did realize that the main function of vitamin E is to protect polyunsaturated fatty acids, so he based the recommended daily intake on the ratio of vitamin E to the intake of these fatty acids. He assumed that higher polyunsaturate intake, for example seed oil, would automatically mean higher vitamin E intake, but neglected the possibility that processed seed oils might lose some of this vitamin E during refining, and so cause some new disease specifically involving tissues prone to lipid peroxidation.</p>
<p>Indeed, he failed to pursue this possibility, even when he found that some members of staff at the Elgin Mental Hospital, who were not on the vitamin E deficient test diet, also had an abnormal red cell test. He did not ask himself how that could have happened, but could have taken a dietary history, and might have discovered that they were consumers of common vegetable oils, which could therefore have had something in common with his experimental stripped corn oil: low content of vitamin E. He may then have gone on to investigate the vitamin E content of such oils, and found it to be low--as David Herting found three years later, in 1963. Had Horwitt detected mild memory faults in consumers of refined seed oils, and set himself to do a little thinking, he could have nipped Alzheimer's in the bud, in 1960.</p>
<p>Any child, young person or adult consuming refined seed oils will report, if asked, memory problems, poor dark adaptation and glare sensitivity (photophobia--which is irreversible). I discovered this syndrome in general practice, and I call it Seed Oil Syndrome, and it probably reflects 4-HNE neurotoxicity in the synapses. Lipid peroxidation, which in the long term causes impaired beta-amyloid clearance, has early clinical effects due to synaptic damage: 4-HNE impairs neuronal glucose uptake, among other effects.</p>
<p>I have seen this hitherto undescribed syndrome in 100s of oil-using patients in family practice, over many years. The memory responds well to vitamin E (I sometimes add fish oil, for a faster response), except after the age of 50 or so, when subjects report long-term stability of memory, without actual improvement.</p>
<p>I am hoping that these cases, who, after some 20-30 years of refined oil exposure, may have a significant brain amyloid load, will not progress to AD, once off seed oils, and using olive oil, vitamin E and fish oil supplement. I also have some of them on Inositol, a seed sugar known to neutralize toxic Abeta oligomers [Ref 14] and improve language and orientation in established AD [Ref 15].</p>
<p>This simple glucose isomer, which is easily obtained in the diet (from grains, nuts, legumes, soymilk, cantaloupe and citrus), may prove to be a powerful weapon--along with cessation of refined-oil exposure-- in preventing Seed Oil Syndrome progressing slowly to Mild Cognitive Impairment and, ultimately, diagnosed AD. Given the extensive neuronal damage already evident in these two later stages, ultra-early prevention is now thought to be the only way to stop this disease, and nutrition--if it can do the job--is far preferable to preventive drugs.</p>
<p>From the public health angle, all cases of Seed Oil Syndrome--which is easily identified by symptoms and diet history--should change to olive oil (or any cold-pressed oil), eat a high.Inositol diet (even citrus juice is very rich in Inositol), and preferably take fish-oil capsules as well.</p>
<p>Saturated fat intake from butter, cream, cheese, fatty meat, pastries etc., must also be reduced, for it commonly causes co-morbid vascular dementia in the Alzheimer victim.</p>
<p>Inositol, given as a higher dose (5 gm/day) via supplement, also reverses anxiety disorder and depression [Ref 16], which affect perhaps 40% of AD cases. Anxiety alone doubles the risk of progressing from Mild Cognitive Impairment to AD [Ref 17], possibly because of cortisol-induced hippocampal damage, low Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor levels and poor hippocampal neurogenesis. Depression, often resulting from anxiety plus fatty diet, may increase inflammation--pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin 1-beta may aggravate neuronal damage and increase stress axis activation even further. Anti-anxiety doses of Inositol also have a place here, by greatly decreasing stress-induced comfort-eating of fatty foods like chocolate, cheese, cakes and pastries [author's clinical observations].</p>
<p>One extra benefit from Inositol in brain disease is its unexpected antiageing effect [Ref 18], a possible example of which is the NIH 31 grain-rich mouse diet, that prolongs the median lifespan of female mice by 25% [Ref 19]. By altering the same genes that are altered by caloric restriction--including the key mitochondrial biogenesis gene PGC 1 alpha--Inositol is clearly a caloric restriction mimetic, with the same potential as dietary restriction to provide neurotrophic, antioxidant and energizing benefits in brain, as described by nutritional neuroscientist Mark Mattson [Ref 20]. Already, a multiple sclerosis animal model has been found to respond well to caloric restriction [Ref 21]: Inositol is a more practical intervention.</p>
<p>Variations in AD incidence around the world (low in West Africa, very high in Wadi Ara Arabs in Israel, 4 times higher in Pittsburgh than in Ballabgarh, Northern India) probably reflect local patterns of refined seed oil consumption. In Northern India, unrefined traditional oils are still very popular (eg. pungent mustard oil, crude peanut oil), and in the South there is mostly coconut oil and crude peanut oil--and possibly an even lower AD rate.</p>
<p>Refined oils are, however, encroaching on these traditional markets. Palm oil is the main cooking oil in Malaysia and Indonesia, where AD rates may be low, but in the US and Europe--and the Middle East too-- refined oils are the rule, apart from those people lucky enough to still use mainly olive oil. A study in Bari, Italy, some years ago, showed cognitive decline in older subjects not using olive oil [Ref 22]; they were apparently using common refined supermarket seed oils, which are widely used in Italy for frying.</p>
<p>An oil that causes a serious brain disease in adult life might also be expected to affect the fetal brain: when asking many oil-using patients about symptoms of Seed Oil Syndrome, I have noticed--as a family doctor--that young adults with the syndrome frequently have children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). I proceeded to do a pilot case/control study on retrospective pregnancy diet, in 80 cases versus 80 controls.</p>
<p>Almost all (78) of the mothers of ADHD cases gave a history of regular consumption of refined seed oils during all or part of the pregnancy, often from fried takeaway food. All of these mothers had permanent glare sensitivity (most carried sunglasses, usually perched conveniently on their head), and those who still consumed these oils had ongoing memory difficulties and impaired night vision.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have met young adults with residual ADHD, who report that their mother, if still using such oils, and now in her mid- to lateforties, has an obvious memory problem. The Scottish breath-analysis scientist Brian Ross has found evidence of lipid peroxidation (increased breath ethane gas) in some children with ADHD [Ref 23], probably due to ongoing childhood exposure to the same refined seed oils that caused their condition during gestation.</p>
<p>In my child patients, such further exposure significantly worsens the ADHD, by increasing cognitive problems, mood issues, aggression and impulsivity--all of which improve rapidly by stopping the exposure and recommending fish oil, to assist synaptic recovery and plasticity. Not only does fish oil work faster when refined oils are first excluded from the diet (to prevent peroxidative destruction of the fish oil fatty acids in vitamin E-depleted synapses), but the synaptic benefits of fish oil may be greatly enhanced by adding two more "synaptic building blocksh--uridine and choline--as proposed for Alzheimer's, by nutritional neuroscientist Dr Richard Wurtman, at the Massachusets Institute of Technology [Ref 24]. Uridine sources include brewer's yeast, broccoli and beetroot, while choline is found in egg, chicken, lecithin and wheat germ. Wurtman's "Souvenaid" synapse-restoring mixture, which increases synaptic density and cognitive function in gerbil rats, does improve Alzheimer symptoms, and may work even better in the developing ADHD brain of a young child, to the extent that usual medications for the latter disorder may become obsolete, due to advances in brain nutrition.</p>
<p>I believe there is enough evidence available to conclude that deodorized seed oils are a major public health hazard, being directly responsible for ADHD, widespread Seed Oil Syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease. I notice in my clinic that Seed Oil Syndrome causes depression and irritability in anxious subjects, and aggravates ADHD in children and adolescents, promoting delinquency, serious aggression, antisocial behaviour, and substance abuse. These problems are now endemic in Western cities, and increasing world-wide.</p>
<p>Correction of all such brain peroxidation problems is very simple: to protect their citizens, while at the same time keeping these heartfriendly oils available, governments must be persuaded to pass laws requiring that all deodorized seed oils be rendered safe, with respect to their vitamin E content, before being sold. Natural vitamin E can 8 easily be recovered from the steam distillate at the food oil refinery, and replaced in the deodorized oil: or synthetic vitamin E could be used instead. Urgent action is required.</p>
<p>The highly desirable result of fixing this seed oil catastrophe would be to eliminate the twin epidemics of Alzheimer's and ADHD, along with the alarming antisocial effects of refined seed oils, as specified above.</p>

<p>I have two questions: will there be public comment at any or all of the advisory council meetings and what would be the best way to communicate with members of the committee?</p>
<p>Based on animal model studies, clinical trials, and case studies (including my mother), I know how to treat this disease and likely how to delay its onset. In the hypothesis, you will find references that show that peroxynitrite-mediated damage is widespread in Alzheimer's disease and that this damage can partially be corrected with peroxynitrite scavengers. Some of the most effective scavengers are methoxyphenols (eugenol,thymol, and carvacrol) in various essential oils (such as cinnamon leaf, clove, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and sage) in part because they can be inhaled directly into to the part of the brain affected by Alzheimer's disease: the hippocampus.</p>
<p>With some help from this committee, it is likely that Alzheimer's disease could be effectively treated within this next year.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Hypothesis for Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The three factors which increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease are high levels of myo-inositol (a precursor to phosphatidylinostiol 4, 5 biphosphate), increased phospholipase C gamma activity (whose substrate is phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 biphosphate) and the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3/AKT pathway (the PI3 kinase converts phosphatidylinostiol 4,5 biphosphate into phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 triphosphate). Factors which increase myo-inositol levels are high glucose levels (due to the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate into myo-inositol), high blood pressure (due to the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter), and Down syndrome (because people with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome containing the sodium/myo-inositol transporter). Factors which reduce levels of myo-inositol are certain blood pressure medications, certain diabetes medications, estrogen, tamoxifen, lithium, and scyllo-inositol. Factors that increase phospholipase C gamma are glucose, estrogen, and angiotensin II (a cause of high blood pressure). Factors which lower phospholipase C gamma activity are fish oil (and other polyunsaturated fats) and phenols in various fruits, vegetables, spices, and essential oils. Factors that prevent or inhibit the activation of the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway are presenilin gene mutations, APOE4, and bisphosphonate osteoporosis drugs. Insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and drugs which increase high density lipids can to a limited degree stimulate this pathway. These are the main risk factors and preventative measures for Alzheimer's diseas</p>
<p>e Phospholipase C gamma increases the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (via inositol 1, 4, 5 triphosphate) which in turn stimulates Protein Kinase C. Protein Kinase C processes the amyloid precursor protein and a calcium dependent enzyme cleaves this protein to form amyloid plaques. Phospholipase C gamma exports zinc and zinc and copper are entombed in the amyloid plaques. This results in higher levels of homocysteine and a decline in the superoxidase dismutase which converts the superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide. Protein kinase C increases choline uptake (and phospholipase C beta) and phospholipase C gamma increasing the number of plaques created. Homocysteine via Protein Kinase C increases the production of the superoxide anion and inducible nitric oxide. The two combine to form peroxynitrites.</p>
<p>The effects of peroxynitrites are as follows:</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites lower levels of intracellular magnesium which allows more calcium into the cells via the now open gate of the NMDA receptor.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites cause lipid peroxidation (including the final product of lipid peroxidation--HNE)</p>
<p>The combination of peroxynitrites, HNE, and calcium influx leads to neuronal cell death. Peroxynitrites oxidize g-protein coupled receptors and nitrate tyrosine. The result is the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Moreover, peroxynitrites nitrate tau proteins preventing them from being reconstituted for proper neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize choline transport systems, muscarinic receptors (a g protein-coupled receptor involved in the uptake of choline), and the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, thus resulting in a critical shortage of acetylcholine which is needed for the retrieval of short-term memories.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize a series of other g-protein coupled receptors including olfactory, serotonin, and dopamine receptors. The results respectively are impaired smell, poor sleep and depression, and lethargy and apathy.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize glucose transporters resulting in a lack of energy and focus.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites can be scavenged using phenolic compounds (one or more OH groups). Phenols in essential oils can be breathed directly into the hippocampus via aromatherapy. They accomplish the following conversion (ONOO- + 2H+ + 2 electrons--&gt;NO<sub>2</sub>- + H<sub>2</sub> 0). Essential oils add hydrogen back to g-protein coupled receptors and partially reverse the nitration of tyrosine (including tyrosine residues on tau proteins). They thus partially reverse many if not all of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
