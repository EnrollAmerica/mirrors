<p>I am very impressed by the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (and Related Dementias). It is well written and quite comprehensive from my perspective. But I do have some concerns and suggestions.</p>
<p>My wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease in February 2010. I am her primary caregiver and health advocate. Fortunately, long-term care insurance has afforded us the opportunity to have two very good caregivers thus providing me the ability to work part time as a research scientist at CNA, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). My wife and I have experienced both the classical, traditional clinical medical approach and, more recently, the alternative complementary medical approach. In addition, I am a member of two caregiver support groups: one offered by a Ministry to the Aging at my church, and the second offered by the Alzheimer's Family Day Center of Fairfax, VA.</p>
<p>From this base of experience and education, I offer my observations and suggestions:</p>
<ol><li><strong>The plan seems to lack a sense of urgency</strong>. While the goal "to prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025" is laudable, the selection of 2025 along with the general tone of the plan does not convey the urgency I believe is necessary. Selecting either 2020, because it's sooner and a nice round number, or 2022, as it comes 10-years after the release of the National Plan and is akin to President Kennedy's announcement in 1960 of manned flight to the moon by the end of that decade, would be better. Both years signal a message of boldness and ambition more so than does 2025. I believe caregivers and family members would be encouraged by such ambitious goals.</li>
<li><strong>The plan appears to display certain biases that may restrict the search for alternative solutions</strong>.
<ol><li>First, there seems to be an emphasis on searching for "pharmacological" solutions. Certainly, the plan recognizes other approaches, e.g. "While research on AD has made steady progress, there are no pharmacological or <em>other interventions</em> to definitively prevent, treat, or cure the disease" and "<em>non-pharmacological management</em> of physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms." But it does not clearly state what such "other, non-pharmacological" approaches might be. This suggests to me a bias toward pharmaceutical solutions and therefore a favoring of the pharmaceutical industry, which seems to be more motivated by profits than solutions. I encourage that these other approaches be specified. The effectiveness of public health communications necessitates clear, plain-English language.</li>
<li>There also seems to be a bias toward the time-consuming approach of clinical trials. The plan clearly recognizes the need to the pharmaceutical bias, I think.</li>
<li>The plan rightly includes "related dementias" in defining Alzheimer's Disease. But it identifies only Lewy body, frontotemporal, and vascular dementias as examples. Unless recognized but not stated by the drafters, I suggest including other neurological diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, ALS/Lew Gehrig, and MS. Such an expansion might introduce synergies and efficiencies and potentially a considerably more significant effect.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><p>Admittedly, my own personal research into AD is limited. I have only recently begun to dig more deeply into the subject. Much of my motivation comes from frustration over the silence and apparent helplessness of the traditional medical community toward my wife's disease. I have recently read two books that have strongly influenced me: "Alzheimer's Disease---What If There Was a Cure"---The Story of Ketones" by Dr. Mary Newport, and "Stop Alzheimer's Now! How to Prevent and Reverse Dementia, Parkinson's, ALS, Multiple Sclerosis and Other Neurodegenerative Disorders" by Dr. Bruce Fife.These books introduced me to the "Type 3 Diabetes" aspect of AD, which I find most intriguing and compelling. If what they say is true about insulin-deficiency and insulin-resistance in the brain and the resultant "starvation" of neurons, and that nutritional substitutes in the form of ketone bodies from medium-chain triglyceride fatty acids already exist on the shelves of health food stores in the forms of coconut oil and MCT oils, THIS IS HUGE. Considering that I might be "starving" my wife's neurons by not providing this source of fuels (already used by neonatologists, according to Dr. Newport and in pediatrics, according to my RN daughter), ignoring this evidence is morally unconscionable to me. Also if true, this nutritional approach could be a "silver bullet" of vast consequence.</p>
<p>Thank you for soliciting comments from the public in reaction to the draft plan. I apologize for missing the March 30 deadline. Such tardiness has become commonplace for me as an Alzheimer's caregiver and health advocate. And thank you for your contribution to this important work.</p>

<p>Although the official comment period has closed for the NAPA draft plan, I'm writing today to urge you to go bolder with the final plan to be released by HHS later this month.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is a cruel disease. It slowly steals one's intellect, ability to communicate, independence, and dignity, even control over basic bodily functions like eating and caring for personal hygiene. It also places an overwhelming burden on caregivers -- emotionally, physically, and financially.</p>
<p>The commitment to a 2025 deadline in the draft NAPA plan represents a major step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's. I am pleased that the plan recognizes the need for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, compressing the drug development process, accelerating targeted research, and better coordinating activities with other countries.</p>
<p>However, I am one of many concerned Alzheimer's advocates who believe that this first draft fails to present a strategy aggressive enough to achieve the goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's within 13 years. It lacks specificity in terms of timelines and deadlines, provides no path to providing significantly greater resources, and does not hold a single high-level office or individual accountable for the overall plan.</p>
<p>I hope that HHS will address these issues so that the next version of the plan will be bolder.</p>
<p>With the number of Alzheimer's patients expected to triple in the coming decades, we must embrace a plan that eschews a "business-as-usual" approach and tackles Alzheimer's with the urgency and aggressiveness it requires. If not, we stand to lose millions more lives -- and trillions of dollars -- to this disease.</p>

<p>This is an excellent document and we applaud your initiative and efforts to make this comprehensive and inclusive. It is with that objective in mind that we make the following observations:</p>
<p>Under Action 1.B.5 you note the importance of clinical trials on "Pharmacologic interventions." In B.6. you mention the importance of these for "lifestyle interventions."However, another <strong>key area</strong> is <strong>dietary or nutritional interventions</strong>. While this is often assumed by some under lifestyle, it is <strong>not always understood as such</strong>, especially by the public, and in light of recent research seems significant enough to warrant it's own mention. At least in terms of prevention, diet and nutrition is arguably <strong>at least as important</strong>, if not much more so, than any pharmaceutical intervention yet devised. (see evidence below). The rationale for it not being assumed under lifestyle is as follows:</p>
<p>Dictionary.com defines lifestyle as: <em>the habits, attitudes, tastes, moral standards, economic level, etc., that together constitute the mode of living of an individual or group</em>.</p>
<p>While tastes may imply dietary choices, that's not necessarily so, as they could imply one's taste for clothing, cars, companionship, etc., which do not equate to food or nutritional choices.</p>
<p>Dictionary.com provides this example of it's use in a sentence: <em>Much of what we're told about diet, <strong>lifestyle</strong> and disease is based on epidemiologic studies</em>.</p>
<p>Here you see they clearly do not consider "diet" to be synonymous with "lifestyle."</p>
<p>Perhaps this oversight, or confounding of the variables, is due to the heavily biased and fretfully flawed FDA tendency to lump anything therapeutic under the heading of pharmaceutical or "drug." That however is confusing and misleading to the public, and we feel a disservice to the thousands of great scientists who have worked and are working with nutrition and nutritional formulas -- many of whom your agencies have funded, who in the past <strong>have made better inroads</strong> into preventing or arresting AD symptoms than the pharmaceutical industry. In fact, Dr. William Grant in his landmark epidemiological study of "what causes Alzheimer's," including studies from 11 different countries, argued strongly that Alzheimer's disease was "primarily caused" not by genetics, which you pay great attention to, but by <strong>unhealthy dietary choices</strong>.[1] Moreover, the experimental peer reviewed studies, also show that findings in the field of nutrition have been more promising to date,[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] at least for the prevention of Alzheimer's than the much more costly pharmaceutical trials. It is logically inconsistent therefore to emphasize pharmaceutical trials in the context of prevention and neglect to even use the words <strong>diet, nutrition</strong> or exercise in this proposal.</p>
<p>So, wouldn't it be appropriate in light of the above noted research, to include here "nutritional" or "dietary" in para 1.B.6 before "lifestyle" as the dictionary has above. In other words to note "the importance of clinical trials on nutritional or dietary interventions." And encourage the FDA to expedite the approval, implementation and public awareness of positive outcomes in these areas, instead of dragging their feet as they historically have done, in this area. Or worse yet proposing a moratorium on new formulations, as they recently have proposed. (If you would like evidence of this let me know.)</p>
<p>We recommend, as you discuss prevention and early intervention, that you <strong>at least</strong> make mention of the fact that Alzheimer's is seen by many good researchers as a condition of elderly malnutrition,[10], [11] and there is a great deal of good research, such as that conducted by Dr. Suzanne Craft at the University of Washington, which the Alzheimer's 'Association highlighted in their 2010 ICAD conference and in their HBO series, which suggests that healthy foods and the nutrients they contain, may be <strong>among the most</strong> important factors to consider in our efforts to prevent Alzheimer's. In fact in that video she notes that by following some simple dietary guidelines people "could at the least delay the onset of Alzheimer's" and by doing so "reduce the number of Alzheimer's cases nearly in half" -- thus enabling you to achieve your objective.</p>
<p>Of course we're just using Dr. Craft as an example. In fact that Assoc and NIH have sponsored many good studies which suggest that various nutrients, like folic acid, grape seed and other antioxidants, key amino acids, etc can make a major dent in preventing Alzheimer's. Remember the famous Cache Senior memory study where they found that high consumption of antioxidants -- C and E "reduced AD prevalence by about 78% (adjusted odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05 - 0.60) and incidence by about 64% (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.09 - 0.99)."[12] Then there were the Chicago fish studies5 and the MIDAS study presented in the 2009 ICAD conference which showed fish and DHA's potential to reduce risk by more than half. And we could go on -- see the references noted above.</p>
<p>You get our point. If you are going to specify pharmaceutical and lifestyle trials, we feel you should also note dietary or nutritional trials.</p>

<p>Dr. Oz backs the research behind this existing drug to treatAlzheimers. This article explains it better than I can. My mother was recently diagnosed and it is a painful disease to watch. The mental decline in someone so vibrant and otherwise very healthy is devastating. Please support an aggressive pursuit of this new promising treatment for Alzheimers.</p>

<p>For the past 3 years I've watched my partner of 48 year decline into the darkness of Alzheimer's disease. His physical condition is to the point that I must place him in a nursing home. This is by far the most difficult decision I have ever made. I want a time to come that no one must make such a decision because of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>I am pleased that your draft plan recognizes the need for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, compressing the drug development process, accelerating targeted research, and better coordinating activities with other countries.</p>
<p>From what I can tell there needs to be more resources promised and some more explanation of the steps to be taken.</p>
<p>I hope that HHS will address these issues in the coming months so that the next version of the plan will be bolder. Our nation cannot afford the costs of inaction.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments on NAPA from an Alzheimer's expert with 30 years of dementia experience</strong></p>
<p>NAPA's outline is a <strong>comprehensive masterpiece</strong> which I am grateful for the opportunity to offer comments...I've waited decades for this!</p>
<p>I want to thank President Obama, for keeping the promise he made in response to my Town Hall question in Scranton PA during his initial campaign. My question to him was: "What do you plan to do about the Alzheimer's epidemic?"</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</strong><br />
					Only 1% of physicians specialize in geriatrics; even fewer are experts in Alzheimer's and dementia. Less than 5% of nurse practitioners are certified as gerontological nurse practitioners. Similar statistics exist for psychiatrists who specialize in geriatrics or dementia care. We are about 13,000 geriatric physicians short now: the American Geriatrics Society estimated it will get worse: a 36,000 deficit of geriatric physicians by 2030. Is there hope?</p>
<p>The lack of Medicare reimbursement for comprehensive geriatric assessment, dementia assessments, family caregiver support, counseling and education have deterred young medical students from entering geriatrics. Geriatricians' salaries are considerably than physicians in sub-specialties. If the annual threat to cut Medicare continues, elders and Baby Boomers will suffer even further access to elder care specialists. If NAPA has any influence in this area, it is essential to have Alzheimer's experts for the dementia bubble ready to burst!</p>
<p>I, as a Gerontological Nurse Practitioner, taught family medicine residents Alzheimers and dementia care in nursing homes, assisted living facilities and on house calls between 1987-1999. Most medical students during the nineties were graduating with less than 10 hours of lectures specific to geriatrics: with no little or curriculum on Alzheimer's, dementia or geriatric pharmacology. Geriatric rotations were not common in many primary care residencies at that time. Even today, primary care provider attendance is lacking at continuing education programs on Alzheimer's disease. I suggest that NAPA offers funding for Alzheimer's CE programs to be offered by geriatric educators. I recommend at least four hours of annual mandatory CE for practicing physicians and other primary care providers on the following topics:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Geriatric Prescribing</strong>: This should include emphasis on the <em>Beers List of potentially inappropriate medications in elders</em>. Adverse drug events affect elders more than any other age group. Persons with Alzheimer's disease are at even greater risk for delirium due to their low levels of brain acetylcholine. There are over 6 million elders on one or more potentially inappropriate medications for elders. Adverse drug reactions in seniors are a leading cause of ER visits and hospitalizations; hence further driving up US health care costs. <em>Many providers remain uneducated re the Beers list</em>. This has been confirmed by many nurses who participated in my 600+ seminars in over 40 states).</li>
<li><strong>Alzheimer's Disease (Late Onset and Early Onset) Vascular Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia, Parkinson's Dementia, and Frontotemporal Dementia</strong>: Primary health care providers need to be comfortable diagnosing and differentiating the major types of dementia, performing a dementia workup and treating Alzheimer's Disease/dementias using clinical guidelines. There are simply not enough dementia specialists for PCP's to refer to. The waiting times for families to see a dementia expert are much too long!</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia</strong>: All prescribers treating elders need to fully understand the risks of antipsychotic therapy, paradoxical effects of benzodiazepines in frail elders, and the non-pharmacological approaches to dementia behaviors. Providers should become familiar with the evidence-based research on these topics. This will enable them to help patients and their families learn the benefits of antidementia medications and the risks of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines in elders.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce </strong><br />
					With a rate of 50% turnover of nursing assistants and direct care staff in states like my own (PA), we need to make LTC a setting where staff remain, ensuring continuity for resident care. Direct care workers are at risk of physical injury and disability. Administrators face rising workman's compensation costs when behaviors of dementia re not optimally treated. Staffing issues, poor retention, burnout and lack of dementia education contribute.</p>
<p>I request that national dementia experts who are entrepreneurs have opportunities to partner in business with governments and state agencies in educating the direct care workforce. I feel that at least 50% of training should be live; to allow staff to ask questions relevant to the patients they serve. Video and online learning can be a supplement, but should we not give the best to the staff that spend the most time with Alzheimer's residents? The #1 reason they resign is because they don't feel that they are respected. Honoring their efforts with live dementia education is an excellent strategy that will save money that is being spent on training a transitory workforce.</p>
<p>Many of us have been working in the community trenches of Alzheimer's care, outside of academic or research settings for decades and want to share our wealth of knowledge and experience. I've been educating nursing assistants, nurses and interdisciplinary staff for 12 years! The National Council for Certified Dementia Practitioners offers a full-day live curriculum that could lead national certification as a CDP: Certified Dementia Practitioner.</p>
<p>Dementia education should not be limited to nursing assistants. It should be available and funded for LPNs (who run most LTC units). Dementia research changes daily to weekly, so updates need to be shared with RN's, administrators, social workers, pharmacists, physical, occupational, recreational and speech therapists, social workers, and dieticians. Only through interdisciplinary education will senior communities be on the "same page" for best practices in long-term care, assisted living, CCRC's and home and hospice care.</p>
<p>I request that dementia education businesses that have clinical experience in dementia care be included in the force to strengthen the direct care workforce.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong><br /><em>HHS will coordinate with states to develop aging workforces that are AD-capable and culturally competent.<br />
					AoA will ask states to specify strategies to improve the AD-capability of the workforce. </em><br />
					I would request that state agencies will have grants and opportunities to partner with for-profits dementia education corporations, especially those that are reaching families currently though the power of social networking.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B: Ensure timely and accurate diagnosis</strong><br />
					I have been diagnosing Alzheimer's and dementia for 30 years. I still see nursing home residents, home care patients or nursing home residents who are not yet diagnosed until the moderate or late stage of Alzheimer's disease. I've met families in which loved ones were killed in auto accidents due to a driver with undiagnosed dementia, spouses who have been bankrupted by their husband's undiagnosed Alzheimer's disease. Part of the problem is family denial, apathy, fear, and helplessness. The remaining problem is that some health care providers lack knowledge of the dementia workup and evidence-based clinical guidelines for treatment. Continuing education is essential for providers: families need to be educated of the warning signs and know where to go for help.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting people with Alzheimer's disease and their families and educating the public and providers. </strong><br />
					This is HUGE. Families are starved for direction, information, support and resources. I have provided approximately 200 caregiver workshops in 40 states across the country. The lack of information on Alzheimer's disease causes family turmoil and division. I've seen cases of anger and elder abuse between family members who misinterpreted the personality changes of Alzheimer's as intentional behaviors. Many families have shared with me their frustrations with dementia care in the current health care setting. Seminars should be funded in the community, in senior centers, or in faith communities; where access is easy for stressed families and friends.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.3: Educate the public about the latest research findings</strong><br />
					Translating research on dementias to professionals and the public has been the main focus of my dementia and geriatric education businesses for the past 12 years. I would request that HHS, VA, federal agencies, ADEAR will also partner with for-profit businesses who have been sharing Alzheimer's information in their businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.1: Educate physicians and other healthcare providers about accessing long-term services and supports<br />
					Action 2.E.1: Evaluate the effectiveness of medical home models for people with AD</strong><br />
					Interdisciplinary collaboration needs to be initiated at the undergraduate level in the health sciences, including pre-med. I have taught graduate level geriatrics for 25 years. Evidence-based studies on quality of life, morbidity and mortality, functional state in elders consistently show that the interdisciplinary team approach offers better outcomes than standard medical care. Teams consistently outperform the hierarchical model of care. This should not be surprising, as Alzheimer's care and general geriatric care is functional, medical, psychological, pharmacological, social, spiritual, legal and financial. Alzheimer's care needs to be shared jointly, not "directed" by a single profession. Re the medical home concept, I would request that nurse practitioner with Alzheimer's or gerontological experience, be included as leaders in the Alzheimer's medical home model.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term services and supports system</strong><br />
					I would request that Medicare reimbursement codes be established for comprehensive caregiver assessments and that providers can choose the caregiver assessment instrument that works best for them; rather than be directed by a 3rd party. Suggested instruments are the The Zarit Burden Interview or the Modified Caregiver Strain Index (CSI). Reimbursement should be allowed for both initial diagnosis and counseling as well as ongoing caregiver assessment and support.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease</strong><br />
					I feel that for-profit Alzheimer's/dementia education corporations, non-profit dementia educators; Alzheimer's Association chapters should have the ability and financial incentives to educate attorneys. My opinion is that only attorneys who are CELAs (Certified Elder Law Attorneys) should be able to title themselves as elder care experts. There is a national examination and certification for other attorneys who are committed to the senior population who desire this certification.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong><br />
					I have prescribed medications in LTC units over three decades. Over the past 20 years, OBRA had some impact on dementia antipsychotic use in nursing homes, but not as much as was hoped for. Despite a nearly doubled risk of mortality (1.7x) due to stroke, pneumonia, cardiovascular disease, antipsychotics are still routinely prescribed for behaviors related to dementia. Many prescribers are not aware that antipsychotic effectiveness for dementia was less than 20% effective in the CATIE study. Several studies revealed that staff dementia education was more effective than antipsychotic treatment for dementia behaviors. Funding should be available to educate prescribers regarding risks of antipsychotics for dementia. 88% of reimbursement claims submitted to Medicare for antipsychotic drugs prescribed for nursing home residents during a six-month review period (January to June 2007) were for residents diagnosed with dementia! So I applaud the recent work of Dan Levinson and the Office of Inspector General to reduce antipsychotic use for behaviors in dementia.</p>
<p>Please contact me if my 30 years in the "dementia trenches" will be of assistance to your remarkable action plan.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Arts and Aging Research</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting the public to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." As a pioneer in Art and Aging programming and recipient of the 2012 MetLife Foundation Creativity and Aging in America Leadership award in the category of Community, the Alzheimer's Poetry Project welcomes the opportunity to provide recommendations for your consideration.</p>
<p>We believe that the five goals outlined in the plan which form the foundation of the National Plan is well formulated and seeks to offer a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. In comparing the National Plan to the most recent work of the three Sub-Committees, we felt the need to underscore a role for arts and aging research.</p>
<p>While our ultimate goal is a world without Alzheimer's, we recognize those living with the disease today and tomorrow will require the best possible care we can offer. We are concerned that the ultimate research agenda will be too narrow in scope and leave research relative to care practices as a back-burner issue, instead of integrated as a significant component.</p>
<p>Among the areas in NAPA that arts programming could be especially effective include educating family and the public about the disease and under lessening the stigma of the disease. A number of arts groups including the Alzheimer's Poetry Project have this effect when we hold workshops for family members and students. Our public arts events such as "Alzheimer's Poetry Day" held at among other locations, the National Hispanic Cultural Center held in Albuquerque, New Mexico on November 5th 2011 in English and Spanish is one such example.</p>
<p>A few arts programs serving people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia and their families, that have extensive experience in helping to educate caregivers and in demonstrating the role that creativity can play in the health of people navigating memory loss, that have show promise in research studies include:</p>
<ul><li>"Meet Me at MoMA," The Museum of Modern Arts dementia program.</li>
<li>"Time Slips," a Storytelling project with people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</li>
<li>SONGWRITING WORKS., which engages elders, older adults and families in hands- on songwriting and performance using an internationally recognized method proven to restore health and community.</li>
<li>"The Dancing Heart," Kairos Dance, which vitally engages those with mid-to-late stage Alzheimer's, in a weekly dance and storytelling playshop that has shown to positively improve the health of participants.</li>
</ul><p>One agency missing from the list of participating inter-agency departments and government agencies tasked to help support the development of the national plan is the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). Recently, this agency partnered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in creating the white paper "The Arts and Human Development: Learning across the Lifespan," which frames a national research agenda for the arts, health and well-being. We recommend that the NEA have an opportunity to weigh in and support efforts in creating NAPA.</p>
<p>In the NEA, "Creativity and Aging Study The Impact of Professionally Conducted Cultural Programs on Older Adults," 2006 they write, "...In conclusion, these results point to powerful positive intervention effects of these community-based art programs run by professional artists. They point to true health promotion and disease prevention effects."</p>
<p>In addition, we would like to bring to your attention to two among many studies that show the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in improving the health and quality of life for people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia including: "Singing while caring for persons with dementia<sup>1</sup>," and "Using poetry to improve the quality of life and care for people with dementia.<sup>2</sup>"</p>
<p>We must ask our selves what immediate help can we provide to people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and how can we help them to continue to actively participate in the life of a community. Arts based dementia programming offers a chance to improve the quality of life of people living with dementia and their caregivers today. Thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts and recommendations.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for signing NAPA and putting creation of our first National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease on the fast track.</p>
<p>I preface my comments with brief personal history.</p>
<p>I joined the national Alzheimer's Association early in 1980, co-founded both the Chicago and Detroit area chapters as I moved around the country, joined the National Board of Directors circa 1981 and rose to become a national Vice Chair and Chair of the Public Policy Committee. In 1984 I co-founded the Alzheimer's Disease International. I am also proud to have single-handedly suggested the idea of what became the federally funded program to states to create innovative Alzheimer's programs with special emphasis on serving minority populations. While Chair of the Public Policy Committee for the national Alzheimer's Association I was also successful in getting our board to hire full time professional public policy staff, create our annual spring "Public Policy Forum" to bring our citizen advocates to Washington DC to be educated and meet with their Congressional representatives. We also developed our first coalition efforts, e.g. with the then Long Term Care campaign, and the National Citizen's Coalition for Nursing Home Reform and helped support the nursing home reform bill that became law (OBRA 1987). We also held our first meetings with members of the CBO and Medicare/Medicaid administration officials to examine what information was needed to start developing a plan for how to meet the service and funding needs of people with dementia and their families. Later, in the 1990's while at Wellesley Centers for Women we looked at the scary prospects of the diminished numbers of people available (the baby bust era e.g. my children's birth cohort) to serve as care partners to those baby boomers who would be developing Alzheimer's and other brain/body diseases in 2040-2050. I then was asked to join Boston University's NIH funded Alzheimer's Disease Center and Department of Neurology to continue my clinical intervention studies; I currently have a small phase I trial of nutritional supplements underway, funded by the U.S. Alzheimer's Association.</p>
<p>My work over the past 30 plus years on behalf of Alzheimer's disease and now the broader field of brain health, is all inspired by my mother Frances Fink Emerson who developed Alzheimer's disease in her early 50's, lived 25 years and died in 1990 with no ability for willed action or movement of any sort, and a brain shrunk to half its original size. She received great care both at home -9 years-and in a nursing home -- 16 years- (and thus lived a long time despite her disabilities....no other health issues) in an era when we knew only a fraction of what we know now, thanks primarily to the work of the Alzheimer's Association, and research funding by NIH, Alzheimer's Association and WHO and other organizations and caring people around the world.</p>
<p>Today I am an Alzheimer's researcher connected with Boston University School of Medicine, actively serve on my local chapter board (Alz. Assn of Massachusetts and New Hampshire) as member of the Medical Scientific Advisory Committee, serve as a Board Member Emeritus of the national Alzheimer's Association (an inactive role), and actively attend and present scientific papers or posters at the Alzheimer's Disease International. I also have a small business that brings evidence-based knowledge about brain healthy lifestyles to organizations and individuals and families. My centerpiece is the evidence-based Memory Preservation Nutrition program, which I am proud to be bringing to 6 Boston area Assisted Living communities to help them improve the healthfulness of the foods their residents are served and eating. I am also a popular speaker, mainly on the topic of "Healthy Eating for a Healthy Brain and Body." And was featured as part of a Medical Journal TV news report on Boston Channel 5's Chronicle on March 20, 2012 and November 18, 2011.</p>
<p>I am excited by the breadth and content of the draft national Alzheimer's plan and want to make just a few pointed comments about moving forward. I am also attaching a couple documents that might be of interest in summarizing some of the recent work related to brain healthy lifestyles and reducing risk of Alzheimer's and other brain diseases. Here also is the direct link to the article I wrote for Sage Encyclopedia 'Alzheimer's Disease: Encyclopedia of Lifestyle Medicine and Health' See it at: <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=6kqwthjab.0.ptfnnijab.rplxpbdab.1&amp;ts=S0737&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sage-ereference.com%2Fview%2Flifestylemedicinehealth%2Fn18.xml%3Fp%3DemailAIi5pJ5vQDTvY%26d%3D%2Flifestylemedicinehealth%2Fn18.xml">http://www.sage-ereference.com/abstract/lifestylemedicinehealth/n18.xml</a></p>
<p>First, I am gratified that the draft plan calls for research and program development in the realm of healthy lifestyles, not just innovations in the realm of pharmaceutical and medical research, which of course is needed as we would all like to find the magic bullet(s) to prevent and cure this disease. But given the complexity of this mysterious disease and the delicacy and intricacy of the brain, such magic bullets may not exist. Alzheimer's may be as challenging to reduce risk as has been heart disease, stroke and diabetes, since they are all interrelated in ways we are still seeking to understand. Thus major public health initiatives based on evidence uncovered in the fields of nutrition, physical exercise, sleep, stress reduction and much more may be what works to help our society avoid the catastrophe of doubling, then quadrupling the numbers of Americans with Alzheimer's disease as the numbers of people who could serve as care partners and paid professional providers shrinks in relative numbers.</p>
<p>Second, as an active member of the international Alzheimer's research and practice communities I strongly urge that the HHS Administrative offices charged with designing, refining and implementing the plan be in close liaison with international efforts to combat Alzheimer's disease. People in the US are often very parochial and have no idea of the great strides being made elsewhere. Also, because our healthcare system is presently dominated by for-profit organizations and pharmaceutical companies, it is harder for us to see clearly public health priorities that might be the best use of resources. The international community faces graver restraints in resources but at the same time has the power of being able to find collective solutions that benefit the most people. For instance at our most recent conference of ADI, held in London, the closing debate was whether enough evidence now exists to mount a major public health initiative targeting improvements in healthy lifestyles for middle-aged adults....vs. an even broader public health initiative to improve the health and wellbeing, especially nutrition, of babies and pregnant women and through that route decrease the numbers of future adults with brain diseases. Meanwhile we are all gearing up to try to be ready to serve the millions of adults who already have Alzheimer's, who will develop it if we don't find a way to slow down the progression and delay the age of onset.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's Disease International's small but very competent staff (Mark Wortman is the CEO, based at the UK Alzheimer's offices in London) and with several groups of collaborative research groups who are keyed in on finding practical solutions to this world wide crisis we are all facing together.</p>
<p>One of these research groups is called "10-66" which receives both NIH and WHO funding to conduct important cross-cultural studies in the developing world to establish true and comparable prevalence/incidence rates of both Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, has conducted international clinical trials of caregiver interventions to determine usefulness and costs in a variety of different countries and financial settings, and is now looking at some broader public policy and public health issues. Their annual reports can be found on the ADI website:</p>
<p>In addition, there is a collaborative effort of several country based large research projects examining whether certain lifestyle interventions could help reduce the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, or delay the age of initial symptoms. Each initiative has different founding sources and different specific research objectives and methods, but by combining and collaborating they hope to increase the robustness of their findings. One of the three studies is taking place in Finland, led by Miia Kivipelto with major funding from Finland's Health Department, and some additional funding from the U.S. Alzheimer's Association and perhaps other sources as well. I touch on that study in one of the two papers I have attached to this email.</p>
<p>Another perspective that was discussed at this last London meeting was, how best to proceed in planning CARE in the depressing scenario that we can't prevent most of the cases of Alzheimer's. What public policy is best. One that is disease specific, or that is based on disabilities, across diseases and health conditions. This was very interesting to me arising among a group of people who has fought hard for over 25 years to get their home countries to give proper recognition to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and to develop national plans. But once one has raised awareness, achieved sufficient specific research dollars and developed specific care programs, then one is freer to look at the broader public policy perspectives and see what is the best use of resources for a country, and what is most likely to be politicall feasible.</p>
<p>As you could gather from my resume, I stand ready to volunteer my time and attention to helping you in your efforts should you see a way I could be helpful.</p>
<p>In the meantime I applaud all the work you are doing and say THANK YOU. You all are fulfilling a dream I've held since the 1980's of a true national effort to combat Alzheimer's disease, both through research, public health and programmatic efforts at the local, state and federal levels.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Disease &amp; Lifestyle</strong></p>
<p><strong>Entry Citation: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Lombardo, Nancy B. Emerson. "Alzheimer's Disease." <em>Encyclopedia of Lifestyle Medicine and Health</em>. Ed. James M. Rippe, MD. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2012. 120-42. <em>SAGE Reference Online</em>. Web. 29 Feb. 2012. 6000 words on-line accessed 2 29 2012 </strong></p>
<p>This entry (a) describes the evolving definition of <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> disease (AD) and its prevalence; (b) summarizes evidence for nutrition, physical exercise, and other healthy lifestyle interventions that may delay onset, prevent occurrence, or slow the progression of AD and other dementias and maintain the emotional and physical health of both the person with dementia and his or her care partners; (c) identifies key lifestyle strategies for preserving brain health--both cognitive and emotional--and how they may be related to body health strategies; and (d) highlights some clinical trial results and introduces a groundbreaking multi-domain study under way in Finland and the body of evidence leading to this seminal trial.</p>
<p>Readers may take away confirmation of the importance of some of the things they are already doing and gain ideas and motivation to adopt brain-healthy nutrition and lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>Prevalence </strong></p>
<p><em>The World Alzheimer Report 2010: The Global Economic Impact of Dementia</em>, published by <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Disease International, reported that around 0.5% of the world's total population live with dementia, predominantly AD, and that the total estimated worldwide costs of dementia were US$604 billion in 2010, equivalent to around 1% of the world's gross domestic product. The <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association reports that there are nearly 15 million caregivers for <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> and dementia patients in the United States. AD is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the one growing most rapidly (by 50% from 2000 to 2007). The growth rate of this epidemic is expected to further accelerate with the aging of the baby boomer generation, increasing personal costs to families, which provide the bulk of care, and rapidly escalating economic costs from $172 billion today to more than $1 trillion by 2050. The U.S. National <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Project Act was enacted into law in January 2011 to create a coordinated national strategy to address this national public health emergency with widespread social and economic consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of AD and Diagnostic Criteria </strong></p>
<p>AD is the most common form of dementia, causing multiple impairments in thinking and cognition, including planning and organization (executive function), attention, short-term episodic memory (especially the recording of events and experiences), and sometimes visual-spatial function. The pathological hallmarks of AD are extracellular plaques composed of a protein called beta-amyloid (also called "A-beta") and the intracellular accumulations of neurofibrillary tangles, the insoluble paired helical filaments of an abnormally phosphorylated tau protein, and a cytoskeletal protein critical to the brain cell structure. Studies suggest that the soluble forms of A-beta, not the more visible plaques, are the toxic form. The normal function of A-beta is to kill microbes, as part of the innate immune system. It is the large amount of A-beta present in AD that is abnormal. Moreover, plaques and tangles appear to be late-stage developments and may or may not reflect the initiating biological sequelae, which may include injury, inflammation, disruptions of cell signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and disruptions in glucose and/or lipid metabolic processes.</p>
<p><strong>New Criteria for Diagnosing and Redefining AD </strong></p>
<p>National Institutes of Health/<strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association working groups in 2010-2011 updated the criteria for diagnosing <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia, added criteria for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to underlying <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology, and set the framework for identifying and testing biomarkers that in the near future could be used to diagnose "preclinical AD." Thus, the definition of AD has expanded beyond dementia and cognitive impairment to include a presymptomatic stage of the disease.</p>
<p>Biomarkers may improve the accuracy of diagnoses of both <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia and MCI due to <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology during life and serve as clinical trial end points. Prominent among the new biomarkers are neuroimaging (e.g., of A-beta levels, glucose processing, and the size and shape of brain structures) and measuring the presence of A-beta and tau in cerebrospinal fluid. These criteria will replace those established in 1984 as the "NINCDS-ADRDA" criteria. These criteria, developed by the National Institute of Neurological Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA), were universally adopted and have been in use, without modification, for more than 25 years. One of the challenges of prevention and treatment trials, both with preclinical AD and in MCI, is the inadequacy of cognitive tests to catch early changes reliably. The emergence of other outcome markers, namely brain imaging, and other biomarkers, is revolutionizing the field.</p>
<p>Scientists participating in the work groups formulating the new guidelines note that the updates were urgently needed for establishing the next generation of clinical trials for possible pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions. In medical practice, the proposed changes represent refinements of existing criteria for the diagnosis of <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia. The guidelines suggest, for example, that physicians recognize that complaints of loss of memory may not always be the first or most prominent presenting symptom. A decline in other aspects of cognition (e.g., word finding, vision/spatial issues, and impaired reasoning, judgment, and problem solving) may be the first presenting or the most prominent symptoms. Many research scientists in the field are concerned that current biomarker criteria give too much emphasis to A-beta and tau (especially A-beta) and too little to the role that oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular pathology, white matter, and other lesions or injuries may play in cognitive decline, in clinical symptoms of dementia, and in the development of abnormal levels of A-beta and tau. Ignoring a large body of evidence could hinder identifying proper treatments and preventive interventions, particularly lifestyle interventions. It is also important to guard against reductionist AD theories because what is now called "<strong>Alzheimer's</strong> disease" may be one or more multifactorial disorders and thus may require "multitherapies."</p>
<p>The evolving understanding of AD includes the recognition that individuals with a diagnoses of AD and MCI can still learn new information and acquire new habits, using a variety of preserved functions such as other forms of memory (e.g., visual, emotional, procedural). In addition, it is important to realize that while people with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> may have lost many brain cells and synapses, they still retain many healthy brain cells, so it is important to work with them to maintain brain health in the hope of slowing progression, maintaining positive emotion, and improving quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Causes or Etiology of AD as Related to Lifestyle </strong></p>
<p>The exact causes and etiology of AD are still not fully known. As of 2011, there are still no methods of perfect diagnosis during life or ways to cure or completely prevent AD. Age remains the biggest risk factor for AD, with (lower) education levels the only other consistent risk factor across all ethnic groups. However, much has been learned in the past 30 years, lifestyles are at the heart of this new knowledge.</p>
<p>Research now recognizes AD as a complex chronic disease with many environmental and genetic factors, whose pathology may begin to accumulate 10 to 30 or more years before the appearance of noticeable clinical symptoms. With such a long prodromal stage, preventive interventions are needed that can be safely used for decades. While a few families have an autosomnal dominant form of AD, most individuals have what is called the "sporadic" form, without clear genetic patterns. The <em>APOE4</em> type of allele confers a dose-related risk for persons of European origin but not typically for those of African origin. While other risk-conferring genes have been identified, most scientists have found that environmental factors are probably at least as important as genetic ones. Recognition of the importance of lifestyle flows directly from the multiple studies that have shown that brain and cognitive health is dramatically affected by the rest of the body, especially the cardiovascular, glucose metabolism, and cell energy systems.</p>
<p>Observational and prospective studies have confirmed this logical relationship and spawned numerous animal studies to explore the relationships between particular lifestyle factors, cognition, and the mechanisms of action. For instance, physical exercise as well as many nutrients and food substances with anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory properties have proven to lower the amount of A-beta in animal models and also lower inflammation. Some nutrients also improve neuronal cell signaling, lipid metabolism, and glucose metabolism and/or decrease oxidative stress.</p>
<p>This sort of evidence, together with numerous observational studies with a variety of human populations in different countries, has established that appropriate nutrition and physical activity are good candidates for helping reduce the risk of dementia, cognitive decline, and AD in humans. In 2010, gold-standard randomized clinical trials for integrated evidence-based nutrition programs had not yet been undertaken, and those for various forms of exercise had just begun. These kinds of lifestyle interventions are very difficult to get funded and then carry out, so scientists cannot yet say with certainty that the various lifestyles indicated by an array of other studies will be sufficient to delay the onset of cognitive symptoms or slow progression. However, scientists have already proven with certainty the link between nutrition, physical exercise, and certain other lifestyle factors to prevent, slow, or even reverse other related chronic diseases such as stroke, other cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and insulin resistance. Therefore, most researchers and clinicians are ready to recommend lifestyle approaches as these offer probable additional benefits to cognitive health. Lifestyle interventions are also of keen interest since, given the multiple decades of presymptomatic development of AD-related pathology, preventive interventions need to be safe and tolerable.</p>
<p>A growing body of research suggests that a variety of nutritional factors, social engagement, mental stimulation, physical exercise, complex activities incorporating multiple domains, and management of stress and depression all help preserve brain health. Managing both emotional and physical stress is important because heightened cortisol levels have been connected to cognitive decline as well as to faster rates of decline in persons with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia. Moreover, research reports an association between cortisol levels, hippocampal shrinkage, and insulin resistance. Adequate sleep is also essential for a healthy brain, neuroplasticity, and memory. Music, art, acupuncture, T'ai Chi, meditation, and certain other spiritual practices, as well as having a meaning and purpose in life, also appear to enhance brain health. Many of these lifestyle factors are related to neuronal plasticity and the generation of new brain cells as well as prevention of deterioration of existing brain cells.</p>
<p>Research indicates some common factors for both cognitive and emotional health. Intervention studies indicate the independent and synergistic efficacy of nutrition, cognitive rehabilitation, physical exercise, and various alternative medicine practices in improving cognition, mood, and quality of life of persons who already live with AD or other memory or brain disorders. The challenge is in actually making behavioral changes to adopt these protective lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>Why Lifestyle Factors Are Important to Brain Health </strong></p>
<p>Epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of AD doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 (with 13% of individuals over the age of 65 having AD and about 40% over 85 years having AD). If lifestyle interventions can delay the onset of AD by 5 years, the prevalence of the disease would be halved, along with all the attendant human and financial costs.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that healthy brain tissue is better able to withstand the ravages of age, genetic vulnerabilities, environmental stresses, accidents, toxins, and disease. Further, healthy lifestyles help enhance and strengthen neurons, dendrites, and other body and brain cells.</p>
<p>Many studies, including gold-standard clinical trials in the case of many other chronic diseases, have suggested that a healthy lifestyle, especially with regard to nutrition and exercise, may help prevent and treat most human chronic diseases. Thus, healthy lifestyles are helpful to both the person with dementia and his or her care partners, who are at extra risk of depression and illness because of caregiving.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular health and normal glucose metabolism contribute to brain health, while the rise in obesity and other chronic illnesses has a direct negative impact on brain health. Dozens of studies have established that each vascular risk factor adds to the risk for AD and severity of dementia.</p>
<p>Diabetes and prediabetes increase the risk of cognitive decline, MCI and dementia, and, according to some scientists, AD in particular. Studies using imaging techniques in adults and teenagers show that diabetes, prediabetes, or abnormally high insulin resistance as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) shrinks the hippocampus, the major site for short-term memory and spatial memory, encoding of new information and experiences, as well as some aspects of emotional function. These findings should raise serious public health concerns because study results show that the hippocampi are already shrinking in obese teenagers with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as in middle-aged nondiabetic adults with insulin resistance. Cognitive impairments in nondiabetic adults were found to be associated with the degree of insulin resistance. Related memory impairments and related white-matter changes were observed in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels were reduced in adults with insulin resistance.</p>
<p>Inflammation is believed to play a key role in the etiology of AD and has been associated with an increased risk of AD. Existing inflammation, as well as inflammatory events such as infections, surgery, or heart attacks, hastens progression in people with AD. Oxidative stress also plays a key role in AD etiology, including increasing inflammation and oxidation of brain lipids. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction is part of AD etiology and relates to the energy systems within the brain cells.</p>
<p>In summary, whatever hurts the heart and blood vessels harms the brain. Problems with glucose metabolism and insulin levels also threaten the brain. The organ and disease silos are disintegrating, with increasingly similar clinical recommendations for better nutrition and exercise and for managing stress to treat or prevent a wide range of chronic diseases affecting nearly every organ in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Lifestyle Approaches for Cognitive Health </strong></p>
<p>Many leaders in the field of brain health believe that the evidence is already sufficient to suggest that regardless of personal risk factors, and with or without pharmacologic intervention, a healthful lifestyle is likely to reduce risk, delay onset, and slow the progression of AD and vascular dementia. Some of these researchers and clinicians conclude that the evidence suggests that it is the combination of vascular lesions (e.g., microstrokes or white-matter lesions) with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology that together result in symptoms of MCI and dementia. If these hypotheses are correct, then they offer another argument in favor of practicing healthy lifestyles to reduce cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Nutrition, physical exercise, and other lifestyle interventions work on multiple pathways to improve overall health in multiple organs with minimal or no side effects, even over many decades, which is important since scientists now believe that the pathology of AD--that is, the development of excess A-beta and abnormal phosphorylated tau--begins several decades before the appearance of cognitive symptoms.</p>
<p>Multiple lifestyle factors can have synergistic or additive effects. One of the most interesting trials involved the 2-year study of aged beagle dogs conducted by Carl Cotman's group at the University of California, Irvine, which showed that an enriched diet alone improved performance on a cognitive task from 25% in the control group to 67% of the experimental animals. A third group, with increased physical activity and social play, improved performance to 80%, while combining enriched diet and exercise-play interventions resulted in 100% of a fourth group of dogs being able to perform the difficult learning task.</p>
<p>Given the well-established connection between cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and diabetes and cognitive function and cognitive decline, and the evidence-based certainty that good nutrition, physical activity, and certain other lifestyle changes help treat or prevent these diseases, more and more people in the AD field have concluded that it is good clinical practice to recommend these healthy lifestyles to persons concerned about their brain health or who already have a diagnosis of MCI or dementia, including AD.</p>
<p><strong>Multidomain Lifestyle Study Under Way in Finland </strong></p>
<p>Many people in the field agree that the preventive intervention most likely to be effective will be multifaceted to be potent enough to delay the onset of AD or slow it down. There is one such multicenter randomized clinical trial under way in Finland, called the <strong>Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability</strong> (FINGER) Trial, under the leadership of Miia Kivipelto and funded by the Finnish government, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the national <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01041989). Persons between 60 and 77 years of age who are determined to be at increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia are randomized to a control group (standard health counseling at baseline) or to a preventive intervention for 2 years. The latter receive multidisciplinary treatment that includes nutritional guidance, physical exercise, cognitive training and social activity, and intensive monitoring and management of metabolic (e.g., diabetes) and vascular risk factors. Importantly, each intervention includes a coach to guide and encourage the implementation of each lifestyle change. In addition to cognitive end points, a variety of potential biomarkers are monitored in relationship to any cognitive change, including biochemical markers of inflammation or oxidation, hormones controlling blood sugars and fats, as well as brain imaging.</p>
<p>Dr. Kivipelto's study reflects the combined wisdom of many leaders in the field, including the International Academy of Nutrition and Aging. The FINGER study builds on more than a decade of research, suggesting the importance of each domain of this combined program. The collective findings of some of these studies are summarized in the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Selected Findings of Lifestyle Studies </strong></p>
<p>Observational studies have established that each of the following lifestyle behaviors may be independently related to a lower risk of dementia: (a) nutrition, (b) physical fitness, (c) social activities and social engagement, (d) organization memberships, (e) productive (meaningful) activities, (f) mental activities (e.g., reading, word spelling/recognition, numbers, and other games), and (g) management of stress. Several researchers, using meta-analyses, have concluded that the most potent activities are complex activities that involve multiple domains, especially activities that include physical activity and social interaction as well as cognitive challenge, such as dancing and golf. Examples of activities involving 2 domains are board or card games, knitting, gardening, T'ai Chi, chi gong or yoga, and doing exercise in a group. Complex and novel activities such as learning a new language, especially sign language, traveling to new places, and playing a musical instrument, especially a new one, are also particularly recommended.</p>
<p>A 2010 Institute of Medicine Consensus conference and a Cochrane review of certain lifestyle interventions for preserving cognitive health concluded that there was insufficient evidence on which to base clinical recommendations. The Cochrane reviews and the Institute of Medicine, however, used very strict criteria for acceptable clinical trials, and for physical exercise, they reviewed only a few clinical trials of very small size or pilot in nature, which were underpowered. Both panels tended to be overly conservative and looking backward rather than forward in a brand new research field where rigorous clinical trials were just beginning to be designed, funded, and reviewed and where, logically, these interventions might have their biggest impact in the preclinical or MCI stage of AD, where outcome measures are still under development. Most reviews also do not integrate the combined weight of observational studies with clinical trials in animal models of AD, which are the first phase of testing some of the factors observed in human longitudinal studies and of researching mechanisms of action. Nutritional trials, especially those with integrated complex nutritional programs, are difficult to design and gain adherence to, and physical exercise programs to some extent suffer the same challenges. Published randomized controlled trials in the nutrition field as of 2011 were limited to single substances or small groups of vitamins.</p>
<p>Nonetheless the body of evidence is growing rapidly.</p>
<p><em><strong>Nutrition </strong></em></p>
<p>One well-structured prospective study published in 2010 found that persons with the highest levels of all 8 forms of vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols) had half the risk of AD, whereas previous studies and intervention trials, less knowledgeable about the necessity of all forms of vitamin E in the brain and body, had looked at only <em>a</em>-tocopherol. This Karolinska Institutet (Sweden) study concluded that it was the combination of the 8 vitamin E forms that was important to brain health.</p>
<p>Various nutritional studies using animal models have shown the power of various single nutrients to lower A-beta levels, reduce oxidative stress, and improve cognitive function. Clinical trials of persons with MCI or AD have been few in number and show mixed results but some limited promise. A Swedish clinical trial of fish oil capsules using a daily dose of 1.7 mg of docosahexaenoic acid and 0.6 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (2 long-chain omega-3 fatty acids abundant in the human brain) reported preliminary results suggesting a slowing of cognitive decline in persons with early-stage AD. A larger trial of just algae-derived docosahexaenoic acid had no effect across all AD patients. One study of 3 B vitamins (B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, and folate) had no effect in persons with AD, but another using lower doses of the same 3 B vitamins improved cognition in people with MCI, but only in those with high homocysteine levels. These results suggest that while combination dietary programs may produce stronger effects on cognition than current pharmacological treatments for AD, single nutrients may be insufficient, and nutritional interventions may have more effect in MCI and very early-stage AD. Continued clinical research is needed.</p>
<p>Of greater interest for clinical study is combining multiple nutrients since the most recent observational studies have suggested that it is combinations of whole foods, such as in the Mediterranean or DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets, that really make a difference. A 2006 integrative review presents evidence of how various nutrients appear to work on the multiple different pathways leading to AD and/or dementia, including inflammation, oxidative stress, glucose or insulin abnormalities, levels of A-beta and tau, cell signaling, and mitochondrial dysfunction. A recent animal study showed that a combination of whole foods-based nutrients, including vegetable, fruit, and herb and spice nutrients combined with fish oil, appears to restore mitochondrial dysfunction in triply transgenic AD mice, and a clinical trial is now under way in healthy older adults. A series of pilot studies with both mice and humans conducted by Thomas Shea and colleagues have shown preliminary success in improving short-term memory and attention in both cognitively normal adults and patients with AD, with a novel combination of vitamins and nutrients: namely, vitamin E, folic acid, vitamin B12, <em>N</em>-acetyl-l-cysteine, acetyl-l-carnitine hydrochloride, and <em>S</em>-adenosylmethionine. These preliminary studies suggest an important focus for continued studies in nutrition and brain health.</p>
<p><em><strong>Physical Activity </strong></em></p>
<p>Most of the meta-analyses of physical activity that had less strict criteria for study inclusion than the Cochrane reviews reported consistently positive results, backing up the observational studies that had linked physical activity to reduced incidence of AD and slower rates of conversion from MCI to AD dementia. An array of intervention studies in healthy older adults, people with MCI, and people with early AD, all found evidence of decrease in the rates of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Animal studies have established that physical activity increases cognitive function and identified at least 2 newer mechanisms of action beyond the known cardiovascular mechanisms: (1) decrease in levels of A-beta in the brain and (2) increased amount and rates of neurogenesis, especially in the hippocampus. Human studies have established that people who exercise more have higher levels of hippocampal BDNF, a brain chemical related to neurogenesis. Increased serum BDNF levels have been correlated with larger hippocampi and better memory performance.</p>
<p>Kirk I. Erickson's randomized controlled study using magnetic resonance imaging as an outcome measure established that aerobic exercise (specifically 1 year of walking 3 times a week for 40 minutes) can increase the size of critical brain structures. Consistent with the expected 1% to 2% annual hippocampal loss in dementia-free seniors, the control group (which spent an equal amount of time stretching) lost about 1.4% volume in this brain region by the end of the 12-month trial. In contrast, the hippocampi of the walkers grew by roughly 2%. In addition, researchers found that greater elevations in serum BDNF were linked to greater gains in hippocampal volume.</p>
<p>The benefit of walking exercise seemed specific to the anterior part of the hippocampus (including the dentate gyrus). Similar effects did not appear in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, or posterior hippocampus. The dentate gyrus is the most metabolically active part of our brain and is involved in spatial memory, short-term memory, and new learning. Neurogenesis is most prominent in this part of the adult brain; many surmise that it is so because creation of new brain cells and dendritic connections is essential to the production of new memories.</p>
<p><em><strong>Meditation and Spiritual Practices </strong></em></p>
<p>Stress management and spiritual practices may also contribute to brain health. For example, a recent study using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in live human participants reported that persons participating in an 8-week mindfulness meditation program experienced measurable increases in the hippocampus regions associated with memory, sense of self, and empathy while reducing areas of the amygdala associated with stress. Numerous studies demonstrate that other spiritual practices such as forgiveness improve emotional and mental health. By relieving stress and depression and decreasing cortisol levels, such practices may also improve cognitive health.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cognitive Training, Cognitive Rehabilitation, and Cognitive-Kinetic Interventions </strong></em></p>
<p>With regard to cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation strategies to improve and preserve cognition, the evidence is particularly strong. Observational studies suggested that "use it or lose it" applies to keeping one's mind active. The groundbreaking ACTIVE randomized clinical trial study demonstrated that even short-term cognitive skills practice interventions had persistent effects in the healthy elderly. A number of later studies suggest that the most effective interventions combine modalities--for example, cognitive training with physical exercise and support groups.</p>
<p><em><strong>Multifaceted Relationship Between Physical Activity and Cognition </strong></em></p>
<p>In population and clinical studies, physical activity and exercise have been shown to have a positive effect on cognitive function in people of all ages. Recent studies have found that physical exercise stimulates a positive increase in executive control processes, including planning, scheduling, working memory, inhibitory processes, and multitasking. The impact of physical activity on cognitive abilities also continues through the entire lifespan. Physical exercise, for example, has been found to be a key facilitator in neurogenesis, particularly in the hippocampus as well as in other areas of the brain. In general, the rate of neurogenesis and other cognitive benefits is related to the intensity, novelty, and dose of physical activity and exercise. Both endurance (aerobic) and strength (resistance training) exercise benefit both cognitively intact and cognitively impaired individuals.</p>
<p>With regard to improvement in individuals with MCI and AD, substantial clinical trial evidence suggests that various cognitive rehabilitation and training strategies may help restore lost function and slow progression of cognitive decline. Different strategies appear to have more or less potent effects in only one area or in multiple areas. For example, a cognitive training strategy targeting episodic memory benefited only episodic memory. A more holistic strategy that combined physical movements based on kinetic/cognitive theory with cognitive training benefitted areas of attention, spatial abilities, language, memory executive functions, and daily functions. Arkin's pioneering study, initially published in 1999, found a combination of simultaneous physical exercise and conversation, and language practice and word games, interspersed with volunteer activity, particularly effective.</p>
<p><strong>Barriers to Adopting Lifestyle Initiatives </strong></p>
<p>There are several barriers to adopting lifestyle changes, including cultural and psychological barriers. Cultural challenges include the overdependence of the American health care system, and therefore of most individuals, on pharmaceuticals and surgery, which have limited preventive roles for many chronic diseases or could be more potent if combined with lifestyle changes. Perhaps the biggest challenge for implementing these interventions as standard clinical practice is financial. Generally, lifestyle interventions are not covered by most current health insurance plans, although the concept of health promotion and prevention of illness is starting to develop. For instance, because research has established that having a "coach" or personal trainer helps individuals make lasting lifestyle changes, some private insurers will supply a free "health coach" even if the actual interventions are not reimbursed.</p>
<p>To promote brain health, prescribed cognitive training and physical activity may be the modalities most likely to be recognized with some incentives. Nutrition for brain health promotion is not currently covered, although individuals with diagnoses may find some limited coverage for counseling with licensed nutritionists. For families working together to provide a healthier home environment for both a patient with brain disease and his or her care partners, one possible source of funding is the National Family Caregiver Support program, which can be accessed online at <a href="http://www.aoa.gov/prof/aoaprog/caregiver/caregiver.asp">http://www.aoa.gov/prof/aoaprog/caregiver/caregiver.asp</a>. Individuals who have long-term care policies also may be able to gain coverage for these services. The future major solutions lie in the realm of public health, public education, public policy, and research envisioned with the 2011 passage of the National <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Project Act.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>4.2.0. Memory and Cognitive Impact of Foods</strong></p>
<p>Research is proceeding rapidly on the connection between diet, including individual nutrients, on memory and other aspects of our thinking.</p>
<p>Most of the research to date has examined how foods relate to memory and cognition. This research has consisted of either animal studies of specific foods or nutrients, or of epidemiological studies of large groups of people (which can show an association, but not prove a direct cause). These studies have explored the relationship between aspects of what we eat and the likelihood or risk of developing general cognitive problems, mild cognitive impairment (including of the amnestic type i.e. involving memory problems), any kind of dementia (i.e. problems in thinking in multiple areas serious enough to cause problems in daily life or work) or specific diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The mechanisms of action (for how specific foods might help or hurt the brain) identified to date appear to vary, and in the case of many whole foods, multiple actions could be working simultaneously (See for example, Emerson Lombardo NB et al. 2006, Sun AY et al 2008. Tian J et al 2010, Howes and Perry 2011, Williams RJ, 2011). Some ways specific foods could enhance brain health include increasing the availability of the memory neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain (apple juice, sage, Melissa, saffron) (e.g. by directly increasing production, slowing its metabolic breakdown, similar to the action of the cholinesterase inhibitors currently on the market), anti-oxidant and/or anti-inflammatory action, regulating amount of various forms of Abeta peptides, slowing or preventing oligomerization or fibrilization of the Abeta molecule (Wang 2008, Frydman-Marom, A.,2011), protecting omega-3 fatty acids in brain cell membranes or fatty acids, regulating blood sugar and insulin, and/or cholesterol, estrogenic effects that can be neuro-protective, promoting creation of new brain cells or connective parts, or slowing their destruction, improving neuronal signaling and synapse activity, restoring mitochondrial function (related to energy) of brain cells, and retarding tau pathology (the "other" problem protein in AD) (Green 2007) . This list is only partial!</p>
<p>The number of human clinical trials is still small but growing.</p>
<p>The body of evidence suggests a clear connection between foods, overall diet and our brain health, including memory and other cognitive skills such as attention and executive function (ability to organize and plan), and is growing each year.</p>
<p>This website and our brain healthy newsletters will keep you informed of this growing body of evidence.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<p>Several studies using various mouse models of Alzheimer's disease demonstrated the positive effects of a wide variety of food substances chosen for their believed health benefits such as strong anti-oxidant properties. Each food type may be comprised of thousands of nutrients. Foods tested that improved cognitive behaviors and/or lowered Abeta levels in TG mice include: apple juice, blueberries, spinach, strawberries, green tea, melatonin, DHA, plum juice, Concord grape juice, resveratrol, grape seed extract and others (Chan A et al, 2006, Rogers EJ et al.2004, Joseph JA. Et al. 1999, 2009, Lee JW, et al 2009, Mandel SA et al. 2011, Calon, F et al, 2004 and Green et al, 2007, Shukitt-Hale B et al, 2009, Shukitt-Hale B et al 2006, Lagouge, M., et al, 2006, Wang et al., 2008). Both almonds and walnuts helped Alzheimer transgenic mice perform better in cognitive tests and lowered levels of A-beta (Chauhan N et al. 2004, Muthaiyah B, et al, 2011 - no published citation for almonds- see continued work by Neelima Chauhan, PhD, of the University of Illinois-Chicago, as reported in 2005 by Society for Neuroscience. <a href="http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=news_111405">http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=news_111405</a>). An unrelated Indian study in aged rats reported almond paste reversed scopolamine-induced amnesia, reduced cholinesterase activity in the brain, and also significantly reduced cholesterol and triglycerides in these aged rats (Kulkarni KS, et al. 2010).</p>
<p>Epidemiological studies have also identified a long list of brain healthy foods. More recently, innovative studies have begun to identify GROUPS of foods that appear to reduce risk of cognitive decline and onset of dementia, MCI or Alzheimer's disease, such as foods typical of the Mediterranean diet (Féart, C et al 2009, Gu Y, et al 2009, Scarmeas N et al., 2006, 2009a, 2009b, or the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet (LINK <a href="http://dashdiet.org/dash_diet_book.asp?google&amp;gclid=CMDj8qOMsq0CFUTc4Aodvz0FlQ">http://dashdiet.org/dash_diet_book.asp?google&amp;gclid=CMDj8qOMsq0CFUTc4Aodvz0FlQ</a> ) (see unpublished study led by Heidi Wengreen, RD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Nutrition at Utah State University).</p>
<p>Combination supplement studies are also gaining interest. Professor Thomas Shea, Ph.D., Director of the Cellular Neurobiology and Neurodegeneration Research Centerat U Mass Lowell (<a href="http://www.uml.edu/research_labs/Cellular_Neurobiology/Staff.html">http://www.uml.edu/research_labs/Cellular_Neurobiology/Staff.html</a> ) is examining, first in mice and now in humans with and without memory impairments, a combination of certain B vitamins, amino acids and anti-oxidants, with some encouraging results. Another study led by Jon Valla in Arizona uses a combination of fruit and vegetable powers, anti-inflammatory spices and herbs, and fish oil, yielding some positive results in TG mice. A similar combination with the addition of vitamin D is currently undergoing a pilot Phase I clinical trial with healthy older adults at Boston University. Also, Nutricia, a subsidiary of the French Danone Company, is pursuing human clinical trials in both Europe and the US, of Souvenaid® (<a href="http://souvenaid.com/">http://souvenaid.com/</a>) a combination of neuron building substrates identified (and patented) by Dr. Richard Wurtman at MIT, together with anti-oxidant isolated vitamins (Kamphuis and Scheltens, 2010), featured at a company sponsored symposium at MIT (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fighting-alzheimers.html">http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fighting-alzheimers.html</a>). The consumer needs to be aware of the differences between medical foods such as Souvenaid, and nutritional supplements such as "Great Mind, as the rules of evidence and FDA regulations are different. The Alzheimer's Forum engaged in an excellent discussion of this topic in 2009, <a href="http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2258">http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2258</a></p>
<p>A Swedish placebo-controlled clinical trial using fish oil containing both DHA and EPA reported that fish oil appeared to slow cognitive decline only in a few persons with early stage Alzheimer's disease. In persons with mid stage disease the main positive effect was to reverse weight loss, which can be a serious problem in some people (Freund-Levi Y. et al, 2006). A larger, more recent clinical trial of just DHA derived from algae, in persons with AD, reported no significant effect on cognition; however the trial neglected to include EPA, the more highly anti-inflammatory long chain Omega 3 which, in nature, usually occurs in conjunction with DHA and which humans typically consume (and synthesize) along with DHA. Since other AD research has established that AD has an inflammatory aspect to its etiology, we believe that EPA may prove to be as important as DHA in its treatment and prevention. Also, psychiatric and attention-deficit disorders research has established that EPA rather than DHA appears to be the active long chain Omega 3 in achieving the desired treatment effect. See for example Jazayeri S, 2008 (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18247193">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18247193</a> ) and work by Andew Stoll, MD (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Omega-3-Connection-Groundbreaking-Anti-depression-Program/dp/0684871386">http://www.amazon.com/Omega-3-Connection-Groundbreaking-Anti-depression-Program/dp/0684871386</a>) and Ned Hollowell, MD. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delivered-Distraction-Getting-Attention-Disorder/dp/034544230X">http://www.amazon.com/Delivered-Distraction-Getting-Attention-Disorder/dp/034544230X</a>).</p>
<p>Cinnamon helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar, is a potent anti-oxidant (see ORAC chart...link) and is anti-inflammatory, and thus through these 4 pathways is thought to be positive for brain health. A January 2011 publication of an animal study (transgenic mice and flies) by a group of Israeli scientists suggests that cinnamon may also have a positive direct brain effect - cinnamon helps retard the development of Alzheimer's pathology by preventing the oligomerization ("clumping") of single Abeta molecules, leading to toxic forms that kill brain cells (Frydman-Marom A). To learn more, see our newsletter on the topic (Link to Cinnamon newsletter CHANGE THIS TO NEW WEBSITE POSITION <a href="http://healthcareinsights.net/home/newsletter-2011/august-2011-newsletter/">http://healthcareinsights.net/home/newsletter-2011/august-2011-newsletter/</a>). Grape seed extract also prevents or slows oligomerization and fibrilization.</p>
<p>A proof of concept RCT in 12 older adults with MCI found significant improvements in one test of memory (verbal learning) in the 6 randomized to drinking Concord Grape Juice for 12 weeks (Krikorian R et al 2010).</p>
<p>Three small pilot randomized controlled studies of three different spices/herbs in Alzheimer's patients, all led by the same medical researcher in Iran, all published in reputable peer-reviewed journals, suggested positive effects in slowing cognitive decline compared to placebo (sage and lemon balm, also known as melissa) or slowing at same rate as a current prescription drug, without the usual gastro-intestinal side effects (saffron). (See Akhondzadeh, S. et al. 2003a, 2003b, 2010)</p>
<p>Diets high in sugar and/or saturated fats appear to be harmful for the brain. A preclinical study in AD transgenic mice demonstrated that simply spiking water with 10% sugar (while offering same healthy mouse chow to two groups of identical, randomized mice) resulted in speedier cognitive decline of the mice drinking the sugared water, higher levels of Abeta in the brain, and abnormal cholesterol levels. Cao D et al. 2007, Suzanne Craft group's proof of concept randomized clinical trial in 50 older adults for just 1 month demonstrated that a high glycemic index, high saturated/high fat diet, compared to a low glycemic, low saturated fat/low fat diet, resulted in significantly worse cognitive performance (using a visual memory test), and undesirable changes in levels of Abeta in cerebral spinal fluid.

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>On behalf of the Pennsylvania Department of Aging, I am respectively submitting comments on the Draft National Plan (Plan) to Address Alzheimer's Disease. In general, I believe the Plan is well timed, comprehensive, and ambitious and our Department supports the Plan. Accomplishing the Plan goals will require collaboration with many different service systems, and the Department of Health &amp; Human Services will likely face challenges in coordinating efforts across these systems.</p>
<p>While achieving the vision of eliminating Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by 2025 is the ultimate goal, the immediate need is appropriate care for those with AD and relief for caregivers. Further, research needs to be expanded into areas that are supportive to caregiving. The Plan should also address the issues and propose solutions of excess deficits that cause unneeded anguish to both the person with dementia and their formal and information caregivers.</p>
<p>Because of the scope and complexity of needs of those with dementia, I believe it is helpful to prioritize those areas of need. First and foremost, there is a wealth of knowledge that enables clinicians to diagnose and treat persons with memory disorders. However, the greatest need is gavubg adequately trained physicians to diagnose and provide care for dementia residents. This issue isn't new; it has been known for the past 10 years. With only 7,162 trained geriatricians in the country or one geriatrician for every 2,620 residents over 75 years of age, there isn't an adequate supply of geriatricians to provide geriatric educational needs among the US medical schools.</p>
<p>There is discussion in the draft plan about the need to expand and prioritize research aimed at developing new pharmacological interventions for preventing and treating Alzheimer's Disease. There is also some mention about reducing the use of antipsychotic medications for treating the symptoms of AD in institutional settings. Both of these action items are laudable. What is missing is a recommendation to reduce the current widespread, wasteful and in some cases harmful, overuse and misuse of the cholinesterase inhibitors and related combination therapies in treating AD. Practice guidelines for cost effective and efficacious pharmacological interventions in the treatment of AD are available but not widely adhered to.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, there discussions are currently being held about the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System. Numbers of people are not now being identified; therefore a module asking respondents if someone in their home has dementia and the follow-ups would greatly help us identify the numbers outside of proper care, care-home settings, etc., that currently suffer dementias.</p>
<p>For your consideration, together with the above general recommendations, I respectively offer more specific comments. For example, although the Plan makes mention of emergency rooms, there needs to be "best practice" models that are shared with the thousands of hospital emergency rooms in the US. In addition, I propose these suggestions on specific goals, strategies, and actions:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.E</strong>: This priority deals with translating findings into medical practice and public health programs. There should be a separate action item that addresses the shortcomings in the current pharmacological treatment of AD and guidance to prescribers on how to remedy this problem.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1</strong>: This priority is not just important, it is essential if we expect to slow progress, delay onset and prevent AD. It needs to be a collaborative effort that is international in scope (Strategy 1.D) with high level commitment and energy that includes public and private resources and their networks interconnected. Money for research alone will not achieve what is needed. We need to look at past models of disease threats like tuberculosis, polio and HIV that had a grass roots demand for a cure.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3</strong>: This is also essential; we need some fast "wins" through medical research that energize the world-wide community committed to eliminating dementia illnesses. And, in addition to expanding the enrollment of all racial and ethnic populations, we need to have several drug investigations on an urgent fast-track that not only give people hope but the belief that we are doing everything possible to get these issues under control.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.3</strong>: ADEAR (Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral) needs to be a more widespread publically funded resource; there needs to be, for example, posters advertising it in post offices, libraries, and other public spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2</strong>: The lack of adequately trained providers is addressed by dedicating "6 million dollars over two years for provider education and outreach." This is a limited amount of money to fix the national issue of solving the access to care issue with competent geriatricians. Further, there needs to be expanded roles for Advance Practice Registered Nurses in geriatric care.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A</strong>: This strategy has a direct connection to PDA programs. PDA has done some work through the Long-Term Living Training Institute and Direct-Care Worker initiatives around educating and strengthening the direct care workforce to ensure workers are dementia-capable. PDA would welcome additional support in this area.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.4</strong>: PDA supports this action and sees the need for additional resources to train more direct workers in nursing homes and professionals that provide services in home and community based settings. PDA has provided funding to the Delaware Valley Alzheimer's Association to provide dementia specific training to those professionals that provide in-home care. The training is designed to improve care techniques that can be directly applied to day-to-day care in the home which can reduce the stress and burden on both professionals and family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies 2.C and 3.B</strong>: Contained in Pennsylvania's assessment for services for older adults is a 24-question assessment of caregiver status and needs. PDA would be interested to learn what other states are using and their best practices in terms of caregiver assessment instruments.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.H</strong>: PDA supports this action and sees the need for additional resources to improve care for certain populations, specifically those with intellectual disabilities. PDA currently co-chairs the Joint Committee on Aging &amp; Intellectual Disabilities (ID) with the Office of Developmental Programs. The committee was formed to improve services and supports available to older persons with ID by working together through interagency coordination and collaboration. As the number of people aging with ID continues to grow, education for both professionals and caregivers along with proper supports should be a focus and be given special consideration to ensure the proper care for this population.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.E</strong>: PDA supports this action and sees a great need for increased housing options for individuals with AD. Affordable, safe housing is a special problem during the early to middle stages of the disease for individuals who live alone and do not have informal caregivers to provide support.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies 4.A and 4.B</strong>: Public awareness campaigns and pooling/compiling resources should be organized around a single, nationally recognized association/entity related to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In conclusion, some components of the Plan have a direct connection to PDA programs, such as support of caregivers and enhancing the knowledge of direct care workers. Other components of the Plan such as methods for diagnosis, direct treatment, and research, do not have a direct connection to our programs. However, as I stated above, our Department supports the Plan and, while recognizing that there is no one quick, easy solution to dealing with such wide, complex needs, I feel my comments and suggestions are important for improving the Plan and thereby improving the lives of those with Alzheimer's Disease and their families and caregivers.</p>
<p>I thank you for the opportunity to provide input and look forward to hearing from you regarding my comments.</p>

<p>The American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) is the national professional association representing the interests of more than 140,000 occupational therapists, students of occupational therapy, and therapy assistants. The practice of occupational therapy is sciencedriven, evidence-based, and enables people of all ages to live life to its fullest by promoting health and minimizing the functional effects of illness, injury, and disability. Occupational therapy practitioners do important work with individuals who have Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their families, and AOTA appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as it works to implement the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA).</p>
<p><strong>Occupational Therapy and Alzheimer's Disease </strong></p>
<p>Five goals form the foundation of the Draft National Plan: (1) Prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025, (2) Optimize care quality and efficiency, (3) Expand supports for people with AD and their families, (4) enhance public awareness and engagement, and (5) track progress and drive improvement. AOTA sees the profession of occupational therapy as a key partner in each of these five areas. Occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants work with individuals who have AD and with their families to maximize occupational engagement, promote safety, and enhance quality of life. A variety of skilled techniques are used when working with an individual who has AD, depending on the focus of the intervention, the stage of the disease process, and the treatment setting.</p>
<p>An occupational therapist's evaluation of a person with AD begins with an occupational profile of the individual's valued occupations, roles and routines, as well as his or her current level of occupational performance. Often the caregiver is crucial in supplying this information as the person with AD may be unable to provide accurate information, or may be unaware of his or her own deficits. It is essential to identify the remaining abilities of the person with AD rather than to focus solely on what he or she can no longer do. Some examples include:</p>
<ul><li>Identifying performance patterns (i.e., habits and routines) that can be maintained which will prolong independence and assist with adjustment to new living settings such as a health care facility or a daughter's home. Practitioners also consider information stored in the patient's procedural memory, which often remains stable for the longest period of time in someone with AD. Performing well-learned basic activities of daily living (ADLs), such as combing one's hair, is an example of utilizing procedural memory. Practitioners learn what the client's hobbies and occupations are which will help with planning the intervention to stimulate patient interest and active participation.</li>
<li>Determining what type of cueing strategies the individual best responds to, and instructing staff on how and when to utilize these strategies during various activity demands. (E.g., does the patient require a one-step verbal command or does he or she need tactile cueing in addition to verbal cues? Can the client follow multi-step commands?)</li>
<li>Determining the time of the day that the person is most alert to maximize performance with activities. (E.g., if the client's typical routine pre-illness was working at night and sleeping during the daytime, then changing that routine may be challenging. The optimal time for engagement in activity may be late afternoons.)</li>
</ul><p>Other areas of consideration include accompanying conditions such as visual loss, or hearing loss. Education of the caregiver (e.g., family or facility staff or both) is a priority and expertise of occupational therapy practitioners, and the therapist should include identification of caregiver concerns about occupational performance and handling difficult behaviors as part of the evaluation. <em>See</em> attachments 1 and 2.</p>
<p>For a person in the early stage of AD, occupational therapy intervention may focus more on compensation for the loss of cognitive abilities and recognition of remaining abilities rather than on the remediation of deficit areas. This is helpful since new learning may be impaired or absent as the dementia progresses.</p>
<p>For persons in the later stages of the disease, the intervention focus may become adaptation of the environment and instruction of caregivers to promote continued occupational performance, as well as learning ways to minimize any unwanted behaviors (such as agitation, combativeness during caretaking) or complicating conditions (such as weight loss, or falls). Addressing the safety of the person with AD is paramount.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of occupational therapy intervention for someone with AD is to set up a program to promote independence, participation in the community, utilize retained abilities for as long as possible, ensure safety, and enhance quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat AD by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>In the absence of a cure, this goal seeks to develop effective prevention and treatment modalities by 2025. Toward this end, HHS proposes to convene an AD research summit with national and international scientists (Action 1.A.1) and convene a scientific workshop on other dementias in 2013 (Action 1.A.4). AOTA asks that you include occupational therapy in these events. HHS also plans to solicit public and private input on AD research priorities (Action 1.A.2) and continue clinical trials on the most promising lifestyle interventions (Action 1.B.6). In these areas, AOTA asks HHS not to neglect research on effective treatment, education, and support for caregivers and to study lifestyle interventions for caregivers</p>
<p>Outreach efforts to more effectively inform the public about research findings and results are also planned, and AOTA reminds the department to take advantage of using professional associations to educate members and providers (Action 1.E.3).</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Optimize Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>HHS recognizes that high-quality care for people with AD requires an adequate supply of qualified, culturally-competent professionals with appropriate skills and expertise. AOTA notes that the Draft Plan places the bulk of its emphasis on physician providers, when patients will be seeing many other allied health care professionals in the new health care system. It is the nonphysician practitioners, such as occupational therapists, who provide most of the support for patients with AD and certainly their caregivers. The $6 million dollar investment of the Obama Administration for provider education and outreach should include specialized training for occupational therapy, and other efforts by both the Veteran's Administration (VA) and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) should include support not only for physicians and nurses, but other qualified and licensed professionals (Strategy 2.A.2).</p>
<p>As far as dementia-specific work (Action 2.A.3; 2.D.1), occupational therapy has a proven track record in caring for patients with dementia and is working with the American Medical Association (AMA) --convened Physician's Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) to develop and manage quality measures for dementia. <em>See</em> Gitlin, L. N., Winter, L., Dennis, M. P., Hodgson, N., &amp; Hauck, W. W. (2010). A biobehavioral home-based intervention and the well-being of patients with dementia and their caregivers. <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em> 30(9), 983--991; Strzalecki, M. (2010). The dementia care difference. <em>OT Practice</em> 15(12), available: <a href="http://www.aota.org/Pubs/OTP/2010/OTP071210.aspx">http://www.aota.org/Pubs/OTP/2010/OTP071210.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>In examining improved care transitions through Medicare's Community-Based Care Transitions Program and the Aging and Disabilities Resource Center (ADRC) Evidence-Based Care Transitions Program (Action 2.F.2), AOTA reminds decision-makers that occupational therapy has an established role in discharge planning, home evaluation, safety, and caregiving training that is an asset in these areas.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with AD and their Families </strong></p>
<p>This third goal acknowledges the important role that caregivers plan in the life of a person with AD: they provide care and support, help lessen feelings of depression and stress, and help delay nursing home placements. To further support caregivers, HHS plans to partners with private organizations to review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations (Action 3.B.3). Occupational therapy should be part of these private-public partnerships.</p>
<p>HHS has also noted that medications, including anti-psychotic drugs, can be used inappropriately to manage the difficult behaviors of nursing home residents who have AD. Occupational therapy practitioners would like to be part of collaborative efforts to reduce inappropriate and off-label use of behavior modifying drugs and agents. AOTA encourages the use of occupational therapy interventions to address inappropriate behaviors without the use of pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>In order to further its goal of enhancing public understanding of AD and engagement stakeholders who can help address the challenges faced by persons with the disease and their families, HHS plans, in part, to work with state and local governments to improve coordination and identify model initiatives to advance AD awareness and readiness (Strategy 4.B). AOTA applauds plans to involve state and local governmental entities to further the National Plan, but we wish to note the importance of involving professional associations at the state level in these efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Track Progress and Drive Improvement </strong></p>
<p>Finally, HHS plans to identify the gaps in existing data and pursue roads to expand and enhance the data infrastructure in this field and to make data more easily accessible to federal agencies and researchers (Strategy 5.A). Occupational therapy practitioners are also cognizant of information gaps related to the study of AD, and will be interested to access and utilize any improvements HHS is able to make, particular in the area of new quality measures, participating in new data collection efforts, or more easily viewing improved data sets or links between data sets.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>AOTA looks forward to working with HHS to implement NAPA. AOTA's Occupational Therapy Practice Guidelines for Alzheimer's Disease are en route via U.S. mail, and additional materials about occupational therapy contributions to the field are available upon request; please do not hesitate to contact us with questions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. The Alzheimer's Association is committed to ensuring that the full potential of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) is realized, and we stand ready to support the successful implementation of the law. Founded in 1980, the Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.</p>
<p>Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and 15.2 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top 10 in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Currently, there are no survivors. Alzheimer's kills more Americans than diabetes, and more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. Individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias are high consumers of hospital, nursing home, and long-term care services. Average per person Medicare costs for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias are nearly three times higher and Medicaid spending is 19 times higher than for those without these conditions. Care for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias is estimated to cost Medicare and Medicaid $140 billion this year alone. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment. Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, Alzheimer's impact on our country will grow year by year. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the escalating cost of care will reach $1.1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). Costs to Medicare and Medicaid are estimated to increase nearly 500 percent over this period.</p>
<p>However, this does not need to be our future. If the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure through the National Alzheimer's Plan, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years (similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease) would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050.<sup>2</sup> Similarly, profound advances can be achieved through improvements to Alzheimer's care quality and effectiveness and through improved supports for individuals with Alzheimer's and their families. The challenge and the potential promise of the National Alzheimer's Plan is our opportunity to change the trajectory of this heartbreaking disease.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association is pleased the important strengths contained within the Draft Framework were preserved in this initial draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan. As was the case with the Framework, this first draft is comprehensive in scope, addressing many of the issues that are critically important to the Alzheimer's community. We do see key opportunities to further strengthen this draft plan prior to its next iteration. The Association's comments address specific areas to fortify; for instance, palliative care and transportation issues, which are particularly important for the one in seven Americans with Alzheimer's who live alone.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>In addition to the specific comments that follow, the Alzheimer's Association would like to emphasize several broader themes.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong>:<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly urges that the National Alzheimer's Plan build on the momentum of the Administration's recent, commendable action on Alzheimer's research funding by indicating in the plan the full scale and scope of research funding required to achieve the Administration's goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. To this end, we believe recent work by leading Alzheimer's researchers to be available in April 2012 will provide a very solid foundation for these projections.<sup>4</sup> As we previously noted in our comments submitted for the Draft Framework, we believe that the firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones are needed, the Department is to be commended for including a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently-needed treatment advances.</p>
<p><strong>Economic burden</strong>:<br />
					The bipartisan, unanimously passed National Alzheimer's Project Act calls for the identification of priority actions to reduce the economic impact of Alzheimer's disease on the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as on American families, while improving health outcomes. In addition to the estimated $140 billion in Medicare and Medicaid costs this year, families caring for people with this heartbreaking disease will still incur high out-of-pocket costs for care -- an estimated $33.8 billion in 2012. Given the high costs of adult day centers, assisted living facilities and nursing home care, and the duration of the disease, individuals affected by Alzheimer's will often deplete their savings and assets, and ultimately come to rely on Medicaid for assistance. Though the theme of better health outcomes is present in several places in this draft, the attention to addressing the economic burden is, in our judgment, insufficient. The distinct financial burdens of Alzheimer's disease were a pervasive theme among the more than 40,000 Americans who participated in the Alzheimer's Association public input process on the National Alzheimer's Plan last year. We urge this be directly addressed in the next draft.</p>
<p><strong>Public health</strong>:<br />
					While we applaud the draft plan's emphasis on strengthening the Aging Network to deal with the burden of Alzheimer's disease, it does little to frame Alzheimer's as a top national public health challenge and to engage the full resources of the public health community at the federal, state and local levels. In this regard, the draft can draw from an important and encouraging trend in leading states where the public health network has been actively evaluating the burden of Alzheimer's. It also can draw from important work developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assessing the public health dimensions of Alzheimer's. The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact. Complementing the strong emphasis on the Aging Network by highly engaging the CDC in the National Alzheimer's Plan will ensure Alzheimer's is addressed as a public health priority.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong>:<br />
					It would be difficult to overstate just how critical we believe Strategy 5B, "Monitor Progress on the National Plan," is to securing important outcomes in the first year of the plan's implementation. We urge this monitoring be done in a timely, transparent way to ensure accountability for both the implementation of action steps and the meaningfulness of this activity. This is important for several reasons. First, this transparency is a clear expectation of Congress as expressed in and embedded throughout the statute (P.L. 111-375). Second, this is necessary for the Advisory Council if the Council is to fulfill its obligation under the law to meaningfully report directly to Congress and to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on an annual basis. Finally, it is a fundamental expectation of the Alzheimer's community. Accountability is a precondition for the successful pursuit of all that follows throughout the plan.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments</strong><br />
					The following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and actions as outlined in the <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, research funds must increase to the Alzheimer's research community's recommendation of $2 billion in order to achieve this goal.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong></em>.<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes it is good to set and update priorities by garnering outside input. We also believe in addition to the National Institute on Aging (NIA), all Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that are funding Alzheimer's research should be an integral part of this planning process, including the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). We look forward to additional details as to how the priority setting activities will feed through to the peer review process so suitable funds are recommended for appropriate studies, and how the planning process will inform decision-making across the entire NIH and not just the NIA. We also look forward to a detailed research plan and timeline for activities soon following the May Summit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.3: Regularly update the National Plan and refine Goal 1 strategies and action items based on feedback and input</strong></em><br />
					In addition to informing the implementation of the National Alzheimer's Plan with feedback from the Alzheimer's Research Summit and the Request for Information (RFI), HHS and its federal partners should also seek input from the public and experts in the field when regularly updating the plan.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.4: Convene a scientific workshop on other dementias in 2013</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the National Alzheimer's Plan for addressing other dementias, in keeping with the intent of P.L. 111-375.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.5: Update research priorities and milestones</strong></em><br />
					The Advisory Council meeting should be held each year at a time most relevant to informing the President's annual budget for Alzheimer's research.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.1: Expand research to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, and translate this information into potential targets for intervention</strong></em><br />
					The development of effective treatments that can delay, prevent and treat Alzheimer's will require a significant investment in our basic understanding of the disease. It will be critical that basic science receive sufficient funds to ensure adequate fundamental knowledge of the disease. To make this action meaningful and effective, the plan must include additional details on how this important research will be prioritized and expanded, what networks and mechanisms will be used to expedite translation of the basic science, and what level of funding will be committed in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes that increasing enrollment in clinical trials is critical to developing new treatments and eventually overcoming Alzheimer's disease. Groundbreaking research that could have a substantial impact on individuals with the disease now and in the future is significantly slowed by a lack of volunteers for Alzheimer's clinical trials. Recruiting and retaining trial participants is now the greatest obstacle, other than funding, to developing the next generation of Alzheimer's treatments. We believe HHS can expand registries through the promotion of existing Alzheimer's disease clinical trial matching services such as the Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch service.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch is a free service that makes it easy for people with Alzheimer's, caregivers, families and physicians to locate clinical trials based on personal criteria (diagnosis, stage of disease) and location. The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch lets interested individuals search trials quickly and easily, and narrows results to those trials where there is a reasonable chance to be accepted for enrollment, saving time for both the participant and the researcher.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.4: Monitor and identify strategies to increase enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies</strong></em><br />
					Monitoring enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies should not be limited to the NIH. Tracking race and ethnicity should also be encouraged in the outreach recommended in Action 1.B.3. This tracking should also be done by the private sector.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong></em><br />
					The Association encourages greater specificity regarding the intent of this action as the norm in drug development is for clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions to be conducted by private industry. Although there is a government role in clinical development of non-proprietary interventions, we urge care be taken not to divert resources to areas already well covered by private industry at a time when research resources for Alzheimer's are stretched so thin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong></em><br />
					While there have been great strides in the use of imaging and biofluids biomarkers over the last several years, to ensure this action is successful, significant research is still needed and will require a substantial investment. This action should also require assembling and maintaining a large cohort of subjects in all stages of the disease, including preclinical.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong></em><br />
					Collaborations must include multi-disciplinary partners, including experts in clinical care, epidemiology, and public health. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be an active participant in these collaborations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.1: Inventory Alzheimer's disease research investments</strong></em><br />
					The research ontology is an important classification system that provides a framework for collective portfolio analysis and introduces opportunities for coordinated strategic planning and initiatives among partner organizations and research funders. The Association was pleased to work with the NIA on this important project and is looking forward to the possibilities of having a global view of what Alzheimer's research is being conducted.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.2: Expand international outreach to enhance collaboration</strong></em><br />
					As a global leader in Alzheimer's research, the Alzheimer's Association operates in a spirit of inclusiveness, seeking partnerships throughout the scientific community to propel the field of Alzheimer's research forward. In addition to connecting with the countries listed in the Action, connecting with established international organizations, such as Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI), would be valuable. We look forward to additional details on how the information gathered from this meeting will be turned into additional action plans and new research partnerships.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong></em><br />
					This Action should also include a review of regulatory science needs, biomarker qualification, clinical trial infrastructure barriers, new or adaptive clinical trial design and guidance on designing/approving prevention or disease-modifying trials. In addition to NIH, FDA and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), the consultation list should include private and non-profit funders of Alzheimer's research as well as the Department of Defense (DoD). A well-defined timeline for meetings and an action plan for this group should be established to ensure accountability and progress.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association encourages the Secretary of HHS, the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense to work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities. This may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.3: Educate the public about the latest research findings</strong></em><br />
					The CDC's Healthy Aging Program, specifically the Healthy Brain Initiative (HBI), is an important example of their role in educating the public about the latest research findings connected to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association appreciates the Administration's announcement that $6 million will be dedicated over two years for provider education and outreach. While the $6 million is a great first step, we urge the Administration to dedicate additional funds for this endeavor to be successful.</p>
<p>To begin work under this area, the Association recommends targeted outreach to various provider groups. We believe HHS should promote an understanding of dementia among health care providers through a variety of mechanisms including the development of guidelines and quality measures. Once these guidelines are created, the development of online training modules would be most efficient. Additionally, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so care can be evaluated. Assisted living facilities should be added to the list of settings where high-quality care should be provided.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly supports a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained to understand the complexities of dementia will help ensure individuals with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system.</p>
<p>While the Association applauds the efforts outlined in the plan, we are concerned that the education component within this strategy may be limited. Many individuals with Alzheimer's disease enter the health care system through their primary care provider. To reach this target population, we encourage the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to play a major role in educational outreach, particularly to the Medicare provider community. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed with individuals and their caregivers after a diagnosis such as managing dementia with other chronic illnesses and referrals to existing community supports and services. CMS could partner with relevant stakeholders, such as the Alzheimer's Association, to develop resources to share with providers. Providers' education should also include guidance on the appropriateness and benefits of palliative and end-of-life care services, such as hospice, for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. This effort should include how and when providers should discuss the issue with the individual and their representative.</p>
<p>We also encourage the plan to address educating physicians and other health care providers on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often providers do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing providers, a lack of training on the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delays detection of cognitive impairment and diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that state and local public health departments should be included in this action item. The public health community is very good at educating health care providers. There are a number of evidence-based interventions for educating providers in a variety of settings that can be applied to Alzheimer's disease. We encourage HHS to support the necessary infrastructure to help state and local departments offer this type of education in public health settings.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</strong></em><br />
					Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties, particularly those that care for people with dementia, should be expanded.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong></em><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the development of quality indicators. HHS should promote existing evidence-based guidelines and curricula. Where unavailable, HHS should work with relevant stakeholders who have developed evidence-based quality care guidelines, such as the <em>Alzheimer's Association's Dementia Care Practice Recommendations</em>, which incorporate the latest research and field evidence. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p>In addition, the Alzheimer's Association urges HHS to ensure that content within the proposed clearinghouse is current and easily accessible.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce</strong></em><br />
					Section 6121 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that all certified nursing aides (CNAs) that work in nursing homes receive training on care for persons with dementia. As implementation of this provision progresses, the Association urges CMS to include a mechanism that ensures any recommended education materials are fully understood and absorbed. Further, CMS should publically establish the survey guidelines that will accompany this new requirement to ensure CNAs are appropriately trained.</p>
<p>The Association would like to see the plan also recommend that all direct care workers, including those in assisted living facilities and home- and community-based settings, be required to meet a similar standard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong></em><br />
					HHS should coordinate with states to develop Alzheimer's disease coordinators and workforces in state and local public health departments that will develop and implement Alzheimer's disease strategies. Strategies may include early detection and diagnosis campaigns, provider education campaigns, surveillance work, implementation of state Alzheimer's disease plans, and other essential public health services. HHS should also work with Aging Network staff to recognize the warning signs of dementia and be trained to assist individuals and their families when they seek appropriate medical care for detection and diagnosis.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong></em><br />
					To continue connecting families and people with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease to Alzheimer's-capable resources and meet growing demand, the Administration on Aging's (AoA) National Alzheimer's Call Center will require additional funding. The National Alzheimer's Call Center provides 24-hour, 7 day a week, year-round telephone support, crisis counseling, care consultation, and information and referral services in 140 languages for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their family members and informal caregivers. Trained professional staff and master's-level mental health professionals are available at all times. Since 2003, the National Alzheimer's Call Center has served more than 2 million people in the community. Additionally, it is important to note that the Alzheimer's Disease Centers, funded by NIA, are only available to certain areas of the country. As such, we urge HHS to include a solution in the final plan to ensure areas without resources have access to assistance, such as the Call Center.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. As discussed, the ACA created the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) which includes the detection of cognitive impairment. To enhance the AWV, the Association believes the CDC should revise the model Health Risk Assessment (HRA), which is part of the AWV, to include questions about memory and other indicators of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>We also recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection in a clinical setting in addition to the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. While the draft plan refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is important to emphasize detection of cognitive impairment as the precursor to a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.C.1: Educate physicians and other healthcare providers about accessing long-term services and supports and Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes health care providers should be educated about available supports for newly-diagnosed individuals and their caregivers to provide better counsel through this difficult disease. This should include information medical and non-medical supports and services. Further, the Association believes Medicare should cover a visit in which a health care provider discusses current and future care planning, with the caregiver, with or without the beneficiary present, to ensure families receive vital information to navigate this difficult disease. The Alzheimer's Association stands ready and willing to partner with HHS to develop a list of appropriate resources to share with the provider community. In fact, our chapters are currently conducting outreach on the local level to make providers aware of the available supports in their own community.</p>
<p>As stated in the Association's <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em>, at least 800,000 individuals with Alzheimer's disease live alone and as many as half do not have an identifiable caregiver. We strongly encourage HHS to further develop assistance for this particularly vulnerable population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</em></strong><br />
					While developing dementia care guidelines and measures, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so that care can be evaluated. In addition, the guidelines should include criteria and provisions for quality palliative and end-of-life care, including hospice care.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to build on existing quality initiatives, such as the Alzheimer's Association's <em>Campaign for Quality Residential Care</em>, which takes a person-centered approach and covers the basics of good care in six areas. The Association supports the development of additional quality measures and evidence-based care guidelines, and can serve as a resource in this effort.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.E.1: Evaluate the effectiveness of medical home models for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					While the medical home model holds promise, these models of care would need to be flexible to accommodate the specific needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, as they may require additional time and services to be effective for the Alzheimer's community. Moreover, it is recommended that care coordination designed specifically for Alzheimer's disease be highlighted for evaluation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, models should focus on aspects that seem to be particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices. Due to the nature of Alzheimer's disease, coaches and telephone disease management may not be particularly effective for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					Acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners to facilitate greater safety for people with the disease.</p>
<p>While it is critical to identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's disease, there should be similar action on identifying and disseminating models of safety to be used by nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other residential care settings. Additionally, there should be similar action on this for emergency personnel and first responders.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong></em><br />
					Most notably absent from the discussion of improving care transitions is the importance of making a documented diagnosis in an individual's medical record. Further, an individual should have a list of relevant medications documented in their medical record, especially prior to any care transition. The use of electronic medical records may also facilitate the availability of this information and should be explored particularly in the context of safer care transitions for patients with dementia.</p>
<p>Some individuals have behavioral problems related to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, appropriate community mental health services should be developed to include systems that strengthen the care needs of individuals with behavioral disturbances.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.1: Review evidence on care coordination models for people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					As mentioned in Action 2.E.1, the focus of these models should include aspects of the models are particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.2: Implement and evaluate care coordination models</em></strong><br />
					Individuals with Alzheimer's disease who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid are likely to use more health care services and have less desirable outcomes without quality care coordination. For example, people with serious medical conditions and Alzheimer's or another dementia are more likely to be hospitalized than those with the same medical conditions but no Alzheimer's or dementia.</p>
<p>Initially, the evaluation of these integrated models of care should be weighted towards effective care coordination, rather than cost-savings, since individuals may have increased access to services that didn't have before. This is especially important when considering cost increases, which may occur in Medicaid services since individuals with Alzheimer's may not have had previous access to long-term care services and supports due to long waiting lists and state fiscal constraints.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.H.1: Create a taskforce to improve care for these specific populations</em></strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan must identify specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support</strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers. Often, financial barriers prevent families from accessing the support they need to provide care for their loved one. Although there are a number of strategies and actions to address support for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families, the plan does not clearly address additional funding for respite care -- whether it be in day centers or within the home.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</em></strong><br />
					As HHS considers which agencies, federal departments, and state and local networks to distribute materials, it should also consider including the CDC's Healthy Aging Program.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</em></strong><br />
					In addition to developing more services, the Alzheimer's Association believes existing services to support caregivers should be promoted, supported, and expanded. Furthermore, while this action mentions respite care, it does so only in terms of providing referrals and does not include increased funding so that families can access such services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</em></strong><br />
					HHS should look for ways to promote the National Alzheimer's Call Center and its services as a crisis resource for caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.C.1: Examine awareness of long-term care needs and barriers to planning for these needs and Action 3.C.2: Expand long-term care awareness efforts</em></strong><br />
					We encourage the plan to consider addressing all aspects of long-term care, including financial planning, driving, and safety issues. Increasing the awareness of future care planning could help individuals and their families address challenges earlier and help avoid crises later.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to examine the barriers to long-term care, which may include studying the availability and impact of long-term care insurance as people with Alzheimer's disease, particularly those with younger-onset, may face unique challenges when trying to purchase insurance.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					The education of legal professionals should be expanded to include other entities in the legal system, including law enforcement, first responders, prosecutors, and judges.</p>
<p>Broader awareness of Alzheimer's disease may help prevent or reduce arrests of individuals with Alzheimer's who are charged with crimes for which they have no intent, such as unintentional trespassing. Further, it may help legal professionals and first responders to spot abuse -- physical and non-physical -- against people with the disease. In addition, State Adult Protective Service (APS) agencies are overburdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire of circumstances. We encourage the plan to address the need for additional resources dedicated to protecting the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Finally, the plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. We hope that the plan considers guidance for legal professionals seeking to balance autonomy and individual safety.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong></em><br />
					Individuals living with dementia may experience behavioral and psychotic symptoms (BPSD) during the course of their disease due to the alterations in processing, integrating and retrieving new information that accompanies dementia. Non-pharmacologic approaches should be tried as a first-line alternative to pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of BPSD. The Association recommends training and education for both professional and family caregivers on psychosocial interventions. Further, we recommend the plan call for similar monitoring and reporting in assisted living facilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</em></strong><br />
					At least 800,000 Americans with Alzheimer's disease live alone. Compared to those with Alzheimer's who live with someone else, on average, people with Alzheimer's who live alone are more likely to live in poverty and require assistance performing tasks such as managing money, shopping, traveling, housekeeping, preparing meals and taking medications correctly. We encourage HHS to explore affordable housing models that will allow this unique population to live safely within their communities.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Action 4.A.1: Design and conduct a national education and outreach initiative</em></strong><br />
					The public awareness campaign in Action 4.A.1 must be culturally-sensitive and reach those in underserved locations.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress</strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government.</p>
<p>At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), coordinated by the CDC. Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they can adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.1: Identify major policy research needs and Action 5.A.2: Identify needed changes or additions to data</em></strong><br />
					The CDC has been a leader in incorporating measures of cognitive health into other population health monitoring efforts. The CDC Healthy Aging Program has worked on identifying databases, worked with partners to add questions on cognitive impairment and caregiving to the BRFSS and added questions on cognitive impairment to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) The CDC is currently analyzing data from these datasets as they become available. In particular, BRFSS data are unique and allow for state- and local-level data that can highlight the needs of diverse populations in the United States.</p>
<p>The CDC Healthy Aging Program developed a 10-question BRFSS module on Perceived Cognitive Impairment. Twenty-two states included the module on their state BRFSS in 2011 and an additional 16 states are including the module in 2012 for a total of 38 states, including the District of Columbia. The CDC Healthy Aging Program is working with partners, including states, to expand the module in 2013 to all 50 states. They are also producing reports and publications regarding these data to inform decision-makers about the perceived impact of cognitive impairment at the state and local levels.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.3: Make needed improvements to data</em></strong><br />
					Using data to improve and track progress is essential and we commend its inclusion in the draft plan. This critical information should be publically available, as well as to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (preclinical through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.1: Designate responsibility for action implementation</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the intent to designate responsibility for each action step. However, we urge designation of individual accountable for each action, rather than simply a "contact person."</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.2: Track plan progress</em></strong><br />
					Tracking on plan progress as described in this action step should be provided to the public on no less than a quarterly basis. In general, we urge that the reporting on progress regarding each action be paired with greater clarity and specificity regarding desired outcomes than has been provided in the draft plan.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.3: Update the National Plan annually</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association urges that updates to the plan be done with the same transparency and opportunities for comment that has characterized the formulation of this initial National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:<br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan should allow us, for the first time to answer this simple question: <em>Did we make satisfactory progress in the fight against Alzheimer's disease?</em> For too many individuals living with Alzheimer's and their families, the system has failed them, and today we are unnecessarily losing the battle against this devastating disease. A successful National Alzheimer's Plan offers us the opportunity to change that, and set a new trajectory for this rapidly expanding global epidemic through American leadership.</p>
<p>As we all know, a plan accomplishes nothing without thorough and effective implementation that is coupled with transparency and accountability for those actions. The Alzheimer's Association looks forward to a final National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, will help to build the strongest possible National Alzheimer's Plan to overcome the escalating burden of Alzheimer's disease on American families.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>The Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM), headquartered in Reston, Va., is a nonprofit scientific and professional organization that promotes the science, technology and practical application of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging. SNM strives to be a leader in unifying, advancing and optimizing molecular imaging, with the ultimate goal of improving human health. With 17,000 members worldwide, SNM represents nuclear and molecular imaging professionals, all of whom are committed to the advancement of the field. For more than 50 years, SNM members have developed--and continue to explore--innovations in medical imaging to allow for noninvasive diagnosis, management and treatment of diseases, benefiting countless patients. Members include physicians, technologists, physicists, pharmacists, scientists, and laboratory professionals.</p>
<p>Since the conception of cross-sectional imaging of the human brain in the 1960's, SNM has been a leading international organization to advance imaging methods to better investigate dementing illness and educate physicians about clinical applications. We have witnessed significant advances in brain perfusion imaging, brain metabolism imaging, and now dopamine and amyloid imaging. Molecular imaging is able to improve the diagnosis and management of neurodegenerative brain disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other dementias and movement disorders.</p>
<p>Significant advances in imaging have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease, track its progression, and monitor the effects of treatment. These advances are being leveraged by the National Institute of Aging and the public-private Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) which will help identify and monitor disease progression, even in the early stages before individuals show symptoms of the disease. Empowered with the knowledge of brain pathology, clinicians will be more likely to begin and maintain appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Despite these great technical achievements, there have been limited advances in treatment and no improvement in mortality related to Alzheimer's disease. Far too many people with Alzheimer's disease are not diagnosed until their symptoms have become severe. The standard clinical diagnostic approach, which is used to infer underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology, has less than optimal specificity and sensitivity, even in expert hands. By the time dementia is obvious, deficits often are so pervasive that the typical phenotype may be difficult to recognize.</p>
<p>Therefore, SNM strongly supports the decision of the President and the Secretary of Health of Human Services to enhance dementia care through the establishment of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. We would encourage the President and HHS Secretary to include a greater emphasis on molecular imaging in the plan. Molecular imaging is one of only a few methods that can unveil pathophysiological and pathogenic changes in living human patients. To make future breakthroughs, further investments are critical, including the investigational use of molecular imaging and the effective implementation of imaging technologies in the clinic.</p>
<p>In addition, we suggest that DHHS to consider not only supporting dementia imaging research through NIH NIA/ADNI initiative, but also more broadly investing in basic and translational research to develop new diagnostic tools and advance them to human applications through multiple NIH Institutes (e.g., NINDS, NIBIB), FDA for accelerated review, and CMS for clinical implementation.</p>
<p>Specific comments are:</p>
<ul><li>Action 1.B.5: The plan should recognize the importance of molecular imaging as a means to facilitate and accelerate pharmacological clinical trials. Molecular imaging can greatly assist in the development of new therapeutic agents at several different stages. Molecular imaging can be used to better select patients with Alzheimer's disease for clinical trials, to exclude patients with other diseases who might not benefit from the therapy, and to demonstrate the presence of the therapeutic target for anti-amyloid therapies. Properly applied in early clinical testing, imaging data can assist in making a go/no-go decision about the effectiveness of potential new therapies. Utilized in later clinical development, molecular imaging can serve as a biomarker of response, substituting for a clinical endpoint.</li>
<li>Action 1.C.1 could be strengthened by expanding the organizations supported beyond ADNI. In order to see significant breakthroughs with regard to pathophysiology and develop new molecular imaging agents that image a range of biological pathways, research investments are needed at a range of academic, private, and public entities, including other NIH Institutes such as NINDS and NIBIB.</li>
<li>Strategy 2B would be strengthened by including utilization of existing neuroimaging tools and investment in new tools. Molecular imaging methods can show abnormal patterns in Alzheimer's disease and can help in the differential diagnosis of dementing disorders. Their use would help achieve the goals of facilitating appropriate assessment and giving healthcare providers tools to make accurate and timely diagnoses. Therefore, patients would benefit more rapidly from the increased access to healthcare resources for Alzheimer's disease care that the Affordable Care Act will provide.</li>

<p><em><strong>GOAL: Delay onset and slow progression of Alzheimer's disease by 2020 </strong></em></p>
<p>To accomplish this goal:</p>
<ol><li>What do you see as the main obstacles to its achievement? Adequate funding is no doubt an element, but are there other barriers?
<ul><li>Generally, the field is too biased and focused on Aß/amyloid, and there needs to be more research oriented towards other potential therapeutic targets such as tau and factors that can improve synaptic connections (e.g., neurotrophic factors or stem cells). In addition, the field needs to focus efforts on the basic mechanism of disease. For example, there is an urgent need to develop better animal models of the disease, particularly those that represent the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease, and also ones that better mimic co-morbidities, as this disease strikes individuals who are quite aged, and generally suffer from other disorders besides Alzheimer's disease.
<ul><li>Educating the public more about the disease would also be useful, with particular emphasis on the effects of midlife modifiers of risk.</li>
<li>There also needs to be better realization that a monotherapy is unlikely to be successful for treating such a complex human disease and we need to do a better job focusing on considering combination therapies. I believe there are few complex human diseases that are readily treated by a single therapy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>What do you see as the key areas of emphasis in research needed to accomplish this goal? Please list up to <strong>5 key areas of research</strong> in order of importance (e.g., genetics, clinical trials). Within each area, please list one or two <strong>examples of more specific items</strong> (e.g., a GWAS in a particular population, a clinical trial on a tau-active drug). Please be succinct, realistic and concrete in your responses.
<ol><li>Animal models
<ol><li>Better models are needed of sporadic Alzheimer's disease</li>
<li>Consider using other species besides mice (rats, dogs, rabbits, primates)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Therapies
<ol><li>Targets needed other than Aß (e.g., tau, synaptic connections, autophagy/proteasome)</li>
<li>More than one therapy against more than one target</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Biomarkers/Early detection/Better Neuropsychological Batteries
<ol><li>Imaging other than amyloid: synapses, astrocytosis (surrogate biomarkers)</li>
<li>Better identification of individuals likely to develop AD</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Study of special human populations/minorities as they can provide important insights into the disease mechanisms
<ol><li>Down syndrome: represent largest group with early onset AD</li>
<li>Oldest old: enable us to elucidate risk factors that may prevent dementia in this group</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Clinical trials (people we enroll in the trials don't necessarily represent the generally population)
<ol><li>early treatments and more preventation trials need</li>
<li>consider co-morbidities</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Is the existing federal and private research infrastructure sufficient to support adequately current and future national research efforts addressing neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease? If not, what suggestions do you have for new infrastructure?
<ul><li>Consider developing infrastructure to foster young investigators at all levels (graduate students, postdocs, residents, assistant professors, etc.)</li>
<li>Facilitate transfer of IP to better enable partnerships between academics and drug companies/small businesses.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What suggestions would you have for enhancing research collaboration outside of the federal government? That is, what would you recommend toward forging new public-private relationships? Please continue to page 3 5.
<ul><li>Consider developing a national IRB so that when multiple sites are used in a clinical trials, the protocol doesn't need to go to 50 different IRBs.</li>
<li>Important for their to be a mechanism for publishing negative clinical drug trials (this should almost be mandatory) so that others can learn and we can maximize resources</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What role do you see the Alzheimer's Centers playing in the future of research on Alzheimer's disease? How should the Centers Program evolve to meet the expanding needs for the field? 6.
<ul><li>Need more large multi-site studies.</li>
<li>NACC appears to mainly be a data repository and should evolve to be more of an actual coordinating center and facilitating and initiating true multi-site studies comparable to other coordinating centers.</li>
<li>Greater participation in human research studies by patients and controls could perhaps be encouraged if we revealed the results of genetic testing like ApoE and also revealed the results of imaging studies. Obviously, better counseling would also need to be provided.</li>
<li>More money for pilot projects and more pilot projects are needed; and also consider increasing the time for some pilots beyond one year.</li>
<li>Encourage more high risk and high yield type projects as well, rather than more conservative next step science.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Please provide any additional comments you might have for developing a research plan to reach the stated goal by 2020.
<ul><li>Might want to consider working groups that are focused on specific areas. For example, one working group could involve leaders in animal models and coordinate the development of new models that can be widely shared in the field, rather than having individuals compete against each other, often working on very similar things.</li>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Mental Health America Comments on Draft National Alzheimer's Plan</strong></p>
<p>As an organization concerned with all aspects of mental health, we are very pleased that the federal government is developing plans to address the needs of people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>We believe, however, that the plan, as currently drafted, falls short of its goals because of three major concerns: (1) unbalanced distribution of new funding; (2) inadequate attention to research about psychosocial interventions; and 3) the failure to address the behavioral health dimensions of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Funding: </strong></p>
<p>The draft plan does not specify how much funding will be available to address Alzheimer's and other dementias in the future. It does provide some information about new federal funding that has been committed prior to the completion of the plan. $156 million will be made available for the five major goals of the plan. Of this $130 million (83 percent) is designated for one goal--research. $26 million is designated for enhanced services and supports, provider education, public education, and improved data collection. Of this, $10.7 million is designated for improved care and treatment of 5.4 million people who currently have dementia and their family caregivers. At less than $2 per person, that is not adequate.</p>
<p><strong>Research About Psychosocial Interventions: </strong></p>
<p>As currently drafted, the plan is heavily tilted towards research into finding a cure for Alzheimer's. It focuses much of its attention on bio-medical research and the development of effective pharmacological treatments. We recognize that the slowing of the progression of dementia is important.</p>
<p>However, we believe that the research must pay much greater attention to psychosocial interventions, which can do much to improve the quality of life of people with dementia and their family caregivers. Further research in the area can help produce evidence-based practices that will more immediately benefit patients and caregivers. We strongly recommend that the research plan devote greater attention to research about psycho-social interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Greater Attention to Behavioral Health: </strong></p>
<p>Although the plan notes that people with dementia experience "behavioral and psychiatric disorders and that family caregivers experience tremendous stress and "report symptoms of depression and anxiety and poorer health outcomes," not enough attention is paid to these behavioral needs that are common among people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>People with dementia often have co-occurring mental health conditions such as major depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Almost all exhibit neuro-psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, aggression, and sleep disorders. When this occurs, those who care for people with dementia turn to mental health providers for help. In addition, family caregivers are at high risk for depression, anxiety, and stress related physical disorders. The plan needs to address evidence-based family support interventions that can provide critical support.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to comment on the plan. We would be glad to work with HHS to provide the details that are needed to complete a National Alzheimer's Plan that reflects the psychosocial/mental health needs of Americans with dementia and their families as well as their opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, there is now an Industry Working group on Alzheimer's supportive of the 2025 goal. I will be working to expand the size of this group in the coming months so that HHS has a strong partner in executing our National Plan. Here are their comments on the draft plan.</p>

<p>As you refine the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, leading biopharmaceutical organizations engaged in Alzheimer's and dementia research and drug development are pleased to have this opportunity to offer comment on a strong first draft. The organizations participating in the Industry Working Group on Alzheimer's Disease (Working Group), identified above, represent many of the industry leaders striving to discover and develop therapies and diagnostics to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025 if not sooner. We have collectively invested tens of billions of dollars and many decades of energy to change the course of Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and we are all too familiar with the scientific, medical, and financial challenges associated with this pursuit, as well as the human and societal costs. If we are to reach the HHS stated goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025 -- which we support -- nothing short of a transformational and transparent partnership between the public and private sectors will be required. We look forward to working with you to make this happen.</p>
<p>The immense risks and challenges associated with bringing a drug, biologic, or other therapies to market are well known. The 1 of every 10,000 potential therapies that end up being approved for patient use take on average 13 years and cost well beyond $1 billion each to develop. For Alzheimer's and dementia research, scientific and other challenges have resulted in a very small number of approved treatments. And of the medications currently available, they address only the symptoms of the disease.</p>
<p>As noted above, we strongly applaud you and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services for embracing the bold and appropriate Goal number 1 of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. Given the significant current public health and fiscal challenges -- and the even greater looming health and fiscal threats posed by the disease -- this is indeed an appropriate goal. Fifty years ago, the nation committed to sending a man to the moon within the decade. We believe the time has come for a second moon shot, one focused on preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease. Just as we succeeded in putting a man on the moon ahead of schedule, we believe this goal can be achieved if the right resources -- public and private -- and the right policies -- those that encourage and accelerate the development of safe and effective treatments -- are brought to bear. The challenge before us now is how to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>This Working Group has devoted considerable time and energies studying this question and is pleased to offer the following comments and suggestions to maximize our collective abilities to achieve success. We have targeted our comments and recommendations within five core areas:</p>
<ul><li>Strengthening the role of industry in the overall process, particularly by providing continuing and dynamic input into determining our national research priorities and ways to compress the discovery pipeline.</li>
<li>Providing greater specificity and detail -- as well as an accurate statement of resources -- that will be necessary to achieve the strategies and goals.</li>
<li>Including the policy incentives necessary to attract and sustain robust industry and capital commitments to Alzheimer's and dementia research.</li>
<li>Establishing metrics that are useful in driving the desired outcome, are clear, and are measurable.</li>
<li>Extending our vision to encompass the global challenge presented by Alzheimer's disease and dementias.</li>
</ul><p>We will comment on each overarching point and then offer a number of more specific comments and suggestions for the next draft of the National Plan.</p>
<p><strong>I. Strengthen the role of industry in the overall process, particularly by providing continuing and dynamic input into determining our national research priorities and ways to compress the discovery pipeline. </strong></p>
<p>We are encouraged to see multiple references from the Administration that this plan be a true National Plan rather than a federal plan, meaning that it will include shared rights, roles, and responsibilities for all stakeholders. To ensure this desire is achieved, the Working Group strongly believes that the next version of the plan <strong><em>must include a more robust and ongoing process of partnership between government -- particularly the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration -- and industry</em></strong>.</p>
<p>For example, while we appreciate the upcoming NIH summit and the Request for Information to collect widespread input on the research agenda, we note these actions are limited to one-time occurrences and do not contemplate an ongoing and robust dialogue and exchange with industry partners. Also concerning is that other recommendations -- including sets 1.B, 1.C, and 1.E, which are focused on expanding research, accelerating effort to identify early and pre-symptomatic stages of the disease, and compressing the discovery timeline, call for what may be viewed as token or no industry engagement whatsoever despite the immense value such involvement would bring to the larger effort.</p>
<p>Specifically, action 1.E.1 focuses on identifying ways to compress the time between target identification and release of treatment, but calls for industry to be involved only indirectly. <strong><em>We strongly believe the plan should recognize an explicit role for industry with a direct seat at this and related tables given the predominant role we collectively play in the therapy discovery and development process</em></strong>. In this way, together, we will begin to set a concrete course that characterizes a new, vital and transparent partnership between the public and private sectors, aligned to achieve the 2025 goal.</p>
<p>Beyond the points above, we urge that the draft plan be amended to include the following:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Commit to establishing a meaningful partnership with industry and an ongoing process of dialogue between industry and NIH and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) in determining research and related priorities</strong>. Inviting industry to the table to identify significant areas of research need and to present perplexing questions in need of basic research will breathe life into the concept of life cycle innovation by providing invaluable input and exchange of ideas. If the government wants to create a truly national plan, we believe this new partnership with the private sector, one that is open, transparent, and ground-breaking, should be at the core of the plan. In terms of specific models, we recommend exploring the Forum for Collaborative HIV Research and related HIV/AIDS models as potential examples, as well as the platforms created through the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program for industry engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Establish a standing NIH/NIA and Industry Alzheimer's Working Group</strong> to provide the institutes with the continuous feedback loop on research and drug discovery issues such as those raised above. One potential model may be the CEO Roundtable on Cancer, which involves a number of industry partners as well as governmental collaborators including the NIH and FDA. Such a partnership could provide the NIH and other federal entities not only with additional voices and input but also with potential resources to support initiatives, such as more regular scientific conferences and inventories.</li>
<li><strong>Increase patient enrollment in clinical trials, particularly targeted minority patients</strong>. We strongly applaud this aspect of the plan and we urge that industry play a meaningful role in crafting the recruitment action plan, including being consulted on the populations or sub-populations we believe are most in need. This action plan should include specific tools for attaining this increased participation, such as targeted patient registries.</li>
</ul><p><strong>II. Provide greater specificity and detail -- as well as an accurate statement of resources -- that will be necessary to achieve the strategies and goals. </strong></p>
<p>The Working Group embraces many of the research action steps included in the first draft plan. Expanding basic research into the underpinnings of the disease, identifying risk and protective factors, identifying biomarkers, and identifying ways to compress the therapy development timeline are all tremendously important if we are to achieve the 2025 goal. But each of these strategies and actions is only as good as the corresponding action steps required to achieve them, and we believe greater specificity and detail than what is contained in the first draft is needed. <strong><em>We also believe that given the enormity of the challenges before us, the plan must speak to the significant yet realistic financial resources -- both public and private -- that must be brought to bear against this disease to stop it from destroying our health and finances. You have been bold in stating the 2025 goal, so too you should be realistic in setting the expectation for the resources -- and scope of investment across the public and private sectors -- that will be required to meet this goal</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Following are comments in terms of enhanced specificity that we feel would strengthen the plan.</p>
<p><strong>A clear path to the validation of a family of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers</strong></p>
<ul><li>Catalogue existing Alzheimer's biomarker initiatives including their focus/type (<em>e.g., inclusion, prognostic, surrogate endpoint</em>) and <em>where</em> they currently lie in terms of their development and review, identify gaps, and establish a plan that seeks to validate specific biomarkers within a certain timeframe.</li>
<li>Convene a joint high-level meeting between FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) leadership focused on Alzheimer's biomarkers and surrogate endpoints -- including imaging modalities and imaging agents -- and the much-needed harmonization of guidance and approvals.</li>
<li>Develop a joint NIH and FDA -- in close consultation with industry -- action plan focused specifically on identifying and validating Alzheimer's biomarkers. This will be a subset of the larger research prioritization and action plan and involve ongoing NIH, FDA and industry dialogue to better understand biomarker needs, to update the biomarkers action plan, and to provide clear and direct guidance to industry on the use of such tools.</li>
<li>Engage the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) on specific initiatives focused on biomarker and surrogate endpoint development and addressing challenges in conducting clinical trials in pre-symptomatic patient populations.</li>
<li>Issue, upon biomarker and endpoint approval, unambiguous guidance to industry on their usage.</li>
</ul><p><strong>A reduction in the cost and time of clinical trials and clinical trial processes</strong></p>
<ul><li>Create large-scale, open-architected patient registries, with a particular focus on ethnic subpopulations.</li>
<li>Engage industry as to population and subpopulation engagement, data, and other needs.</li>
<li>Consider the applicability of novel trial designs, such as models used to address rare disease, for Alzheimer's disease.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Improved access to standardized electronic health and clinical trial data</strong></p>
<ul><li>Establish a process involving NIH, FDA, and industry to identify core data issues. Topics would include access to data -- including intervention arm data, failed trial data, dormant therapy data, biomarker data and other valuable data sets -- as well as agreeing to and extending the use of common data standards.</li>
<li>As part of this process, engage with industry around specific ideas to enlarge the space of appropriate data sharing. Members of the Working Group have each participated in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, in many ways a seminal effort to explore and expand this space. We understand the opportunities afforded by efforts such as these, both to accelerate development where signals are positive and to fail early where signals suggest a dead end. We are prepared to build on these experiences to create new models that serve to advance therapy development across the sector.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Honest assessment of the level of resources necessary to achieve the 2025 goal</strong></p>
<ul><li>Include within the strategies and action items a realistic estimate of the resources necessary to achieve success, and a statement as to how the federal government, particularly during financially challenging times, plans to meet its commitment.</li>
<li>Extension of the scope and scale of responses to the global scale including a path forward toward a global action plan and fund.</li>
</ul><p><strong>III. Include the policy incentives necessary to attract and sustain robust industry and capital commitments to Alzheimer's and dementia research </strong></p>
<p>The draft national plan is deficient in that while it notes the importance of compressing the discovery timeline, it fails to mention financial and other policy levers that are needed to attract and sustain robust industry and capital commitment to this most challenging area of research. <strong><em>We urge that you speak to the role of smart incentives within the draft plan and lay out a path for addressing these topics near-term</em></strong>. Specific issues we recommend the plan address directly or develop a process involving industry stakeholders to address include:</p>
<ul><li>Maintaining and strengthening a patent system that encourages and rewards innovation and protects and provides a fair return on investment.</li>
<li>Establishing avenues for the collaboration of the public and private sectors that realistically take into account the genuine needs and strengths of both groups.</li>
<li>Ensuring appropriate payment for any successful therapy that takes into account the enormous costs of research and drug development in this critical area. This requires adequate federal reimbursement and payment policies and having the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) at the table whenever warranted.</li>
</ul><p><strong>IV. Establish metrics that are useful in driving the desired outcome, are clear, and are measurable. </strong></p>
<p>The members of the Working Group strongly believe that meaningful and clear metrics and milestones are absolutely essential for implementing any plan and holding responsible parties accountable. In business, clear action plans and corresponding metrics are commonplace and indispensable in keeping projects focused, on schedule, and on budget. All three of these attributes are necessary if the National Alzheimer's Plan is to be successful in achieving its goals, but the current plan falls short in this area, particularly in setting outcomes for action items. For example:</p>
<ul><li>The draft plan seeks to increase enrollment in Alzheimer's clinical trials but fails to specify specific numbers, target demographics or interim milestones.</li>
<li>It seeks to increase the pace of collaboration between the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs but does not provide a clear timeframe or goals.</li>
<li>It seeks to identify biomarkers but does not establish targets or set a timeframe for biomarker acceptance and validation by the FDA.</li>
<li>And it speaks to maximizing government and industry collaboration but does not espouse clear goals for this action, only events like meetings and conferences and high-level themes.</li>
</ul><p>While all of these and other actions are meritorious, they require clear metrics and a commitment to aggressive oversight. To that end, the industry Working Group recommends that the plan be amended to:</p>
<ul><li>Commit to develop this year specific action steps and metrics for each action starting with the designation of a specific federal official/office to manage each action.</li>
<li>Develop and post on the NAPA website a user-friendly "dashboard" to regularly track progress toward each action, strategy, and goal.</li>
<li>Work with industry and other appropriate partners to establish metrics that will increase our collective ability to achieve our goals, particularly the goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's by 2025.</li>
</ul><p><strong>V. Extend our vision to encompass the global challenge presented by Alzheimer's disease and dementias. </strong></p>
<p>In a recent speech, Professor Peter Piot, former Under Secretary-General of the United Nations and former executive director of UNAIDS, called dementia "one of the largest neglected global health challenges of our generation" and called for a global health action plan to address it.<sup>1</sup> Alzheimer's disease is an epidemic that respects no national boundaries and that threatens to cripple the health and finances of the world if unaddressed. The statistics are clear: more than 36 million people worldwide currently have Alzheimer's or dementia, and projections estimate this number will skyrocket to 115 million by the mid-century point, according to Alzheimer's Disease International. The economic impact of the current epidemic exceeds $600 billion annually, and nearly two-thirds of all victims live in developing nations that are largely ill-equipped to address the challenge.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Earlier this year, rating agency Standard &amp; Poors issued an analysis that said "Population aging will lead to profound changes in economic growth prospects for countries around the world, we believe, as governments work to build budgets to face ever greater age-related spending needs."<sup>3</sup> If governments fail to address this challenge and amend their social benefits systems, the agency concluded, the systems will become unsustainable." As Professor Piot noted, we must learn from the global approach to combat HIV/AIDS and enact a similar approach to Alzheimer's and dementia. No single country can take on this massive and multi-faceted endeavor alone, and the United States should be forceful and positive in recognizing this.</p>
<p>The draft plan acknowledges the need for greater collaboration between the U.S. and international partners, specifically Canada, the United Kingdom, and other nations that have or are developing National Alzheimer's Plans. This is a solid step that must be built upon with a clear path forward. Specifically, we urge that the global section be built out and contemplate specific measurable steps the U.S. will take to help develop and execute a global action plan as well as a global fund focused on both treatment and therapy development.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong></p>
<p>Madame Secretary, the members of the ad hoc Industry Working Group wish to express our deep gratitude to you for taking meaningful actions to address our national and global Alzheimer's epidemic. We believe the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is a strong first step, and we offer the above comments and suggestions as part of a sincere offer to foster a true partnership and collaboration with you and your colleagues to prevent and treat this disease by 2025. We welcome any questions you may have, and we stand at the ready to discuss any of our comments with you and your team directly if desired.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Thank you for inviting the New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA), to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." As Acting Director of NYSOFA, the New York State Unit on Aging, I would like to offer for consideration our recommendations to the Draft Framework for the National Plan. These amendments would seek to enhance the role of the aging network in helping to achieve the goals and objectives of the National Plan.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) identifies the urgent need for a national plan to systematically tackle and conquer this fatal illness and scientific research, is the key to finding a cure. NYSOFA supports the efforts of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services which includes, David Hoffman from the New York State Department of Health.</p>
<p>NYSOFA is a member of the New York State Coordinating Council for Services Related to Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias, established in 2007, and actively participates in subcommittee activities. In 2011, NYSOFA was awarded a three year Systems Integration Grant from the Administration on Aging (AoA) that provided funding for developing and integrating into service systems, dementia capability - this included care transitions and evidence-based direct services to persons with dementia and their caregivers. In addition, NYSOFA was a recipient of other AoA grants, including Lifespan Respite.</p>
<p>New York State is committed to providing the best possible dementia capable services throughout our aging network. New York will continue efforts to identify best practices and evidence-based interventions that produce positive outcomes impacted by the disease and their caregivers. A recent snapshot of all of NYSOFA's programs/ and services in December 2011, revealed that a significant percentage of the 59 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) were serving persons living with cognitive impairments related to dementia.</p>
<p>Of all of NYSOFA's community-based services and supports, social adult day services programs are uniquely suited to providing care and support to individuals with dementia and their caregivers. In these programs, 65 percent of participants have some form of dementia. The average year of age is 83 of a program participant, who requires hands on assistance with at least two activities of daily living (ADLs). They can remain living in their communities by attending an adult day care center for an average of two years following enrollment in the program. This is one example of a service provided by the aging network that persons with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers rely on.</p>
<p>For the person with Alzheimer's that lives alone or who does not have a caregiver, the friendly home delivered meal volunteer may be the only daily social interaction they may experience. As noted in the Alzheimer's Association <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em> report, one in seven persons with this disease lives alone. The case manager who coordinates services for these individuals often identifies signs or symptoms of illness and communicates with health care providers when they emerge. The aging network plays a significant role in providing community-based services and caregiver supports, which routinely interact with clinicians and health care providers. Considering the demographic shift of the next 30 years, it is vital that the aging network be recognized in the plan and that the plan demonstrates an integration of the health care and aging networks.</p>
<p>Please consider NYSOFA's recommendations for inclusion in the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>The Aging Network, as noted below in the following statements, should be identified specifically in the following key provisions of the draft plan. </strong></p>
<p>This is imperative as the aging network is much more than a support system and is better described as a service system of public and private entities that provide a wide range of services targeted to older adults and their caregivers. Many of the direct services, such as Chronic Disease Self-Management Programs and Adult Day Services are "active treatments" for the participants. Please consider including references to the Aging Network in the following statements:</p>
<p>Page 5: Framework and Guiding Principles -- insert:</p>
<p>"Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers receive assistance from both the clinical healthcare system and support systems, such as long-term care, home care, legal services, aging and other social services. Both the clinical care and support environments need better tools to serve people with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers. Ongoing and future research seeks to identify evidence-based interventions to assist clinicians, persons with Alzheimer's and their caregivers."</p>
<p>Page 11: Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs --insert:</p>
<p>"Additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, the pharmaceutical industry, and public health and aging systems quickly and accurately."</p>
<p>Page 13: Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care- insert</p>
<p>"The workforce that serves people with Alzheimer's Disease is diverse and complex. It includes professionals in the aging services network and the licensed health care field - such as primary care physicians; specialists such as neurologists, geriatricians, and psychiatrists; registered nurses and advanced practice nurses; community health workers; social workers; psychologists; pharmacists; dentists; allied health professionals; and direct-care workers like home health aides and certified nursing assistants and, also those who provide consumer directed or informal supports."</p>
<p>Page 17: Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings-insert</p>
<p>"These guidelines should be tailored to the stages of the disease and cover the myriad of care settings in which care is delivered, such as in the home, congregate aging service settings, physician offices, and long-term care facilities."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The aging network relies on non-pharmaceutical evidence based research to continue generating support for service delivery models used to provide care to persons with dementia and their caregivers</strong>. The aging network needs clinical trials to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the most promising non-pharmaceutical evidence-based interventions.</p>
<p>Page 10: Action 1.B 6: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising lifestyle interventions- insert:</p>
<p>"HHS and its federal partners will continue to conduct evidence based clinical trials to test the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions and risk factor reduction in the prevention of Alzheimer's Disease."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The aging network serves as the foundation on which the Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) is being built to serve as a primary source of information and assistance to persons in need of long term care supports and services. </strong></p>
<p>Action 2.A. 1: Educate Health Care Providers: insert:</p>
<p>"Health care providers will learn how to manage the disease in the context of other health care conditions, and about the role of the ADRC in linking people to support services in the community".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In general, persons with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers prefer to receive community-based long term services and supports as compared to nursing home placements</strong>. Community-based AD care should be routinely referred to in the plan.</p>
<p>Page 15: Action 2. A. 4: Strengthening the direct-care workforce -insert:</p>
<p>"HHS will strengthen the nursing home, aging services and long-term services and supports direct-care workforce through new training focused on high-quality, person-centered care for people with Alzheimer's Disease."</p>
<p>Page 17: Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings-insert:</p>
<p>"These guidelines should be tailored to the stages of the disease and cover the myriad of care settings in which care is delivered, such as in the home, aging service settings, physicians' offices, and long-term care facilities. These guidelines should also take into account how care might be modified for diverse populations and in the context of co-occurring chronic conditions in people with Alzheimer's."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The following should be added into Strategy 2. D. on page 17 as an additional action item. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Adult Day Services implementing evidence-based interventions should be acknowledged as an active treatment for persons with Alzheimer's Disease</strong>. There is a substantial need for increased access to dementia capable day centers and in the understanding about the effectiveness of this model by primary care physicians. This undertaking can be enhanced through additional evidence based research on this mode of care. In addition, Medicare should be expanded to reimburse for adult day services for individuals with dementia.</p>
<p>Although this process is challenging, NYOSFA is confident that the final adopted National Plan will increase positive outcomes for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers, as well as, identifying promising treatments for this ailment. On behalf of NYSOFA, I want to express our appreciation for the consideration of these recommendations.</p>

<p>As you refine the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, leading biopharmaceutical organizations engaged in Alzheimer's and dementia research and drug development are pleased to have this opportunity to offer comment on a strong first draft. The organizations participating in the Industry Working Group on Alzheimer's Disease (Working Group), identified above, represent many of the industry leaders striving to discover and develop therapies and diagnostics to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025 if not sooner. We have collectively invested tens of billions of dollars and many decades of energy to change the course of Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and we are all too familiar with the scientific, medical, and financial challenges associated with this pursuit, as well as the human and societal costs. If we are to reach the HHS stated goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025 -- which we support -- nothing short of a transformational and transparent partnership between the public and private sectors will be required. We look forward to working with you to make this happen.</p>
<p>The immense risks and challenges associated with bringing a drug, biologic, or other therapies to market are well known. The 1 of every 10,000 potential therapies that end up being approved for patient use take on average 13 years and cost well beyond $1 billion each to develop. For Alzheimer's and dementia research, scientific and other challenges have resulted in a very small number of approved treatments. And of the medications currently available, they address only the symptoms of the disease.</p>
<p>As noted above, we strongly applaud you and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services for embracing the bold and appropriate Goal number 1 of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. Given the significant current public health and fiscal challenges -- and the even greater looming health and fiscal threats posed by the disease -- this is indeed an appropriate goal. Fifty years ago, the nation committed to sending a man to the moon within the decade. We believe the time has come for a second moon shot, one focused on preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease. Just as we succeeded in putting a man on the moon ahead of schedule, we believe this goal can be achieved if the right resources -- public and private -- and the right policies -- those that encourage and accelerate the development of safe and effective treatments -- are brought to bear. The challenge before us now is how to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>This Working Group has devoted considerable time and energies studying this question and is pleased to offer the following comments and suggestions to maximize our collective abilities to achieve success. We have targeted our comments and recommendations within five core areas:</p>
<ul><li>Strengthening the role of industry in the overall process, particularly by providing continuing and dynamic input into determining our national research priorities and ways to compress the discovery pipeline.</li>
<li>Providing greater specificity and detail -- as well as an accurate statement of resources -- that will be necessary to achieve the strategies and goals.</li>
<li>Including the policy incentives necessary to attract and sustain robust industry and capital commitments to Alzheimer's and dementia research.</li>
<li>Establishing metrics that are useful in driving the desired outcome, are clear, and are measurable.</li>
<li>Extending our vision to encompass the global challenge presented by Alzheimer's disease and dementias.</li>
</ul><p>We will comment on each overarching point and then offer a number of more specific comments and suggestions for the next draft of the National Plan.</p>
<p><strong>I. Strengthen the role of industry in the overall process, particularly by providing continuing and dynamic input into determining our national research priorities and ways to compress the discovery pipeline. </strong></p>
<p>We are encouraged to see multiple references from the Administration that this plan be a true National Plan rather than a federal plan, meaning that it will include shared rights, roles, and responsibilities for all stakeholders. To ensure this desire is achieved, the Working Group strongly believes that the next version of the plan <strong>must include a more robust and ongoing process of partnership between government -- particularly the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration -- and industry</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, while we appreciate the upcoming NIH summit and the Request for Information to collect widespread input on the research agenda, we note these actions are limited to one-time occurrences and do not contemplate an ongoing and robust dialogue and exchange with industry partners. Also concerning is that other recommendations -- including sets 1.B, 1.C, and 1.E, which are focused on expanding research, accelerating effort to identify early and pre-symptomatic stages of the disease, and compressing the discovery timeline, call for what may be viewed as token or no industry engagement whatsoever despite the immense value such involvement would bring to the larger effort.</p>
<p>Specifically, action 1.E.1 focuses on identifying ways to compress the time between target identification and release of treatment, but calls for industry to be involved only indirectly. <strong>We strongly believe the plan should recognize an explicit role for industry with a direct seat at this and related tables given the predominant role we collectively play in the therapy discovery and development process</strong>. In this way, together, we will begin to set a concrete course that characterizes a new, vital and transparent partnership between the public and private sectors, aligned to achieve the 2025 goal.</p>
<p>Beyond the points above, we urge that the draft plan be amended to include the following:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Commit to establishing a meaningful partnership with industry and an ongoing process of dialogue between industry and NIH and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) in determining research and related priorities</strong>. Inviting industry to the table to identify significant areas of research need and to present perplexing questions in need of basic research will breathe life into the concept of life cycle innovation by providing invaluable input and exchange of ideas. If the government wants to create a truly national plan, we believe this new partnership with the private sector, one that is open, transparent, and ground-breaking, should be at the core of the plan. In terms of specific models, we recommend exploring the Forum for Collaborative HIV Research and related HIV/AIDS models as potential examples, as well as the platforms created through the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program for industry engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Establish a standing NIH/NIA and Industry Alzheimer's Working Group</strong> to provide the institutes with the continuous feedback loop on research and drug discovery issues such as those raised above. One potential model may be the CEO Roundtable on Cancer, which involves a number of industry partners as well as governmental collaborators including the NIH and FDA. Such a partnership could provide the NIH and other federal entities not only with additional voices and input but also with potential resources to support initiatives, such as more regular scientific conferences and inventories.</li>
<li><strong>Increase patient enrollment in clinical trials, particularly targeted minority patients</strong>. We strongly applaud this aspect of the plan and we urge that industry play a meaningful role in crafting the recruitment action plan, including being consulted on the populations or sub-populations we believe are most in need. This action plan should include specific tools for attaining this increased participation, such as targeted patient registries.</li>
</ul><p><strong>II. Provide greater specificity and detail -- as well as an accurate statement of resources -- that will be necessary to achieve the strategies and goals. </strong></p>
<p>The Working Group embraces many of the research action steps included in the first draft plan. Expanding basic research into the underpinnings of the disease, identifying risk and protective factors, identifying biomarkers, and identifying ways to compress the therapy development timeline are all tremendously important if we are to achieve the 2025 goal. But each of these strategies and actions is only as good as the corresponding action steps required to achieve them, and we believe greater specificity and detail than what is contained in the first draft is needed. <strong>We also believe that given the enormity of the challenges before us, the plan must speak to the significant yet realistic financial resources -- both public and private -- that must be brought to bear against this disease to stop it from destroying our health and finances. You have been bold in stating the 2025 goal, so too you should be realistic in setting the expectation for the resources -- and scope of investment across the public and private sectors -- that will be required to meet this goal</strong>.</p>
<p>Following are comments in terms of enhanced specificity that we feel would strengthen the plan.</p>
<p><strong>A clear path to the validation of a family of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers</strong></p>
<ul><li>Catalogue existing Alzheimer's biomarker initiatives including their focus/type (<em>e.g., inclusion, prognostic, surrogate endpoint</em>) and <em>where</em> they currently lie in terms of their development and review, identify gaps, and establish a plan that seeks to validate specific biomarkers within a certain timeframe.</li>
<li>Convene a joint high-level meeting between FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) leadership focused on Alzheimer's biomarkers and surrogate endpoints -- including imaging modalities and imaging agents -- and the much-needed harmonization of guidance and approvals.</li>
<li>Develop a joint NIH and FDA -- in close consultation with industry -- action plan focused specifically on identifying and validating Alzheimer's biomarkers. This will be a subset of the larger research prioritization and action plan and involve ongoing NIH, FDA and industry dialogue to better understand biomarker needs, to update the biomarkers action plan, and to provide clear and direct guidance to industry on the use of such tools.</li>
<li>Engage the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) on specific initiatives focused on biomarker and surrogate endpoint development and addressing challenges in conducting clinical trials in pre-symptomatic patient populations.</li>
<li>Issue, upon biomarker and endpoint approval, unambiguous guidance to industry on their usage.</li>
</ul><p><strong>A reduction in the cost and time of clinical trials and clinical trial processes</strong></p>
<ul><li>Create large-scale, open-architected patient registries, with a particular focus on ethnic subpopulations.</li>
<li>Engage industry as to population and subpopulation engagement, data, and other needs.</li>
<li>Consider the applicability of novel trial designs, such as models used to address rare disease, for Alzheimer's disease.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Improved access to standardized electronic health and clinical trial data</strong></p>
<ul><li>Establish a process involving NIH, FDA, and industry to identify core data issues. Topics would include access to data -- including intervention arm data, failed trial data, dormant therapy data, biomarker data and other valuable data sets -- as well as agreeing to and extending the use of common data standards.</li>
<li>As part of this process, engage with industry around specific ideas to enlarge the space of appropriate data sharing. Members of the Working Group have each participated in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, in many ways a seminal effort to explore and expand this space. We understand the opportunities afforded by efforts such as these, both to accelerate development where signals are positive and to fail early where signals suggest a dead end. We are prepared to build on these experiences to create new models that serve to advance therapy development across the sector.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Honest assessment of the level of resources necessary to achieve the 2025 goal</strong></p>
<ul><li>Include within the strategies and action items a realistic estimate of the resources necessary to achieve success, and a statement as to how the federal government, particularly during financially challenging times, plans to meet its commitment.</li>
<li>Extension of the scope and scale of responses to the global scale including a path forward toward a global action plan and fund.</li>
</ul><p><strong>III. Include the policy incentives necessary to attract and sustain robust industry and capital commitments to Alzheimer's and dementia research </strong></p>
<p>The draft national plan is deficient in that while it notes the importance of compressing the discovery timeline, it fails to mention financial and other policy levers that are needed to attract and sustain robust industry and capital commitment to this most challenging area of research. <strong>We urge that you speak to the role of smart incentives within the draft plan and lay out a path for addressing these topics near-term</strong>. Specific issues we recommend the plan address directly or develop a process involving industry stakeholders to address include:</p>
<ul><li>Maintaining and strengthening a patent system that encourages and rewards innovation and protects and provides a fair return on investment.</li>
<li>Establishing avenues for the collaboration of the public and private sectors that realistically take into account the genuine needs and strengths of both groups.</li>
<li>Ensuring appropriate payment for any successful therapy that takes into account the enormous costs of research and drug development in this critical area. This requires adequate federal reimbursement and payment policies and having the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) at the table whenever warranted.</li>
</ul><p><strong>IV. Establish metrics that are useful in driving the desired outcome, are clear, and are measurable. </strong></p>
<p>The members of the Working Group strongly believe that meaningful and clear metrics and milestones are absolutely essential for implementing any plan and holding responsible parties accountable. In business, clear action plans and corresponding metrics are commonplace and indispensable in keeping projects focused, on schedule, and on budget. All three of these attributes are necessary if the National Alzheimer's Plan is to be successful in achieving its goals, but the current plan falls short in this area, particularly in setting outcomes for action items. For example:</p>
<ul><li>The draft plan seeks to increase enrollment in Alzheimer's clinical trials but fails to specify specific numbers, target demographics or interim milestones.</li>
<li>It seeks to increase the pace of collaboration between the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs but does not provide a clear timeframe or goals.</li>
<li>It seeks to identify biomarkers but does not establish targets or set a timeframe for biomarker acceptance and validation by the FDA.</li>
<li>And it speaks to maximizing government and industry collaboration but does not espouse clear goals for this action, only events like meetings and conferences and high-level themes.</li>
</ul><p>While all of these and other actions are meritorious, they require clear metrics and a commitment to aggressive oversight. To that end, the industry Working Group recommends that the plan be amended to:</p>
<ul><li>Commit to develop this year specific action steps and metrics for each action starting with the designation of a specific federal official/office to manage each action.</li>
<li>Develop and post on the NAPA website a user-friendly "dashboard" to regularly track progress toward each action, strategy, and goal.</li>
<li>Work with industry and other appropriate partners to establish metrics that will increase our collective ability to achieve our goals, particularly the goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's by 2025.</li>
</ul><p><strong>V. Extend our vision to encompass the global challenge presented by Alzheimer's disease and dementias. </strong></p>
<p>In a recent speech, Professor Peter Piot, former Under Secretary-General of the United Nations and former executive director of UNAIDS, called dementia "one of the largest neglected global health challenges of our generation" and called for a global health action plan to address it. <sup>1</sup> Alzheimer's disease is an epidemic that respects no national boundaries and that threatens to cripple the health and finances of the world if unaddressed. The statistics are clear: more than 36 million people worldwide currently have Alzheimer's or dementia, and projections estimate this number will skyrocket to 115 million by the mid-century point, according to Alzheimer's Disease International. The economic impact of the current epidemic exceeds $600 billion annually, and nearly two-thirds of all victims live in developing nations that are largely ill-equipped to address the challenge.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Earlier this year, rating agency Standard &amp; Poors issued an analysis that said "Population aging will lead to profound changes in economic growth prospects for countries around the world, we believe, as governments work to build budgets to face ever greater age-related spending needs."<sup>3</sup> If governments fail to address this challenge and amend their social benefits systems, the agency concluded, the systems will become unsustainable." As Professor Piot noted, we must learn from the global approach to combat HIV/AIDS and enact a similar approach to Alzheimer's and dementia. No single country can take on this massive and multi-faceted endeavor alone, and the United States should be forceful and positive in recognizing this.</p>
<p>The draft plan acknowledges the need for greater collaboration between the U.S. and international partners, specifically Canada, the United Kingdom, and other nations that have or are developing National Alzheimer's Plans. This is a solid step that must be built upon with a clear path forward. Specifically, we urge that the global section be built out and contemplate specific measurable steps the U.S. will take to help develop and execute a global action plan as well as a global fund focused on both treatment and therapy development.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong></p>
<p>Madame Secretary, the members of the ad hoc Industry Working Group wish to express our deep gratitude to you for taking meaningful actions to address our national and global Alzheimer's epidemic. We believe the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is a strong first step, and we offer the above comments and suggestions as part of a sincere offer to foster a true partnership and collaboration with you and your colleagues to prevent and treat this disease by 2025. We welcome any questions you may have, and we stand at the ready to discuss any of our comments with you and your team directly if desired.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>The American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry (AAGP) is submitting these comments in response to the call for comments to the <strong><em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong>. The American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry (AAGP), established in 1978, is a membership association of nearly 2000 geriatric psychiatrists, geriatricians, nurses, family physicians, psychologists, neurologists, social workers, pharmacists and other health professionals interested in mental health and older adults. AAGP promotes the mental health and well-being of older people through professional education, public advocacy, and support of career development for clinicians, educators, and researchers in geriatric psychiatry and mental health. AAGP's activities include substantial attention to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Geriatric psychiatrists and others in AAGP are involved in all aspects of national activities addressing Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, members in our organization are principal investigators of federally supported basic science and clinical services investigations regarding Alzheimer's disease; AAGP members are local and national advocates for individuals suffering with dementia and their family caregivers; AAGP members teach and train clinicians at all levels who care for patients with dementia; and, clinician members of AAGP often become the primary coordinator for care management of outpatients with moderate to severe illness, and necessary consultants in residential nursing home care.</p>
<p>From this perspective, AAGP applauds the efforts of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in implementing aspects of The National Alzheimer's Project Act, including the development of the current <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em> (National Plan). Overall, in AAGP's opinion, the Draft National Plan in its current form has appropriate and commendable goals, and provides an excellent foundation for efforts towards achievement. AAGP remains concerned, however, that this ambitious plan has no explicit funds to implement the goals. The $50 million directed toward this program in 2012 and the proposed additional funding of $80 million will fall billions of dollars short of the appropriations needed to make the National Plan a reality. We urge the HHS to identify sources of funding in order to strengthen it. AAGP would contend that promulgating a plan of this importance without commensurate funding attached to its implementation creates a contradiction in the public's mind and can be demoralizing to everyone impacted by the National Plan including patients, families, clinicians, and the many others involved with the care and support of patients with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>As noted, AAGP members are at the forefront of the research, clinical, and education arenas of Alzheimer's disease in the United States. However, as Constantine G. Lyketsos, MD, and David S. Miller, MD, (both long time members of the AAGP) noted in their article in <em>Alzheimer's &amp; Dementia (2012)</em>, Alzheimer's disease is not simply "a memory or cognitive disorder, (as) almost all individuals with AD develop one or more Neuropsychiatric Syndromes at some point in their disease." The lack of discussion in the National Plan of Alzheimer's disease as a mental health issue is startling and one that needs to be remedied. Neuropsychiatric syndromes of Alzheimer's disease are difficult to manage clinically and have a serious and disabling impact on both the patient as well as the caregiver. At the same time, there is a significant lack of knowledge on how to manage these conditions effectively. Health providers must be experts at managing these behaviors with non-pharmacologic therapies until evidence-based pharmacologic interventions are discovered. The National Plan must also recognize that it is the onset of the neuropsychiatric syndromes that often leads to assisted living or nursing home (long-term care) placement for patients with Alzheimer's disease. The current long-term care population includes a majority of patients with dementia and a large percentage of those patients have such behavioral abnormalities. In these settings issues that relate to these syndromes is the central component that worsens quality of life and leads to morbidity and mortality. Research needs to be conducted on a new long-term care model that accommodates these patients in environments that are not only safe, but also can help manage these symptoms so quality of life improves even as Alzheimer's progresses. AAGP believes it is critical that the National Plan both recognizes the existence of AD neuropsychiatric syndromes, and includes research and clinical care strategies on how to address them.</p>
<p>In addition to addressing the mental health of the patient with Alzheimer's disease, AAGP believes it is critical to also address the mental health of the family caregiver. Too often the caregivers of patients with AD suffer from depression, which can lead to disability and/or physical health issues as well as to the development of dementia. In any comprehensive plan on AD, the mental health of the caregiver must be included.</p>
<p>AAGP applauds HHS for including a section on the education of health care providers, recognizing the needs for training specific to the treatment and management of patients with AD. It is well known that all primary care health providers need better education/training in the treatment of patients with AD, but in certain cases subspecialist care by geriatric psychiatrists is necessary. For example, when a patient requires acute psychiatric care with a comorbid diagnosis of AD, a specially trained physician is required. However, due to several factors including insufficient Medicare reimbursement, the number of geriatric psychiatrists in the U.S. is decreasing concurrent with the increasing need for additional specialists to address the growing incidences of dementia. The Institute of Medicine will address some of these issues in its forthcoming report on the needed workforce for mental health of older adults, but the National Plan should also include additional specific strategies for this specialized care. The time is now to invest funds into both training of health care providers as well develop models of care to ensure that there are community care programs to provide quality care for individuals with AD. Although it will require an initial investment of funds, ultimately the community and the health care systems will save money as there will be a decreased burden on the family and health care system.</p>
<p>AAGP offers its assistance to HHS as it begins to implement the National Plan. We are in a position to assist in the dissemination of research as well as actively participate in the education initiatives. We have worked on developing dementia-based curricula as well as conducted hundreds of workshops on the diagnosis and treatment of AD, including the neuropsychiatric syndromes of AD. We offer AAGP as a partner organization to HHS in any and all of these efforts.</p>
<p>We applaud HHS for the development of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. We agree that it is necessary for all of us to work together to be successful to address the many challenges facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Please contact us if we can provide further information or support in the execution of the National Plan.</p>

<p>Attached please find comments on the draft plan from the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration.</p>
<p>We appreciate the opportunity to offer our input on this important project.</p>
</td>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) congratulates the Advisory Council of the National Alzheimer's Project on the creation of the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (the draft plan). The draft plan is a major step forward in meeting the current and future challenges posed by progressive neurological diseases for the benefit of all who are affected by these devastating illnesses.</p>
<p>AFTD is honored to offer our input on behalf of the thousands of Americans living and working with frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), a group of clinical disorders resulting from a progressive loss of neurons in the frontal and/or temporal lobes of the brain. AD and FTD are related by pathological inclusions, often called neurofibrillary tangles, of the essential brain protein tau but differ in many critical ways. Memory loss, the characteristic symptom of AD, is rare in FTD and, when it does occur, is most often seen only during the later stages of FTD. The initial presentation of FTD can comprise a mix of symptoms, including: changes in behavior and personality diminished cognitive and executive functioning, language and communication problems, as well as motor impairments similar to those found in ALS or Parkinson's disease. FTD progresses unpredictably but inevitably results in complete dependence on medical care to sustain life during the final stages of the disease.</p>
<p>The average age of disease onset in FTD is in the late 50's, about a decade earlier than in AD. This difference poses special challenges shared only by the small percentage of people with the early-onset form of AD. Accessing insurance and finding appropriate health care for a debilitating neurological disease is a tremendous challenge for people under the age of retirement. Furthermore, the stigma associated with cognitive symptoms like dementia for people in their 40's-60's combined with a lack of public and professional awareness of FTD can create an overwhelming sense of isolation for people and families coping with FTD.</p>
<p>As an organization whose mission is devoted exclusively to this "related dementia", we believe that the inclusion of language in the draft plan explicitly addressing the distinct challenges posed by FTD and the related dementias will enable the proposed Actions and Strategies to better meet the needs of those affected by a non-Alzheimer's neurological disease. We strongly urge HHS to solicit input from experts and members of non-Alzheimer's disease communities and to specifically include such individuals as members of the task force detailed by Action 2.H.1 under Strategy 2.H.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevention and Treatment by 2025. </strong></p>
<p>AD and FTD are related through a shared underlying pathology. This connection offers exciting research prospects with enormous potential for AD and FTD patients alike. Therapeutic compounds that target the protein tau could have equally effective application for treating both diseases. FTD offers pharmaceutical companies opportunities for drug development not available with AD, such as a larger number of cases related to identified mutations on a small number of genes and a regulatory status to facilitate progress toward clinical drug trials. It is our sincere hope that the draft plan will stimulate aggressive efforts to exploit this point of mutual interest for the sake of both FTD and AD patients and their families.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>The primary obstacle to the efficient delivery of high-quality care for FTD in any professional setting is the overwhelming lack of qualified providers experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of FTD. Obtaining a diagnosis of FTD often takes several years, an amount of time equal to ¼ or more of the total life expectancy for some patients, and like AD a definitive diagnosis is still only obtainable by autopsy. Ambiguity in diagnosis during the life of the patient complicates care, clinical trial recruitment, financial planning and all other aspects of coping with a neurodegenerative disease of any kind. Reliable diagnoses that accurately differentiate AD from FTD and all other related diseases would benefit everyone. Once diagnosed, the only professional care available to those with FTD is by providers who advertise services with phrases like "Memory Care" or "Dementia Services" that are intended for people with AD. Some who have FTD, especially people in their 50's or 60's, fail to realize that such resources even apply to them since they do not have memory problems and dementia is widely perceived as a condition that affects only senior citizens. In order to measure and improve care for people affected by FTD any quality improvement tool developed through the draft plan must include data, information, and content addressing the scarcity of professional expertise and knowledge of FTD and recognize the enormous challenge patients and families face in accessing appropriate healthcare services that is not experienced by most of those with AD.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expanded Support for Patients and Caregivers </strong></p>
<p>Due to the earlier average age of disease onset relative to AD, FTD is more likely to strike people who are still employed and raising a family and inevitably deprives them of their ability to function in either a professional or private capacity. FTD robs families of a parent, and makes experienced professionals incapable of successfully concluding a career. The paucity of public awareness and scarcity of professional expertise can combine with the debilitating symptoms of FTD and throw entire families into personal, financial, and legal turmoil prior to diagnosis. Thus magnifying the impact of FTD on not only the healthcare system, but all other social and legal systems well beyond what is expected of a rare disease. Currently the main source of support for FTD patients and caregivers is extended families, close friends, and perhaps most importantly, other FTD caregivers. The need for strategies and action to expand support for patients and caregivers around the unique challenges posed by FTD is desperate.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Public awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>AFTD respectfully submits that without language explicitly describing the differences between the etiology, demographics and symptoms of FTD and AD, and the distinct challenges these differences impose on patients, caregivers, and the health care system as a whole, the draft plan will not successfully attain this goal for stakeholders involved with FTD. When FTD is subsumed under the phrase "related disorders" critical distinctions are lost, promoting the mistaken belief that dementia is a disease synonymous with AD rather than a symptom with a variety of causes. This, in turn, leads many healthcare professionals across all settings to treat people as if they have AD regardless of their actual diagnosis and provide them with inappropriate care which may even cause harm. Furthermore, when families and patients fail to respond as expected to the inappropriate care they receive they are too often denied care entirely rather than offered alternatives, exacerbating the sense of helplessness and the stigma that is all too common in those diagnosed with FTD. Unless more explicit attention is given to how FTD, and other neurological diseases differ from AD any increase in public awareness and engagement achieved through the draft plan will fail to fully benefit patients, families and caregivers coping with FTD and other neurological disease beside AD.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improved data infrastructure. </strong></p>
<p>Any data infrastructure created as part of the draft plan needs to be designed to include fields, criteria, and values specific to the impact of FTD, and other non-Alzheimer's diseases, on patients, families, and healthcare systems, if it is to benefit those with a neurological disease besides AD.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments on Draft Framework of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the Draft Framework of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. AstraZeneca is a global innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets prescription medicines that treat the world's most serious illnesses. For decades our scientists have been researching methods to support early diagnosis, stop or slow disease progression, and to alleviate the debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Dementia research is challenging, and subsequently many pharmaceutical companies have discontinued investment in this area. AstraZeneca remains committed to neuroscience research and has adopted a more flexible R&amp;D model to fully optimize external research partnerships and expertise. In 2012 we announced that our global Neuroscience Innovative Medicines Unit will be headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>We applaud the government's commitment to strengthen public funding for Alzheimer's disease research thereby accelerating scientific advancement leading to new effective treatments. We support the broader initiative to engage public and private stakeholders around common goals and objectives to optimize existing activity and facilitate public-private sector collaboration. We have a global approach to medicines development and welcome the National Plan's proposal of international collaboration with other countries actively engaging in dementia research.</p>
<p>Disease modifying treatments will remain elusive unless we continue to research the underpinnings of the disease. New genetic, molecular, and cellular targets, beyond recent advances in beta-amyloid, are needed for future pharmaceutical interventions. Ongoing identification, validation, and endorsement of biomarkers enable clinical studies and help demonstrate disease modification. All at-risk patients will benefit from early detection and prevention if diagnostic capabilities are improved and a clear framework to bring effective treatments for this debilitating disease is established. The success of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the C-Path Institute Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) clearly demonstrate the positive impact public and private sector coordination can have in the development of new treatments for Alzheimer's. AstraZeneca encourages DHHS to continue this spirit of collaboration by including all appropriate stakeholders, including industry, in the overall planning process aimed at minimizing Alzheimer's Disease as a health burden by 2025.</p>
<p>We look forward to working with HHS to pave the way for innovation in Alzheimer's disease treatment and management. Please do not hesitate to contact Alice Pomponio if we can be of further assistance.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Geriatric Mental Health Alliance of New York Comments on the<br />
					Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>On behalf of the Geriatric Mental Health Alliance of New York, I am writing in response to the draft National Alzheimer's Plan recently released for comment by the Department of Health and Human Services. The Geriatric Mental Health Alliance of New York is a 3,000 member advocacy and education organization formed to improve policy and practice for older adults with behavioral health needs.</p>
<p>We are delighted that a National Alzheimer's Plan is being developed in recognition of the vast growth of the number of people who will have Alzheimer's or other dementias during the elder boom, and we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the draft plan.</p>
<p>However, we believe that the draft plan is inadequate in several critical ways.</p>
<p><strong>Imbalance of Use of Funding</strong>: The draft plan does not specify how much funding will be available to deal with Alzheimer's and other dementias in the future, but it does provide some information about new federal funding that has been committed prior to the completion of the plan. $156 million will be made available for the five major goals of the plan. Of this $130 million (83%) is designated for one goal--research. $26 million is designated for enhanced services and supports, provider education, public education, and improved data collection. Of this, $10.7 million is designated for improved care and treatment of 5.4 million people who currently have dementia and their family caregivers. That's less than $2 per person. This is simply not sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Inadequate Attention to Research About Psychosocial Interventions</strong>: The clear tilt of the draft plan is towards research to find a cure for Alzheimer's. It seems to focus heavily on bio-medical research and the development of effective pharmacological treatments. Prevention, cure, or effective slowing of the progression of dementia are, of course, much to be desired. But we do not believe that it is at all likely that this will be achieved by 2025--the goal of this plan--and even if it is, the millions of people who now have or will develop dementia prior to that will not be helped at all.</p>
<p>We know that psychosocial interventions can do much to improve the quality of life of people with dementia and their family caregivers, but we need to know more--to develop truly evidence-based practices. We strongly urge those developing the research plan to pay much more attention to research about psychosocial interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Attention to Mental Disorders Commonly Experienced by People with Dementia and their Caregivers</strong>: People with dementia often have co-occurring mental health conditions such as major depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Almost all exhibit neuro-psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, aggression, and sleep disorders. (See Lyketsos, et al) When this happens, those who care for people with dementia turn to mental health providers for help. Yet, the role of the mental health system is barely reflected in the draft plan.</p>
<p>In addition, family caregivers are at high risk for depression, anxiety, and stress related physical disorders. There are evidence-based family support interventions. (See Mittelman). The need for supports for family caregivers is noted in the plan, but briefly and with little substance.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that failure to address issues of mental health will result in continued failure to meet fundamental needs of people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to comment on the plan. We would be glad to work with HHS to provide the details that are needed to complete a National Alzheimer's Plan that reflects the psychosocial/mental health needs of Americans with dementia and their families as well as their opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the Advisory Committee for preparing an excellent draft plan. The Assisted Living Federation of America (ALFA) has submitted comments on a couple of occasions, but I would like to reiterate that our organization is a resource if HHS or the Advisory Committee would like to learn more about the role of licensed assisted living in meeting the needs of individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementia. Our providers have developed special programs that ensure residents have an improved quality of life along with quality of care. We believe these innovative programs should be used to replace the use of psychotropic and other medications that may not be needed. ALFA would just like to request that as the national plan looks ahead to helping individuals with dementia and their family and friends plan for the future, that assisted living be recognized as an appropriate and cost effective option. Thank you.</p>

<p>I just came across an article stating that you are interested in ideas for understanding Alzheimers.</p>
<p>I have been a Clinical Psychologist and College Professor since 1950 and am interested both personally and professionally.</p>
<p>I try to follow the research and have attended regular conferences on Senile Dementia and it seems clear to me that medications have been minimally effective. So far physical exercise, mental stimulation and socialization have proven more effective. In working with older clients the concept of working with the positive-the resources you have -is more effective than focusing on what is lost. In addition meditative techniques are valuable in helping focus and concentration.</p>
<p>As medications seem so limited -it would seem very important to spend some research dollars and involvement in a broad spectrum approach to dealing with Senile Dementia.Thanks for your attention.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Inter-Agency Working Group of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for developing a solid first draft of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, a draft that includes goals and actions dealing with the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. LEAD is pleased that a number of priority recommendations previously submitted by the coalition are included in the draft plan.</p>
<p>Organizations from all segments of the Alzheimer's-serving community participated in developing these comments, including non-profits and for-profits, research-oriented and care-oriented, academic and advocacy, among others. LEAD believes strongly that achievement of the goals of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025 and improving the quality of care and of life of Alzheimer's victims and their families will require an National Alzheimer's Team using an 'all hands on deck' approach. LEAD and its participating organizations are prepared to step up as a full member of that Team.</p>
<p>Attached please find LEAD's comments on the first draft of the National Plan. We have organized our comments in the categories of research and drug discovery, clinical care, and long-term care support and services. We hope the Secretary will give strong consideration to including these recommendations in the final National Plan.</p>
<p>Comments provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals, strategies, and actions within the draft plan. As noted in earlier comments, LEAD believes that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private, and non-profit sectors. It is imperative that the actions within the national plan be monitored and tracked to assess the impact of the action steps as well as progress toward the Plan's goals. While we are pleased that HHS will evaluate the data and infrastructure required for implementation of the plan, it is important that there is a model for assessing the impact that strategies within the national plan have on progress toward the desired goals. To that end, LEAD recommends that immediate action be taken to develop a model this year that will allow HHS to accurately assess the impact of the action steps in the national plan and identify areas for course adjustments. We, as a nation, should not pursue implementation steps that are not clearly moving toward our goals. We cannot waste time and resources going down blind alleys. In that regard we recommend that each goal and strategy set forth in the final national plan include a budget, clear milestones and quantifiable metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>LEAD members have also identified a set of other actions within the draft plan that should be implemented immediately, without the need for a national plan. These include activities that are already being undertaken or that leverage current resources and materials. Many of these actions are critical to the success of implementing long-term goals and strategies. Specifically they include disseminating existing tools and guidelines to help healthcare professionals diagnose and care for people with Alzheimer's and their families, as well as expansion of successful interventions that are already proven to improve quality of life for people with Alzheimer's. These actions are highlighted at the end of each section of comments.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established three workgroups -- one each in the areas of research and drug development, clinical care and long-term care support and services -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the entire Alzheimer's-serving community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD fully supports this bold goal, with the hope that the goal can be achieved even more rapidly with the right plan and resource commitment. And LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has included a number of recommendations submitted by the coalition under Goal 1. Specifically we are pleased that the Advisory Council recommends a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on "the most promising pharmacological interventions" as well as accelerating efforts to "identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease." In addition, we are pleased that there is greater emphasis on international coordination and collaboration with commercial and nonprofit partners. However, it is imperative that any goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease include research investments in non-pharmacological treatments. Non-pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's treatment can improve relevant outcomes including improved behavior and delay of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's comments and recommendations for Goal 1 of the draft National Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong><br />
					Strategies to expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease should reference the very significant contribution that will be made by industry in conducting clinical trials. Strategies should build on the infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new agents for trials and their existing working relationships with regulators to ensure that safe and effective medicines get approved. Strategies should include a statement of what each Federal and industry partner can contribute and where the cost and time of the clinical trial process can be reduced consistent with standards of safety and efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong><br />
					To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry, and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a large-scale, open-source patient registry of subjects that can be approached for recruitment in prevention trials, including specifically under-represented ethnic and other sub-populations. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong><br />
					With the levels of funding now dedicated by government, academia, and industry to Alzheimer's disease research, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of all partners and resources -- and make the best use of the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. Studies need to be adequately powered, with agents that effectively test mechanisms of action, produce clear evidence of brain target engagement, and really help to advance the state of knowledge. Private industry is ready to support the 2025 goal and should be engaged as a full and equal partner with government and the research community in its achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include consideration of a uniform patient consent and centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB) to review all multi-center Alzheimer's disease trials to decrease the time for trial start-up and protocol amendments.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong><br />
					Public-Private Partnerships provide an opportunity to overcome many of the challenges associated with taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Many Public Private Partnerships exist around Alzheimer's disease and have helped to overcome barriers to research and drug development. Such partnerships include: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Coalition Against Major Diseases, FNIH Biomarkers Consortium and the Alliance for Aging Research's ACT-AD Coalition.</p>
<p>LEAD recommends increased support for these partnerships as they seek to establish publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification. Further as additional data gaps are identified, pre-competitive partnership collaborations can accelerate the pathway toward development of Alzheimer's disease modifying therapies.</p>
<p>New models of Public-Private Partnership cooperation and funding are needed, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations, collaborative platforms, and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such Alzheimer's partnerships could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because these partnerships rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided through multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation</em></strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the final plan includes a process for developing a standardized informed consent to allow participants in clinical trials to authorize their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study in order to advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger Alzheimer's disease databases to allow data mining and to increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, HIPPA, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop data standards to ensure a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data</em>.</strong><br />
					The National Plan should encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Using these standards will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA and EMA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data, including data in failed trials, data with respect to dormant drugs, and data rich in biomarker information, should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that all findings from the May research summit be shared with the public for comment and that "strategies and milestones for an ambitious plan to slow progression, delay onset, and prevent Alzheimer's disease" be established within six months of the summit to ensure continued momentum and coordination with the National Plan. LEAD recommends that continuing research summits be conducted every other year in order to monitor progress and adjust priorities in light of funding conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.2: Solicit public and private input on Alzheimer's disease research priorities</strong><br />
					The NIA should issue an RFI within six months of the summit as noted above and information be captured and evaluated and considered as the NIA develops priorities for future years.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene representatives from across the federal government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to create an action plan for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the building of registries.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft plan includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis, and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the draft plan will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans requiring care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are comments from LEAD regarding the draft plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong><br />
					Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides, and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in public and private hospital settings. Additionally, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>In addition to educating healthcare providers, LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this action be combined with Action 2.D.1 "Explore dementia care guidelines and measures." Both recommendations require input from experts to develop dementia-specific guidelines for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong><br />
					LEAD applauds the efforts to strengthen state aging workforces that are "capable and culturally competent" through the Administration on Aging (AOA). While implementing this action, it is important that efforts to improve state strategies do not further burden states' abilities to apply for and utilize funds from AoA. States should maintain flexibility to implement strategies that address the unique needs of the state populations through their state infrastructures.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated about palliative and hospice care by healthcare professionals. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</strong><br />
					The Advisory Council should consider merging Action2.D.1 with Action 2.A.3, which calls for the dissemination of "dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum." Both Actions require the convening of an expert panel to develop dementia care guidelines for care providers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong><br />
					To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the draft Plan should consider the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such centers would also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure people with Alzheimer's disease and their families have access to new Alzheimer's therapies</em></strong><br />
					As biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented. This will be particularly important as CMS improves upon the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of Medicare. Due to the absence of any current spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, ACO's may be "penalized" for providing a new treatment to patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse those new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Primary Care Doctors, Geriatricians, Geriatric Psychiatrists and Neurologists should be adequately reimbursed for patient care and the evaluation of cognitive function including psychometrics and caregiver education and counseling</em></strong>.<br />
					Unless doctors are appropriately reimbursed, the complex needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease will not be addressed. Anticipatory care planning and comprehensive treatment management in a setting where transitions and treatable concomitants of Alzheimer's disease are understood will result in better care. Such practices may delay the onset and progression of disabling clinical symptoms, and allow meaningful function, reduce healthcare costs, and improve the quality of life for individuals with the disease and their family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop Quality Care Measures for People with Alzheimer's and their Family</em></strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop Alzheimer's disease specific quality care measures. Information on these measures should be captured through the use of Health IT tools to track care quality and outcomes.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop guidelines that can be provided to provider groups.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</strong><br />
					Similar to Action 2.A.3 HHS should quickly convene a panel of experts to develop consensus for appropriate assessment tools and identify strategies for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					HHS should compile an inventory of tools to assist caregivers from federal and state agencies as well as patient advocacy organizations and make these tools readily available within the next year through the state aging networks.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong><br />
					HHS should convene stakeholders to develop guidelines for hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's and disseminate guidelines through national associations and hospital systems.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds the draft plan for including goals and strategies that will improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that the plan includes recommendations from LEAD to expand proven programs that are in place at the federal, state and local levels that provide adequate care and support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families. Moving forward it is important that the plan provide adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.3: Utilize informatics for caregivers and persons with AD</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the word "informatics" in the title of this Action be changed to "Health IT" to be consistent with the accompanying language. Identifying and capturing information about caregivers, in particular family caregivers, by health IT applications will help to better coordinate care of both the person with Alzheimer's or other dementias and the caregiver. Capturing information about the health of family caregivers on medical records has an added benefit of supplying data for metrics that can be used to track the impact of programs on both family caregivers and their care recipients. Data would allow for the comparison of patients with and without family caregivers as well as track health impacts on family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include identifying interventions that are successful in improving the health and wellness of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Many successful evidence based programs have been proven to work for both people with Alzheimer's and other dementias so it is important that the evaluation of such programs is not limited to only Alzheimer's specific interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include the evaluation of innovative interventions aimed at helping people with Alzheimer's and other dementias remain in the community rather than in long term care or other institutional settings.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure adequate resources for programs and services supported by AoA's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP)</em></strong><br />
					ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve Goal 3 in the Draft Plan, funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families at the community level.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Include services for mental and behavioral health services</em></strong><br />
					Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of needed health services available to individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with these individuals, their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of effective behavioral and mental health interventions.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.1: Identify culturally sensitive materials and training</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene an expert panel to develop an inventory of culturally sensitive materials and trainings available and identify gaps that should be filled by government and patient advocacy organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong><br />
					Utilizing its current inventory of federal agency programs and materials, HHS should make these resources readily available to all caregivers through the state aging programs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a meeting of partner organizations to identify successful evidence based interventions by community based organizations and quickly work to ensure that more people with Alzheimer's and their families have access to successful programs as identified in Action 3.B.4. There are already programs exist that LEAD recommends that HHS should expand as part of this effort:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.B.6: Share lessons learned through VA caregiver support strategies with federal partners</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the quarterly meetings identified in this action step commence as soon as possible so that important information is gathered and shared among federal programs and with community based providers.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress </strong></p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Establish a coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's disease care, research, and education within the federal government</em></strong><br />
					LEAD members strongly recommended that there be a permanent office or other coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's care, research, and education within the federal government. An office in the White House, like that established for HIV/AIDS, would be in a position to coordinate efforts across HHS, DOD and the VA as well as the Departments of Treasury and State and the Office of Management and Budget, in order to assure comprehensive coordination of a national and international effort to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's by 2025. Section 2c of the National Alzheimer's Project Act lays the groundwork for a coordinating function with HHS itself by establishing in the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services that:</p>
<ol><li>the Secretary or the Secretary's designee be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's; (and)</li>
<li>Provide information and coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies.</li>
</ol><p>Both the Act itself and those volunteering their time and expertise on the Advisory Council, its work groups, and those assembled by supporting private entities such as LEAD, have envisioned a lasting presence to drive and coordinate Federal and private efforts to defeat Alzheimer's. We recommend that a permanent role be established within the White House as well as in the Office of the Secretary of HHS at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level as National Coordinators of Alzheimer's Plan Implementation. These individuals will be responsible not only for reporting on the progress of the National Plan as provided by the National Alzheimer's Project Act, but also for driving forward aggressive coordination and rationalization of Federal resources with private and global efforts to defeat Alzheimer's by 2025.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Project Act, with bi-partisan support from the Congress, places the responsibility for this function with the office of the Secretary of HHS. A separate person within that office reporting to the Secretary may have a "bully pulpit" but would not have the administrative apparatus to function effectively. Ideally, this role would fall to an official whose full time job is pursuing an end to Alzheimer's in as highly placed a position as possible.</p>
<p>Similarly, locating this HHS responsibility elsewhere within HHS could dilute its importance. The National Institutes of Health, for example, focus on research, not care or education. The Administration on Aging focuses on care and education, not research.</p>
<p>The office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation has begun the implementation of the Plan efficiently and in good time. The professional staff has the institutional knowledge and, all indications are, commitment to the Plan to move it forward. What remains is the appointment of an individual within that office and at the level of a deputy assistant secretary whose full time responsibility is to fulfill the aspirations of the Act, the Advisory Council, Congress, and others who support it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Data Standards</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The Problem </strong></em><br />
					One of the inefficiencies in clinical trials is that data collected by different pharmaceutical companies as well as academic research sites is highly variable. The wealth of data from research holds great potential to advance scientific and regulatory work, but the lack of standardized data creates significant challenges. Variable data can impede a FDA reviewer's ability to perform integral tasks such as rapid acquisition, analysis, storage and reporting of regulatory data. Improved data quality, accessibility and predictability will give reviewers more time to carry out complex analyses, ask in-depth questions and increase review consistency. <a href="http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf">http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf</a> -</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Both FDA CDER and CBER are encouraging the use of data standards by industry into an accepted format such as that created by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) or Health Level Seven International (HL7). <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm">http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm</a> <a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm">http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm</a></p>
<p>Another potential for use of standardized data is the ability to create larger databases from smaller clinical trials and increase statistical power. Collecting AD data into large databases that can be mined will enable improved clinical trial design and patient selection for research, qualification of biomarkers for use in research, and decisions on the effects of novel therapeutics. An example of how a large database built on pooled AD data can contribute to the knowledge base is the use of modeling and simulation to provide a quantitative model of AD progression as performed by the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD). Indeed, opportunities afforded by AD data standards and data sharing have the potential to reduce costs of clinical trials and accelerate the translation of research into new therapies for the millions of patients and their loved ones affected by Alzheimer's Disease. Making data publically available allows more scientific investigators to perform AD research and provide new insights. A public database can increase collaboration and initiative from multi-disciplinary experts.</p>
<p>Medical research data on Alzheimer's patients should be collected in uniform data standards that are the same if the studies are done in San Francisco, Shanghai or Sydney.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br /><strong>AD Data Standards</strong><br />
					Require or strongly encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored AD clinical trials to use the same AD CDISC data standards to facilitate data sharing and regulatory authority (FDA and EMA) review.</p>
<p>Remap data AD clinical trial data rich in biomarker data, as ADNI and ADCS, to the same common AD CDISC data standards.</p>
<p>Develop common data standards and measurements for questionnaires that assess cognition and functional status. Engage copyright holders of AD questionnaires to allow an additional layer to capture recording of these instruments into AD CDISC data standards.</p>
<p>Foster the development of standardization of methods for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes and establish a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards.</p>
<p>Post data from federally-funded and industry sponsored AD clinical trials and recorded in AD CDISC data standards into a common AD database (as the CAMD database) available for qualified research use. Include data from placebo and if possible, active intervention arms</p>
<p>Promote the use of AD data standards in clinical practice/ Electronic Health Records (EHR) to collect data seamlessly that can be aggregated and analyzed for research.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Common informed consent form for AD clinical studies</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					The final report of the Alzheimer's Study Group emphasized that patients are critical contributors to clinical development. There was a call for patients to be made aware that they can speed the search for new treatments by enrolling in clinical trials, contributing tissue samples, and allowing the use of their medical records for research. Human subjects, research funding, and time are all in limited supply. Clinical research on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) must develop methods to assure that resources are used wisely and strategically. The informed consent form is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a single study and specific purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data are essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. Even though data sharing is a requirement in NIH funded studies, misunderstandings and overly restrictive consent forms restrict access to data collected under NIH funding and industry clinical trials as well.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Obtaining de-identified data from AD clinical trials, multicenter and single site studies, and pooling these data to build large databases is a critical step in providing the necessary research infrastructure to gain an understanding of a disease as complex as Alzheimer's and to examine significant scientific issues such as biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong><br />
					We recommend a mechanism to let Alzheimer's patients allow their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study and that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger AD databases to allow datamining and increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of AD, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p>The National Health Council has conducted surveys and issued reports such as the Electronic Health Information Exchange: A Live Strong Report describing that "87 percent of patients strongly agree that EHR should provide patients with a way to share their medical information with scientists doing research -- as long as the information cannot be linked to them personally."</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Making the case for Public Private Partnerships for NAPA</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					A crisis in medicine today is that there are increasing investments in biomedical research but decreasing numbers of new medical products, especially drugs, that obtain FDA approval and are available to patients.<sup>1, 2</sup> In order to respond to this crisis, the field of drug development is undergoing transformational changes.</p>
<p>Taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product that finally reaches patients faces overwhelming challenges including the long length of research, high rate of failures of potential candidates and enormous costs. This research and development process is so difficult it is called the "Valley of Death." As many as 80-95% of promising drug candidates fail.<sup>3, 4</sup> Drug companies will spend tens of thousands to perform research on millions of compounds and spend in excess of a billion dollars over a 10- to 20-year period just to have one drug reach patients.<sup>5</sup> A pressing example is Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for which diagnosis is difficult and there are only a few FDA approved treatments to temporarily slow the disease but no cure, at a time when this debilitating disease is exploding in the aging population. In fact, the pace for development and FDA approval of Central Nervous System (CNS) drugs is even longer than other drug classes.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>These challenges mean that companies have to be smarter and more efficient in managing drug discovery and development. Innovation is needed to create greater efficiencies to help move therapies through development, review and approval for patient use. John Castellani, President PhRMA, stated that "The regulatory process is a strategic priority that if done right can reduce time, cost and uncertainty in drug development."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong>:<br />
					Increasingly, public private partnerships (PPP) are presenting an opportunity to meet these challenges. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Innovation comes from focusing on science that can improve the process of drug development and be applied to regulatory decisions. Efficiencies come from building collaborations and sharing.</p>
<p>The flagship success of PPPs in AD is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (<strong>ADNI1</strong>), a $60 million, 5-year study to test whether imaging and biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments could measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Begun by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and supported by other federal agencies, private-sector companies and organizations, the ADNI1 investment would have been prohibitive for a single stakeholder. However, ADNI1 has transformed the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD. Additionally, many other PPPs are having an impact in AD, some of which are described below:</p>
<p><strong>ADNI2</strong>: Approximately 1,000 people aged 55 to 90 will be followed with imaging and biomarker measures to identify who is at risk for AD, track progression, and devise tests to measure the effectiveness of potential interventions. This ~ $60 million study is funded by NIH and companies.</p>
<p><strong>FNIH Biomarkers Consortium</strong>: One project is the first part of a multi-phased effort to utilize ADNI samples to construct multiplex panels in plasma and CSF to diagnose patients with AD and monitor disease progression.</p>
<p><strong>Alliance for Aging Research</strong>: The Alliance initiated Accelerate Cure/Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease, a coalition of national organizations representing patients, providers, caregivers, consumers, older Americans, researchers, employers, and health care industries seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for AD.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association Global Standardization</strong>: This organization is leading global efforts to standardize Alzheimer's biomarkers with the World Wide AD Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) and the Alzheimer's Association Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Quality Control Program.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable</strong>: Members facilitate the development and implementation of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease by collectively addressing obstacles to research and development, clinical care and public health education.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Path Institute's Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD)</strong>: CAMD accelerates the development of therapies for AD by advancing drug development tools for regulatory approval. CAMD developed AD data standards with CDISC, a pooled clinical trial database with 6,000 patients, and a clinical disease progression model. CAMD obtained regulatory approval for imaging biomarkers from the EMA and is collaborating with the FDA on CSF and imaging biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Path Institute's Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium</strong>: A workgroup is developing and evaluating a PRO instrument on MCI for use in clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new AD drugs.</p>
<p><strong>IMI PharmaCog</strong>: The five-year €20M PharmaCog project, funded under the European Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI), will provide tools to define the potential of a drug candidate, reduce the development time of new drugs and thus accelerate the approvals of promising new medicines.</p>
<p>While the impact of these PPPs is extensive, there are still significant challenges and opportunities for preventing and treating AD. One challenge is in the regulatory arena. For approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company engages exclusively with the regulatory agency and all information within the drug approval process is proprietary. Lessons learned from one AD drug trial are not shared, so any insights on why drugs fail or how particular biomarkers track with disease progression are lost. However, in recognizing the need for change, the FDA established an innovative approach in the Critical Path Initiative. The FDA formalized a process for submitting tools as biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments to be "qualified" for specific uses in supporting drug development.<sup>7</sup> Tools that receive a designation of "fit for use" from the FDA's qualification process8 can then be widely shared.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br />
					Providing the extensive evidence needed for qualification of tools by regulatory authorities can optimally be carried out through public-private partnerships. PPPs can support publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification.</p>
<p>The challenge then becomes funding PPPs that move products toward regulatory approval. The cost of qualification for a single biomarker is several million dollars over a time frame of up to 5 years. Such costs require significant investment by both public and private sectors and in-kind contributions in order to be successful. However, the end product is a tool that FDA can have confidence in to produce better data and be used by all drug companies in clinical trials. The result benefits all stakeholders, including patients.</p>
<p>Since not all PPPs conduct research as ADNI does, there needs to be new models of PPP funding, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such an AD PPP could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because PPPs rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided by a multi-stakeholder board to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft HHS National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Comments from the Professional Affairs &amp; Information Committee, National Academy of Neuropsychology</strong></p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of the National Academy of Neuropsychology (NAN), a professional association with 3,500 members dedicated to the advancement of neuropsychology as a science and health profession for the benefit of the culturally diverse patients and caregivers that we serve.</p>
<p>Clinical neuropsychologists are licensed, independent doctoral level practitioners with special expertise in the applied science of brain-behavior relationships. We provide neurocognitive assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and integrated support of culturally diverse patients (and their caregivers) suffering from a variety of neurological, medical, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD; cf. Goals 2, 3 &amp; 4 of the Draft HHS Plan). Our patients are referred by a variety of medical specialties. Neuropsychological assessment measures brain functioning with standardized, well-researched tests of attention, processing, memory, language, spatial, motor, sensory, and executive functions as well as social-emotional aspects of behavior and mood (cf. NINCDS-ADRDA, Goal 1 of the Draft HHS Plan). This information aids diagnosis, medical management, placement, and practical life-related patient and caregiver decisions and can stage disease progression and recovery (consequent to future biological interventions). Neuropsychologists are most often located in metropolitan areas, but many have developed part time rural practices to serve outlying communities, and consult with general clinical psychologists and primary care physicians in rural areas.</p>
<p>We thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the Draft HHS National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the effort and diligence of the HHS staff and of the National Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services in guiding the agenda for AD research and services which will positively impact the lives of the patients and caregivers that all of us serve. We would also like to thank you for including Psychology in your revised document, given the role that many psychologists play in service to AD patients and caregivers via research, education, and direct services. While neuropsychologists and psychologists share many things in common, neuropsychologists are more specialized in their knowledge of brain-behavior relationships, neuroanatomy, biological bases of cognition and behavior, standardized neurocognitive assessment, and management of neurodegenerative diseases (such as AD). Neuropsychologists frequently consult with their clinical/counseling psychologist colleagues and provide additional highly specialized diagnostic and intervention planning services for the benefit of AD patients and their caregivers. Below we will provide information regarding the critical role that neuropsychological/neurocognitive assessment plays in AD diagnosis, treatment, education, and research, specifically with regard to linking biomarkers to neurobehavioral phenotypes and clinical presentation. Currently neuropsychology and neurocognitive assessment are not acknowledged in the draft HHS plan. We hope to persuade you to redress this omission.</p>
<p>We want to highlight that neuropsychologists already play an active and instrumental role in AD research (e.g., via understanding the neurocognitive and behavioral profile of the disease, determining early clinical signs and symptoms of the disease, and providing the neurocognitive clinical correlates needed for biomarker research). Neuropsychology also plays a key role in education (e.g., to other medical professionals, to patients and caregivers) and direct care of AD patients and their caregivers (e.g., innovative quality of life programs). Your acknowledgement of neuropsychology's role in the future direction of care and research in AD will help to perpetuate neuropsychology's involvement in research and innovative service programs of importance to the Alzheimer's community. Conversely, exclusion of neuropsychologists from the Draft HHS Plan may limit opportunities for neuropsychologists to remain active in AD research, education, and clinical service, and this could seriously disadvantage AD patients and caregivers who are amidst the AD experience.</p>
<p>Specifically, we seek to have neuropsychology included in (1) <strong>Strategy 1.C, Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong>, which stresses the importance of the use of biological markers in the diagnosis of AD. Currently, this section of the document fails to recognize the importance of neuropsychological/neurocognitive markers of the AD phenotype that are currently the gold standard for determining the presence and progression of AD. Additionally, (2) inclusion of neuropsychologists as direct service providers (Strategy 2.A., below) is also critical to AD patients and caregivers needing this help.</p>
<p><strong>1. Strategy 1.C, Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression </strong></p>
<p>Regarding Strategy 1.C, Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression, we offer the following wording suggestions for your consideration (italics ours):</p>
<p><em>Under Strategy 1.C: "Significant advances in the use of imaging and biomarkers in brain, blood, and spinal fluids <strong>in relation to neuropsychological manifestations</strong> have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease, ..." </em></p>
<p><em>and/or </em></p>
<p><em>Action 1.C.1: "Identify imaging and biomarkers <strong>in relation to sensitive neuropsychological measures</strong> to monitor disease progression." </em></p>
<p>In support of these suggestions we offer the following information and references:</p>
<p>Neurocognitive decline is the hallmark of AD, and according to the NIH neurocognitive assessment is essential to the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, along with clinical history (symptoms and their course), medical tests (such as blood work), and neuroimaging (<a href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis">http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis</a>). Also, While the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association workgroup on diagnostic guidelines for AD has recommended continued research on biological markers, they continue to consider AD to be a clinical diagnosis based on neurocognitive and functional data,<sup>1,2</sup> which are hallmarks of neuropsychological evaluation at very sensitive and detailed levels.</p>
<p>In general, the cognitive screening tests used in the medical context lack sensitivity to early cognitive decline<sup>3</sup>, and this is further complicated when assessing premorbidly intellectually bright or well-educated patients. Neuropsychological assessment, using standardized and demographically normed tests of cognition, is known to be more sensitive to early cognitive decline.<sup>4</sup> Further, neuropsychologists are listed by the NIH along with Geriatricians, Geriatric Psychiatrists, and Neurologists, as specialists in assessment who can provide detailed diagnosis of AD(<a href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis">http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis</a>). In fact, clinical neuropsychologists often field referrals from the other three specialties mentioned by the NIH to provide very detailed assessments to assist in their patient evaluations, and often refer to the other specialists for the benefit of AD patients.</p>
<p>Neuropsychology has significantly advanced the research exploring biological markers of Alzheimer disease through the development of very sensitive neurocognitive tests; tests that are critical to early identification of neurocognitive decline (complementing Strategy 1:C of the HHS draft document).<sup>5</sup> In fact, it is not uncommon for a detailed neuropsychological evaluation to detect progressive neurocognitive decline before pathology is observed on neuroimaging such as brain MRI. Such work has assisted countless AD patients and their caregivers to enhance what time they have left, and is now being effectively used by physicians to initiate and monitor the effects of dementia delaying medications (such as cholinesterase inhibitors).</p>
<p>In the final analysis, however, there is still much that needs to be learned of the relationship between AD biomarkers and neurocognitive/functional (neuropsychological) symptoms and outcomes. As Jeffrey Cummings, M.D., noted expert on dementing conditions, has written:</p>
<p><em>The predictive relationship between biomarker changes and clinical outcomes is critical to their successful utilization in AD drug development programs. This is not known for any AD-related biomarker. Preliminary correlations have been established for some clinical outcomes and some biomarkers; it is unknown if changes in a biomarker (such as reduced MRI ventricular enlargement with treatment) will correlate with reduced decline in cognition or function following treatment (p.1482).<sup>6</sup></em></p>
<p>Dr. Cummings' insightful comments lead to at least three conclusions based on the totality of biomarker research to date. First, more work needs to be done, including continued development of very sensitive standardized neuropsychological measures in relation to biomarkers for earlier identification of AD (as a clinical syndrome). Second, while there may be a correlation between biomarkers and clinical manifestations, the correlation is not perfect. Consequently, AD remains a clinical diagnosis at present, and the measurement of neurocognitive decline or enhancement (based on biological intervention) still requires detailed standardized neuropsychological assessment results (i.e., standardized and objective clinical correlates) to help press forward in biomarker research and to benefit AD sufferers. Third, neuropsychological measures are needed within the research itself as the best current means of characterizing the disease for which biomarkers are sought (i.e., neuropsychological markers remain the gold standard for biomarker research).</p>
<p><strong>2. Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care </strong></p>
<p>Regarding the inclusion of neuropsychologists as direct care providers: While clinical neuropsychology and clinical psychology are related, and often work together in a complementary manner in the community for the benefit of AD patients and caregivers, they are not the same specialty. Consequently, we suggest that you consider including "neuropsychologists" (along with "psychologists") as distinct additional providers within "The workforce that cares for people with Alzheimer's disease..." (Strategy 2.A.), and also in receiving HHS information regarding "...dementia curricula and practice recommendations..." (Action 2.A.3).</p>
<p>In closing, NAN again applauds your efforts to aggressively address AD, and we offer our support and services as researchers and clinicians in this endeavor. Thank you for your time in reviewing our comments. Please direct any comments, questions, or concerns to us via the NAN central office.</p>

Your acknowledgement of neuropsychology's role in the future direction of care and research in AD will help to perpetuate neuropsychology's involvement in research and innovative service programs of importance to the Alzheimer's community. Conversely, exclusion of neuropsychologists from the Draft HHS Plan may limit opportunities for neuropsychologists to remain active in AD research, education, and clinical service, and this could seriously disadvantage AD patients and caregivers who are amidst the AD experience.</p>
<p>Specifically, we seek to have neuropsychology included in (1) <strong>Strategy 1.C, Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong>, which stresses the importance of the use of biological markers in the diagnosis of AD. Currently, this section of the document fails to recognize the importance of neuropsychological/neurocognitive markers of the AD phenotype that are currently the gold standard for determining the presence and progression of AD. Additionally, (2) inclusion of neuropsychologists as direct service providers (Strategy 2.A., below) is also critical to AD patients and caregivers needing this help.</p>
<p><strong>1. Strategy 1.C, Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression </strong></p>
<p>Regarding Strategy 1.C, Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression, we offer the following wording suggestions for your consideration (italics ours):</p>
<p>Under Strategy 1.C: "Significant advances in the use of imaging and biomarkers in brain, blood, and spinal fluids <em><strong>in relation to neuropsychological manifestations</strong></em> have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease, ..."</p>
<p>and/or</p>
<p>Action 1.C.1: "Identify imaging and biomarkers <strong><em>in relation to sensitive neuropsychological measures</em></strong> to monitor disease progression."</p>
<p>In support of these suggestions we offer the following information and references:</p>
<p>Neurocognitive decline is the hallmark of AD, and according to the NIH neurocognitive assessment is essential to the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, along with clinical history (symptoms and their course), medical tests (such as blood work), and neuroimaging (<a href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis">http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis</a>). Also, While the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association workgroup on diagnostic guidelines for AD has recommended continued research on biological markers, they continue to consider AD to be a clinical diagnosis based on neurocognitive and functional data,<sup>1,2</sup> which are hallmarks of neuropsychological evaluation at very sensitive and detailed levels.</p>
<p>In general, the cognitive screening tests used in the medical context lack sensitivity to early cognitive decline<sup>3</sup>, and this is further complicated when assessing premorbidly intellectually bright or well-educated patients. Neuropsychological assessment, using standardized and demographically normed tests of cognition, is known to be more sensitive to early cognitive decline.<sup>4</sup> Further, neuropsychologists are listed by the NIH along with Geriatricians, Geriatric Psychiatrists, and Neurologists, as specialists in assessment who can provide detailed diagnosis of AD(<a href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis">http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/diagnosis</a>). In fact, clinical neuropsychologists often field referrals from the other three specialties mentioned by the NIH to provide very detailed assessments to assist in their patient evaluations, and often refer to the other specialists for the benefit of AD patients.</p>
<p>Neuropsychology has significantly advanced the research exploring biological markers of Alzheimer disease through the development of very sensitive neurocognitive tests; tests that are critical to early identification of neurocognitive decline (complementing Strategy 1:C of the HHS draft document).<sup>5</sup> In fact, it is not uncommon for a detailed neuropsychological evaluation to detect progressive neurocognitive decline before pathology is observed on neuroimaging such as brain MRI. Such work has assisted countless AD patients and their caregivers to enhance what time they have left, and is now being effectively used by physicians to initiate and monitor the effects of dementia delaying medications (such as cholinesterase inhibitors).</p>
<p>In the final analysis, however, there is still much that needs to be learned of the relationship between AD biomarkers and neurocognitive/functional (neuropsychological) symptoms and outcomes. As Jeffrey Cummings, M.D., noted expert on dementing conditions, has written:</p>
<p><em>The predictive relationship between biomarker changes and clinical outcomes is critical to their successful utilization in AD drug development programs. This is not known for any AD-related biomarker. Preliminary correlations have been established for some clinical outcomes and some biomarkers; it is unknown if changes in a biomarker (such as reduced MRI ventricular enlargement with treatment) will correlate with reduced decline in cognition or function following treatment (p.1482).<sup>6</sup></em></p>
<p>Dr. Cummings' insightful comments lead to at least three conclusions based on the totality of biomarker research to date. First, more work needs to be done, including continued development of very sensitive standardized neuropsychological measures in relation to biomarkers for earlier identification of AD (as a clinical syndrome). Second, while there may be a correlation between biomarkers and clinical manifestations, the correlation is not perfect. Consequently, AD remains a clinical diagnosis at present, and the measurement of neurocognitive decline or enhancement (based on biological intervention) still requires detailed standardized neuropsychological assessment results (i.e., standardized and objective clinical correlates) to help press forward in biomarker research and to benefit AD sufferers. Third, neuropsychological measures are needed within the research itself as the best current means of characterizing the disease for which biomarkers are sought (i.e., neuropsychological markers remain the gold standard for biomarker research).</p>
<p><strong>2. Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care </strong></p>
<p>Regarding the inclusion of neuropsychologists as direct care providers: While clinical neuropsychology and clinical psychology are related, and often work together in a complementary manner in the community for the benefit of AD patients and caregivers, they are not the same specialty. Consequently, we suggest that you consider including "neuropsychologists" (along with "psychologists") as distinct additional providers within "The workforce that cares for people with Alzheimer's disease..." (Strategy 2.A.), and also in receiving HHS information regarding "...dementia curricula and practice recommendations..." (Action 2.A.3).</p>
<p>In closing, NAN again applauds your efforts to aggressively address AD, and we offer our support and services as researchers and clinicians in this endeavor. Thank you for your time in reviewing our comments. Please direct any comments, questions, or concerns to us via the NAN central office.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Alliance for Aging Research, we thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The Alliance for Aging Research, <a href="http://www.agingresearch.org">http://www.agingresearch.org</a>, is a leading nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating the pace of medical discoveries to improve the universal experience of aging and health. Our work in Alzheimer's disease includes chairing the Accelerate Cure/Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (ACT-AD) Coalition that brings together stakeholders to accelerate development of new treatments; and as an active member of the Leaders Engaged in Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) coalition, serving as co-chair of its research and drug development workgroup.</p>
<p><strong>Thank You and Introduction </strong></p>
<p>We would like to first thank and praise the Administration and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for its swift implementation of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA). In only 14 months since President Obama signed the legislation into law, HHS has appointed the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services, convened the council three times, and developed both a draft framework and draft national plan.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important, we would like to thank you for the Obama Administration's commitment of a $50 million boost in immediate funding for Alzheimer's disease research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2012 and for the $80 million increase in the President's fiscal 2013 budget. The announcement about the availability of these funds marks a historic moment for the country. No previous administration has proposed a research increase specific to this dreaded disease. In addition, the initiative also includes a much-needed increase of $26 million for FY 2013 to enhance support for people with Alzheimer's disease and their family caregivers as well as education for providers and the general public.</p>
<p>We praise HHS for recognizing the importance of the larger demographic shift in the U.S. aging population as a motivator for success of the National Plan, which states:</p>
<p><em>NAPA offers a historic opportunity to address the many challenges facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Given the great demographic shifts that will occur over the next 30 years, including the doubling of the population of older adults, the success of this effort is of great importance to people with AD and their family members, public policy makers, and health and social service providers. </em></p>
<p>The Alliance believes that increased investment in preventing, treating or curing chronic diseases of the aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, is perhaps the single most effective strategy in reducing national spending on healthcare. As you are aware, eighty percent of seniors have at least one major chronic condition and half have two or more. Chronic diseases associated with aging account for more than 75 percent of Medicare and other federal health expenditures. Unprecedented increases in age-related diseases as the population ages are one reason the Congressional Budget Office projects that total spending on healthcare will rise to 25 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2025 from 17 percent today. Simply put, our nation does not have the luxury of time to address the health research needs of this population.</p>
<p>The Alliance recognizes that fiscal restraints are required in the current economic climate, and that the Administration has already extended itself to support Alzheimer's disease funding in the National Plan. However, one of our overall comments is that <strong>funding lines must be developed and additional resources provided to adequately meet the goals of an otherwise ambitious plan</strong>. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) specifically, and NIH in general, will need a funding commitment in the billion dollar range to meet the defined 2025 goal to "prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease"; FDA will need an increase of hundreds of millions to accelerate the regulatory process and promote innovation in the development of Alzheimer's disease treatments; and other agencies from AoA to CMS and HRSA will need additional resources to meet Alzheimer's-specific objectives identified in the plan that are expected to occur in conjunction with implementation of Affordable Care Act programs. The Alliance suggests that HHS create a detailed chart of current (within the next fiscal year) expected federal/private investment in each area and costs associated with meeting each goal and strategy within the plan. Otherwise, a majority of these activities look to be unfunded mandates for federal programs with already limited resources.</p>
<p>Second, the Alliance is pleased that HHS has recognized the data gaps that exist for Alzheimer's disease and has additionally committed $1.3 million for FY 2013 to address them. HHS' use of NIA-generated, peer-reviewed, figures for Alzheimer's disease prevalence is monumental. While seemingly academic, the identification and development of reliable data is the necessary starting point for accurate needs assessment and programmatic response. <strong>Data development is a cornerstone of the plan that the Alliance believes should be integrated throughout each goal as well as remain its own goal</strong>.</p>
<p>Last, the Alliance was disappointed that this draft plan did not include the inventory conducted by the federal interagency working group. It is challenging to comment on the goals and strategies of the draft plan when the rationale behind them is not included as a resource. We understand that this was the first inventory conducted and that certain federal regulations must be met before presenting it in a clear format for the public. However, we wanted to note the issue and <strong>strongly recommend that future draft plans include the inventory to allow for more informed public comment</strong>.</p>
<p>The comments below are organized by the goals and strategies identified in the plan in specific areas where we felt the Alliance had expertise and that were not already being addressed in comments submitted by the research and drug development workgroup that the Alliance co-chairs through LEAD.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>The Alliance praises HHS for setting a goal of 2025 to "develop effective prevention and treatment modalities." We believe that setting this goal makes sense for a number of reasons, including the fact that the NAPA legislation expires in 2025. Goal setting is valuable for mobilizing policymakers and the advocacy community, motivating researchers and industry, and galvanizing public attention and awareness of the issue. The Alliance feels strongly that HHS and NIH should be clear with the public in particular about the state of Alzheimer's disease research to manage expectations. We hope that the upcoming May Alzheimer's Research Summit will include an explanation of this goal that will be captured by the press.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments </strong></em></p>
<p>The Alliance is very supportive of this particular action to "examine ways to speed up the processes for bringing pharmacological treatments to market, including: identifying and validating therapeutic targets; developing new interventions: testing efficacy and safety; and regulatory approval." In fact, the Alliance spearheaded a coalition effort, Accelerate Cure/Treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (ACT-AD) Coalition, <a href="http://www.act-ad.org">http://www.act-ad.org</a>, in 2006 to accomplish similar goals. <strong>HHS should consult with ACT-AD as it moves ahead with this action</strong>.</p>
<p>ACT-AD is a coalition of nearly 50 national non-profit health professional, patient, health provider and consumer organizations seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for Alzheimer's disease. ACT-AD's mission is to support accelerating research for transformational therapies to potentially slow, halt or reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Until the formation of the ACT-AD Coalition, there was no point of advocacy combining the perspectives and commitment of respected advocates for women's health, consumer interests, caregiver support groups and aging interested organizations. ACT-AD is strengthened by the diversity and credibility of those voices and is bringing that strength to bear on critical issues concerning the development, review and approval of a new generation of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Under the current regulatory environment, research being performed today cannot reach patients in time to avert this disaster. CNS drugs take, on average, 13 years from initial animal studies of a drug candidate to approval. A delay of one year negatively impacts the lives of nearly 333,000 patients and their families. While these figures underscore the urgency of seeking more effective therapeutic interventions for patients with Alzheimer's disease, there are promising treatments being tested that may slow, halt or reverse Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The ACT-AD Coalition works with urgency to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for Alzheimer's disease. The methods the Coalition uses to conduct its important work include:</p>
<ul><li>Educating healthcare professionals, providers and other key constituencies about ways to focus the attention of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials and other decision makers about the need to expedite Alzheimer's disease treatments in the crowded landscape of those vying for consideration and action.</li>
<li>Advancing ACT-AD's profile with the Food and Drug Administration officials and other key influencers and audiences as an organization that has critical mass and strategic focus to sustain a long-term commitment to improving the regulatory review of Alzheimer's disease drugs.</li>
<li>Initiating efforts to build support for FDA reform among key Congressional leaders who influence appropriations necessary for Agency reform.</li>
<li>Developing needed research and link Alzheimer's disease expertise to the Food and Drug Administration in order to support their efforts to prioritize drug review with a comprehensive, multidisciplinary base of facts.</li>
<li>Mobilizing support and pressure upon the Food and Drug Administration from outside the agency, especially through ACT-AD member organizations and collaborations with other third-party organizations.</li>
<li>Engaging the caregiver population that continues to be overburdened and unfocused on the need for political and regulatory reform.</li>
</ul><p>The ACT-AD Coalition holds periodic meetings with its members and representatives of the Food and Drug Administration. Scientific workshop topics have included clinical meaningfulness and Phase II trial issues--and the focus is always on areas relating to an open dialogue between the Food and Drug Administration and Alzheimer's disease community to advance efforts to combat the illness.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>Our nation faces an impending healthcare crisis as the number of older individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other complex health needs increasingly outpaces the number of healthcare providers with the knowledge and skills to adequately care for them. If current workforce trends do not change, we will continue to fail to ensure that every older American is able to receive high-quality care. The Institute of Medicine's (IOM) April 2008 report, "Retooling for an Aging America: Building the Health Care Workforce," calls for immediate investments in enhancing the geriatric competencies of the entire workforce, increasing the recruitment and retention of geriatric specialists and caregivers, and improving the way that care for older adults is delivered.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care </strong></p>
<p>First, direct-care workers provide critical support to older adults in need of long-term care, providing eight out of every ten hours of paid service delivered.<sup>2</sup> This field, which is increasing at three times the rate of other jobs within the United States economy, provides the best opportunity for caring individuals to obtain vital employment positions.<sup>3</sup> There is also a significant shortage of health professionals and direct-care workers with specialized training in geriatrics and an even greater shortage of the geriatrics faculty needed to train the entire workforce. Title VII Geriatrics Health Professions programs are the <strong>only</strong> federal programs that increase the number of faculty with geriatrics expertise in a variety of disciplines and offer critically important geriatrics training to the entire healthcare workforce. Title VIII Geriatrics Nursing Workforce Development Programs are the primary source of federal funding for advanced education nursing, workforce diversity, nursing faculty loan programs, nurse education, practice and retention, comprehensive geriatric education, loan repayment, and scholarship.</p>
<p>The $6 million investment by the Administration for "provider education and outreach" will barely scratch the surface in addressing shortages in geriatric workforce and training outlined in actions under Strategy 2.A. <strong>Much more substantial investment is needed to fund the recommendations by IOM and we suggest that HHS revisit that report and the three others that came before it</strong>.</p>
<p>Even if more students enter geriatrics training, incentivizing them to stay will require loan forgiveness options. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) introduced S. 1095, the "Caring for an Aging America Act" that <strong>would amend the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) requirements to add geriatrics and gerontology to the permanent eligibility</strong>. This small change in the language governing eligibility for NHSC loans would mean that geriatrics and gerontology specialists would always be eligible for NHSC loans as opposed to the current situation which is that these geriatrics and gerontology specialists can only participate in the program if the HHS Secretary so designates it. An additional advantage is that <strong>the loan forgiveness would be fully funded through the NHSC</strong>.</p>
<p>By 2030, our nation will require 3.5 million additional healthcare professionals and direct-care workers to fulfill the growing demand for care. <strong>The National Health Care Workforce Commission, established by the Affordable Care Act, will play a central role in formulating a national strategy for bolstering the healthcare workforce in order to meet the needs of the escalating number of older Americans</strong>. There is no mention of the commission in Strategy 2A.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services </strong></p>
<p>We are concerned that the use of warning signs to promote early detection by providers and patients may create confusion in the public. Warning signs for Alzheimer's disease have not been validated and are not promoted as screening instruments; however, concern has been raised that individuals experiencing cognitive deficits and their families may treat warning sign lists as a screening tool.<sup>4</sup><strong>Although warning signs are publicized by several national organizations for educational purposes, they are not a substitute for a structured screening or consultation with a primary care provider</strong>. Further, the utility of these warning signs is questionable since the individuals in whom these problems are first noticed are frequently well into a dementia course. In addition:</p>
<ul><li>Most of the warning signs may be indicative of a number of other health issues, including everything from depression (changes in mood/personality) to transient ischemic attack (problems with language/disorientation). There is often no mention that these warning signs may indicate other conditions.</li>
<li>By the time any one or more of the warning signs presents the individual may be in the early moderate/moderate stage at best so "early detection" is a misnomer.</li>
<li>Warning signs may be useful in raising public awareness about Alzheimer's disease. However, elevating warning signs to an early detection tool and then placing the onus of recognition on those with the illness and their loved ones is not sound policy--especially given that anosognosia (unawareness of a problem of cognition in oneself, usually to the point of vigorously denying the problem) is a common symptom for individuals with the disease.</li>
<li>Moreover, promoting the use of warning signs among individuals and family caregivers may serve as a disincentive to providers to learn more about proper, proactive detection methods.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes </strong></p>
<p>Behavioral issues are a main reason that psychoactive medications are administered in long-term care settings, which may result in increased falls, increased mortality and increased confusion. There has been increased focus on the use of "atypical" antipsychotic medications in particular, after FDA introduced its black box warning in 2005 and for "conventional" antipsychotics in 2008 for patients with dementia.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>In May 2011 the HHS Office of the Inspector General released a report Medicare Atypical Antipsychotic Drug Claims for Elderly Nursing Home Residents," which found that over a six month period from January-June 2007, 51 percent of Medicare claims for atypical antipsychotic drugs were erroneous, amounting to $116 million.<sup>6</sup> The report found that over 726,000 of the 1.4 million atypical antipsychotic drug claims for elderly nursing home residents did not comply with Medicare reimbursement criteria. The claimed drugs were either not used for medically accepted indications as supported by the compendia or not documented as having been administered to the elderly nursing home residents. The OIG report concludes "We suggest that CMS either use its existing authority or seek new statutory authority to <em>prevent payment</em> [emphasis added] and hold nursing homes responsible for submitting claims for drugs that are not administered according to CMS's standards regarding unnecessary drug use in nursing homes."</p>
<p>The two main reasons for overuse of antipsychotics in nursing home residents with dementia are 1) understaffing and 2) lack of training. Required staff ratios have been suggested for years by nursing home advocates but Congress is reluctant to touch the issue. Training was somewhat addressed in the Affordable Care Act as part of the Nursing Home Transparency provisions, but the training section only applies to nursing assistants--not supervisors. <strong>Dementia training for nursing home staff should apply to nursing supervisors as well as assistants</strong>.</p>
<p>What makes the issue even more complicated is that there is valid use for antipsychotics in the treatment of dementia-related psychosis. A September 2011 report, a comparative effectiveness review prepared for AHRQ's Effective Health Care Program by the Southern California Evidence-based Practice Center, based at the RAND Corporation, found statistically significant evidence for risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine, for the off-label indications of dementia.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>There are provisions in the Nursing Home Reform Law, enacted in 1987, that clearly define appropriate use of psychoactive drugs, circumstances when antipsychotic drugs should be limited and provides for review of a patients drug regimen. CMS guidance to surveyors in the State Operations Manual8also encourages facilities to use non-pharmacological alternatives, identifies situations where antipsychotic medications are not indicated,9 and provides an investigative protocol for unnecessary drugs, including antipsychotic drugs. Despite these strong provisions antipsychotic drug use remains a serious concern, in part because the law, regulations, and surveyor guidance are inadequately and ineffectively enforced. <strong>Stronger enforcement of these standards would make an enormous difference</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>As HHS considers ways to strengthen its National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, the Alliance looks forward to working with you. Thank you for considering our views, and please do not hesitate to contact Alliance for Aging Research Director of Public Policy Cynthia Bens if you have any questions or would like additional information.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Public Input on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>GE Healthcare appreciates this opportunity to provide input and comments on the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Our comments focus on the use of diagnostics to help physicians diagnose and treat disease and to reduce the burden of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementias on patients and their caregivers.</p>
<p>GE Healthcare, a division of the General Electric Company, has decades of expertise in medical imaging and information technologies, medical diagnostics, patient monitoring systems, performance improvement, drug discovery, and biopharmaceuticals manufacturing technologies. GE Healthcare's broad range of products and services enables healthcare providers to offer patients earlier and better diagnosis and treatment of cancer, heart disease, neurological diseases, and other conditions that threaten the quality and length of life. Worldwide, GE Healthcare employs more than 53,000 people committed to serving healthcare professionals and their patients in more than 100 countries.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of Comments</strong></p>
<p>Our comments and recommendations focus on the following issues:</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis, Monitor, Treatment and Prevention</strong>: The magnitude of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the US is overwhelming; Alzheimer's disease affects 1 in every 8 older Americans and nearly half of those ages 85 and older. As the number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias grows in the future, aggregate payments for their care will increase dramatically from $183 billion in 2011 to an estimated staggering $1.1 trillion by 2050.</p>
<p>While an estimated 5.4 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, the Alzheimer's Association reports that half of them lack a specific diagnosis. This represents a fundamental gap that is identified in the Draft National Plan. To address this gap, the Plan calls for increased efforts to identify disease, diagnose AD and monitor disease progression.</p>
<p>New diagnostic technologies suggest benefits in early screening and utility in determining treatment pathways. Specific diagnostic tests including brain imaging may aid practitioners and caregivers to implement care plans early in the disease process.</p>
<p>For treatment decisions, new diagnostic imaging technologies may help inform and guide healthcare providers when making decisions ranging from pharmacologic choices to duration of therapy. In addition, technological advancements in diagnostics using brain imaging may serve useful in drug development as they allow researchers to stratify patient populations according to the extent and anatomic distribution of pathophysiology and then to measure the effect of tehapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>For non-medical purposes, diagnostic tests offer patients and caregivers information that may enable the initiation of preventive measures like exercise (both cognitive and physical), time to make life planning decisions and understanding of the course of the disease.</p>
<p>Because AD progresses in the brain for as long as a decade before classic signs and symptoms become clear to diagnosticians, early detection of the pathophysiology is crucial to effective intervention and better health for those affected.</p>
<p><strong>GE Healthcare's Effort To Address Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD)</strong>: For decades, GE Healthcare has invested heavily in R&amp;D to bring to market an increasing number of molecular medical diagnostic products; companies like GE Healthcare translate scientific and medical discoveries into innovative products and services that add objectivity to clinical trials and every day practice of medicine to help physicians prescribe the right drug at a dose which is right for their patients.</p>
<p>By example, these advances have begun to change the paradigm for treatment of diseases such as cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Access To New Technologies</strong>: While predictive testing and risk assessment have evolved rapidly over the past decade, the adoption of new diagnostic imaging procedures comes with challenges. GE Healthcare is pleased that cognitive testing has been added to the routine physical exam in Medicare as a screening tool. Nevertheless, the benefits of new brain imaging or molecular imaging diagnostic tests have not been widely recognized by payers that see limited value in early diagnosis when treatment choices are limited. We support the many action items included in the draft plan that will accelerate the development and adoption of important diagnostic imaging tools.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: We encourage the inclusion of action items in the Plan that stress the need for Medicare to provide access to the health benefits of diagnostic imaging technologies, as well as other innovative technologies while under a doctor's care within the practice of medicine.</p>
<p>GE Healthcare also supports the draft Plan's focus on accelerating research aimed at preventing, diagnosing and treating this debilitating disease, and strengthening care quality and efficiency of care both before and after new treatments become available. Patients and their caregivers deserve no less.</p>
<p>GE Healthcare very much appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on these important issues and looks forward to HHS and the Advisory Council's final recommendations in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. If you have any questions on our comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

<p>Although the official comment period has closed for the NAPA draft plan, I'm writing today to urge you to go bolder with the final plan to be released by HHS later this month.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is a cruel disease. It slowly steals one's intellect, ability to communicate, independence, and dignity, even control over basic bodily functions like eating and caring for personal hygiene. It also places an overwhelming burden on caregivers -- emotionally, physically, and financially.</p>
<p>The commitment to a 2025 deadline in the draft NAPA plan represents a major step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's. I am pleased that the plan recognizes the need for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, compressing the drug development process, accelerating targeted research, and better coordinating activities with other countries.</p>
<p>However, I am one of many concerned Alzheimer's advocates who believe that this first draft fails to present a strategy aggressive enough to achieve the goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's within 13 years. It lacks specificity in terms of timelines and deadlines, provides no path to providing significantly greater resources, and does not hold a single high-level office or individual accountable for the overall plan.</p>
<p>I hope that HHS will address these issues so that the next version of the plan will be bolder.</p>
<p>With the number of Alzheimer's patients expected to triple in the coming decades, we must embrace a plan that eschews a "business-as-usual" approach and tackles Alzheimer's with the urgency and aggressiveness it requires. If not, we stand to lose millions more lives -- and trillions of dollars -- to this disease.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments Regarding Draft National Plan To Address Alzheimer's Disease<br />
					March, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the development of the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, and for the opportunity to submit comments.</p>
<p>The Down Syndrome Research and Treatment Foundation is a national/international 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the mission to stimulate and support biomedical research that will accelerate development of treatments to significantly improve cognition, including memory, learning and speech, for children <strong>and</strong> adults with <strong>Down syndrome</strong>. The major objectives include creating new opportunities for <strong>all</strong> Individuals with Down Syndrome to: 1) Lead more independent lives; 2) Participate more successfully in schools &amp; employment; and 3) Prevent additional early cognitive decline with aging &amp; <strong>Alzheimer's disease</strong>. Since its founding in 2004, DSRTF, through its novel research strategy and grants program, has identified and substantively supported much of the research that has led to the recent rapid and unprecedented advances in Down syndrome cognition research and the first clinical trial with a novel drug candidate to focus on as a primary indication and specifically address overcoming cognitive and behavioral impairments in individuals with Down syndrome by a major international pharmaceutical company, Roche.</p>
<p>We acknowledge and appreciate the explicit recognition, inclusion and designation of attention to intellectual disabilities populations as unequally burdened by Alzheimer's disease within Strategy 2.H: Improve care for populations disproportionally affected by Alzheimer's disease and for populations facing care challenges. However, this is far too limited within the overall plan; it is more than just initiatives addressing only care. As discussed further below, there is a very strong rationale to <strong>explicitly include Down syndrome</strong> in each of the strategies, and designated strategic sub-actions, comprising the National Alzheimer's Plan and resulting initiatives, and Strategy 1 involving fundamental, translational and clinical research in particular.</p>
<p>As research has documented, virtually all individuals with Down syndrome, now numbering more than 400,000 individuals in the US, develop the characteristic neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease by age 40. Research has also shown that, very conservatively, at least 25% increasing to 75% or more of the individuals with Down syndrome between the ages of 40-60 develop the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia and the percentage increases with age. These facts underscore the very significant and important relevance of this population as a key and explicit element to be included not only in the National Alzheimer's Plan but also in the development and implementation of all aspects of the Plan, including research (fundamental, translational, and clinical) to effectively prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease, enhancing care quality and delivery, and expanding supports for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Given these facts, explicit and integral inclusion and consideration of Down syndrome in the Plan and associated initiatives can not only significantly address the significant number of individuals with Down syndrome but also the larger non-Down syndrome population developing or with Alzheimer's disease. This requires significant increases in awareness and rational considerations among researchers and clinicians, which can be partly addressed through explicitly including Down syndrome more prominently in the Plan as well as in resulting initiatives and increased proportional funding.</p>
<p>Given the significant size of the Down syndrome population (&gt;400,000 in the US, and up to 10-times that number worldwide) and the virtual certainty that the individuals will develop the characteristic neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease and ultimately the associated dementia further compromising their cognition and life, inclusion of Down syndrome, particularly in the research initiatives (fundamental, translational, and clinical) would significantly contribute important novelty, unavailable otherwise, to as well as enhance and accelerate essentially all aspects of the major objectives specified under Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 as well as Goal 2. NIH grants and funding for <strong>all</strong> of Down syndrome research have remained disproportionately very low, e.g. $20M in FY 2011. This includes a much smaller and too limited subset of research grants investigating the aspects of Alzheimer's disease associated with Down syndrome. As only one contrasting example, explicit and significant attention and funding by NIH and its Alzheimer's disease research initiatives, both basic and translational, have been targeted to so-called dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease, both basic and translational (see e.g., the DIAN initiative) that is much more rare and with a much smaller population. In both Down syndrome and dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease myriad research has confirmed the significant involvement of the same gene, APP, and its products (The APP gene is located on human chromosome 21, the chromosome trisomic in Down syndrome, as are a number of additional genes demonstrated to be involved in mechanisms associated with Alzheimer's disease.). Through more detailed and sufficient investigations in the Down syndrome population, researchers can obtain invaluable insight into how and why Alzheimer's disease develops, and can compare and extend their findings to the much more common late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease as well as enhance and accelerate development of new therapeutics. The relevant trajectory to Alzheimer's disease and size of the Down syndrome population provides a strong rationale for greater recognition and explicit inclusion in the National Alzheimer's Disease Plan and resulting Alzheimer's disease fundamental, translational and clinical research initiatives.</p>
<p>Although by no means an attempt to thoroughly include detailed or exhaustive rationale and recommendations in these comments here, in addition to the suggestions and requests above with respect to more prominent and explicit integral recognition and inclusion of Down syndrome in the ultimate version of the National Alzheimer's plan, I submit the following recommendations for further consideration:</p>
<ul><li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Goal 1 as well as each of the proposed "Actions" under Strategy 1A, including Actions 1.A.1-5.</li>
<li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.B. including Actions 1.B.1-6. This would include not only research in animal models of Down syndrome, but with respect to human clinical studies explicit designation and inclusion of relevant and appropriate cohorts of individuals with Down syndrome, together with and/or in parallel/addition to those clinical studies initiatives involving non-Down syndrome cohorts. The results would be expected to be mutually informative and beneficial.</li>
<li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.C. including Actions 1.C.1-2. Again, given that essentially every individual with Down syndrome develops the characteristic neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease by age 40 with a significant proportion also developing the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia and further increases with age earlier, inclusion of relevant and appropriate cohorts of individuals with Down syndrome, together with and/or in parallel/addition to these research initiatives involving non-Down syndrome cohorts would uniquely provide important relevant and additional information, insights, direction and acceleration of success.</li>
<li>As is true for Alzheimer's disease research and development, relevant Down syndrome research is ongoing, and increasing, internationally. It will be important to coordinate with and expand relevant Down syndrome research internationally and collaboratively. Therefore, explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.D. including Actions 1.D.1-2.</li>
<li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.E. including Actions 1.E.1-3. With respect to Action 1.E.1., again, given that essentially every individual with Down syndrome develops the characteristic neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease by age 40 with a significant proportion also developing the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia and further increases with age earlier, inclusion of relevant and appropriate cohorts of individuals with Down syndrome, together with and/or in parallel/addition to these research initiatives involving non-Down syndrome cohorts would uniquely provide important relevant and additional information, insights, direction and acceleration of success. With respect to Action 1.E.2., inclusion of private-public collaborations and partnerships between Federal entities such as NIH and non-governmental nonprofit organizations such as DSRTF with its focus on Down syndrome cognition research will enhance productivity, accelerate significant progress and success as well as minimize duplications of efforts and resources. With respect to Action 1.E.3., the critical importance of the increasing development and very significant impact of Alzheimer's disease on individual with Down syndrome and their families and care givers underscores the importance of involvement and communication with this community and associated stakeholders.</li>
<li>As indicated above, given the particular and significant relevance and importance of and impact of Alzheimer's disease on the relatively large population of individuals with Down syndrome, their families and caregivers as well as the healthcare system, it is not sufficient to generally designate "intellectual disabilities" in only Strategy 2.H. "Down syndrome" should be explicitly included in proposed Strategies 2.A.-H., 3.A.-E., 4.A.-B. and each of the Actions included under those strategies. Therefore, explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategies 2.A.-H., 3.A.-E., 4.A.-B. and each of the Actions included under those strategies.</li>
<li>Finally, based on the comments, rationale and recommendations outlined above, we would encourage and recommend that a representative from the Down syndrome community be added to the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) Advisory Council, as the important deliberations, priorities and implementation will have mutual benefits to science/research, clinical care, and long term care not just additionally for individuals with Down syndrome and associated Alzheimer's disease but also for the broader population and research efforts involving Alzheimer's disease.</li>
</ul><p>I would be very pleased to further discuss, as may be helpful and informative, any aspects of the above concerning the importance of explicit inclusion and considerations of Down syndrome relating to Alzheimer's disease in further detail with those involved in developing the National Plan, including members of the Advisory Committee. I have registered for and plan to attend the upcoming May 14-15 NAPA/NIH Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit in Bethesda, and look forward to the opportunity for further discussion of the importance and relevance of Down syndrome for the Plan and its successful implementation as outlined above.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>New York Memory Center comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting the public to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." For over two decades New York Memory Center has been on the front-lines of Alzheimer's community-based care. As a pioneer in Social Adult Day programming and Caregiver Supportive Services we welcome the opportunity to provide recommendations for your consideration.</p>
<p>We believe that the five goals outlined in the plan which form the foundation of the National Plan are ambitious, courageous, and seek to offer a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. In comparing the National Plan to the most recent work of the three Sub-Committees, we felt the need to underscore a few key recommendations.</p>
<p>While our ultimate goal is a world without Alzheimer's, we recognize the very real possibility that even with increased financial support to drive a targeted research agenda, we may not put an end to this horrible disease by 2025. Moreover, those living with the disease today and tomorrow deserve the best possible care we can offer. We need better care now. We are concerned that the ultimate research agenda will be too narrow in scope and leave research relative to care practices as a back-burner issue, instead of integrated as a significant component.</p>
<p>In innovative Alzheimer's Adult Day Centers around the country, various non-pharmacological approaches to care such as arts-based programming; cognitive stimulation; exercise and movement training; meditation; learning methods; sensory therapy, cognitive training; tailored diets; communication techniques for managing behavioral symptoms; early stage education designed to maximize independence and efforts to reduce excess disability; and caregiver education, coaching, and counseling are practiced with evident increases in quality of life, and evident reductions in challenging behaviors; and with some interventions, short term improvements in cognition, language and learning. These interventions must be recognized as active treatment for Alzheimer's disease and reimbursed by Medicare.</p>
<p>Although these practices emerged as grassroots movements, we now have significant studies that support many of these interventions as evidence-based or evidence informed practices in the care of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Any plan to invest in research should substantially include non-pharmacological care-based research. Much more research is needed in these areas as positive outcomes are consistently identified by care providers and clinicians as superior to other conventional approaches. We must address the clinical significance of these various approaches to treatment. The small size of most studies, and variability in quality in these areas limits generalization of the results, and discourages widespread practice changes in care settings. What is needed is funding for large, well designed, robust studies in order to influence practice changes nationally.</p>
<p>Today, approximately $30 million dollars of the $479 million dollars devoted to Alzheimer's disease research is earmarked for clinical research in Alzheimer's disease care, support and education. We recommend a substantial increase in this area relative to the overall annual research budget. Research based, non-pharmacological, active treatment needs to be implemented as standard practice. Research must seek to understand what care works, why, and to ensure that the best care is widely practiced nationwide.</p>
<p>One agency missing from the list of participating inter-agency departments and government agencies tasked to help support the development of the national plan is the National Endowment for the Arts. We strongly recommend that this agency have an opportunity to weigh in and support efforts in creating this national plan. Recently, this agency partnered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in creating a white paper framing a national research agenda for the arts, health and well-being.</p>
<p>We believe that HHS should provide federal funds to support a state lead entity in every state--- determined by each Governor for the purpose of developing a state Alzheimer's Strategic Plan. We recommend that this lead agency Chair a state inter-agency committee comprised of other departments in state government which impact the Alzheimer's community, labor, other stakeholders, community service providers, caregivers and at least one resident living in the state with capacity who is living with memory loss to serve on this committee. We believe this committee should be tasked to provide annual updates which compare results to planned goals, and made publicly available to the citizens of each state.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that the plan encourage the development of statewide plans for a full assessment of each state's current service delivery system, and outline a strategic plan for caring for individuals living with Alzheimer's and related dementias now and in the future. The national plan should weigh in on these efforts and seek to reward states for creating and implementing innovative cost savings while improving care outcomes.</p>
<p>We also believe that Administration on Aging Title IIIE Caregiver Support Service Programs can be an effective resource in meeting the needs of the Alzheimer's and related dementia community. With increased funding to the States, these programs could provide memory screenings and referrals to local diagnostic centers in order to receive a full differential diagnosis. Moreover, these programs could take a lead role in case management and care coordination, and in helping families with advanced care planning. We recommend that the plan include increased new funding to states within IIIE that stipulates services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</p>
<p>Medicare must provide an Adult Day Services benefit for persons with dementia. Adult Day Care Services provides active treatment for the person with dementia and support for their caregivers. This is particularly vital for the person with the disease that lives alone and/or has no caregiver. Medicaid should include Adult Day Services as a state option. Simply put, public policy discriminates individuals with a dementing disease. Medicare and Medicaid provide coverage for active treatment of medical and functional needs related to disease processes but does not include active treatment for individuals with dementia. These services allow adults with memory loss to be safe, socially connected, and therapeutically supported in order to maintain functional abilities as long as possible and avoid premature institutionalization. Moreover, this provides caregivers needed respite in order to extend their ability to care for their loved ones at home.</p>
<p>The cost savings to our long-term-care system would be tremendous relative to the over usage of home care, and nursing homes. In New York State the average cost for Adult Day Services is approximately $80 per day--- compared to $144 a day for home care, and between $253-376 a day for nursing home care. We must ask ourselves--- why are we--- over-medicalizing long term care services when they are often inappropriate. Adult Day Services provides care in the lease restrictive setting and offers a therapeutic oasis where those living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias can continue to actively participate in the life of a community.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts and recommendations.</p>

<p>Caregiver support: comment/recommendations for a caregiver "proxy" for specific recurring elements/items to obtain AZ care and/or documentation of services. For example, there is a service here in Maryland (maybe all states - but I never utilized it until I moved here). For a fee (that is well worth it) the service is automobile title/tax documentation and filing. This title service obtains the necessary information from the owner of the vehicle and then completes the necessary processes at the title/courthouse to research title, complete documents and file the title.</p>
<p>Something similar could/should be offered to caregivers. They lose many hours from their own work/family/life spending hours dealing with the mandatory documentation/filing/provider visits - Insurance, Medicare, SSI, finances.</p>
<p>Improvements could be gained through informatics and digitalization of records and bioscreen/markers. Obtain information from AZ healthcare proxy/financial proxy caregivers to write a book on a step wise process of what is required by caregivers to file Medicare, SSI, etc. and suggestions on how a business "proxy" service could do this work. And/or how to automate the procedures through functionalities through a software application and with secure/encryption.</p>
<p>Home/housing models: I hear repeatedly that it is cheaper for an AZ patient to live at home (if home is available) than in an institutional setting. That is not true in the current environment. The cost of maintaining 24h/7d care in an AZ patient home is more expensive that placing the AZ patient in an institution. For example, the cost of care in Alabama, is primarily due to in-house sitter/aide - minimum $12-15/hour, is the equivalent of $264-$360/day, equivalent to up to $10,000/month. This does not include cost of housing overhead, food, medications, transportation, clothing, toiletries, taxes. The cost of AZ/dementia care in an assisted living facility is about 50% of that cost (includes housing, utilities, and food). Either cost is excessive and any personal savings are rapidly consumed and then insurance (if coverage purchased), then Medicaid pays.</p>
<p>The only way to reduce or minimize in home care is for volunteer services and/or family live in care. Churches may be a "mission" service and should consider the care/education/services for elderly adultsequivalent to the resources they invest in children services. With improvement of technology, monitoring/tracking devices, virtual monitoring, the care in house may be drastically reduced until the AZ patient is incapable of or has severe reductions in ADLs.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p>While the Draft National Alzheimer's Plan mentions nonpharmacological treatments and initiatives for dementia, it does so in a way that enables these important initiatives to be easily sidelined through lack of funding, lack of understanding and inappropriate research.</p>
<p>We the undersigned believe that the unique and positive alternative paradigm of nonpharmacological interventions in Alzheimer's must be recognized. This paradigm has several key dimensions that the National Alzheimer's Plan must recognize as a legitimate treatment modality for Alzheimer's and related dementias that can significantly improve the lives of those with these conditions and can significantly reduce costs in the care and treatment of those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p>The following must be recognized and included in the plan if these significant care options are to be valued as they clearly need to be so the many millions of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias today and tomorrow receive the quality of life and human rights they deserve.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><em>A DIFFERENT PARADIGM<br />
							Nonpharmacological interventions represent a global paradigm of Alzheimer's treatment; much more than just individual actions such as chocolate, dolls, and environmental design. This paradigm, based on neuroscience theory, applied research, and clinical practice, has been developed by many experts over decades. If this powerful approach to dealing with dementia and reducing symptoms is to be taken seriously, the particulars, no matter how exceptional (such as museum programs for people with Alzheimer's, providing improvisational theatre, or giving chocolate), need to be taken as examplars of a larger way of thinking about Alzheimer's and dementia--a new paradigm--not as ends in themselves. </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE<br />
							There is a huge cache of evidence-based knowledge demonstrating how non-pharmacological interventions reduce symptoms and improve daily lives of people living with dementia and their care partners. This research is often discounted and rejected because although it is meaningful and fits the needs of the evaluation being conducted, it does not fit a particular research model--the double blind randomized controlled trial. It is important to assess these data carefully to calculate the statistical effect sizes they represent and thus their impact on people's lives. </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>METHODOLOGY AND METHODS<br />
							Much existing research is discounted by policymakers, researchers, and others because they are convinced that the only evidence worth counting is generated by double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RCTs represent one important way to generate knowledge; but only one way. Other methodologies contribute substantially to our knowledge of nonpharmacological interventions and need to be taken seriously. It makes little sense to discredit a large body of knowledge that could immensely help policy and decision-making. The following summarizes two alternative ways to think about research methodology. </em></p>
<p><em>The RCT gold standard assumes that 1. It is the highest level of proof, no matter what the research question, 2. It is at the top of a hierarchy of methods where other methodologies are "lower" on the continuum, and 3. That statistical significance is a measure of meaningfulness of a finding. </em></p>
<p><em>The alternative gold standard for nonpharmacological and other research assumes that 1. The best methodology for any research question is the methodology that fits the question best--not any particular one, 2. There is no single continuum of methodology and no absolute hierarchy, and. 3. That effect measures are an important addition to statistical significance as a measure of a finding's "meaningfulness." </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>HUMAN RIGHTS<br />
							Freedom to choose, getting what you want, being part of the larger society and taking part in cultural activities are human rights everyone deserves--including those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias. We ought to be shocked at the limits to human rights being imposed daily on those with dementia (no chocolate and no visits to museums) rather than amazed that human rights are being respected in a few places--Arizona, or New York, or Massachusetts or wherever. </em></p>
<p><em>The World Health Organization defines the rights of all people as dignity, independence, self-fulfillment, participation and care. Respecting these for people living with Alzheimer's could well be a rallying cry for those who care about people living with this condition.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>THE WAY OUT OF THE ETHICAL DILEMMA OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS<br />
							In the name of science and further research, there is a movement taking place to diagnose Alzheimer's disease long before those being diagnosed show any cognitive or behavioral symptoms. Although these tests are presented as limited to research purposes, they are highly likely to be employed in everyday practice. For the millions who will receive this early diagnosis tomorrow and the millions living with this dementia diagnosis today, early diagnosis presents a major ethical dilemma: What to do with a diagnosis if no medications are available that stop the progress of the disease? The nonpharmacological paradigm and its associated interventions represent an ethical way to respond to the call for early Alzheimer's diagnosis since they offer a clear solution to improve the quality of life of people living with dementia. </em></p>
</li>
</ol><p>For these reasons, we urge that an expert and champion of nonpharmacological approaches and treatments for dementia be appointed to generate research, direct information gathering and otherwise serve the needs of those with dementia today employing nonpharmacological approaches.</p>
<p>We also urge the Federal Advisory Panel and others administering research programs for dementia to include on an equal basis in all research, both nonpharmacological treatments and pharmacological ones. By nonpharmacological "treatments" we mean all health related activities that research has demonstrated have positive behavioral and health outcomes. These include, among others: engaging activity, exercise, targeted nutrition, music, visual arts, film, drama, museums, an appropriately designed and stimulating environment, memory books, high-touch end of life care, external written cueing, information technology, training family and formal caregivers, counseling, meditation, yoga, tai chi, exercise, poetry, storytelling, pets, and even chocolate.</p>
<p>We also urge the Federal Advisory Panel and those administering Alzheimer's-focused research programs and Alzheimer's-focused intervention strategies to develop and make explicit key performance indicators suited to nonpharmacological interventions. We also urge them to include in research protocols all evaluation methods and methodologies suited to studying the effects of real-world applications of nonpharmacological treatments. We urge that all research involving treatment of dementia, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions, include reporting the clinical significance of effects produced by treatments, as well as statistical significance.</p>

<p>On behalf of the American Psychological Association (APA), I would like to commend the Department of Health and Human Services, the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services, and the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your efforts to develop and refine the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Enclosed are our APA comments in response to the draft plan released on February 22, 2012. APA is a scientific and professional organization representing psychology in the United States, with 154,000 members and affiliates. APA's mission is to advance the creation, communication, and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives.</p>
<p>APA is eager to collaborate with the Advisory Council, federal agencies, and other organizations in the continued planning and implementation of the National Plan. We will continue to promote the involvement of our members in this important effort and stand ready to recommend psychologists (including researchers, clinicians, and educators) with expertise in a wide array of areas that are critical to the plan's success. These areas include: cognitive aging; neuropsychological and capacity assessment; evidence-based interventions for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers; implementation research, public education and social marketing; palliative care; designing culturally appropriate programs and materials; health provider education and training; integrated health and care coordination models; and dementia guideline development.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions, comments, or concerns to Deborah DiGilio, MPH, Director of APA's Office on Aging.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>American Psychological Association Comments on Draft National Plan</strong></p>
<p>The American Psychological Association (APA) appreciates that the Draft National Plan is responsive to some of the concerns that we raised in January. In particular, we are pleased to see greater attention to clinical trials to test lifestyle interventions, including exercise and cognitive training. These interventions show promise as ways to improve cognitive health, and may in time be shown to prevent or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The second draft's emphasis on recruiting diverse participants to clinical trials is also important.</p>
<p>The ability to image biomarkers has significantly advanced the study of Alzheimer's. What continues to be missing in the current draft is an acknowledgement of the critical role of neuropsychological testing and assessment to measure changes in cognitive performance. Real clinical benefits for those with AD depend on fully understanding how biomarkers relate to cognition and behavior. It is fundamentally important to understand why people with similar amounts of beta amyloid may have very different cognitive profiles. The National Institute on Aging and its funding partners are urged to support additional research that links the presence of biomarkers with changes in cognition and functional behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p><em>Strategy 1A: Identify research priorities and milestones </em></p>
<p>APA supports the convening of a summit to help set research priorities to reach the goals articulated in the National Plan, and the additional strategies to receive broad input and refine and update research goals and priorities as the Plan is put into effect. APA also supports the convening of a workshop on non-Alzheimer's dementias, and offers assistance for this project.</p>
<p><em><strong>In order to clarify the types of research being discussed, APA suggests the following wording changes - with underlined text to be added and struck-through text to be deleted: </strong></em></p>
<p><em>Strategy 1B: Expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease </em></p>
<p>"HHS and its federal partners will expand clinical trials on pharmacologic and <s>non-pharmacologic</s> <u>behavioral</u> ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease and manage and treat its symptoms."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: APA prefers that behavioral studies be given their own name, and that they not be defined only by whether they include a pharmaceutical.</p>
<p>"Action 1.B.1: Expand research to identify the molecular, cellular, <u>and cognitive</u> mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, and translate this information into potential targets for intervention. "</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Certainly molecular and cellular work is vitally important. However, an 'integrated interdisciplinary basic science agenda' for Alzheimer's must also include basic cognitive and behavioral research.</p>
<p><em>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease </em></p>
<p>"Identifying <u>and linking</u> <s>imaging</s> biomarkers <u>and behavioral/cognitive markers</u> in presymptomatic people will facilitate earlier diagnoses in clinical settings, as well as aid in the development of more efficient interventions to slow or delay progression."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Biomarker research is tremendously important, but it is neuropsychological and cognitive measures that enable scientists to link biomarkers to observable clinical symptoms. Biomarker research advances are leading to the ability to diagnose and track AD, but findings cannot be considered complete in the absence of behavioral data. Therefore, the two areas of research should be linked in the plan's language.</p>
<p>Current research demonstrates that neuropsychological measures function well as diagnostic, prognostic, and disease progression indicators (Blacker et al., 2007; Gomar et al., 2011; Jacobs et al., 1995; Tabert et al., 2006). Cognitive measures are critical in the practical and operational (not theoretical) level within all three recognized stages of AD -- pre-clinical, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia -- in recently updated diagnostic guidelines by the NIA-Alzheimer's Association. Therefore, cognitive measures hold the promise of identifying people at the highest risk of developing AD up to 20 years or more before the disease is diagnosed, and are the best measures of potential impact of interventions on disease progression. Particularly as treatments are worked into preclinical phases of AD, improvements in the sensitivity of the cognitive measures to reliable change over time is critically important.</p>
<p>Recent studies in 2010 and 2011, many using ADNI data, have shown that neuropsychological measures are more accurate, earlier predictors of progression to AD when compared to MRI, FDG-PET, and amyloid imaging (Gomar et al., 2011). There is considerable promise in broadening and improving the measurement of cognitive markers of AD. Every piece of the expansion and improvement of AD research will require good (and better) cognitive assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care </em></p>
<p>"The workforce that cares for people with Alzheimer's disease includes healthcare and long-term services and supports providers such as primary care physicians; specialists such as neurologists, <u>neuropsychologists</u>, geriatricians, and psychiatrists; registered nurses and advanced practice nurses; community health workers; social workers; psychologists; pharmacists; dentists; allied health professionals; and direct-care workers like home health aides and certified nursing assistants, who provide care at home or in long-term care facilities. These providers need accurate information about caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease including the benefits of early diagnosis and how to assist caregivers. Physicians need information on how to implement the "detection of any cognitive impairment" requirement in the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit included in the Affordable Care Act. Major efforts by both VA and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), including expanded training opportunities created in the Affordable Care Act, support geriatric training for physicians, nurses, <s>and other health workers."</s> <u>social workers, psychologists, dentists, pharmacists, counselors, and allied health professionals</u>.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: We believe it is important as this plan will direct future efforts and funding in this area, that all geriatric disciplines be explicitly mentioned. Psychologists, social workers, and other health care providers play an integral role in VA interdisciplinary teams to meet the needs of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Accordingly, they are included in the ACA expanded training provisions, and are listed on the BHPR website.</p>
<p><em>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools </em></p>
<p>"The Affordable Care Act created the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. 'Detection of any cognitive impairment' must be included as part of the wellness visit. HHS is using research findings to identify the most appropriate assessment tools that can be used in a variety of outpatient clinical settings to assess cognition. The recommended tools will be distributed to practitioners to aid in identification and evaluation of cognitive impairment and risk for dementia," <u>and to determine the need for referral for a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation</u>.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Neuropsychological evaluation remains a critical component of differential diagnostic methods in discriminating neurodegenerative changes from normal age-related cognitive decline, cognitive difficulties that are related to psychiatric conditions or medical morbidities, and other related disorders. Neuropsychological measures are accurate, early predictors of progression to AD and provide useful information to individuals with dementia and their families regarding the functional capacities of the individual and potential impact of interventions on disease progression.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>"Most of the public is aware of Alzheimer's disease; more than 85 percent of people surveyed can identify the disease and its symptoms. Alzheimer's disease is also one of the most-feared health conditions. Yet there are widespread and significant public misperceptions about the <u>prevention</u>, diagnosis, <u>disease management</u>, and treatment." <u>In addition, there is a lack of public understanding of the differences between normal age-related cognitive change and pathological change</u>.</p>
<p><u>These misperceptions can lead both to delayed diagnosis when family members falsely attribute behavioral and memory issues to normal aging and to faulty diagnosis and harmful avoidance behaviors when families become paralyzed with concern about the stigma and decline associated with Alzheimer's disease. Both misconceptions can prevent families from obtaining needed and appropriate supports. They can also lead to inaction in adopting health promoting behaviors such as physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and refraining from smoking, which may prevent or slow any disease process</u>. "Enhancing public awareness and engagement is an essential goal because it forms the basis for advancing the subsequent goals of the National Plan. A better understanding of Alzheimer's disease will help engage stakeholders who can help address the challenges faced by people with the disease and their families."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: Two top tier messages of this campaign should be: 1) AD is not a normal part of cognitive aging; and 2) there are modifiable risk factors for AD (including diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity or low educational attainment, and physical inactivity) AND actions individuals can take now to reduce their risks. A recent study (Barnes et al, 2011), notes that up to half of AD cases worldwide are attributable to seven potentially modifiable risk factors -- and that a 10-25% reduction in all seven risk factors could potentially prevent as many as 1.1-3.0 million AD cases worldwide.</p>
<p><em>4.A: Educate the public about <u>normal cognitive aging and</u> Alzheimer's disease </em></p>
<p>"Greater public awareness of <u>normal cognitive aging and</u> Alzheimer's disease can <u>encourage individuals and</u> families to <u>participate in cognitive health promoting behaviors and</u> seek assessment, reduce isolation and misunderstanding felt by caregivers, and help link people in need to accurate information, resources and services," <u>when needed</u>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Professor, Researcher and Author comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting the public to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." For over three decades I have worked as an educator at the University level, and therapist with individuals who have either been just diagnosed with early on-set of Alzheimer's Disease, mild- to moderate stages of the disease as well as late stage Alzheimer's disease. In addition, I have taught at Colleges and Universities across the United States as well as in many countries internationally. Being a two time Fulbright Scholar in Global Health Studies, I have dedicated my academic career to both teaching, researching and authoring creative and innovative approaches on how to best provide programming to those afflicted with this disease. I welcome the opportunity to provide recommendations for your consideration.</p>
<p>In recent years, various non-pharmacological approaches to care such as creative arts-based programming; cognitive stimulation; exercise and movement programming; meditation; learning methods; sensory therapy, and cognitive training are recognized in small scale studies and are the basis of research information taught and practiced at the University level in career areas such as Therapeutic Recreation, Creative Arts Therapies, Movement and Dance Therapy and Art Therapy. These non-pharmacological approaches have emerged as a grassroots movement responding to an evolution of evidence, put into research and implemented in Social Adult Day Programs, Assisted living Facilities, and Long Term Nursing Facilities.</p>
<p>However small these studies, research is continuing to suggest that some individuals will slow the progression of dementia and have the potential to improve or revert back to normal memory with early interventions due to structured cognitive stimulation (Pressley, J., Trott, C. &amp; Tang, M., 2003; Chertkow, H., et al., 2001). Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that activities in the mental, physical and social domains have protective effects against cognitive decline and dementia (Flatiglioni, et al. 2004; Gilley, W., Wilson, L., Bienias, L., Bennett, A. &amp; Evans, A., 2004; Claire, L., Wilson, B., Carter, G., Roth, I. &amp; Hodges, J.,2004; Davie, J., et al., 2004). More specifically, continued active participation in life through social involvements and activities that are individualized and person centered to each individuals needs and skills have been documented to enhance feelings of self esteem, self worth and directly impact overall quality of life (Pruessner, J., Lord, C., Meaney, M. &amp; Lupien, S., 2004; Manly, J., et al., 2005; Kumara, R., et al., 2005). A National study of all research related to early stage dementia indicated that the need for psychosocial support for persons newly diagnosed should take place soon after receiving the diagnosis to prevent dropping social support networks, cognitive decline and leading to increased institutionalization rates (Brodaty, H., Gresham, M., &amp; Luscombe, G., 1997; Fernandez-Ballesteros et al., 2003). In a review of the literature regarding early stage AD it has been documented that multi-modal approaches have the most significant outcomes (Burgener, S., et al., 2007). The TTAP Method, a multi-modal approach has been documented in a pilot study (Alders, A. &amp; Levine Madori, L., 2010) to improve cognition in Hispanic elderly in a Social Adult Community Day Center in Buffalo, New York and in a research study with Rehabilitation Patients at Helen Hayes Hospital the method proved to increase overall feelings of self control and pain management (Levine-Madori, L., 2009).</p>
<p>Research in the area of non-pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's care is still being ignored, and yet it continues to remain the most economically sound approach. In a data collection in 2010 on a Gero- psychiatric unit at Lyndon Oaks at Edward Hospital located in Naperville, Illinois, staff was trained in The TTAP Method. Pre- training data collection documented the unit had an average of 90 hours of aggressive interventions a month. These interventions were carried out by a Nursing Supervisor. Six months into staff implementing of thematic person-centered creative arts programming the aggressive behaviors went down to an average of 4.6 Nursing Interventions. Falls went from an average of 5 per month to 3, this statistics validate a direct healthcare savings of over $80,000.00 in just a six moth period. <a href="http://www.levinemadoriphd.com/content/site/educational-courses.php">http://www.levinemadoriphd.com/content/site/educational-courses.php</a> .</p>
<p>A world without Alzheimer's, might very well be a real possibility in the future. However, the current 5.4 million people who currently have the disease and the estimated 10,000 people daily diagnosed each and every day will still need daily non-pharmaceutical innovative programming, treatment and care. As an Art Therapist, Recreation Therapist and Ph.D. it is my belief that the current research agenda is narrow in scope and leaves research in the non-pharmaceutical -creative arts completely out of the discussion. For decades we as a society have poured millions of dollars into pharmaceutical research, which to date has yet to make an impact. It is my belief that it is crucial at this point in time, just as the baby boomers are starting dramatically impact the "graying of America". As you probably are aware, it is estimated by the National Association on Alzheimer 's disease, in 2011, that one of every 8 baby-boomers are predicted to have some form of cognitive impairment in their lifetime.</p>
<p>The time for researching the non-pharmaceutical approaches and putting research into practice is now! Those who have dedicated their lives to people afflicted by this disease process understand that these individuals LIVE with the disease for many years. The average person diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease now lives 15 years and must be given meaningful and person-centered daily therapeutic interventions. Without research we cannot move forward in the healthcare areas such as Art Therapy, Recreation Therapy, Music Therapy, etc. to provide research based, best practice approaches. Please know that these healthcare fields in the Creative Art Therapies, Therapeutic Recreation, and Music Therapy are in fact where daily treatment and ongoing cognitive, social, emotional and physical stimulation comes from. Research money is needed to be earmarked for these healthcare professionals and the research that they do in non- pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's care.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to share thoughts and suggestions with you.</p>

<p>The American Health Care Association (AHCA) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Draft Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease published in <em>Federal Register</em> Volume 77, Number 37, pages 11116 - 11117 (February 24, 2012).</p>
<p>AHCA represents nearly 11,000 non-profit and proprietary facilities dedicated to continuous improvement in the delivery of professional and compassionate care provided daily by millions of caring employees to 1.5 million of our nation's frail, elderly and disabled citizens who live in long term and post-acute care facilities. We are most interested in this plan since we care for many people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. According to the <strong>AHCA Nursing Facility Patient Characteristics Report, March 2012</strong>, almost 48% of all nursing facility residents across the U.S. are identified as having some form of dementia, while the <strong>March 2012 AHCA Nursing Facility Operational Characteristics Report</strong> indicates that 71% of all special care beds in nursing facilities today are dedicated to care for persons with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias.</p>
<p>AHCA supports the national plan's guiding principles, goals, strategies and actions and believes the plan is timely, and when executed, will produce a better understanding of the disease and the prevention strategies, care and resources that will be required to care for people living with dementia. Since we are in agreement with the national plan and find it to be comprehensive, we offer only a few comments for your consideration.</p>
<p>The plan identifies that it is often difficult to distinguish between Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in terms of clinical presentation and diagnosis. AHCA would like to see this statement expanded to also include the importance of distinguishing undiagnosed psychiatric disease and characteristics, like behavioral symptoms, from Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>According to the National Alliance on Mental Health (NAMI), the nation's largest mental health organization formed in 1979, the nation's mental health system has been and continues to be in crisis. NAMI grades states in their provision of mental illness (MI) services and rates the nation as a "D" (an average of all the states). Services found lacking include the number of psychiatrists, treatment services, and community-based supports -<a href="http://www.nami.org/gtsTemplate09.cfm?Section=Grading_the_States_2009">http://www.nami.org/gtsTemplate09.cfm?Section=Grading_the_States_2009</a>.</p>
<p>In 2010, David Grabowski, PhD from Harvard Medical School looked at MI and Dementia in nursing homes. Grabowski found that between 1960 and 1970, states closed and downsized psychiatric hospitals. As a result, many states were ill equipped to provide community service alternatives and nursing homes became the "de facto" treatment destination for people with MI. Grabowski cites findings indicating that in 2005, 12% of persons newly admitted to nursing homes had dementia, 19% had MI and 6% had both MI and dementia and the Pre-Admission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) process, instituted in nursing homes with OBRA in 1987, was not effective at ensuring appropriate placement and treatment of persons with MI - <a href="http://www.pasrrassist.org/system/files/Grabowski_Mental_Illness_in_Nursing_Homes_Dec2010.pdf">http://www.pasrrassist.org/system/files/Grabowski_Mental_Illness_in_Nursing_Homes_Dec2010.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>The NAMI and Grabowski findings are concerning in that nursing home providers often admit individuals with undiagnosed MIs due to the lack of state MI services. These individuals may present with behavior problems that are often mischaracterized as symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and in some cases, represent both dementia and MI and raise important care issues that need to be addressed. Considering this, AHCA recommends that the national Alzheimer's plan, particularly Goal 1, Strategy 1.A related to research priorities, address the prevalence of undiagnosed MI in nursing homes, ways to distinguish undiagnosed MI from Alzheimer's, and best practices for treating individuals living with both dementia and MI.</p>
<p>Finally, the national plan identifies the need to monitor the use of antipsychotics in nursing homes (Goal 2, Strategy 3.D). AHCA is in agreement with the strategy's focus. One of our four priority goals as part of our Quality Initiative is for our members to safely decrease the off-label use of antipsychotics by 15% by the end of 2012. Given that many individuals admitted to nursing facilities are already on these drugs, reduction in off-label use of antipsychotics in nursing facilities will be more successful if attention is also given to reducing off-label prescribing in the hospital and in the community. It is important for all settings of care that provide services to the elderly to monitor and report their rates of off-label use of antipsychotic drugs. Expanding the scope of monitoring will help to more consistently and effectively detect and eliminate inappropriate uses of these drugs and help reduce antipsychotic drug prevalence in nursing facilities. AHCA recommends that the national plan, Action 3.D.2, be expanded to all healthcare settings.</p>
<p>AHCA welcomes the opportunity to work with HHS on future discussions and planning related to addressing Alzheimer's disease and on any further development and refinement of strategies and actions to improve and monitor care. We thank you for the opportunity to offer these comments.</p>

<p><em>This letter is very similar to my oral testimony (a few corrected typos and better words)--except for my adding a new paragraph at the beginning--to respond more fully to a public comment that preceded mine:</em></p>
<p>A person (Michael Ellenbogen?) who currently suffers from mild Alzheimer's dementia concluded his comments by recommending the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services consider the "right-to-die" option. He thus implied that Physician-Assisted Dying could be an option for patients who suffer from dementia. Because of time limitations, I could only disagree briefly by saying that Physician-Assisted Dying will neither help nor is needed. I now explain more: (1) Why would Physician-Assisted Dying NOT help? Where Physician-Assisted Dying is legal, the law requires patients be of "sound mind" when they ask their physician to write a prescription for a lethal dose of medication. Yet dementia patients lose the mental capacity to make medical decisions early in the course of this progressive disease. Thus for dementia patients, Physician-Assisted Dying would compound their tragedy with <strong><em>premature dying</em></strong>. This is because dementia patients can have much good life after they lose capacity--and they can expect more, with further research--so I and many others consider <strong><em>premature dying</em></strong> an act that violates the <strong><em>principle that life is precious</em></strong>. (2) Why is Physician-Assisted Dying NOT needed? Because Living Will forms and the discussions they provoke can be both moral and effective. Combined with other clinical and strategic forms, diligent Advance Care Planning can give people peace of mind, whether they are still well or in the early stage of dementia. They need not worry about being forced to linger for months to years by enduring the huge burdens and suffering that characterize Advanced Dementia. Instead, they can feel confident that others <strong><em>will honor their Known Wishes</em></strong> after they lose the ability to speak for themselves.</p>
<p><em>Here is my original comment:</em></p>
<p>For patients who will someday suffer from Alzheimer's and related dementias, Advance Care Planning is most urgent, <strong>most important</strong>, and <strong>most challenging</strong>. The process of expressing one's end-of-life wishes in advance warrants both 1) the development of innovative planning tools that are easy, effective, and acceptable to both patients and physicians, and 2) sufficient effort to train professionals to honor Advance Directives and to recommend that their patients/clients complete them.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning <strong>most urgent</strong>? Unlike most diseases, patients who have dementia typically lose mental capacity to make end-of-life medical decisions early in the course of the disease. Once their window of opportunity to make decisions closes, they will not be able to participate in their own end-of-life planning. The reality of the huge, increasing epidemic of patients whose lives will end as they suffer from Alzheimer's disease makes Advance Care Planning even more urgent on a societal level.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning <strong>most important</strong>? Because patients can linger in the terminal stage of Alzheimer's Dementia for several years. The relentless course of their disease may frustrate the best efforts of their clinicians, their caregivers and their loved ones. The multiple burdens on others are well known. For example, more than one-third of Alzheimer's caregivers are depressed. Yet the suffering patients themselves experience is under-appreciated. For too many who have lost the ability to complain and whose behavior may be atypical, pain and suffering may go unrecognized and therefore under-treated for months, or even years</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning <strong>most challenging</strong>? Unlike other terminal illnesses, often there are no life-sustaining treatments that physicians can withhold or withdraw. Typically, a strong body houses a feeble brain. Many who feel the pang of the "<strong>Dementia Fear</strong>" consider "<em>premature dying</em>." They may believe: "If I don't kill myself now, I won't be able to kill myself later. Then, I'll be trapped in a condition I loathe so much that I'd rather be dead." Those who act on this fear only compound the tragedy of their disease. We must offer patients effective advance care planning so they can feel confident they can choose to avoid a prolonged dying of months to years with suffering and burdens. Then, many will ironically choose to live as long and as well as possible--and benefit from improvements in the medical and non-medical management of their disease.</p>
<p>Advance Care Planning for Advanced Dementia needs research funding to develop and to implement--even if other researchers discover new drugs that delay the onset of symptoms or slow down their progression. We know that changes in the brains of dementia patients begin one or more decades before clinical symptoms emerge. We also know it takes many years to prove the safety and efficacy of new drugs and to adopt a policy to implement widespread treatment. Realistically, most of the 76 million baby boomers predicted to get dementia are still likely to become demented. Even if a new drug were available today, patients afflicted with Alzheimer's disease who do not die of another cause will eventually reach the stage of Advanced Dementia. Most importantly, when they do reach the advanced stage of dementia, these patients will then have only their Advance Directives on which they can rely, to control <em>how long, and how much, they must suffer</em>before they die.</p>
<p>To reduce end-of-life suffering of millions of victims of Alzheimer's disease and their loved ones, we must thus fund research programs that will: 1) develop new Advance Directives that are easy, effective, and acceptable to both patients and physicians, and 2) train professionals to honor Advance Directives and to recommend their clients and patients have the discussions and complete the forms...now, while they still can.</p>

<p>My father is the third person I know to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. First was my uncle who passed away in 2005 and then my aunt or father's sister who, although 6 years younger has had it for over two years now.</p>
<p>The impact of this illness on the family is devastating. There is no one place to go for help or all the information you need. It takes a village to handle an aggressive, geriatric Alzheimer's family member. As a caregiver one needs to find out as much as possible as quickly as possible to get the help needed for a loved one. Nobody tells you all the challenges you will have and the financial impact it has on the family as well.</p>
<p>My father was normally an intelligent man, very good with mathematics, science and spoke English, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. Now we see him unable to handle his finances, becoming increasingly aggressive, suffering from delusions and hallucinations regarding our mother who he has been married to for 62 years.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that a mental healthcare power of attorney was not signed since the lawyers don't mention that when you go to get your will and other papers in order, we had to apply for emergency guardianship to get my father admitted to a level one psychiatric facility. After he is there for three weeks and thoroughly evaluated we are told he cannot come home due to delusions regarding our mother. Now we have to find someplace for him and try to find resources to help us. Unfortunately we end up putting him in a group home which we think is the right thing since it is similar to his home and the advice we get from social workers as well as companies such as Care Patrol, that have familiarity with this illness. Since we have no experience we follow the guidance of these "professionals." Unfortunately in our case perhaps also due to the stressfulness of the situation we did not make the right decision. The home was nice but the caregiver, although a nurse, was not there most of the time, and the other caregivers were Pilipino and did not understand English very well.</p>
<p>The situation gets worse when my brother goes to visit my father and he is in bed at 7:30 since the caregivers don't seem to want to be bothered with the patients. When he arrives my father gets up from bed and falls and the door is locked and the caregivers can't seem to figure out how to get the door opened. My brother finally does and dad is on the floor. The caregivers just leave the area and my brother and his son help my father get back into the bed. My father seems to be in a drug stupor and his eyes roll back in his head. I get a frantic call from my brother and call the hospice since he was on palliative care and ask them to send a nurse immediately since the nurse who owns the group home is not there. I also leave an urgent message for her, which is never returned. I wait and then call for the nurse at the hospice that is on call to find out that she was denied entry into the home by the caregivers who told her he was sleeping and to come back the next day. When I confront the owner of the home the following morning she insists that she called me even though there is no record on my answering machine or caller id on the home or cell phones. Then she also indicates that her mother told her that nobody came to the door from the hospice, which was an outright lie. I immediately started looking for another facility but it was difficult since they are all extremely expensive and my mother is alive and living with physical disabilities at home and all of my father's social security, pension and VA benefits (which I applied for since he was a WWII veteran) have to go in their entirety to his care and we still fall short.</p>
<p>During the time I looked for a facility I asked the group home owner not to transport my father anywhere since there was an issue when we brought him home for lunch prior to that. I had met him at a follow-up appointment with his neurologist and she said we could try to bring him home to see how it went. The first time we tried it he seemed ok but it was after an appointment for a vision test and he refused to get in the car unless we took him home. On that occasion, he managed to get his checkbook which we later found out about since we could not locate it to pay the bills.</p>
<p>The following week he had a dentist appointment due to periodontal disease which we needed to attend to. After that appointment , when we brought him home, he became very agitated and pulled a knife out of a drawer, which usually had only papers(so we can only imagine he had placed it there the week before, since we did not). He sat down and said he was not going back to the group home or as he called it, a jail. Then he said he would kill my husband if he ever saw him again since he was the one who, with my sister, brought him to the hospital. I asked him to return the knife and he took it and put it under some papers behind him. This wasn't a small knife it was a large carving knife. I asked for it back but he refused and then went out back and started cutting plants with it and ended up coming in the house without it. He had hidden it. I sent my sister out to retrieve it and she found it in a bucket outside. I took that knife and the rest that were in the house and put them in the trunk of my car. While I did that he went in the back yard and left from the gate on the side and was halfway down the block on foot. I ran to catch up with him and my sister called the police since we were very concerned and needed to get him back to the group home. When the police came he told them he would go back with us and when they left and we were a few blocks away he lunged over the back seat and grabbed my steering wheel and tried ripping the keys out of my ignition and then grabbed the gear shifter to get the car out of gear. I immediately jammed on the breaks and told my sister, who was sitting next to me, to call 911 and that is when he tried to grab the phone from her. I told him I would go back to the house and proceeded slowly to give the policemen a chance to get there. I went past the house and he became agitated and tried getting out of the car but could not since the child locks were on the doors. Unfortunately I forgot the window locks and he was able to open the window and got his body out up to his hips. I had to stop the car and get his feet back in. This is 5'8" man who weighs 158 lbs. I am only 5'3" and weigh 130. This time four police cars came and the officer ended up having to put my father in his squad car and take him back to the home.</p>
<p>Despite the incident that happened and the fact that the group home owner knew about what happened and was told not to take him out, her husband took my father to the bank a couple of weeks later and the bank rep called my mother and then me since my father was requesting his social security number to take out money.</p>
<p>When I finally found a decent place for my father that specializes in Alzheimer's and dementia care, the group home was very rude and unprofessional with the nurse who came to assess him and asked them in front of my father if they were going to take him to a psychiatric facility. So in addition to all the stress now we had to deal with a group home that was manipulating him so he would not leave. He was also writing them checks, which I got back, but we closed the account to keep anyone from taking advantage of him. He had promised money to them, wrote checks to his attorney who was appointed by the court and was promising thousands to the staff and doctors in the hospital where he was assessed.</p>
<p>On top of everything we ended up getting calls from Elder abuse since the owner of the home was apparently upset that we were taking him out and kept arguing that he wasn't ill despite the medical records from a neurologist and psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Our family has been going through hell. On top of all this there was a tremendous amount of paperwork to get VA benefits, get medications and other medical issues taken care of and the legal expenses for guardianship are bleeding my parent's dry. The emotional impact on our mother and the rest of us has been awful as well.</p>
<p>I tell you all this so you can see what it is like since none of us ever imagined how awful this would be. I don't think anyone knows what it is like until they experience it firsthand.</p>
<p>Waiting until 2025 is too late. In my visits to many facilities I have seen people in their 40's and 50's with the disease and it will only get worse as the baby boomers age. With twice as many of them as their parent's generation we are in for a healthcare meltdown if something isn't put in place soon. We need to do something now. I am sure we are not the only family going through this.</p>
<p>There should be more research into different modalities (allopathic, homeopathic, naturopathic, etc.) to address this illness. I have read that there are studies being done regarding a cancer medication that is on the market that reduces the amyloid plaque in the brain. This is the website: <a href="http://www.case.edu/think/breakingnews/breakthrough.html">http://www.case.edu/think/breakingnews/breakthrough.html</a>.</p>
<p>I have also read about a possible treatment or preventative in raw coconut oil by a doctor who used it on her spouse: <a href="http://www.coconutketones.com/whatifcure.pdf">http://www.coconutketones.com/whatifcure.pdf</a>. Perhaps the cure or prevention lies in a combination of different modalities and all should be considered.</p>
<p>Families need more financial assistance and better resources where they can find all or most of the information needed with respect to legal, medical and assisted living resources as well as support groups to help families get the assistance they need as quickly as possible. Most of what is out there now is just "you are on your own" looking though websites in the midst of a crisis trying to find the help and guidance you need or other families at support groups trying to help each other. When a family is in constant crisis they need as much assistance/guidance as quickly as possible to help them navigate the system of care so they can make the right decisions for their loved one.</p>
<p>I agree with all of the findings but it must also be noted that some co-occurring chronic conditions such as sleep apnea (<a href="http://www.newschief.com/article/20111229/news/112295021">http://www.newschief.com/article/20111229/news/112295021</a>) hearing loss (<a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hearing_loss_and_dementia_linked_in_study">http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hearing_loss_and_dementia_linked_in_study</a>) and periodontal disease (<a href="http://www.breathproblems.com/link-between-periodontal-disease-and-dementia.html">http://www.breathproblems.com/link-between-periodontal-disease-and-dementia.html</a>)should also be included in annual geriatric screenings since they can be directly linked to causing dementia and may be overlooked. In addition something should be put in place regarding hearing loss and the prohibitive cost of hearing aids. Perhaps insurance companies can increase fees by a few dollars a month on their premiums to include some coverage for hearing aids. Everyone is impacted by hearing loss of a senior citizen: family, motorists who drive on the roads along with them, and anyone who the hearing impaired interact with. Since hearing loss can be linked to dementia making hearing aids more affordable through some sort of coverage could help in part, to address this issue.</p>
<p>Anyone directly related to the care of a patient with dementia or Alzheimer's and affiliated with a medical facility, assisted living, or group home should need to be certified to care for a patient with this illness and display that certification where it is visible to family who are looking for care for their family member. There are people who claim to know how to handle patient s with this illness, yet do not, and tend to take advantage of the family as well as the person with the illness.</p>
<p>There should be clear guidelines in place as to what the group homes can and cannot do such as taking a dementia patient to the bank to take out money. I bring this up since this happened with my father.</p>
<p>Medical assessments in the home would help greatly as well since it can be impossible to get a dementia patient to the doctor or hospital unless you have a mental health care power of attorney. If a patient is hospitalized and determined to have dementia, a mental health care power of attorney should automatically be granted without the family having to dish out thousands of dollars to an attorney when the person has received a neurological and psychological evaluation by qualified physicians. This would save the families of these patients thousands of dollars which can be used for their care. A regular health care power of attorney is insufficient since we were told that Alzheimer's and dementia are considered physical illnesses with psychological manifestations. Without a mental health care power of attorney the family has to file for emergency guardianship and then permanent guardianship which can cost upwards of $20,000. This is a progressive disease with no known cure at this point. It is ridiculous to penalize an already suffering family to have to deplete their savings when their loved one is only going to progress in mental deterioration and obviously needs a guardian. Many times they feel that they are not ill and will continue to fight and deplete their funds further until they end up on ACCHHS (Medicaid), which in turn just depletes the government's funds further. If this is a necessity perhaps some cost containment should be put in place so families aren't hurt financially by exorbitant legal fees.</p>
<p>Another issue is medication. The VA indicates it can help with the cost of medication but you have to bring the patient into their facility. Once they are in a memory care facility they are not always amenable to being transported so it would be of great help to have a VA rep come to the patient facility to assess them for the medication benefits or just to have the paperwork from the doctor diagnoses serve as proof that the person needs the medication and provide it and delivery at no cost to the veteran.</p>
<p>The facility that my father is currently in provides dental care via mobile dentistry. It would also be beneficial to have the same with respect to mobile hearing units to help many of the residents in these facilities to get the hearing assessments and hearing aid cleaning, hearing aids, wax removal, etc. to ensure that they can hear effectively. Mobile vision care would also be a plus to ensure that the patients are seeing well or are not developing illnesses of the eye.</p>
<p>Finally decent memory care facilities are very expensive (the one our father is now at costs $4,338/mo.) and that it would help greatly to have some sort of coverage to help as the only thing available is long term care insurance which many people do not have and once you are diagnosed with Alzheimer's, is no longer an option.</p>
<p>I hope you will take these suggestions into consideration in your National Plan. After going through all of this first hand I can tell you that these changes are greatly needed and would help all the families out there who are going through all of these challenges.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to offer public comment on this important and much needed national plan.</p>
<p>From my experience as a nurse working with several community hospices over the past 15 years, it's often a struggle to utilize antipsychotics (i.e. Haldol) in skilled nursing facility setting. Nursing facilities have many regulations which are well-intentioned to provide safe care for residents.</p>
<p>However, I would just like to offer that haloperidol is often preferred over lorazepam for agitation, terminal restlessness for many patients, especially Veterans with a history of PTSD. We have found that these patients may benefit from a medication that may help them to think more clearly, so that they feel less vulnerable by feeling more in control.</p>

<p>There are numerous improvements in the draft national plan to address Alzheimer's disease from the initial framework plan. Additional areas of the plan still need strengthening and improvement. CCAL appreciates the opportunity to submit comments to help strengthen the draft plan. The comments follow.</p>
<p><strong>General </strong></p>
<ul><li>CCAL suggests that the plan include the words "other dementias" and be known as the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias. The terms "Alzheimer's" and "dementia" are often used interchangeably. Many internists and family practice physicians (among others in the health care field), for example, are still not well educated about assessing and diagnosing Alzheimer's disease and use the general term "dementia" to explain cognitive decline to patients and their families. The addition of the terminology "other dementia" is more inclusionary and desirable.</li>
<li>Person-centered care is the widely recognized gold standard of services and supports for people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (PWD) (Alzheimer's Association, 2006; Edvardsson, et al, 2010). It is a foundational aspect of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. The draft plan is silent about person-centered care. CCAL suggests that the plan integrate the philosophy and orientation to person-centered care throughout the plan.</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Challenges Section</strong> (page 4)</p>
<ul><li>Notably missing as a national challenge is the over prescription and utilization of antipsychotic medications as a first line of management for behavioral challenges experienced by PWDs. The medical community as well as the formal and informal caregiver communities need to be educated about non-pharmacologic approaches to such behavioral challenges as agitation. Medications should be used only if and when non-pharmacologic approaches have not been effective. There is currently a dearth of readily accessible information about recommended non-pharmacologic approaches and practices.</li>
<li>Also missing as a national challenge is recognition that the quality of programs and services for PWDs who reside in residential long-term care (assisted living, nursing homes) across the nation continues to be uneven and often less than optimal. There is no national focus on or effort to address quality for these long-term care programs and services despite the fact that the number of people living with dementia will increase over fifty percent by 2030.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Plan's Three Guiding Principles</strong> (page 5)</p>
<ul><li>CCAL applauds the second Guiding Principle that supports public-private partnerships. We recommend that the detail for this principle be expanded to specifically include dementia experts who represent the practice, policy, and research sectors. All too often senior executives are included on advisory panels solely because of their positions. Unfortunately they often lack actual dementia expertise and experience. It is vitally important that the national plan be developed, planned, and implemented by a diverse group of dementia experts who can provide "face validity" both to the plan and the process of its development and implementation.</li>

<p>I have just two comments on the National Alzheimer's Plan which is mostly nice sounding rhetoric that I hope helps with this devastating disease.</p>
<p>First, Goal 1 (an effective treatment by 2025) just seems to me arbitrary and unrealistically optimistic. Of course that would be wonderful but as a physician specializing in geriatrics and Alzheimer's I see little hope of this being accomplished in the foreseeable future or perhaps ever. How will this be done by 2025 when there are no significantly effective drugs on the market at this time -- this is only 13 years away and the drug development/approval process takes many years. Hopefully the research summits proposed will help. $50-80 million in new funding seems a pittance that can't possibly make a significant difference. We have had a "war on cancer" with much higher rates of funding for about 40-50 years now with some modest positive results but certainly no cure for cancer.</p>
<p>Second, in my opinion, Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes, has no place in this report. Most of the other items in this report are positive, optimistic goals. This is a narrow and arguable negative. In my opinion again as an experienced geriatrician and long term care physician, I feel the issue of antipsychotics in nursing homes is overblown and not significant enough to be a major national priority. Inappropriate use of medications is one thing that of course must be minimized, though what is appropriate is highly individualized and subjective. However the "off-label" use being considered inherently inappropriate or fraudulent is completely wrong. Physicians and nursing homes are already extensively educated and regulated on this issue. All drugs are commonly and legally used for many "off-label" scenarios and there is nothing wrong with that if the medical judgement is reasonable and the patient benefits. Unfortunately Alzheimer's patients often have uncontrollable anxiety and agitation and until a better therapy comes along, antipsychotics are often the only answer. "Conflicts of interest" among pharmacists and physicians have NOTHING to do with this issue. Clinicians simply often have no better solution for dementia related psychosis and agitation at this time. I am an active member of the American Medical Directors Association and vehemently disagree with their their "politically correct" approach to this difficult issue (they have gone along with government suggestions to more vigorously educate and crack down on physicians and nursing homes).</p>
<p>Perhaps a brief mention of better treatments for behavioral and psychological symptoms as well as cognitive symptoms and "cure" would be appropriate under goal 1. Otherwise I think this entire paragraph 3D2 is inappropriate in this report and should be completely deleted.</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>From: <strong>Helen Matheny</strong></p>
<p>For your information, attached is the first draft of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. As a non federal member of the national Alzheimer's Disease Advisory Council I encourage each of you to review the draft and provide comments. Your perspective as a physician is critically important. HHS is seeking input on the draft National Plan through March 30, 2012. Please send your comments to napa@hhs.gov. Also, please feel free to copy me. I serve on the Council's Clinical Care Subcommittee and would greatly value your suggestions. I expect the second draft of the plan to be available mid-April.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Making the case for Public Private Partnerships for NAPA</strong></p>
<p><em>The Problem</em><br />
					A crisis in medicine today is that there are increasing investments in biomedical research but decreasing numbers of new medical products, especially drugs, that obtain FDA approval and are available to patients.<sup>1,2</sup> In order to respond to this crisis, the field of drug development is undergoing transformational changes.</p>
<p>Taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product that finally reaches patients faces overwhelming challenges including the long length of research, high rate of failures of potential candidates and enormous costs. This research and development process is so difficult it is called the "Valley of Death." As many as 80-95% of promising drug candidates fail.<sup>3,4</sup> Drug companies will spend tens of thousands to perform research on millions of compounds and spend in excess of a billion dollars over a 10- to 20-year period just ot have one drug reach patients.<sup>5</sup> A pressing example is Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for which diagnosis is difficult and there are only a few FDA approved treatments to temporarily slow the disease but no cure, at a time when this debilitating disease is exploding in the aging population. In fact, the pace for development and FDA approval of Central Nervous System (CNS) drugs is even longer than other drug classes.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>These challenges mean that companies have to be smarter and more efficient in managing drug discovery and development. Innovation is needed to create greater efficiencies to help move therapies through development, review and approval for patient use. John Castellani, President PhRMA, stated that "The regulatory process is a strategic priority that if done right can reduce time, cost and uncertainty in drug development."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><em>The Solution</em>: Increasingly, public private partnerships (PPP) are presenting an opportunity to meeting these challenges. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Innovation comes from focusing on science that can improve the process of drug development and be applied to regulatory decisions. Efficiences come from building collaborations and sharing.</p>
<p>The flagship success of PPPs in AD is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (<strong>ADNI1</strong>), a $60 million, 5-year study to test whether imaging and biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments could measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Begun by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and supported by other federal agencies, private-sector companies and organizations, the ADNI1 investment would have been prohibitive for a single stokeholder. However, ADNI1 has transformed the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD. Additionally, many other PPPs are having an impact in AD, some of which are described below:</p>
<ul><li><strong>ADNI2</strong>: Approximately 1,000 people aged 55 to 90 will be followed with imaging and biomarker measures to identify who is at risk for AD, track progression, and devise tests to measure the effectiveness of potential interventions. This ~ $60 million study is funded by NIH and companies.</li>
<li><strong>FNIH Biomakers Consortium</strong>: One project is the first part of a multi-phased effort to utilize ADNI samples to construct multiplex panels in plasma and CSF to diagnose patients with AD and monitor disease progression.</li>
<li><strong>Alliance for Aging Research</strong>: The Alliance initiated Accelerate Cure/Treatment forAlzheimer's Disease, a coalition of national organizations representing patients, providers, caregivers, consumers, older Americans, researchers, employers, and health care industries seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for AD.</li>
<li><strong>Alzheimer's Association Global Standardization</strong>: This organization is leading global efforts to standardize Alzheimer's biomarkers with the World Wide AD Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) and the Alzheimer's Association Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Quality Control Program.</li>
<li><strong>Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable</strong>: Members facilitate the development and implementation of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease by collectively addressing obstacles to research and development, clinical care and public health education.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Path Institute's Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD)</strong>: CAMD accelerates the development of therapies for AD by advancing drug development tools for regulatory approval. CAMD developed AD data standards with CDISC, a pooled clinical trial database with 6,000 patients, and a clinical disease progression model. CAMD obtained regulatory approval for imaging biomarkers from the EMA and is collaborating with the FDA on CSF and imaging biomarkers.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Path Institute's Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium</strong>: A workgroup is developing and evaluating a PRO instrument on MCI for use in clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new AD drugs.</li>
<li><strong>IMI PharmaCog</strong>: The five-year €20M PharmaCog project, funded under the European Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI), will provide tools to define the potential of a drug candidate, reduce the development time of new drugs and thus accelerate the approvals of promising new medicines.</li>
</ul><p>While the impact of these PPPs is extensive, there are still significant challenges and opportunities for preventing and treating AD. One challenge is in the regulatory arena. For approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company engages exclusively with the regulatory agency and all information within the drug approval process is proprietary. Lessons learned from one AD drug trial are not shared, so any insights on why drugs fail or how particular biomarkers track with disease progression are lost. However, in recognizing the need for change, the FDA established an innovative approach in the Critical Path Initiative. The FDA formalized a process for submitting tools as biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments to be "qualified" for specific uses in supporting drug development.<sup>7</sup> Tools that receive a designation of "fit for use" from the FDA's qualification process8 can then be widely shared.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br />
					Providing the extensive evidence needed for qualification of tools by regulatory authorities can optimally be carried out through public-private partnerships. PPPs can support publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification.</p>
<p>The challenge then becomes funding PPPs that move products toward regulatory approval. The cost of qualification for a single biomarker is several million dollars over a time frame of up to 5 years. Such costs require significant investment by both public and private sectors and in-kind contributions in order to be successful. However, the end product is a tool that FDA can have confidence in to produce better data and be used by all drug companies in clinical trials. The result benefits all stakeholders, including patients.</p>
<p>Since not all PPPs conduct research as ADNI does, there needs to be new models of PPP funding, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such an AD PPP could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because PPPs rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided by a multi-stakeholder board to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PLAN</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan. I am, of course, very pleased that the federal government is developing plans to address the needs of people with dementia and their families, a population that will grow substantially over the next quarter century because of the elder boom and because of increased life expectancy.</p>
<p>I believe, however, that, as drafted, <strong>the plan will fail to meet the needs--and to improve the quality of life--of millions of people who currently have dementia and their families as well as millions more who will develop dementia over the next decade and more</strong>.</p>
<p>In these comments I will address two major concerns: (1) unbalanced distribution of new funding and (2) the failure to address the behavioral health dimensions of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong>: Although the draft plan does not specify future funding, it does provide information about funding that has been committed prior to the finalization of the plan. Altogether $156 million will be added over the next two years. It will be distributed as follows:</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p>If this reflects how funds will be distributed going forward, it is clear that research is the only priority of the Plan; its other four goals are of very limited importance.</p>
<p>Let me be clear. I do not oppose increased spending on research seeking a cure, preventive interventions, or a way to substantially slow the growth of disability due to dementia. But expecting to achieve this by 2025 is wildly optimistic given the current state of research. And while we are waiting, 10's of millions of people with dementia and their families will not get the care and support that they need and deserve, resulting in avoidable suffering and missed opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>This plan appears to write off a generation or more of people with dementia and their families. </strong></p>
<p>I suppose those who want research to be the virtually exclusive priority of our nation's efforts regarding Alzheimer's and other dementias could argue that funding for services is available elsewhere. But this is at best a partial truth. Medicare mostly does not cover long-term care or family support; and Medicaid is supposed to be for people with very limited means. Indeed, long-term care is one of the targets for cost cutting in Medicaid, and one of the proposals to cut Medicaid that resurfaces routinely is reducing the ability of people who are not extremely poor to become eligible for coverage of long-term care services.</p>
<p><strong>I strongly urge HHS to revisit the question of how new funds should be spent and to place much greater emphasis on improving care now and for the foreseeable future than this draft plan does. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Neglect of Behavioral Health </strong></p>
<p>The summary of facts about dementia given near the beginning of the plan notes (1) that people with dementia experience "behavioral and psychiatric disorders", (2) that "personality and behavior changes may also occur", and (3) that family caregivers experience tremendous stress and "report symptoms of depression and anxiety and poorer health outcomes." But these very important facts are barely mentioned in the rest of the plan and, with the possible exception of family caregivers, are not addressed in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>This omission will result in certain failure to meet behavioral health needs that are common among people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Here are the sections of the plan that should reflect behavioral health needs.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Framework and guiding principles</strong>: This section lists service systems that are important to people with dementia and their families, mentioning health care, long-term care, home care, legal services, and social services. Mental health and substance abuse (behavioral health) systems are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.B: Expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease</strong>: This section mentions both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, but</p>
<ul><li>The clear priority is bio-medical research seeking pharmacological treatments. There is also a great need for research regarding non-pharmacological, psycho-social interventions, which hold great promise for improving the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers virtually immediately.</li>
<li>In addition, there is a great need for research regarding preventing and/or treating co-occurring mental or substance use disorders or the neuro-psychiatric symptoms that affect virtually all people with dementia.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategies 1.B. 3, 5, and 6: Expand clinical trials</strong>: These sections fail to mention clinical trials of anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications. It is true that these medications are over-used for people with dementia and can be dangerous. Fortunately, it is also true that non-pharmacological, psychosocial interventions can be enormously helpful to people with dementia and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. But it would be useful to develop medications that are safe and effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs</strong>: This section lists fields and settings where findings of research should be disseminated so as to improve practice. Behavioral health settings are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2, 3</strong>: These sections mention a number of federal agencies that need to be involved. SAMHSA, NIMH, NIDA, and NIAAA are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with skills to provide high-quality care</strong>: This section notes, "Physicians need information on how to implement the new requirement regarding "detection of any cognitive impairment." They, and other health providers, also need information about how to detect co-occurring mental or substance use disorders and to distinguish their effects from those of dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B: Ensure timely and accurate diagnosis</strong>: As noted, accurate diagnosis requires a very difficult differential diagnosis to distinguish between dementia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong>: This section notes opportunities to provide information and referral through NIA and AoA. It does not mention the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is funded by SAMHSA, and which provides a national I&amp;R network for help with any mental health issue--not just suicide. There are also local I&amp;R systems focused on mental health and/or substance abuse, which are not mentioned in the draft plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings</strong>: This section mentions "home, physician's office, and long-term care facility." It does not mention mental health settings such as clinics, day programs, inpatient units, psychiatric rehabilitation, crisis services, and case management programs. People with dementia and/or their family members are often served in these settings. And when people with AD in crisis, it is usually the mental health system that is turned to for help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.E: Explore the effectiveness of new models</strong>: This section mentions "medical homes", which are required to integrate physical and behavioral health care, but there is no mention in the plan about this fact. The plan also does not note the emphasis in the Affordable Care Act on developing "health homes", for which many people with dementia will probably be eligible because they have multiple chronic conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F: Ensure that people with AD experience safe and effective transitions between care settings and systems</strong>: Despite the fact that settings and systems officially charged with caring for people with dementia frequently turn to the mental health system when there are behavioral problems, there is no mention of how profoundly flawed transitions between the mental health and the long-term settings and systems are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F. 1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong>: Despite the fact that many people with AD--with and without psychiatric disorders-end up in psychiatric inpatient units of hospitals due to behavioral problems, there is no mention of the need to address psychiatric hospitalization specifically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.G: Advance coordinated and integrated health and long-term services</strong>: This section and its subsections do not mention the <strong>need to coordinate physical and behavioral health services</strong>, which is particularly surprising since integration of this kind is a major goal of health care reform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.H: Improve care for populations disproportionally affected by AD and for populations facing care challenges</strong>: This section appropriately identifies "people with intellectual disabilities" as disproportionately affected by AD, but it fails to mention people with psychiatric disabilities, who often develop dementia as they age, compounding causes of cognitive impairment and complicating care and treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with AD and The Families</strong>: This section does mention the mental health needs of family and other informal caregivers. They could get more attention than is in the plan, but it's there to some extent. However, this section vastly neglects the mental health needs of people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong>: This section calls for "dissemination through the Aging Network, state public health departments, and public websites." There is no mention of the mental health system, to which people with AD and their families frequently go for help.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no mention of dissemination to people with dementia, most of whom can read and process information in the early and mid-phases of dementia. They, as well as caregivers, can benefit from informational material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term care services and supports system</strong>: Again, the plan fails to recognize the frequent use of the mental health system by people with AD and their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</strong>: This section says "AoA will expand efforts to develop more AD-capable long-term services and supports [for] AD caregivers." Although the section mentions the need for interventions regarding depression, it fails to mention anxiety disorders--which are very common. In addition it fails to mention the need for "AD-capable" behavioral health services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</strong>: This section notes the importance of call centers, but does not reflect awareness of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which could be an important resource during a crisis. This section also does not reflect the fact that, it is usually the psychiatric services in local hospitals or psychiatric mobile crisis teams that are called on to deal with a behavioral crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D: Maintain the dignity, safety and rights of people with AD</strong>: This section appropriately notes the fact that people with dementia are vulnerable in many ways and that many need more protection than they get. (The inadequacy of many Adult Protective Services programs is particularly important to address.) However, there is nothing here to suggest that people with dementia need anything other than protection. Treating people still capable of some degree of self-care and of being helpful to others, solely as people in need of protection, diminishes them and deprives them of the dignity and rights that this section is supposed to address. <strong>There needs to be a strengths-based model for dementia as increasingly there is for people with psychiatric and other disabilities</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report, and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong>: This is clearly important to do, but it is also important to address the use of anti-psychotics in other formal care settings such as assisted living facilities, senior housing, adult day care, etc. It is also important to address the likely overuse of anti-psychotics for people with dementia who live in their own homes or with family caregivers.</p>
<p>In addition, it is very important to <strong>address the inappropriate use of anti-depressants</strong> because recent studies suggest that anti-depressants have high risks and virtually no benefits for people with dementia and should be used only after non-pharmacological interventions have been tried.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.E: Assess and address the housing needs of people with AD</strong>: Stable housing, as the plan says, is a critical need for people with dementia. But the plan seems to have a remarkably limited view of the kinds of stable housing that can be helpful, failing to mention assisted living, continuing care communities, senior housing, supportive housing, housing for people with developmental disabilities, and housing for people with serious mental illness.</p>
<p>The draft plan also fails to note that people with serious mental illness are frequently dumped out of housing they have had within the mental health system for many years and are sent to nursing homes when their dementia or physical disorders make them too difficult for the mental health system--as it is currently organized--to care for. It should be possible for people with serious mental illness to stay in their own homes or in the housing that has become their home rather than to be shunted off to a long-term care system that has very limited capacity to care for them.</p>
<p>In addition, even though reducing the unnecessary use of nursing homes for people with dementia is a clear goal of this plan, there is no mention of the fact that <strong>there are now more people admitted to nursing homes with mental illness other than dementia than with dementia alone</strong>. Frequently they are people with co-occurring dementia and psychiatric disorders. Housing designed for this population is needed to help them avert admission to nursing homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Public education should include information about the frequent overlap of mental disorders and dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data To Track Progress</strong>: Because this plan does not seem to reflect awareness of the important role the mental health system plays in helping people with dementia and their families, it seems likely that plans for improved data collection will overlook data related to psychiatric disorders and mental health settings. It is important to track progress regarding the behavioral health of people with dementia and their families.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>I hope that you will find these comments on specific sections of the draft plan helpful in identifying what to include in the final plan regarding the behavioral health needs of people with dementia and their families. Let me add that behavioral health services are not only important for those who are experiencing mental or substance use disorders. In addition, <strong>care informed by understanding the psychological potential of people with dementia could result in vastly improved quality of life for them</strong>.</p>
<p>We do not have to wait for a cure to make life better for people with dementia and their families, and we should not devote virtually all new resources to seeking an ultimate solution when so much could be accomplished with better care and support.</p>
<p>I would be happy to help the group developing the plan to flesh out any of the suggestions included in this letter.</p>

<p>I'd like to commend the Department of Health &amp; Human Services for developing an ambitious plan to address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>I would add, however, some concern about its apparent overemphasis on biology and pharmacology. Based on my own clinicial experience, chats with colleagues, and reading of the related literature, I can confidently state this focus is necessary but not sufficient. The mental health (i.e., depression &amp; anxiety) of patients and unpaid caregivers alike is inextricably linked to this disease and its treatment. Should these psychological components remain unaddressed, the costs (financial &amp; human) will continue to mount. Conversely, adequate support can reduce this burden, both at the individual and societal levels.</p>
<p>Experts estimate it will take decades before "cures" for Alzheimer's are discovered, let alone made available (and affordable) broadly. While this remains an appropriate aspirational goal, behavioral treatment of the millions currently afflicted, and support for those trying to care for them, must not be sacrificed.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PLAN</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan. I am, of course, very pleased that the federal government is developing plans to address the needs of people with dementia and their families, a population that will grow substantially over the next quarter century because of the elder boom and because of increased life expectancy. I have signed onto a letter drafted by Michael Friedman, MSW and signed on by the vast majority of members of a group of experts assembled in December of 2011, in Washington DC, by SAMHSA, to inform them of the psychosocial, mental health and behavioral issues, concerns and strategies that should be included in the NAPA plan. We are all disappointed that few, if any of our input has been included in the draft plan.</p>
<p>I support everything in the letter from the group but would add the following two comments:</p>
<ol><li>Not only do we need more research on psychosocial interventions, but also on creative engagement interventions. There is an increasing number of successful art and creativity programs (Stagebridge, Kairos Dance, TimeSlips, SPARK, Art Care, Memories in the Making) for persons with dementia, that are making a difference in the quality of life not only for the person, but also for the caregivers. We all know that most aggressive or violent behavior in persons with dementia is behavior that is trying to communicate something else besides aggression; most often pain, boredom, grief, loneliness or urgency of personal body functions. As we develop relationships with people with dementia, we learn their language and can anticipate their unspoken needs by learning what they are communicating to us. Creative engagement and art programs can provide fun and adult-like experience that help us to hear the voices of those with dementia and to avert disaster before it happens.</li>
<li>I would also add that in searching for alternatives to nursing homes for those with Alzheimer's disease, consider the thousands of adult day health care programs that are providing creative and psychosocial interventions, as well as nursing care to over 260,000 participants and family caregivers. ADS have become a preferred platform for chronic disease management with much higher percentages of care provided for hypertension, physical disability, cardiovascular disease, mental illness and developmental disability. (Metlife, 2010). These are all medical issues that compound the care of persons with Alzheimer's disease. According to this national survey, conducted in 2010, by The Ohio State University and funded by MetLife Mature Market Institute, the adult day centers are leaders in community based care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. (over 75% of centers offer cognitive and memory training programs, and educational programs for Alzheimer's disease).</li>
</ol><p>I hope that you will find these comments helpful in identifying what to include in the final national plan for persons with Alzheimer's in America. We do need research for persons with dementia, but not only for new drug interventions. We need research in these psychological and psychosocial interventions also. We must not ignore the 5.4 million persons living with Alzheimer's disease NOW!</p>

<p>The Mental Health Association in New York State, Inc., the undersigned, is writing in response to the draft National Alzheimer's Plan recently released for comment by the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>We are all pleased that a National Alzheimer's Plan is being developed in recognition of the vast growth of the number of people who will have Alzheimer's or other dementias during the elder boom, and we appreciate the opportunity to comment on the draft plan.</p>
<p>However, we all believe that the draft plan is inadequate in several critical ways.</p>
<p><strong>Imbalance of Use of Funding</strong>: The draft plan does not specify how much funding will be available to deal with Alzheimer's and other dementias in the future, but it does provide some information about new federal funding that has been committed prior to the completion of the plan. $156 million will be made available for the five major goals of the plan. Of this $130 million (83%) is designated for one goal--research. $26 million is designated for enhanced services and supports, provider education, public education, and improved data collection. Of this, $10.7 million is designated for improved care and treatment of 5.4 million people who currently have dementia and their family caregivers. That's less than $2 per person. This is simply not adequate.</p>
<p><strong>Inadequate Attention to Research About Psychosocial Interventions</strong>: The clear tilt of the draft plan is towards research to find a cure for Alzheimer's. It seems to focus heavily on bio-medical research and the development of effective pharmacological treatments. Prevention, cure, or effective slowing of the progression of dementia are, of course, much to be desired. But we do not believe that it is at all likely that this will be achieved by 2025--the goal of this plan--and even if it is, the millions of people who now have or will develop dementia prior to that will not be helped at all.</p>
<p>We know that psychosocial interventions can do much to improve the quality of life of people with dementia and their family caregivers, but we need to know more--to develop truly evidence-based practices. We strongly urge those developing the research plan to pay much more attention to research about psycho-social interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Attention to Mental Disorders Commonly Experienced by People with Dementia and their Caregivers</strong>: People with dementia often have co-occurring mental health conditions such as major depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Almost all exhibit neuro-psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, aggression, and sleep disorders. (See Lyketsos, et al) When this happens, those who care for people with dementia turn to mental health providers for help. Yet, the role of the mental health system is barely reflected in the draft plan.</p>
<p>In addition, family caregivers are at high risk for depression, anxiety, and stress related physical disorders. There are evidence-based family support interventions. (See Mittelman). The need for supports for family caregivers is noted in the plan, but briefly and with little substance.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that failure to address issues of mental health will result in continued failure to meet fundamental needs of people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to comment on the plan. We would be glad to work with HHS to provide the details that are needed to complete a National Alzheimer's Plan that reflects the psychosocial/mental health needs of Americans with dementia and their families as well as their opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen and I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at age 49, after struggling to get a diagnoses from age 39. We need to better educate our doctors.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to read many of the public comments. Many referred Psychologists and Neuropsychologists that may not have been in the plan. While I think they can add a benefit to people with AD, they can also hinder diagnose, as was done to me. In my experience it delayed my diagnoses for about 10 years, not to mention the financial burden it created to our health system. Many need to be better educated on how people with AD react to the test they provide. They also need to put some merit in what their patients and caregivers may share with them. Especially if the caregiver is a RN.</p>
<p>In June 1999, I had my first full Neuropsychological Evaluation conducted by Dr. Lindsey Robinson. The summary and recommendations were: <em>Current level of overall intellectual functioning is in the average range, with verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills relatively evenly developed. Neuropsychological testing revealed moderate to severe impairments in information processing speed and sustained attention, with mild to moderate impairments in verbal learning efficiency. Short-term attention, expressive/receptive language skills, verbal and nonverbal abstract reasoning, and cognitive flexibility were within normal limits for age. There was no evidence of clinically significant depression, anxiety, or other psychological disorder which might account for the patient's cognitive deficits. The etiology of Mr. Ellenbogen's cognitive impairment is unclear as, from a neuropsychological perspective, his symptoms are nonspecific. However, the magnitude of impairment observed on objective testing, in the absence of identifiable affective disorder, does suggest the presence of some form of organic cerebral dysfunction. Further neurological evaluation recommended.</em></p>
<p>I another appointment with Dr. Lindsey Robinson on February 2001. It was frustrating dealing with these doctors because every time I had to see a new doctor or take a test, my primary doctor needed to okay it. The other frustration was that sometimes I had to wait 5 months for appointments, which was the case with this appointment. The test that I was about to retake was questionable. I was not sure my insurance would cover the procedure, so I had to jump through hoops with the doctor and my insurance company. If the test was not covered, it would cost me about $2,500.00. When you deal with these insurance companies, document the conversation for yourself and ask them to do the same. I cannot tell you how many times they tried to get out of paying, but then they checked their records and saw I had received pre-approval. They kept putting up roadblocks and I had to be in touch with them a lot, when I should have been working. It was bad enough that I had to leave work for appointments, I did not need the added aggravation from the insurance company.</p>
<p>I finally met with Dr. Lindsey Robinson. She had commented on my other doctors findings in the beginning of her report: <em>The etiology of his cognitive symptoms was felt to be multifactorial, including normal aging, alcohol consumption, and anxiety.</em></p>
<p>I have to tell you that when I saw those comments, I was very angry. She was making up her mind before even administering the test.</p>
<p>Her summary and recommendations were: <em>Current level of overall intellectual functioning is in the average range, with no significant discrepancy between verbal cognitive skills and nonverbal reasoning abilities, There is no significant change in overall intellectual ability in comparison with the evaluation in June of 1999. On neuropsychological testing, Mr. Ellenbogen displays generalized psychomotor slowing and inconsistent impairments in attention, concentration, and memory. In comparison with the previous evaluation, a variable, inconsistent pattern of change was demonstrated, with improvements on some measures and declines on others. This pattern of performance is not suggestive of focal or lateralized organic cerebral dysfunction, and is not consistent with the presence of a progressive cognitive disorder. Rather, Mr. Ellenbogen's neuropsychological test performance suggestive of fluctuating levels of attention, concentration, and performance speed. Objective psychological screening suggest the presence of mild to moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety, and an introspective, perfectionistic personality style. These psychological symptoms are most likely playing a significant role in Mr. Ellenbogen's subjective cognitive dysfunction.</em></p>
<p>She encouraged me to seek a psychiatric consultation to determine whether a trial of antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication might be helpful in ameliorating my cognitive symptoms. She got me so aggravated, and she would not listen to anything my wife or I tried to tell her. She just did not want to hear it.</p>
<p>I went back to Dr. Lindsey J. Robinson, the Clinical Neuropsychologist, in January 2006. She was going to redo the neuropsychological testing. I thought it would be best to use this doctor again because she had a baseline for me and could compare my new results with the old. It would take months for the results. The other issue was that there were not many doctors, who performed this test, that were covered under my health insurance policy.</p>
<p>In June 2006, just a few weeks after my 48th birthday, Dr. Lindsey J. Robinson finally got back with the results of my testing. Her results for neuropsychological testing were as follows: <em>Background -- Previous neuropsychological evaluation in 1999 and 2001 revealed fluctuating, inconsistent impairments in attention, concentration, and performance speed, and symptoms consistent with anxiety and depression. Summary and recommendations -- Multiple aspects of Mr. Ellenbogen's behavior and test performance suggestive of inconsistent/incomplete effort during the evaluation. Thus, this test results described are not regarded as a valid representation of his optimal cognitive functioning. Mr. Ellenbogen's clinical presentation and test are unchanged in comparison with prior neuropsychological evaluation in 1999 and 2001. There is no evidence of progression of cognitive impairments, and Mr. Ellenbogen's developmental history and current test performance are not consistent with a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any other organically-based cognitive disorder. Mr. Ellenbogen demonstrated an anxious/ obsessive personality style and some symptoms of depression. His cognitive can be most parsimoniously attributed to affective disorder and/or other motivational or psychological factors.</em></p>
<p><em>Diagnostic Impression;</em></p>
<p><em>R/O Dementia (not in evidence)<br />
					R/O Anxiety Disorder, NOS<br />
					R/O Personality Disorder, NOS</em></p>
<p>Her recommendations -- <em>Mr. Ellenbogen should be reassured that thorough medical/neurological evaluation on multiple occasions has revealed no evidence of neurological cause for his cognitive symptoms. A trial of psychotropic medication could be considered to address Mr. Ellenbogen's apparent effective symptoms. He is unlikely to benefit from psychotherapy due to his reluctance to accept a non-medical explanation for his symptoms.</em></p>
<p>I have to tell you that when I met with her and read this report, I was so upset that I had made the decision to go back to her. First of all, during my testing we were not in a quiet area. Anytime I hear noise, it just throws me off. I have difficulty processing and concentrating when that occurs. There was nothing she could do to make it better. I tried very hard to be accurate during my testing and worked as quickly as I could. I tried to inform her that she was wrong in her findings, but she did not want to hear it.</p>
<p>She was so confident in her failure to diagnose me properly, that when I had reach out to her to make her aware that other Psychologists and Neuropsychologists determined that I did have Alzheimer's. She insisted on writing a letter to tell my primary doctor, that the others were wrong and she felt that her diagnosis was correct. Since that day I tried to reach out to her and gave her the opportunity to see the conclusions that 3 other doctors cane up with, but her office refused. Doctors like this will only hurt people like me. There should be a specific testing they must go through before they can test YOAD patients.</p>
<p>Maybe someone from your office can educate her. [address removed]</p>
<p>As you can see, it requires special doctors with the right training to deal with YOAD. I hope you will insure that happens.</p>

<p>As a Caregiver and Advocate for those affected by Alzheimer's Disease, I am Extremely pleased with the Draft National Plan To Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Given the fact that people are living longer, this Dreadful, Devastating disease is on the Fast track to becoming an Epidemic, which I am confident The National Plan will in deed keep in check and make much more manageable, so long as it is Fully Supported and Enforced.</p>
<p>Below, I wish to offer my input, which comes from Real Life Experience as a Caregiver and Advocate</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that you will find this input most helpful.</p>
<p><strong>With Respect To Diagnosis:</strong></p>
<p>One of the Keys to Success in Keeping Alzheimer's Disease In Check Is Early, Timely Diagnosis.</p>
<p>I have found in my work as a Caregiver and Advocate that Alzheimer's enters the lives of those affected in ways we may classify as minor or may overlook such as; having to write things down more often, patterns of not being able to locate items or patterns of memory lapses, all of which we may joke off as ' Pre- Senior or Senior Moments '.</p>
<p>It is up to All Of Us to Keep An Eye On Each Other and Those Around Us, Should we see these behaviors, we Must Take Them Seriously and Track Them As Such.</p>
<p>Cognitive Testing / Evaluations Must Become Part Of Routine Exams For Everyone ,As We Never Know Where or When This Dreadful Disease May Strike.</p>
<p>With Respect To Testing / Evaluation, It Must Be More than asking a person their name, what day it is, what year it is and who the President is. I Propose we include questioning about work, family, driving skills, life skills, household management, personal care. In addition to Monitoring Personality / Behavioral Status and Changes.</p>
<p>The Key here is Proper Evaluation, Monitoring, Detection of Changes and Knowing When To Red Flag.</p>
<p><strong>Education / Training:</strong></p>
<p>Education and Training are Critically Important and Mandatory in the Diagnosis, Treatment and Care of Those Affected By Alzheimer's Disease, and Must Be An Ongoing Process As The Disease Evolves Over Time.</p>
<p>Through my Exposure and Experience I have seen the Blood Boiling Impact that Those With Poor / Little To No Knowledge, Education and Training can have when it comes to Alzheimer's, from Arguing with Patients , Poor / In-Effective Communication Skills to Leaving Patients Un-Attended. All of which are 100 Percent Un-Acceptable and In-Excusable.</p>
<p>People who are working in Any Capacity With Those Affected By Alzheimer's Must Be The Best Of The Best, The Cream Of The Crop as There Is No Room To Settle For Second Best.</p>
<p>Ill Willed or Under Qualified People Pose A Grave Danger and Threat To Those With Alzheimer's and We Must Ensure, The Best Of The Best Are Ready, Willing and Able To Step Up and Provide The Necessary Care.</p>
<p><strong>Caregivers and Support:</strong></p>
<p>Formal, Thorough, Ongoing Education, Training and Support Are Essential at All levels of the Caregiving Process, and It Must Be Seamless.</p>
<p>There Must Also Be Flexibility Within Medical Coverage Of All Types To Allow For Flexibility and Out of Network / Program Services If These Out Of Network / Program Services Provide A Level of Care / Support Which Standards and Quality Exceed In Network / Program. Why Should Those With Alzheimer's and Their Caregivers Be Backed Into A Corner Which Forces Acceptance Of Sub-Standard Services?</p>
<p>Caregivers at All levels also Need Adequate and Timely Relief To Prevent ' Burnout ' and To Tend To Their Own Personal Health and Affairs.</p>
<p>Caregivers Must Be Educated and Informed Of All Available Support Services, which as a Caregiver , Myself Can Be Overwhelming , In and Of Itself, As Most Are Unsure Of How To Begin The Process Of Locating Services or Lack the Time and Energy To Do So.</p>
<p>Given This, I wish to offer my services, as an official community resource, with respect to assisting Caregivers research, locate, apply for and coordinate support services. I have Professionally and Successfully Linked Caregivers with a myriad of support services ranging from In Home Personal Care Services to Financial and Prescription Support Services.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts:</strong></p>
<p>In Closing, I Agree That Alzheimer's Is Quickly Approaching Epidemic Levels and If We Fail To Act Now, This Failure Will Prove To Be Devastating To Say The Least.</p>
<p>The National Plan, When Combined With Input, Such As Contained In This Document, Ensure That A Proactive Approach Will Lessen The Burden and Devastation Of Alzheimer's At All Levels.</p>
<p>We Must Also Unite and Advocate Tirelessly To Ensure Every Aspect Of This Plan Does Not Fall Prey To The " Politics ' Of Our Government ,As That Too Will Prove To Be Devastating.</p>
<p>Thank You For The Opportunity To Provide Input On The National Plan, It Has Been An Extreme Honor To Say The Least and I Look Forward To This Being Fully Enacted and Enforced.</p>

<p>Please accept the following comments on the draft National Plan for Alzheimer's and Related Disorders from the State Unit on Aging in Connecticut:</p>
<ol><li>While evidence based research can be a reliable tool, more flexibility should be granted to community providers and researchers to explore innovative and creative non-pharmacological approaches to living with and treating Alzheimer's disease. Our CONNECTIONS grant from AoA and our work in CT with NECC and cognitive training has afforded us with many examples of the positive impacts of this intervention on the quality of life for the caregiver as well as the individual with dementia. Excluding such projects from funding opportunities, further exploration or dismissing them as models because they do not have the full complement of expansive research behind them is short-sighted and limiting to families. Often the most innovative approaches are the ones that afford families a sense of empowerment in combating the disease process.</li>
<li>The strategy area of "maintaining the dignity, safety and rights of people with Alzheimer's Disease" is critical. The perception of this disease and the assumed burden that families incur upon diagnosis often negatively impacts the delivery of care received by those with the diagnosis. Training medical and legal personnel as well as other individuals in the field is an excellent way to begin addressing the stigma associated with the disease and some of the misperceptions and assumptions that are prevalent. Monitoring and reporting the use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes is an excellent proposed action, as is providing awareness training and education for professional caregivers.</li>
<li>It would be beneficial to incorporate hospice options into any training module offered to families as well as facilities working with this population.</li>
<li>The design and implementation of a national education initiative is enthusiastically supported. We are still struggling with the same level of stigma 14 years after implementing our Statewide Respite Care Program (for individuals with Alzheimer's disease) in Connecticut, and many conversations with our local Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association underscore this sentiment.</li>
<li>I strongly encourage the Plan team to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment before new activities are initiated. Since many states and individual organizations may already be implementing aspects of the plan, best practices should be observed to obviate unnecessary and costly duplication or delays.</li>
</ol><p>Please contact me or Cynthia Grant our Alzheimer's contract specialist at the above email address should you need more information.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft HHS National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Cambridge Cognition offers the attached document for consideration.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Cambridge Cognition welcomes the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease. In response to the request for comments relating to Strategy 2.b 'ensure timely and accurate diagnosis', and action 2.B.2, 'identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools', the Committee is invited to consider a computerized solution; and the following is submitted:</p>
<ul><li>In the context of an annual wellness check and also in the context of early diagnostic assessment, the careful choice of an appropriate cognitive test is imperative. Many cognitive instruments do not measure with adequate sensitivity the changes in episodic memory that are the characteristic feature of early in course Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.</li>
<li>Cognitive assessments should be sensitive to the changes that occur at the early stages of dementia, norm-referenced, culturally unbiased, easy-to-use and standardized in administration. One example of such a test is the CANTAB Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test, a non-verbal, visuospatial measure of cued episodic memory.</li>
<li>Computerized assessments are a vital part of the future of cognitive testing. CANTAB PAL, a test presented on touch screen, is being used in leading scientific and clinical institutions worldwide and by major pharmaceutical companies in their clinical research. This widespread use has resulted in over 70 peer-reviewed publications in dementia. Across a number of studies, the PAL test shows very high levels of sensitivity and specificity in differentiating mild Alzheimer's disease from healthy aging and clinical depression. Furthermore, impaired performance on the PAL test has been shown to predict rate of subsequent cognitive decline in patients with MCI (Swainson et al., 2001; Blackwell et al 2004, 2005; Mitchell et al., 2009; Egarhazi et al 2007; Chandler et al 2008) and in community dwelling samples of older adults (de Jager et al., 2002, 2005). Performance on the PAL test has also been shown to be associated with CSF amyloid beta:tau levels (Barnett et al., 2011).</li>
<li>Beyond its scientific credibility, any test used in a primary care setting must be easy to use, fast and reliable. Ideally, the same test should also be appropriate for use within the context of a comprehensive diagnostic work-up.</li>
<li>Experience gained from the deployment of CANTAB PAL in over 1000 centres has shown that the elderly find the touch screen presentation intuitive and easy to interact with, accommodating a broader range of motor function than other computerized interfaces or even pencil and paper tests.</li>
<li>The wide availability of iPad and other similar devices enables CANTAB PAL to be made available to mainstream healthcare for the first time. This form of the test, known as CANTABmobile, is particularly well suited for use in primary care settings. By using adaptive methodology, the test is completed within 5-7 mins.</li>
<li>CANTABmobile offers key benefits in being both language invariant and culturally neutral. The test instructions are automatically administered using a voiceover in the language selected onscreen. Currently 18 language options are available within the test, including American English and Latin American Spanish. This facility reduces the cost of translation services and ensures patients are assessed quickly regardless of their language. The voiceover and automated stimulus presentation also enables full standardization in test delivery, allowing non-specialist health care professionals to administer the test, again reducing costs and improving quality.</li>
<li>The test takes 5-7 minutes, and automatically finishes if the patient fails at a given level, avoiding patient distress, and ensuring efficient use of time. The results are automatically scored comparing performance against a database of more than 4000 adults, fully adjusting for age, education and gender. The test instantly produces a single page report which clearly indicates the suggested action using a simple traffic light system. The report can be immediately emailed, printed or saved as a pdf.</li>
<li>The CANTABmobile test platform also includes computerised rating scales for depression and activities of daily living, fulfilling the criteria for other aspects of the wellness check, reducing risk of misclassification due to depression. The outputs for these are similarly included in the physician report.</li>
<li>Furthermore, CANTABmobile allows monitoring patients over time (Fowler et al 1995, 1997, 2002), and also anonymized data collation across systems, achieving the aim of facilitating public health outcomes research.</li>
<li>CANTABmobile has been developed for primary care physicians alongside a partner product covering a multi-domain toolkit designed for specialists.</li>
</ul><p>In summary, CANTABmobile delivers a high level of scientific rigor and patient/practitioner convenience. Furthermore, the computerized format enables many additional and desirable features. Embracing computerized solutions, both in primary and specialist services, will enable effective early detection of memory loss and provide an expedient route to diagnosis and intervention.</p>

<p>I wish to make this statement on Wednesday, orally, during the Teleconference, and to have these words below and the names of the co-signers, part of the transcript:</p>
<p>For patients who will someday suffer from Alzheimer's and related dementias, Advance Care Planning is <strong>most urgent, most important</strong>, and <strong>most challenging</strong>. The process of expressing one's end-of-life wishes in advance warrants both 1) the development of innovative planning tools that are easy, effective, and acceptable to both patients and physicians, and 2) sufficient effort to encourage people to complete them.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning most urgent? Unlike most diseases, patients who have dementia typically lose mental capacity to make end-of-life medical decisions early in the course of the disease. Once their window of opportunity to make decisions closes, they will not be able to participate in their own end-of-life planning. The huge epidemic predicted for Alzheimer's makes promoting Advance Care Planning urgent on a societal level.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning most important? Unlike most diseases, patients can linger in the terminal stage of Advanced Dementia for several years. They may frustrate clinicians, caregivers and loved ones as their disease ravages on. The multiple burdens on others are well known. More than one-third of caregivers are depressed. Yet the suffering patients themselves experience is under-appreciated. For too many, pain and suffering may go unrecognized and therefore under-treated for months, or even years.</p>
<p>Why is Advance Care Planning most challenging? Unlike most diseases, there are often no life-sustaining treatments that physicians can withhold or withdraw. Typically, a strong body houses a feeble brain. Many who feel the pang of the "<strong>Dementia Fear</strong>" consider "<em>premature dying</em>." This kind of thinking is typical: "If I don't kill myself now, I won't be able to kill myself later. I'll be trapped in a condition I hate so much that I'd rather be dead." Those who act on this fear only increase the tragedy of their disease. We must offer patients an effective advance care plan so they can feel confident they can avoid a prolonged dying of months to years with suffering and burdens. Then they will choose to live as long, and as well as possible--as they benefit from improvements in medical and non-medical management of their disease.</p>
<p>Advance Care Planning that specifically includes Advanced Dementia needs funding to develop and implement, even if researchers discover new drugs that delay the onset of symptoms or slow down their progression. Here's why: Changes in the brains of afflicted people start one or more decades before clinical symptoms emerge. Meanwhile, it will at best take many years to prove the safety and efficacy of new drugs and adopt a policy for widespread treatment. Realistically, most of the 76 million baby boomers who are now destined to get dementia will probably still become demented. Even if new drugs were available today, Alzheimer's-afflicted with who do not die of another cause will eventually reach the stage of Advanced Dementia... and, wWhen they do, they will be able to rely only on their Advance Directives, to control how long, and how much, they must suffer before they die.</p>
<p>To reduce end-of-life suffering of millions of victims of Alzheimer's disease and their loved ones, we thus must: 1) develop new Advance Directives that are easy, effective, and acceptable; and, 2) implement programs to encourage people to complete them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PLAN</strong></p>
<p>The National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare appreciates the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan. Together, with our more than 1,900 member organizations, we serve our nation's most vulnerable citizens: more than 8 million adults and children with mental illness and substance use disorders. We are committed to providing comprehensive, quality care that affords every opportunity for recovery and inclusion in all aspects of community life.</p>
<p>The National Council is, of course, very pleased that the federal government is developing plans to address the needs of people with dementia and their families, a population that will grow substantially over the next quarter century because of the elder boom and because of increased life expectancy.</p>
<p>The National Council believes, however, that, as drafted, <strong>the plan will fail to meet the needs--and to improve the quality of life--of millions of people who currently have dementia and their families as well as millions more who will develop dementia over the next decade and more</strong>.</p>
<p>In these comments the National Council will address two major concerns: (1) unbalanced distribution of new funding and (2) the failure to address the behavioral health dimensions of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong>: Although the draft plan does not specify future funding, it does provide information about funding that has been committed prior to the finalization of the plan. Altogether $156 million will be added over the next two years. It will be distributed as follows:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="text-align:center"><tbody><tr><th scope="col" style="text-align:center"><strong>Goals</strong></th>

<td style="text-align:center"><strong>$156.0 million</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:center"><strong>100%</strong></td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>If this reflects how funds will be distributed going forward, it is clear that research is the single priority of the Plan; its other four goals are evidently of very limited importance.</p>
<p>The National Council does not oppose increased spending on research seeking a cure, preventive interventions, or a way to substantially slow the growth of disability due to dementia. But achieving any of this by 2025 is probably wildly optimistic given the current state of research. And while we are waiting, 10's of millions of people with dementia and their families will not get the care and support that they need and deserve, resulting in avoidable suffering and missed opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>This plan appears to write off a generation or more of people with dementia and their families. </strong></p>
<p>The National Council understands that those who want research to be the virtually exclusive priority of our nation's efforts could argue that funding for services is available elsewhere, but this is a partial truth. Medicare mostly does not cover long-term care or family support; and Medicaid is supposed to be for people with very limited means. Indeed, long-term care is one of the targets for cost cutting in Medicaid, and one of the proposals to cut Medicaid that resurfaces routinely is reducing the ability of people who are not extremely poor to become eligible for coverage of long-term care services.</p>
<p><strong>The National Council strongly urges HHS to revisit the question of how new funds should be spent and to place much greater emphasis on improving care now and for the foreseeable future than this draft plan does. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Neglect of Behavioral Health </strong></p>
<p>The summary of facts about dementia given near the beginning of the plan notes (1) that people with dementia experience "behavioral and psychiatric disorders", (2) that "personality and behavior changes may also occur", and (3) that family caregivers experience tremendous stress and "report symptoms of depression and anxiety and poorer health outcomes." But these very important facts are barely mentioned in the rest of the plan and, with the possible exception of family caregivers, are not addressed in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>This omission will result in certain failure to meet behavioral health needs that are common among people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Here are some sections of the plan that need to reflect behavioral health issues.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Framework and guiding principles</strong>: This section lists service systems that are important to people with dementia and their families, mentioning health care, long-term care, home care, legal services, and social services. Mental health and substance abuse (behavioral health) systems are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.B: Expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease</strong>: This section mentions both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (though it emphasizes biological research), but it does not mention the need for research regarding preventing and/or treating co-occurring mental or substance use disorders or the neuro-psychiatric symptoms that affect virtually all people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategies 1.B. 3, 5, and 6: Expand clinical trials</strong>: These sections fail to mention clinical trials of anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications, which probably are over-used currently and are dangerous. Non-pharmacological, psychosocial interventions can be enormously helpful to people with dementia and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. But it would be useful to develop medications that are safe and effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs</strong>: This section lists fields and settings where findings of research should be disseminated so as to improve practice. Behavioral health settings are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2, 3</strong>: These sections mention a number of federal agencies that need to be involved. SAMHSA, NIMH, NIDA, and NIAAA are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with skills to provide high-quality care</strong>: This section notes, "Physicians need information on how to implement the new requirement regarding "detection of any cognitive impairment." They, and other health providers also need information about how to detect a co-occurring mental or substance use disorder and to distinguish their effects from those of dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B: Ensure timely and accurate diagnosis</strong>: As noted, accurate diagnosis requires a very difficult differential diagnosis to distinguish between dementia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong>: This section notes opportunities to provide information and referral through NIA and AoA. It does not mention the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is funded by SAMHSA, and which provides a national I&amp;R network for help with any mental health issue--not just suicide. There are also local I&amp;R systems focused on mental health and/or substance abuse, which are not mentioned in the draft plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings</strong>: This section mentions "home, physician's office, and long-term care facility." It does not mention mental health settings such as clinics, day programs, inpatient units, psychiatric rehabilitation, crisis services, and case management programs. It should be noted at the very least that people with AD in crisis often are referred or taken to psychiatrists or other mental health professionals, who are expected to provide treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.E: Explore the effectiveness of new models</strong>: This section mentions "medical homes", which are required to integrate physical and behavioral health care, but there is no mention in the plan about this fact. The plan also does not note the emphasis in the Affordable Care Act on developing "health homes", for which many people with dementia will probably be eligible because they have multiple chronic conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F: Ensure that people with AD experience safe and effective transitions between care settings and systems</strong>: Despite the fact that settings and systems officially charged with caring for people with dementia frequently turn to the mental health system when there are behavioral problems, there is no mention of how profoundly flawed transitions between the mental health and the long-term settings and systems are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F. 1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong>: Despite the fact that many people with AD--with and without psychiatric disorders--end up in psychiatric inpatient units of hospitals due to behavioral problems, there is no mention of the need to address psychiatric hospitalization specifically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.G: Advance coordinated and integrated health and long-term services</strong>: This section and its subsections do not mention the <strong>need to coordinate physical and behavioral health services</strong>, which is particularly surprising since integration of this kind is a major goal of health care reform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.H: Improve care for populations disproportionally affected by AD and for populations facing care challenges</strong>: This section appropriately identifies "people with intellectual disabilities" as disproportionately affected by AD, but it fails to mention people with serious and persistent mental illnesses who do not recover over time, as is true for many people with schizophrenia and other treatment refractory mental disorders. People with serious and persistent mental illness also often develop dementia, compounding causes of cognitive impairment and complicating care and treatment tremendously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with AD and The Families</strong>: This section does mention the mental health needs of family and other informal caregivers. They could get more attention than is in the plan, but it's there to some extent. However, this section vastly neglects the mental health needs of people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong>: This section calls for "dissemination through the Aging Network, state public health departments, and public websites." There is no mention of the mental health system, to which people with AD and their families frequently go for help.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no mention of dissemination to people with dementia, most of whom can read and process information in the early and mid-phases of dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term care services and supports system</strong>: Again, the plan fails to recognize the frequent use of the mental health system by people with AD and their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</strong>: This section says "AoA will expand efforts to develop more AD-capable long-term services and supports [for] AD caregivers." Although the section mentions the need for interventions regarding depression, it fails to mention anxiety disorders--which are very common. In addition it fails to mention the need for "AD-capable" behavioral health services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</strong>: This section notes the importance of call centers, but does not reflect awareness of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which could be an important resource during a crisis. This section also does not reflect the fact that, it is usually the psychiatric services in local hospitals or psychiatric mobile crisis teams that are called on to deal with a behavioral crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D: Maintain the dignity, safety and rights of people with AD</strong>: This section appropriately notes the fact that people with dementia are vulnerable in many ways and that many need more protection than they get. (The inadequacy of many Adult Protective Services programs is particularly important to address.) However, there is nothing here to suggest that people with dementia need anything other than protection. Treating people still capable of some degree of self-care and of being helpful to others, solely as people in need of protection, diminishes them and deprives them of the dignity and rights that this section is supposed to address. <strong>There needs to be a strengths-based model for dementia as increasingly there is for people with psychiatric and other disabilities</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report, and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong>: This is clearly important to do, but it is also important to address the use of anti-psychotics in other settings such as homes, assisted living facilities, senior housing, adult day care, etc. In addition, it is very important to <strong>address the inappropriate use of anti-depressants</strong> because recent studies suggest that anti-depressants have high risks and virtually no benefits for people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.E: Assess and address the housing needs of people with AD</strong>: Stable housing, as the plan says, is a critical need for people with dementia. But the plan seems to have a remarkably limited view of the kinds of stable housing that can be helpful--such as assisted living, continuing care communities, senior housing, supportive housing, and housing for people with serious mental illness.</p>
<p>The draft plan fails to note that people with serious mental illness are frequently dumped out of housing they have had within the mental health system for many years and are sent to nursing homes when their dementia or physical disorders become too difficult for the mental health system--as it is currently organized--to care for. It should be possible for people with serious mental illness to stay or in their own homes or in the housing that has become their home rather than to be shunted off to a long-term care system that has very limited capacity to care for them.</p>
<p>Finally, even though reducing the unnecessary use of nursing homes for people with dementia is a clear goal of this plan, there is no mention of the fact that there are now more people admitted to nursing homes with mental illness other than dementia than with dementia alone. Frequently they are people with co-occurring dementia and psychiatric disorders. Housing designed for this population is needed to help them avert admission to nursing homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Public education should include information about the frequent overlap of mental disorders and dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data To Track Progress</strong>: Because this plan does not seem to reflect awareness of the important role the mental health system plays in helping people with dementia and their families, it seems likely that plans for improved data collection will overlook data related to psychiatric disorders and mental health settings. It is important to track progress regarding the behavioral health of people with dementia and their families.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The National Council hopes that you will find these comments on specific sections of the draft plan helpful in identifying what needs to be included in the final plan regarding the behavioral health needs of people with dementia and their families. The fact of the matter is that good care, care informed by understanding the psychological potential of people with dementia and the stress experienced by their family members, could result in vastly improved quality of life for them.</p>
<p>We do not have to wait for a cure to make life better, and we should not devote virtually all new resources to seeking a cure when so much could be accomplished with better care and support.</p>
<p>The National Council would be happy to help the group developing the plan to flesh out any of the suggestions included in this letter.</p>

<p>I would like to thank this committee for their efforts on this project. I am writing a very long letter and hope someone takes the time to read it and forward to all involved.</p>
<p>As this plan moves forward I can applaud the parts of the plan that involve research and drug development. I am sure it will make the researchers and drug companies very happy!! I have no problem researching earlyon set Alzhemers, but really the brain is an organ just like the heart and lungs. There is no cure for old, period! When a person shows signs of this disease at 75 years of age it is just that, the brain is getting old. The government can dump millions into drugs that they them selves will be paying for. Do you know how much Nemenda costs? Most people that take it could never afford it, so the government pays for a drug that has very little effect on the person that takes it. Financial aid and support to the families trying to care for a loved one at home is where this country will benefit.</p>
<p>I am a 52 year old daughter taking care of an 87 year old father with severe Alzheimers. We have a unique situation where I as well as 2 brothers live next door to my dad on land given to us by him. For the last 10 years I have taken care of him as well as worked and raised a family. I have 2 children who are in the health field, 1 a nurse and 1 in a Doctor Pharmacy program, that I struggle to keep in school since I have had to stop working. In the beginning my dad just required monitoring, meals delivered and laundry done, as the disease progressed we alarmed the house so he could not wander off at night. He tripped and broke his right hip in April 2010, surgery made the disease go crazy and I have been a full time caregiver since that day! My data never took a dime of government assistance, he lived and worked as a construction worker and farmed through some very difficult times. He had maybe $35,000 in an IRA when this began. My brothers help where they can and I private pay caregivers (35 hours per week) with the money he has remaining to the tune of $1400 a month. He collects $1267 social security. So after utilities, insurance, drugs and food the remainder comes from the IRA. You can see that when we pre-pay a funeral he will almost be broke. I stopped working, stay 5 nights a week with my dad. Moving someone to a skilled care only worsens this disease or any dementia. April 2011 dad broke his left hip, Hospital 5 days Nov 2011 for and infection. After every surgery or hospital stay he was sent to skilled care (I use that term very loosely) the very basics are not being met in these homes, my dad was left unattended wet and soiled on a daily basis. He developed pineal yeast infections that went unchecked until I discovered it. This is caused by neglect and poor hygiene The workers are miserable, patients are ignored, no one smiles or even pretends to hear them. Don't believe me, take off your suit and go undercover for a visit. I saw this care across the board in 3 different skilled care facilities. My dad is no longer verbal enough to get a point across, but after every trip to a skilled home I would insist on bringing him home when he looked like death. Home is where it is at!!! Love and proper care, I have him walking with a walker, I have him on a bathroom schedule (he is never wet). At night I taught myself how to use an external catheter (something I had to fight to have Medicare approve). This is an aid that is simple to use and eliminates wetness at night and helps to prevent bedsores.</p>
<p>My dad now receives some help from the area on aging, that provides 3 half days of daycare. This is income based and I am controlled if I want to remain in the program to keep his withdraws from his IRA to a minimum. I do this so he dosen't run out of money therefore forcing him onto Medicaid and forcing us to put him in a home. Where is the burden of care? on me!!! Now we are hearing budgets cut to the access public transportation he rides to and from day care. I will be forced to enroll my dad onto Medicaid this will cost the government more than $9,000 monthly.</p>
<p>We were not rich enough to hire an Elder Attorney to transfer my dads assets out of his name, nor do we feel it was our right. How many rich people are on Medicaid because they were taught to spend down their assets? Not one person in this country should be able to give their undeserving children an inheritance before they die, period! Not one person is more in need of skilled care than my dad 24/7 and I could qualify him in a heart beat if I pre-pay a funeral. However I know without a doubt that I am giving him better care than he would get in a home. He is happy in his home and everyday that he smiles and says thank you is a gift to me!</p>
<p>My recommendations give the families financial help to keep their loved ones at home. Give the care giver that quit her job a tax break, so they can continue to help send their own children to college. Allow people to hire quality private care givers, don't force an agency that charges double the hourly rate on us. Respite care that is now covered only under Medicaid, so that we can a least get a weeksbreak to refresh our minds would be nice! Stop taxing the elderly when they can prove every dime of there money is going to care for themselves. Adult Day care should be a medical expense.</p>
<p>I also see both sides of this story my in-laws were forced by 2 of their children to move to assisted living. They pay $4300 a month and my father-in-law takes care of his wife their and the home is very happy to have them. They should be, he does their job for them and they collect the pay check!!! They hate where they live!</p>
<p>There was a song written over 50 years ago the title is "The House of Shame" by Smiley Bates. My dad would call a local radio station almost every Saturday and request it, he then would call each of his children to tell them listen to it. I challenge you to listen to it, I did! Nothing has really changed in 50 years.</p>
<p>I am sorry this is so long, but unless you know the entire problem you can not fix it.</p>

<p>I was reading through your plan this weekend. CNS Vital Signs <a href="http://www.cnsvs.com">http://www.cnsvs.com</a> is a small yet highly successful computerized neurocognitive assessment platform used by over 6500 clinicians in 52 countries. It is regularly used to assess neurocognitive impairment (see attached PDF). It significantly supports the new MCI Guidelines... I noticed Action 2.B.2 (see below) and was wondering if we can get more detailed information as to...</p>
<p><strong>HOW &amp; WHO WILL BE DOING THE ASSESSMENT OF THE NEUROCOGNITIVE ASSESSMENT TOOLS?</strong><br /><strong>Will CNS Vital Signs be included in the mix of recommended tools?<br />
					Is there other contacts I should be making within this endeavor?<br />
					CNS Vital Signs has been used by most of the major pharmaceutical companies (2000 investigator sites worldwide) in clinical trials and we are working with some academic based neuropsychologists on a new tests. Is it possible for either the academic institutions or our small business to receive some funding to research - enhance the assessment of neurocognition using our assessment platform? How can we as a small business get help? </strong></p>
<p>If you, your staff, or any interested parties would like a FREE TRIAL of our assessment platform... simply register at our website <a href="http://www.cnsvs.com">http://www.cnsvs.com</a>; download the LOCAL software app... and begin testing... we also have a WEB app demo at <a href="https://www.cnsvs.com/index.php/demo-learn">https://www.cnsvs.com/index.php/demo-learn</a> just follow the instructions.</p>
<p>I know this issue is of great importance to our country and we stand ready to help in any way possible.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</strong><br />
					The Affordable Care Act created the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. "Detection of any cognitive impairment" must be included as part of the wellness visit. HHS is using research findings to identify the most appropriate assessment tools that can be used in a variety of outpatient clinical settings to assess cognition. The recommended tools will be distributed to practitioners to aid in identification and evaluation of cognitive impairment and risk for dementia.</p>

<p>I have worked in the healthcare industry for 20 plus years, specifically with the geriatric population. I am currently the Director of Therapeutic Recreation and Volunteer Services at a long term care facility in New York.</p>
<p>My comments, or rather hopes with this project are really very simple. I deal with individuals who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease and other types of Dementia and have lived with it for years, by the time they come to our facility they may have lived in the community for 1 to 5 years before a loved knew that taking care of them at home was no longer a safe option.</p>
<p>My hope is that this project builds in funds for caregivers who provide treatment modalities such as therapeutic recreation, music therapy, art therapy etc., treatments that do not include psychopharmacological components only, treatments that treat the individual as a person with a personality, with nuances to their personality,or rather their new personality that has manifested itself via the disease. Things like painting, singing, reminiscing, cooking, gardening etc are in fact very important parts of treatment for the person living with Alzheimer's Disease, and are sometimes the most important aspect related to the quality of life for the person and their families.</p>
<p>Please know that those who provide this type of treatment are people like me, A Certified Dementia Practioner, with a Master's Degree in Community Health, a quality of life specialist, who treat the person as a person and not just a symptom. I do know that this is cliche, but please know how important it is for the day to day activities of these individuals to have meaningful activity with a sense of purpose and focus and most important...dignity.</p>
<p>Please build in funds for these disciplines in this industry, I know how utterly important it is to provide funding for research towards a cure, but these patients, these people, these grandmothers and grandfathers etc. Must have activity and must have some meaningful quality to their lives until the day we find a cure.</p>
<p>Thank you so very much for your time and for working on this project.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTARY RE: "DRAFT NATIONAL PLAN TO ADDRESS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE"</strong></p>
<p>With all due respect to the contributors and authors of this draft plan, I submit that, if finalized as written, it will do more to destroy the Alzheimer's community and set back any hope of progress toward a solution than anything seen to date in my lifetime.</p>
<p>WHY?</p>
<p>As written this is a blatantly politicized piece of campaign rhetoric. I, perhaps surprisingly, am a life-long Democrat and strong supporter of liberal causes who has burned a lot of shoe leather knocking on doors on behalf of liberal candidates starting with Adlai Stevenson in 1952, but I am and have been also a dementia caregiver for over 20 years. This Alzheimer's Disease issue SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY! THE PROBLEM IS APOLITICAL, AND SO SHOULD BE THE SOLUTION!</p>
<ol><li>Starting with the Vision Statement. There is NO better vision than that of The Alzheimer's Association - "A world without Alzheimer's Disease".</li>
<li>Certainly President Obama should be given credit for his support, and his supporting statement deserves recognition in the plan, but other people such as former House Speaker Gingrich deserve equal recognition for their contributions toward developing and supporting these efforts as well.</li>
<li>This entire issue of age related cognitive impairment (I've read that there are nearly 100 probable types/causes) deserves the support of EVERY citizen, whatever their political persuasion, and this draft plan mitigates any possibility of achieving that necessary broad level of support.</li>
<li>Further, in the 27 pages of text, I count at least 8 specific references to the "wonderful" AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. Why? One should be more than enough, Zero would be better since a) The administration is wavering on implementation with refusal to implement some parts of the law, b) the administration is providing multi-state waivers to other parts, c) there seems to be little agreement or consensus on interpretation of key elements among those few who have struggled to review those nearly 3000 pages, and lastly d) this controversial law has yet to be reviewed for constitutionality by The Supreme Court (partiallly or completely).</li>
</ol><p>I suggest that the intent of those statements can be preserved in a much less controversial way by simply replacing "Affordable Care Act" language with something like "existing and proposed legislation". I think that the PLAN might also allow for the possibility for proposing new, additional legislation should it be considered useful.</p>
<p>With respect to Strategy 1C, I feel it would be most appropriate to add an additional action to address the legal and ethical aspects of early detection. What about those people that show no signs of dementia but are discovered to have major plaque accumulations? Should they be told?</p>
<p>I agree that measurement of the disease's progression is extremely valuable to the caregivers, researchers, and medical professionals, but I think that more than imaging and biomarkers is needed. Today, the "gold standard" of American neurologists and gerontologists is probably the MMSE (Mini Mental State Exam), although many more assessment tools have been developed and found useful around the world. Of even more significance is the Allen Cognitive Scale measuring patients ability to contribute to their care in later stages. The PLAN should include recommendations for assessment tool standards to be applied nationwide in evaluating AD/Dementia progression for use in clinical trials, medical reporting, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Another observation formed from my having read the proposed draft report numerous times is that the research portion, despite expressing some valid points, still appears to be another somewhat disorganized "hip-shoot" relying on far too much luck and too little deliberate, well thought out planning. Dr. Eric Kandel said it best when he applauded the successes so far and recognized that this whole issue was extremely complex and we had a lot more to learn. The complexity of the challenges clearly represents a "system of systems" which the late Russell Ackoff defined to be a "mess". This entire program cries out for a well-organized systems engineering approach if any progress is to be made in an affordable, rapid manner. Ackoff would have been our guy, but perhaps a colleague or student of his might be found to accomplish this task as soon as possible. A few calls to the systems thinking community in Academia or the International Federation for Systems Research might identify some key people.</p>
<p>Speaking of complexity, I think we can rely on the following:</p>
<ol><li>Age related dementias (other than major vascular events) are slow in development (Some have said that AD may begin in a persons twenties).</li>
<li>AD mechanisms change as the disease progresses and as damage occurs.</li>
<li>Each stage may require markedly different treatments to achieve delay or prevention.</li>
</ol><p>Is it possible that we are discarding treatments because we are applying trials to an inappropriate stage of the disease? (or even to those that may be incorrectly diagnosed?) Can we confidently rely on the FDA to make the appropriate treatment decisions for all stages of AD? I assure you that the "front-line" families become more desperate as the disease continues it's slow progression. I further suspect that most people in the AD community care very little if the treatment is "FDA Approved". The issues really boil down to:</p>
<ol><li>Is the treatment available (anywhere in the world)?</li>
<li>Is the treatment affordable?</li>
<li>Where, when, and how can I get it?</li>
</ol><p>An example of a layman's assessment of possible "treatments" as of today is shown as Attachment 1 to this commentary.</p>
<p>With regard to rapidity, I also have seen other criticisms of the 2025 goal suggesting that a 2020 goal might be better. Certainly, I would like to see a goal of 2010, but I believe that 2025 might be attainable only if we restrict ourselves to those things that are in the "pipeline" today, which in turn have no guarantee of success. I would urge you to consider scheduling several goals, with separate time objectives, recognizing that we are in a cancer or AIDS-like program that might take 50 years to find a "cure". By the way, I also noted that "finding a cure" is not in the list of research objectives. Have you given up?</p>
<p>I would suggest starting as follows:</p>
<ol><li>Identify and treat risks (2012) - Suggestions for good/bad environmental and diet approaches (subject to vary with time and knowledge -- remember discarding our aluminum cookware?) This is like "No Smoking" in the fight against cancer.</li>
<li>Slow and/or stop degradation (2015) This is partially available now for those who respond to Aricept/Namenda combo treatment. Solutions are needed for the large number of people who do NOT respond favorably.</li>
<li>Early Prevention (2020)</li>
<li>Minimize Symptoms (2022)</li>
<li>Delay Onset (2025)</li>
<li>Reversal of Afflictions (2050) - "THE CURE"!!!!</li>
</ol><p>Of course, the above dates are unsupported figments of my imagination, but I hope you see the concept here.</p>
<p>I also found some statements and titles in the described actions that gave me a "where did this come from" moment. Namely, Action 1.B.3 that discusses clinical trials and international outreach. Do you intend to request non-citizens, off-shore, to participate in our clinical trials? This needs some explanation. Another point that underwhelmed me was Action 1.B.4. Is this just pro-forma government speak or is there a real point? Frankly, I am of the very solid opinion that Alzheimer's Disease is about as racially and ethnically diverse and unbiased in selection as is possible in all of humanity. Are you implying that there is bias in the clinical trial community? Is there managed selectivity in who gets the "stuff" and who gets placebo? I highly doubt that! In fact, I doubt that your assumption of higher risk for AD being either racially or ethnically related has any validity at all. I submit that the REAL reason for those observations lie in differences in life-long histories of environment, diet, and health care practices. For example, we are fairly certain that Americans (of my generation) of Greek or Italian ethnic heritage are at lower AD risk levels, most likely due to preferences for a mostly Mediterranean Diet. This risk reduction may not apply to younger generations if they've switched to Drive-Thru Bacon Cheeseburgers. In any case, I suggest that tracking data on historical environment, diet, and health care practices will be much more meaningful, and tracking racial/ethnic populations as suggested will provide little or no contribution toward improved outcomes.</p>
<p>A small, but significant, item that I have some issues with is the stated expected cost of nursing home care at $78,000. A much more representative (and far more meaningful) number can be shown if it were expressed as a range of state cost averages ($70,000 to $150,000) and further adjusted to determine the level of pre-tax retirement income required to sustain the nursing home option (don't forget to include costs for incidentals like toothpaste, shaving cream, haircuts as well as Medicare parts B,C, and D with those costs adjusted for "means testing").</p>
<p>I suspect you will be looking at $150,000 to $250,000 per year. Thus it will be much easier to understand the future economic pressures on Medicaid and will go a long way toward determining the adequacy of an individual's long-term-care planning.</p>
<p>Also, I am very disappointed that this draft plan promulgates the social stigmas so dreaded by those in the Alzheimer's community. I understand the enticement to encourage high funding levels and popular support through fear, but I believe this is counterproductive to the tasks of living with and caring for those with AD. I am also a strong supporter of redefining those people as being "deeply forgetful" as opposed to "Alzheimer's victims", "Alzheimer's sufferers", "Senile individuals", "People with Dementia" or "Cognitively Impaired". Please realize that NOBODY wants to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It WILL rapidly result in loss of life-long friendships, loss of independence, loss of self, loss of peer respect, etc. This is clearly why early diagnoses seldom happen, and why public education is SO important. The stigma extends and becomes tragic when overzealous and uneducated agents of Adult Protective Services who believe the unsupported and unproven claims spread throughout the Elder Abuse channels of government that "most elder abuse comes from spousal and parental relatives/caregivers". I believe that too many malicious prosecutions are executed throughout the country due to proliferation of this myth. Occasionally, States have admitted to errors, documented those errors, and revised state policies (see "HANDCUFFED" by Wisconsin DHS). Other states rigidly support their mistaken beliefs, and I have seen personally the destruction of families, and early, wrongful patient deaths not to mention large legal costs to these families or to the states if public defense is necessary.</p>
<p>Many caregiving families are threatened daily by the health care/ adult protection bureaucracy. Has no one heard of self-inflicted injuries due to agitation? This is why nursing homes use Posey Mitts (soft handcuffs) and load their patients with unwanted drugs. Should patients be arrested and confined if a caregiver is injured? Should caregivers be arrested and confined if a patient exhibits self-inflicted injuries? Should a caregiver be arrested and confined if a patient is inadvertently injured or bruised during an effort to protect another innocent person? Or attempting to protect the general public? Should families be destroyed, Power of Attorney ignored, and spouses of 50 years be separated without visitation upon arrest, with NO conviction? The Plan's legal advisors would provide a great service to the community by prioritizing for both home and professional caregiver's a list of who should get protection/arrest first: a) the general public, b) close bystanders, c) professional caregivers, d) home caregivers, e) spouses and children/parents, or f) the "deeply forgetful" themselves.</p>
<p>Lastly, some comments on caregiving support needs. The PLAN needs to clearly state as part of Goal 2 that the priority is to provide for in-home care as long as possible in order to provide more favorable outcomes, extend life and quality of life at less cost to both families and government taxpayers. My own personal experiences indicate that respite care for family caregivers and supervised productive day care experiences for the "deeply forgetful" are absolutely mandatory to the achievement of this objective. The only successful application that I have seen was a 1991-1992 experimental program in the State of Georgia with several counties participating. While I understand this program has ended, I believe it was well documented, and I guarantee that as implemented it was indeed a lifesaving experience for participants and caregivers.</p>
<p>As to Nursing Homes, reducing the inappropriate use of anti-psychotics is a good start, but further improvements are necessary, and should begin with significant modification to the criteria by which state licensing authorities evaluate these facilities. Current criteria covers physical safety very well, but ignore many quality of life issues that affect the "deeply forgetful" residents. We often need to remind ourselves that the deeply forgetful are NOT "empty shells", but simply require unique communication techniques. The Plan should look specifically at the results achieved by advanced compassionate thinking in facilities modeled after Lakeview Ranch, those practicing The Eden Alternative, Montessori based care for the "deeply forgetful" and suggest significant modifications to existing licensing and evaluation criteria that could be addressed by all State Licensing Authorities. Also, I am told that many facilities consider it to be too costly to maintain and update resident's care plans, apparently in direct violation of federal laws. This may be lack of education, but certainly indicates lack of enforcement.</p>
<p>Hospitalization offers additional caregiver challenges. "Deeply forgetful" patients require special care, and have special needs above and beyond normal expectations. Electronic (although privacy protected) records are a great idea but should be expanded to include primary caregiver advice and concerns. Hospital personnel need to understand time, behavior, and observation problems as well as the patient's inability to express needs, particularly if in discomfort and pain. Similar observations might be made about any social situation that is not a part of daily routine and familiar people. Examples such as travel (particularly by air), home care visitations, family outings, and especially holidays come readily to mind. People that interact with the "deeply forgetful" need to know that respect and personal dignity are paramount.</p>

<p>Background</p>
<p>On January 4, 2011, President Barack Obama signed into law the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA), requiring the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish the National Alzheimer's Project to:</p>
<p>[[Page 11117]]</p>
<ul><li>Create and maintain an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Coordinate Alzheimer's disease research and services across all federal agencies.</li>
<li>Accelerate the development of treatments that would prevent, halt, or reverse the course of Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Improve early diagnosis and coordination of care and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Improve outcomes for ethnic and racial minority populations that are at higher risk for Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Coordinate with international bodies to fight Alzheimer's globally.</li>
</ul><p>The law also establishes the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services and requires the Secretary of HHS, in collaboration with the Advisory Council, to create and maintain a national plan to overcome Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p>
<p>On February 22, 2012, HHS released a draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The draft National Plan has five goals:</p>
<ol><li>Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025.</li>
<li>Optimize Care Quality and Efficiency.</li>
<li>Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families.</li>
<li>Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement.</li>
<li>Track Progress and Drive Improvement.</li>
</ol><p>The draft National Plan includes strategies to achieve each goal and specific actions that HHS or its federal partners will take to drive progress towards achieving the goal.</p>

<p>What EXACTLY is HHS and NIH doing to ensure that people who are enrolled in your Medical (Human) Research and Clinical Trials that you are desperately trying to recruit Alzheimer's patients for have the CAPACITY to give INFORMED CONSENT?</p>
<p>History has shown that some of the most abusive governments in History used vulnerable elderly and incapacitated patients for medical and human research. This was addressed international laws and federal laws in this country.</p>
<p>As an elder rights advocate, I am extremely concerned about the mad rush to do testing on individuals who have been declared incompetent or incapacitated and who do not have the capacity to give informed consent. No surrogate decision maker should be allowed to give informed consent on behalf of any other human being. The surrogate decision maker cannot feel the pain and horrific side effects and the incapacitated person with Alzheimer's may suffer immensely but not be able to even communicate the pain they are involuntarily being forced to endure.</p>
<p>What do you plan to do about this? An all out campaign is needed to HALT any plans to use incapacitated Alzheimer's and dementia patients for human research trials (including drug and other medical research) without informed consent being provided by the individual who will be subjected to the human research and testing!</p>
<p>The press needs to get involved in warning the American people about this travesty.</p>
<p>Please let me know what we can do to ensure that these concerns are addressed.</p>

<p>OVERALL I FIND THE DRAFT PLAN A REASONABLE AND READABLE DOCUMENT, EVEN THE HHS BOILERPLATE. I HAVE SOME COMMENTS WHICH ARE BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE, WHICH I WILL STATE BRIEFLY: MY WIFE, MARTHA, WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A/D AND COPD IN THE FALL OF 2007. I CARED FOR HER AT HOME WITH SOME RESPITE ASSISTANCE UNTIL I COULD NO LONGER DO SO IN JULY OF 2009. I MOVED HER TO AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY FOR SIX MONTHS AFTER WHICH TWO HOSPITALIZATIONS MADE IT NECESSARY TO PUT HER IN A HOSPICE FACILITY FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. IN JUNE OF 2010 I BROUGHT HER TO THE HOUSE ON HOME HOSPICE. I WILL NEVER REGRET DOING THAT. AFTER 55 DAYS, ON AUGUST 4th, 2010, SHE DIED.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>PAGE TWO OF THE PLAN LISTS FOUR GOALS. TWO OF THEM ARE: "... ENHANCE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS' KNOWLEDGE ...", AND "... SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND CAREGIVERS ...". THEY ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GOALS. I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN MORE PROMINENCE AND A GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY. WHY? BECAUSE DISCONTINUITIES IN AVAILABLE MEDICAL CARE ARE A SERIOUS AND GROWING PROBLEM - RIGHT NOW - AND ALZHEIMER'S SUFFERERS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS ARE PAYING THE PRICE - RIGHT NOW. WE ALL HOPE THAT EVENTUALLY A CURE WILL BE FOUND FOR ALZHEIMER'S. BUT AN IMMEDIATE AND MORE ACUTE PROBLEM IS COHERENT AND GRADUATED CARE FOR ALZHEIMER'S AS THE DISEASE PROGRESSES, AND RELIEF FOR THE BURDEN THIS PLACES ON CAREGIVERS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO US:</p>
<ol><li>IT WAS LIKE PULLING TEETH TO GET A DIAGNOSIS. AFTER TWO $600 SESSIONS WITH A MEDICAL "EXPERT" IN THE SPRING AND FALL OF 2007, HE STILL WOULD NOT DIAGNOSE A/D. OUR FAMILY DOCTOR, AN INTERNIST, HAD TO MAKE THE CALL AND BEGIN TREATMENT.</li>
<li>IN JULY 2009, AFTER A HELLISH TWO WEEKS IN A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINIC TO GET THE RIGHT DOSAGE OF A/D DRUGS, THE DOSAGES STILL WERE NOT RIGHT AND OUR INTERNIST HAD TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS LATER.</li>
<li>BY THE FALL OF 2009 15-MINUTE APPOINTMENTS WITH OUR INTERNIST WERE NO LONGER ENOUGH BUT THERE WAS NO AVAILABLE MEDICAL "NEXT STEP". I FOUND THAT AT LEAST IN NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI, ALL THE GERIATRICIANS HAVE BEEN COOPTED AND ABSORBED BY THE HOSPITAL-HOSPICE, NURSING HOME OR HOSPICE INDUSTRIES. THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR AND DO NOT WANT ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS. THEY PREFER PATIENTS WHO NEED MONEY-MAKING REHABILITATIVE THERAPIES.</li>
<li>MONEY IS NOT THE WHOLE ANSWER. WE HAD NURSING HOME INSURANCE, WHICH WOULD HAVE PAID UP TO $254 A DAY. NURSING HOMES COSTING $230 A DAY HAD NO OPENINGS, PREFERRING PATIENTS NEEDING THERAPIES. I OPTED FOR A $90 A DAY ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY, WHICH WAS FINE UNTIL SHE WAS BED-RIDDEN AND HER NEEDS BECAME TOO GREAT FOR ASSISTED LIVING. AS IT WAS, BECAUSE OF THE 90-DAY EXCLUSION ON OUR NURSING HOME INSURANCE, WE BARELY BROKE EVEN ON THAT POLICY.</li>
<li>THE NEXT TRANSITION, AND IT WAS ABRUPT, WAS TO A HOSPICE FACILITY. THE HOSPICE BILLED MEDICARE $1000 A DAY FOR HER CARE. HER CARE THERE WAS PERHAPS TWICE AS GOOD AS IN ASSISTED LIVING, BUT IT WAS NOT ELEVEN TIMES AS GOOD AS THE BILLING WOULD SUGGEST. THE MEDICARE HOSPICE BENEFIT IS A WONDERFUL THING, BUT THE HOSPICE INDUSTRY IS GETTING FAT ON WHAT IT CHARGES, AND IT IS COMPLETELY INADEQUATE FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S.</li>
<li>THE LAST TRANSITION WAS IN JUNE OF 2010 AND IT WAS ALSO ABRUPT. I WAS TOLD SHE HAD TIMED OUT OF IN-PATIENT HOSPICE. I FOUND THAT NURSING HOMES WERE STILL NOT INTERESTED IN HER AS A PATIENT SO I OPTED FOR HOME HOSPICE. I PERSONALLY PREFERRED THAT TO A NURSING HOME, BUT EVEN THOUGH I HIRED A CNA AND AN LPN TO SUPPLEMENT MY EFFORTS AND THE HOME HOSPICE EFFORT, WHICH WAS UNEVEN, HER CARE WAS NOT AS GOOD AS THAT IN A NURSING HOME . BUT, HOME HOSPICE STILL BILLED MEDICARE $250 A DAY, WHICH WAS MORE THAN A NURSING HOME.</li>
</ol><p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>I SAY AGAIN THAT CONTINUITY OF COHERENT AND GRADUATED MEDICAL CARE FOR THE ALZHEIMER'S PATIENT AND RELIEF FOR THE CAREGIVER IS AN ACUTE AND GROWING PROBLEM THAT NEEDS GREATER EMPHASIS IN YOUR PLAN. IT IS A - RIGHT NOW - PROBLEM, NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CHIPPED AWAY AT OVER TIME. BECAUSE OF MY WIFE'S COPD COMPLICATION, WHICH REQUIRED 24/7 OXYGEN, OUR ORDEAL WAS MERCIFULLY SHORTER, LESS THAN THREE YEARS, THAN IS TYPICAL FOR ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS. OTHERS HAVE IT HARDER THAN WE DID.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>I HAVE DETAILED RECORDS FOR EVERYTHING I HAVE SAID ABOVE. I CAN PROVIDE ANYTHING MORE THAT YOU NEED FROM ME.</p>

<p>Attention:<br />
					2012 Public Comments on the National Plan for Alzheimer's Disease and the National Alzheimer's Project Act</p>
<p>Proposal: Early Stage Dementia Care (STAR-10R), a New Thinking For Dementia Care:<br /><strong>STAR-10R (Non-medication Dementia Care): PREVENTION, JOBS, &amp; $1B+ Annual Healthcare Savings</strong></p>
<p>Background:<br />
					STAR-10R has been developed over more than two decades and it is the most innovative and pioneering proactive system of Dementia Care and methods in existence today. It is intended for Early Stage Dementia and it is presently the only comprehensive non-medication alternative for Dementia Care. Through innovative and proprietary methods and techniques, STAR-10R addresses the top 10 most prominent ("10R's") and well known symptoms of Dementia while patients are still within the Early Stages of Dementia (i.e, stages 1-3). It proactively intercepts and intervenes with the known symptoms, rather than an existing "wait and see" or "cause &amp; effect" approach. Our approach and principles with STAR-10R, also sets the stage for a major overhaul in our traditional "cause &amp; effect" Healthcare system, which is outdated at best. In other words, STAR-10R could be the foundation of a new dawn in Preventive Healthcare system for all Americans alike. STAR-10R is also aimed at reducing medication side-effects, by reducing medication, inherent in the cases associated with excessive medication. The latter is usually the case with each occurring Dementia symptom.</p>
<p>Implementation:<br />
					STAR-10R can be implemented at minimal cost, by giving the Healthcare professionals the new tools that they simply do not have through traditional means or existing services. STAR-10R can be implemented by Communities of all classes and categories including Memory Care Units, Assisted Living, Nursing Homes, Home Agencies among others.</p>
<p>Implications:<br />
					STAR-10R is intended for the Early Stages of Dementia and will reduce medication, side-effects and cost of healthcare, all while having the potential to create many thousands of new (and badly needed) highly skilled professional jobs in America. STAR-10R, relatively speaking, costs little to implement. For every $10M investment in its implementation, STAR-10R can serve at least 10,000 Early Stage Dementia patients. That is only $1K annual investment in Dementia Care using our intervention methods, where as the same patients would have otherwise cost in excessive $100K+ annually per Dementia patient, only 3 years later, as they would otherwise progress rapidly through Dementia Stages. In other words, that $10M implementation investment for every 10,000 Early Stage Dementia could save $10M in Dementia Care cost for every 10,000 Seniors (meaning the system pays for itself, and ends up costing nothing). Having said that, when considering the projected increase in baby-boomer population and the relevant projection in Dementia population increase, over the next 10 years the savings to the nation can be well in excess of $10B annually, just in Dementia Care alone. This would mean a savings of $100B over the next 10 years. This will, most definitely, make a major dent in our national debt that is presently out of control! STAR-10R will also help America take a global leadership role in Dementia Care and Intervention and Prevention methods. For more information, please visit our non-marketing and highly information web site below. Thank you for taking this note worthy proposal in consideration; savings alone worth the implementation of this proposal, to say nothing about the impact on Quality of Life for our Seniors, all while offering more Hope to families and better alternatives to traditional wait/see/medicate/spend approach of symptom treatment.</p>

<p>As a 66-year old woman who is conservator for a relative with Alzheimer's and who has watched several other relatives lose their mental faculties and eventually all their other faculties before they died a very long drawn out death, I cannot urge you enough to increase the amount of money spent on research into Alzheimer's and other dementia diseases. Yes, Alzheimer's is devastating to the individual and possibly even more so to the families and caregivers.</p>
<p>When I see that HIV/AIDS research receives about $3 billion from our government whereas Alzheimer's, with 5 times as many affected Americans as there are American HIV patients, even with this new initiative will only get half a billion dollars, I truly don't understand why research into Alzheimer's is so underfunded. I also don't understand why HIV/AIDS patients receive much more government paid assistance than patients with most other diseases. I'm afraid the Alzheimer's lobby has not been vocal enough unlike the HIV/AIDS lobby. But I admire what has been accomplished in making HIV now a treatable chronic illness because of the resources invested in that research.</p>
<p>Don't waste a lot of funding looking for more expensive ways to diagnose Alzheimer's when simple questionnaires and interviews can determine that dementia is present or not. Since dementia is not contagious early diagnosis is only helpful for getting your affairs in order until a viable treatment is discovered.</p>
<p>Unfortunately none of the drugs currently used for Alzheimer's have any long-term benefit and even short-term benefits are questionable. Basic research into what causes or leads to Alzheimer's is where most of the funding needs to go. Hopefully this could lead to understanding how to avoid Alzheimer's altogether as prevention is always preferable and less expensive than treatment. It is is important to include nutritional supplements such as curcumin and vinpocetine in the research since studies have demonstrated some success with several supplements. Just because they can't be patented by drug companies, not enough money is being spent on their research. How cost effective they would be for both patients and the health care system.</p>
<p>If prevention and/or treatment of Alzheimer's and other dementias is not found soon the cost to the government will be astronomical in the future, as families have less ability and inclination to care for dementia patients at home. I predict dementia patients will frequently be abandoned so they can receive medicaid-paid nursing home care.</p>
<p>I urge the Alzheimer's plan to be implemented quickly and research funding be increased exponentially.</p>

<p>In relation to your research,published by the European College on Psychopharmacology, published by Reuters agency on 05.09.2011, from Prof.Dr.Hans-Ulrich Wittchen,I'm sending you the attached material.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>SCREEN OF THE HEALTH IN THE HAIRY BACK</strong></p>
<p>Today we are living in a wold filed with tension, broken families, psychological whirlpool and local wars.The human self is torn apart, and it seems that prevents milion of people from being together and free.We consider that the reason for this is the Syndrom of the Emotional Breakdown (SEB),that has a visible external sign.We are convinced that there is a functional virus,that penetrates the limbic system of the human barain,as a result of improper emotional impact.</p>
<p>Reretfully,during the course of evolution,the human had developed his brain to a level,to be able to hurt himself by means of thoughts.There exist mental viruses,or functional viruses.They cause a contamination in the emotional assessments of the humans,and as a result of this he develops a diagnoses SEB.The contaminated person generates in the course of his daily life toxic thoughts that create in egological contamination.</p>
<p>In a person living with SEB, in the hairy back of the head could be visualised a red patch in different shades - from light pink , through bright red, to dark purple.It could be on spots , or on well-seen red figures- different variants exist.When the patch becomes dark purple, it means that this individuals is about 30-40 hours away from death.</p>
<p>We consider that the SEB is a reason for destruction of personality, the reason makes people live in disharmony with themselves and with society.</p>
<p>How could Homo Spiens be infected with the SEB f.virus?</p>
<p>By receiving improper emotional value,quarrel in a bus, short negative telefone conversation, scolding a child for breaking by accident the Christmas toy, not keeping the right of way on a crossroad, watching a conflicting T.V. show - in short experiencing negative feeling. (1)</p>
<p>The very act of infecting is a mental action, armed at hurting someone.In such a way an individual,or the society as a whole could be infected.Each person is in constant contact with other.Even the mere presence without talking, or seeing is a form of contact.</p>
<p>Long time ago the man had invented the mental weapon, but still there is no vaccine, or some kind of defence against the negative impact, that only humans are able to inflict upon each other.That is why when we are hurting others, we are hurt ing also ourselves.</p>
<p>After the f.virus gets in the limbic system it may be inactive for a period of time - sometimes it may take years before it strikes the host.An egological contamination of the planet is being created.</p>
<p>It has been observed, that in infants, the patch dissapears after a proper drug treatmentand parents care.There are adults with a well visible path, their body is fightingto reach the necessary balance.</p>
<p>A man is a buld in such a way, that from the day he was born till his last day he fights with the debalancing cataclysms.All the known pharmakopea exist in the human body - it is a system by itselfs. The patch is like a screen that reflects one's health status.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,still the drug or the vaccine to fight the SEB is not invented. There is a danger to human health when the SEB becomes host's essence. The f.virus contaminates the emotional assessment,which like a ruffled mirror reflects the incoming emotional values feelings like agression,envy,hatread, jealousy,indifference,addictional to alkohol, drugs,gambling,lonelines and pathology like diabetes,AIDS,cancer,cirrhosis, etc - the list could be quite long.There are different medical brands,fighting to balance the existing total disbalance.</p>
<p>For better clarity in determing the degree of contamination the following levels of SEB are distinguished:</p>
<p>Level 1<br />
					Humans,trying to get into conflict at first opportunity, or that are impartial to the suffiring of the surrounding people.The most typical feelings of these people are agression, hatred,jealiusy, greediness.The patch is light pink in colour,small in siza, andvery dangerous to to the host himself and to the surrounding.Family quarrels, cold blooded and cruel murders, divorces, etc. are due to the fighting hormons in the blood and cells of the host.We observe these people not as defendants,but as victims.Of course according to the law, everybody is responsible for his own actions.The people at 1-st level are most dangerous for themselves, and for the society as a whole.Their live is subjected to this plague of 21-st centuary.</p>
<p>Level 2- This level is causing the world economic crisis!<br />
					People that are infected with Level 2 cannot make a reightful assessment of the necessity of the investments for the benefit of the society.If we appoint a Level 2 infected person at leading position at a financial structure,the collaps of the institutiun is immienent. This condition is known as business destroyer.These are people that cannot distinguish between a friendly and enemy hand.Such people have difficulty finding a job, and cannot find their place in prosperous structures, if ultimately they get into such structures, it is for a very short time - 2 - 3 months.The patch is like drops of spray - small, red and very dangerous for the host's business.Such person is better not be an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Level 3<br />
					This is the level of the addicted to drugs, alcohol, tobacco, gambling, etc.These people think that being healthy or not is out of theirmanageability. Is there an alcoholic that considers that alcohol is dangerous to his health? Is there a gambler who does not belive that with the next bid he will get back the lost money, of not today, then tomorrow? The patch is red and big.It is very difficult to get out of this level, and it will long time.Large part of the body is contaminated, and this could be overcome only with relevant therapy and will.</p>
<p>Level 4<br />
					This is level of chronic diseases like diabetes, cancer high blood pressure, apathy, depression, psoriasis, etc. The patch is very big and pink to purple in colour.People at this level are better strict to medecines an diets, known to the traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Level 5<br />
					Level 5 is litle known, because there is no coming back.The patch is big purple - a warning that death is knocking on the door. Mothers had observed such patch at the back of their children that commited sucide.The patch dissapears 12 hours after death.</p>
<p>It is possible to suffer from chronic illness, without having SEB.It is possible to live the whole live without SEB.The patch is like a screen of the health status that warns, that if body could not cope by itself, it will need appropriate intervention - medical, egological or surgical.Many people live having the patch, but SEB had not turned to be their essence.</p>
<p>When SEB controls the man?</p>
<p>When the emotional perception is constantly distrubed.In a strong way the f.virus modifies the incoming emotional values.It is known, that when the SEB f.virus settles in the limbic system of the Homo Sapiens, it transforms the impulses to the pituitary. In the limbic system are built chains of neurous lymbic ways.Some of them by means of the talamic cores end in the cortex.In such a way the impulses coming from the limbic system are integrated into the nervous system.</p>
<p>Other ways end in the hypotalamic cores.Through the cores the functional influence is transmitted to the cores the functional influience is transmitted to the pituitary gland and to the entire endocrine system. Trough these ways an influence is effected also on the vegetative visceromotor cores.Thus the activity of the limbic system is interconnected with the endocrine orgnas, locomotive organs, the heart. They participate in the emotional behavoir of the individual.</p>
<p>The endocrine glands produce one ore several hormones.By means of blood flow these hormones reach all parts of the body, but effect influence only on some of them. A regulation of the function of the body is effected by means organic substances dispersed in body liquids. The endocrine glands excrete secretion in the blood.They are in close functional connection with the nervons system.When the improper emotional value enters the individual trough the way known to medicine, it is lead to the pituitary gland. The latter signals the the relevant endocrine gland, and in case the individual is contaminated by SEB, a hormonal ingredient is being created, which is of no need to the body in this particular moment.This hormonal substance jams the mitochondrias in the cells with parahormonal substance.</p>
<p>Thus the cell changes its mass.It cannot breathe and capsules itself, and cannot function properly. If this cell happens to be a nevron, pathologic change in the brain could occur, as a result of SEB. By this very mechanism excess quantities enter into mitochondrias of the muscle fibres, the structure of the cells of the locomotive apparatus changes, the structure of the host organs changes.</p>
<p>The foundations of the science called Egology, the studies and fights the SEB for more 24 years,are laid in Bulgaria.In a center Egology, for more 24 years the inflience of SEB is being ignored, more nine thousand photos are made to visualise the SEB. The cell mass of thousands of people is regenerated under a strict medical supervision. For the purpose of visualisation and indirect attack to ignore the SEB special test are created, that shows its avalibility in a person.Exist SEB-idirect neutrlalizators,Neutralizators are created that in an unexplainable way collect within themselves inorganic substances. The neutralizators like from the man the egological contamination.They change their colour without changing its structures.In the web seite egology by you can find filmed opinions thousands of patients that recover their health status after the SEB had been removed from them.In theses cases the SEB red patch fades.</p>
<p>The test are personal and for single use.They discover faultlessly the contamination,thus warning the individual.Exist also products, that help to balance the emotional status- internet side <a href="http://egologia.bg">http://egologia.bg</a>.</p>

<p>I received a notice that your organization will be evaluating ideas from Alzheimer's caregivers. I would be greatly honored to provide some ideas on my holistic Assisted Living Practice, which has been successful in stablelizing both, Alzheimer's and Dementia conditions in a short time frame. We work closely with the resident's MD and their prescribed medications at the beginning, then we immerse the resident in a completely holistic diet, where their medications are much more effective and over a short period (2-3 weeks), the resident's medications can be reduced, therefore, improving their alertness and ability to maintain their independence in many of their daily activities.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me if you should wish to discuss our program. I am working on a book at this time and will be sharing very helpful cases and our holistic approach within a peaceful residential environment.</p>

<p>An estimated 1.3 million Americans have LBD, which features progressive dementia plus varying combinations of symptoms (especially at onset), ranging from parkinsonism, fluctuating cognition and visual hallucinations, to REM sleep behavior disorder, a severe sensitivity to antipsychotic medications, mood disorders and autonomic dysfunction. Both clinical diagnoses within the LBD spectrum feature Lewy body pathology, but the timing and severity of symptom onset differs.</p>
<p>Dementia with Lewy bodies represents approximately 20 percent of all dementias and is the most frequent dementia type misdiagnosed clinically, most often as Alzheimer's. Features that differentiate LBD from Alzheimer's at the early stage include visual hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder and results of neuropsychological assessment.</p>
<p>Most older adults with Parkinson's disease have some degree of cognitive impairment at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 80% of people with Parkinson's will ultimately develop dementia. The prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson's disease has not yet become common knowledge among clinicians. There is no general public awareness about dementia in Parkinson's disease. Caregivers of people with PDD report to LBDA that the progression to dementia ultimately proves to be their most difficult caregiving challenge.</p>
<p><strong>It's not always Alzheimer's. </strong></p>
<p>We appreciate the importance of communicating the plan in a manner that is both straightforward and understandable by the general public. While Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, there are millions of Americans whose lives are deeply affected by related disorders like stroke, LBD and frontotemporal degeneration; while they receive nominal mention in the background material as being included in this plan, there is no mention of them in the draft agenda.</p>
<p>Public awareness and education is one of the core goals of the draft agenda. LBDA urges the names of related disorders be included in the opening statement of the draft agenda, so that educating the public about the most common forms of dementia begins now and continues throughout the advancement of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, through public relations efforts of federal agencies, disease advocacy organizations and academia.</p>
<p>As the plan receives coverage in the media, deliberate inclusion of related disorders will also minimize disenfranchisement of Americans affected by lesser-known, non-Alzheimer's dementias like LBD, many of whom might easily infer the omission indicates the federal government does not appreciate that their plight is as fraught with burden as those dealing with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis </strong></p>
<p>While improving the timeliness of diagnosis is important, the Lewy Body Dementia Association strongly recommends the inclusion of the word 'differential' when referring to diagnosis.</p>
<p>A general dementia diagnosis or an inaccurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease leaves people with LBD at risk for exposure to potentially severe or irreversible medication side effects. (Approximately 50% of people with DLB who are exposed to neuroleptics will experience a severe reaction.) Inaccurate diagnosis also prevents the opportunity to prepare families for the complexity of LBD symptoms, treatment and high toll of LBD caregiving. Accurate differential diagnosis not only leads to more appropriate therapeutic interventions but also improves the selection for study candidates in research trials.</p>
<p>Primary care physicians must become more familiar with the top four causes of dementia, specifically Alzheimer's, LBD, stroke and frontotemporal degeneration. Delayed or inaccurate diagnoses are further compounded by the low percentage of referrals from primary care physicians to specialists. Simple screening tools to highlight when a referral is warranted for differential diagnosis are urgently needed, especially for people with LBD.</p>
<p><strong>Care Quality </strong></p>
<p>When assessing the care needs of persons with dementia, it is essential to look beyond the cognitive deficits and their impact on employment, incidental activities of daily living and activities of daily living. In the case of Lewy body dementias, care quality must also address motor symptoms (such as the risk of falls), behavioral problems, sleep and autonomic issues. Other professionals who regularly provide care for people with dementia include specialists treating sleep and autonomic symptoms as well as physical, occupational and speech therapists.</p>
<p><strong>Care Guidelines across Care Settings </strong></p>
<p>Given the increased rate of hospitalization of people with dementia, hospitals should be included in the list of care settings for which dementia care guidelines and measures are to be developed. Many hospitals are not equipped to provide adequate care to people with dementia, especially those with behavioral problems, leading to excessive or avoidable treatment with antipsychotic medications. (This is especially dangerous to the person with LBD, who may experience modest to significant decline without a return to their baseline from as little as a single dose of haloperidol.) Additionally, consideration should be given to non-cognitive symptoms, such as motor problems, which affect activities of daily living and increase fall risk.</p>
<p>As LBD is a multi-system disorder, routine care coordination between multiple physicians is particularly challenging with LBD. By changing medications without consulting the treating neurologist, another physician may unknowingly exacerbate any one of several LBD symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>In addressing the long term care needs of people with dementia, caregivers need more accessible resources to provide quality care for the person with dementia in their own home as long as possible, while also maintaining balance of the equally important quality of life for the family caregiver.</p>
<p>Patient advocacy groups should be included in the draft framework as an important source of counseling, support and information to patients and families upon a differential diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Public Awareness </strong></p>
<p>The general public needs to be educated about the difference between dementia and the disease processes that cause it, much like the education the public received about HIV and AIDS. Few people understand that dementia is sometimes treatable. Educating the public that dementia is a symptom requiring medical attention, not a disease in itself, will help de-stigmatize both dementia and the many related clinical diagnoses.</p>
<p>In order to improve the reporting to physicians of all dementia-related symptoms beyond memory problems alone, such as those seen in stroke and LBD, it is imperative that the general public learn that the most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer's disease, stroke and LBD, and what symptoms should be reported to their physicians.</p>
<p>The Lewy Body Dementia Association is encouraged at the expansive nature of this draft agenda, especially as it pertains to the impact of dementia disorders not just on the patient but on the family caregiver as well. We look forward to following the progression of your work with great anticipation.</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Advisory Council for developing goals and strategies that address the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families within the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Also significant is the Advisory Council's action to set a timely objective for the development of effective prevention and treatment modalities in the Framework. Enclosed please find comments on the Framework developed by LEAD around research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development. We hope that the Advisory Council will consider these comments and recommendations as it advises on a national strategic plan for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The comments and recommendations provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals and supporting strategies within the Framework. However, it is important to note that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private and non-profit sectors and by establishing quantified metrics to track progress. LEAD strongly urges that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be allocated to each of the outlined goals and strategies included in the final national plan. Furthermore, each goal and strategy outlined in the final national plan should include a targeted budget with assigned milestones and metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established four workgroups -- one each in the areas of research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the Alzheimer's community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has set an aggressive goal to develop effective prevention and treatment modalities for Alzheimer's disease by 2025. The lack of tools such as biomarkers and an understanding of the biological basis of Alzheimer's disease currently impede the ability to appropriately address the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. The strategies outlined in the Framework have the potential for accelerating the therapeutic pipeline and rapidly translating basic science into new therapies for people with Alzheimer's disease. Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1:</p>
<p><em><strong>1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones </strong></em></p>
<p>With limited resources, private and public funders of Alzheimer's research must develop methods to coordinate research funding to assure that resources are spent strategically on the most promising areas and that investments are outcome-oriented and accountable. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council will consider input from the upcoming May 2012 National Institute on Aging Conference, which will seek to identify strategies and milestones to slow progression, delay onset and prevent Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, LEAD recommends the following:</p>
<ul><li>Development of methods to more efficiently and expeditiously determine diagnosis, prognosis and response to therapies using appropriate biomarkers and genetic markers.</li>
<li>Development of methodologies and tools needed to quantify the outcomes of interventional approaches that are more sensitive--but relevant--indicators of therapeutic effectiveness. While such research should include biomarkers and genetic markers, the primary focus should be related to the identification of more relevant clinical endpoints that may ultimately be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of novel therapeutic approaches. It is essential that such research be closely aligned with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) so that any progress in the field can be rapidly adopted by regulators, thereby expediting regulatory review and patient access to successful therapeutics.</li>
<li>Development of better methods to study individuals who are non-symptomatic or have mild cognitive impairments to effect better prediction of risk factors, primary and secondary prevention, and effective delay in progression.</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>To enhance research and drug development aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, the Advisory Council should advocate for the use of large-scale patient registries to facilitate faster and less expensive clinical trial recruitment. To assist this effort, public and private sectors should work together to address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation. Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a specific study and narrow purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data is essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. LEAD recommends a mechanism be developed to let patients opt into having their de-identified data used for broader research purposes that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The National Plan should also encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) which will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data rich in biomarker information should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's Disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p>While Alzheimer's disease researchers have identified promising candidate biomarkers, providing the level of evidence needed for qualification by the FDA requires additional data and rigorous analysis. Such efforts are beyond the scope and resources of companies or academic researchers and are best carried out through existing public-private partnerships such as the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Also, the lack of standardization for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes can delay the FDA from qualifying a biomarker for use in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Standardization of analytic methods together with establishing a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards, therefore, should be part of any national Alzheimer's research strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, quantitative clinical disease progression models should be developed to inform the design of Alzheimer's disease clinical trials in the evaluation of new medicines. These models would offer a tool to differentiate between symptomatic and disease-modifying drug effects, as well as help determine the optimal sample sizes and sampling times. A disease model will also help to identify subpopulations with unique characteristics for trials, and assess the impact of baseline disease severity on drug response.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>The Advisory Council should consider the term "presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease treatment" to refer to those interventions that are initiated before apparent cognitive decline and are intended to reduce the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease-related symptoms. This will accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, address uncertainties surrounding the term "prevention" and be more acceptable to regulatory agencies conducting reviews of clinical trials. In addition, a cognitive assessment tool should be developed that can be used to assess therapies at earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a patient registry of subjects that can be used for prevention trials. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease. Finally, biomarkers should be identified for tracking earlier cognitive decline by developing consensus on the scientific evidence.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends the establishment of a central Alzheimer's disease research coordinating entity within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This entity should maintain the authority and ability to convene inter-agency and non-government constituencies, domestically and internationally. We propose that the entity gather and distribute data, and make recommendations to the HHS Secretary for federal policy regarding funding strategies for stopping Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In addition, an international action plan against Alzheimer's disease should be developed by nations with national Alzheimer's disease plans in place or in progress. Developing a plan is an important first step to coordinate efforts against this global challenge. The global plan should include efforts to standardize biomarkers and surrogate end-points, coordinate surveillance and enhance regulatory cooperation. Any global effort should also include funds for research, strategies for cost containment efforts and goals to improve the delivery of clinical care and long term services.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the Framework will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans that require care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are additional strategies that could, if implemented, improve care quality and efficiency for people with Alzheimer's disease:</p>
<p><em><strong>2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings </strong></em></p>
<p>To achieve quality care and a safe transition for people with Alzheimer's disease between care settings, it is imperative that healthcare professionals are more adequately reimbursed for services such as comprehensive, longitudinal evaluation and management services, acute and chronic psychiatric management, evaluation of cognitive function (including psychometrics) and caregiver education and counseling.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems </strong></em></p>
<p>Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in both public and private hospital settings. In addition, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the Advisory Council should advocate for the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure the translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors, and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such Centers will also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>Often, even though a physician has identified cognitive impairment, the diagnosed individual and his or her family are not told of the diagnosis. Further, once a diagnosis is made and disclosed, as few as half of diagnosed individuals and families receive counseling, support or information about next steps, which would include available home care support, long-term care, and palliative care options and qualifications. This information is important, especially for individuals in the early- stage of the disease who experience positive outcomes when physicians are involved in planning and advance care counseling.</p>
<p>It is especially important that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated early in the disease process about palliative and hospice care. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><em><strong>New Strategy: Ensure People with Alzheimer's Disease and their Families Have Access to New Alzheimer's Therapies </strong></em></p>
<p>As new biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease over the coming years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented through regulation. This will be particularly important as CMS continues to improve the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of the Medicare program. Due to the absence of spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, it could cause an ACO to be "penalized" for providing the new treatment to its patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse the new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes goals and strategies seeking to improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that strategies are included that would help individuals with Alzheimer's disease remain in the community by establishing infrastructure to provide resources for family caregivers and support planning for long-term care needs. It is important that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Framework:</p>
<p><em><strong>3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally-Sensitive Education, Training and Support Materials by all Health and Social Service Providers who Interact with People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><em><strong>3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being </strong></em></p>
<p>In order to meet the unique care requirements of this population, the Advisory Council must advance proven federal, state and local programs supporting both the diagnosed individual and family. While Federal programs are in place that provide many of the services required by people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level, additional funds should be appropriated to implement evidence-based, non-pharmacologic interventions for people with dementia and their family members.</p>
<p>LEAD members are concerned with the current and proposed cuts to the Administration on Aging's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP). ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their families, and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve goal 3 in the Framework funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level.</p>
<p>Below is a list of successful federal programs that the Advisory Council should include and expand upon under strategy 3B in the final plan:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>

<ul><li>I think we as a field need more research on the clinical and pathological definition of AD, its relation to microvascular diseases and to other types of neurodegenerative disorders, and its genetics vs. environmental factors. Large-scale genetics as done in the autism field would be particularly helpful.</li>
<li>It seems to me that the value of solid reproducible fundamental research should be more emphasized. At present, there are many stories coming out in the AD field in major journals almost every week, but at least some of these stories, may be the majority even, turn out to be simply wrong after closer consideration. I have the impression that we need to emphasize that at present there really are not that many 'translatable' research findings, and that obtaining a better fundamental definition of the underlying biology may be boring, but is necessary.</li>

<td>HHS and its Federal partners will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease and manage and treat its symptoms. HHS will build on recent advances and expand research to identify molecular underlying mechanisms in areas such as genetics, protein aggregation, neurovascular biology, and the cell and molecular biology of the nervous system to identify risk and protective factors as well as new candidate therapies. To achieve this strategy, new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions.</td>

<td>To me, an important part of the initiative is "Strategy 1.B Enhance Scientific Research..." The FDA really does need to "<strong>aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease</strong>". Human clinical trials provide crucial information about which targets and mechanisms are most valid and currently they are a bottle neck for advancing our understanding. Basic research using transgenic models has identified a large number of potential mechanisms and targets, but we won't know which leads are most promising until they are tested in humans. There is increasing evidence that the disease process starts well before cognitive symptoms, so clinical trials designed to prevent AD could be the key to providing a therapeutic breakthrough.</td>

<td>Amy R. Borenstein, Ph.D., FAAN James A. Mortimer, Ph.D, FAAN (University of South Florida (via Alz Forum))</td>
<td>We and others have shown that given a level of pathology, people with more brain reserve can delay their symptoms of AD. What has not been done is to test interventions that increase brain reserve in population-based samples in the community. Most intervention studies of non-pharmacologic agents thus far have used volunteer subjects. We don't know which non-pharmacologic interventions work best in the population at large, and we don't know the relative ranking of such interventions, or if and how they interact with one another. Also, we feel strongly that interventions should be done on information that is personalized. In other words, someone who does not exercise and smokes should be targeted on these factors, whereas someone else who is obese and has diabetes should be targeted on those factors. Also, while biomarkers indicate that we can predict about 10 years before symptoms who is going down a malignant trajectory vs. a more normal trajectory, we know that the pathology of AD develops over decades, and that prevention must occur at a much younger age.
<p>								Therefore, what is needed in the NAPA are community-based studies of young-middle aged adults. We would need to gather careful epidemiologic data, including family history, head trauma, vascular diseases, exercise habits, diet, cognitive and social stimulation, and measures such as BMI, waist and head circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, insulin levels, DNA (APOE and others) and follow these populations over time with neuropsychologic measures and perhaps with MRI. AD is a complex disease occurring probably over the lifespan, and if we had a large enough population-based study we could design the study cleverly so that we can see what is happening at different, say, 5-year age groups over the life course (beginning perhaps as low as 20).</p>
<p>								Biomarkers are good for predicting high-risk individuals about 10 years before symptoms occur. This is occurring over a back-drop of decades of accumulating pathologies. We don't just want to predict who is at high risk - we want to take those people (and perhaps those at moderate risk) and put them into prevention programs to delay onset of the disease. If we only have the prediction part and not the prevention part, we will not be successful in Goal 1. The study does not have to be decades long, but it must have a sufficient number of people to accomplish the goal of discovering which preventions work best (by explaining the population attributable risk) and which interact.</p>
<p>								We have proposed such a study to be done in China where there is a lot of vascular brain disease and where it is easy to get thousands of people involved on a detailed research level but while we were well reviewed in study section our grant did not get funded. Dr. Mortimer and I would be happy to be involved in the design of an observational/interventional epidemiologic study in population-based subjects of primary preventions.</p></td>

<td>Significant advances in the use of imaging and biomarkers in brain, blood, and spinal fluids have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease, track its progression and monitor the effects of treatment in people with the disease. Without these advances, these neurodegenerative processes could only be evaluated in non-living tissues. Accelerated research will improve and expand the application of biomarkers in research and practice. These advances have shown that the brain changes that lead to Alzheimer's disease begin up to 15 years before symptoms. Identifying imaging and other biomarkers in presymptomatic people will facilitate earlier diagnoses in clinical settings, as well as aid in the development of more efficient interventions to slow or delay progression. While additional work needs to be done on biomarkers, we have enough information now that should allow secondary prevention trials in presymptomatic people to begin immediately with the most effective therapies.</td>

<td>When these trials fail, they don't tell us anything useful because the rationale for testing them was that they were harmless rather than their targets were implicated in the disease. They need to be more aggressive in testing other compounds that have a strong mechanistic rationale for prevention. If the government thinks that it will just "continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials", then they are blowing smoke because what they are doing now is not aggressive. In cancer trials, the FDA has approved trials where the treatment has killed a substantial percentage of the group because it had the potential to cure some of them and they were all going to die soon anyway. The FDA just doesn't look at AD the same way. The most significant thing to accomplish is to change the way the FDA looks at clinical trials for AD. We have lots of targets and drugs that just aren't getting tried on a reasonable time frame.</td>

<td>
<ul><li>Make "third party" or "pass through" Alzheimer's organizations (such as Cure Alzheimer's Fund) eligible for federal funding. The funding should NOT be used for organizational overhead or indirect expenses, but should be used by the organization to fund breakthrough Alzheimer's research. Such organizations are excellent "aggregators" and consortia builders --- much better than the research institutions themselves which have more of an interest in funding their own institutions. Private, non-bricks-and-mortar organizations are designed to put together leading researchers for innovative research. Help from the government for these kinds of initiatives has the potential to move the field much farther much faster.</li>
<li>Similarly, there should be more opportunity for co-funding of projects from government and private entities. Matching funds from the government for private initiatives, or the other way around, could generate considerably more private capital for focused, high level science than is the case today.</li>

Additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, industry, and public health systems quickly and accurately.

<td>Ideally, a National Institute on Dementia Research should be established as a new NIH institute with a director on par with directors of existing institutes, and supported by contributions from (and including representatives from) NIA, NINDS, NIMH, NIDDK, NIEHS, NHLBI, NCCAM, NHGRI, NCATS, NICHD, VA R&amp;D, and DoD (and maybe others).</td>

<td>I feel there is a gap there on a larger scale although there have been some good examples as well how to breach that gap. One problem when you talk with clinicians is that many of them still view Alzheimer's disease to be a very separate category from so-called 'vascular-dementia', although vascular factors and circulatory problems in brain including blood-brain barrier problems have been frequently indentified in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In that regard the present document is not clear about whether the goal will be to cure dementias of either Alzheimer's type or so-called vascular, which to my own bias is only a different phenotypic expression of similar diseases that in some cohorts more openly shows vascular feature than in others. I feel this issue should be addressed somehow because this might impact the numbers.
<p>								Another gap is between genetic studies and the biology of disease. For example, we still do not know how mutations in some genes that have been recently associated with sporadic AD relate to the biology of disease. More specific emphasis perhaps can be placed on these studies.</p>
<p>								In general it will be great to expand Strategy 1E with some more specific examples. But, perhaps that can be done after the May summit which I understand should provide some concrete guidance on the research priorities. Are we going to be represented at the May summit?</p></td>

<ol><li><strong>Committing Additional Resources to Research</strong><br />
										The planned NIA sponsored conference in May 2012 will provide invaluable insight into the goals and strategies required to achieve the goal of a treatment/prevention by the year 2025. However, while a reorganization and coordination across all research domains will increase research productivity, without additional research funds, the goals of having a treatment/prevention by 2025 is likely unattainable. There is currently no effective treatment for AD and thus additional funds are necessary to promote basic research, translational research, drug development and clinical research. Currently, funding rates at NIH and most non-profits is in the single digits (5-10% of all grant being funded), thus leaving a very large number of meritorious applications (the top 20-25%) unfunded. If we are truly serious about achieving the goals set forth in the Draft Framework, additional federal, non-profit and industrial investments in Alzheimer's research have to be part of the answer. While there will likely a considerable debate about the exact amount of investment required to achieve this goal, a starting point would likely be $2 billion/year as put forward in the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2010. As clearly laid out in the attached paper by myself, Dr. Todd Golde and Dr. Doug Galasko, similar types of investments in other diseases (i.e., HIV/AIDS) have proven transformative and lead to effective therapies. While I appreciate that the current funding climate is very tight and highly political, it is only with these types of investments are we likely to transform the Alzheimer's research endeavor and achieve Goal 1 of the Framework.</li>
<li><strong>Strategies/Goals</strong><br />
										The conference in May of 2012 will certainly help identify the key research areas that need to be addressed to achieve Goal 1 of the Framework. As part of the detailed National Plan, it will be important to both identify these targets as well as commit funding commensurate to achieve the goals identified. Funding one research domain at the expense of another with not enable us to achieve the ultimate goal laid out in the Framework. For each target, clear goals must be identified and a infrastructure/organization (see below) put in place to regularly assess progress within these areas.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure/Organization</strong><br />
										To achieve Goal 1 of the Framework, it will be absolutely critical to have an infrastructure and organization that can coordinate federal research efforts across all funding agencies, interact with non-profits and industry, promote awareness of the disease and the role that research will play in combating the disease as well as reporting to the Advisory Council directly as outlined in the Framework. In order for this organization/infrastructure to be truly successful and transformative, it will be essential that its efforts are entirely focused on combating Alzheimer's disease. This will provide a uniquely focused organization that will have the most chance of success. A similar "disease-focused" agency was created in 1988 for HIV/AIDS entitled the "Office of AIDS Research" (OAR) within the Office of the NIH Director, that played a key role in successfully coordinating the federal response to AIDS. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 strengthened the OAR, providing it with increased authority in the planning, coordination and evaluation of AIDS research. If we are truly serious about transforming Alzheimer's research and achieving the goals laid out in the Framework, a similar type of organizational structure (perhaps an Office of Alzheimer's Research?) is required.</li>

<td>My bias is to support Goal 1 of the Draft Framework in order to raise urgency, create more awareness and focus resources on the issue.
<p>								However, for this to be an effective strategy, we need to be able to:</p>
<ol><li>Set a time limit as is being suggested.</li>
<li>Define the goal as precisely as we can. Does our goal mean: " Delay onset of Alzheimer's disease, minimize its symptoms, and delay its progression" as the text goes on to say in this Goal? If so, we need objective metrics to measure these outcomes. We also need to be clear about expectations around the nature of the therapies to be developed. Almost certainly there will not be one blockbuster drug that "cures" people, but rather different interventions used at different phases of the pathology and with different genotypes. This is not easy stuff to convey --- no bumper sticker phrasing here, but rather a need to be patient and clear about the expectations for effective therapies. To mount an all-out national effort, we need to be very clear about the endpoint, "aspirational" or not.</li>
<li>Suggest at least the order of magnitude of the resources needed to achieve the goal.</li>
</ol><p>								It has been pointed out that setting these objectives is risky business. Particularly in AD, but not unique to the field, some researchers and others have raised false hope and expectations repeatedly with promises of a "cure within the next five years" for a long time. Credibility for this effort and responsibility to patients and their families demands that we define our objectives as carefully as we can within the context of an aspirational goal.</p>
<p>								Finally, we need to emphasize that this focus on research is not at the expense of, but in support of clinical efforts to help people already affected. The language concluding this goal does this and should be retained and if anything, strengthened.</p>
<p>								HHS will prioritize and accelerate the pace of scientific research and ensure that as evidence-based solutions are identified they are quickly translated, put into practice, and brought to scale so that individuals with Alzheimer's disease can benefit from increases in scientific knowledge.</p></td>

<td>One thing that strikes me over and over is that when people go to their "regular" practioners, they often get very vague information and appropriate diagnoses. People who go to most geriatricians get the latest information.
<p>								Somehow we need to have training for the variety of family and internal medicine practioners, and even specialists to enable them to recognize the early/all signs of the various dementias and the overlaps of the various complications such as diabetes, concussions, and Parkinson's etc. Without specific education of the medical community in the form of continuing education, all the research in the world won't be disseminated and used to its potential. We need further training of all doctors to recognize the problems, and make the connections to a disease that devastates!</p>
<p>								I hope these ideas will be included as part of the national plan proposed.</p></td>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." The Alzheimer's Association is the leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans with Alzheimer's disease and almost 15 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top ten in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Caring for people with this heartbreaking disease cost Medicare and Medicaid an estimated $130 billion last year.</p>
<p>Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, the future will be even bleaker. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the cost of care will surpass $1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). However, if through the National Plan the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years, similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease, would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050. This is both the challenge and promise of the National Alzheimer's Project Act and the development of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment -- a strategic plan is within our grasp. The Draft Framework sets that plan in motion. But while this framework is extensive in scope, there are a number of items that need to be addressed. Those items are raised in this letter.</p>
<p>Having reviewed this Draft Framework, however, the leading comment of the Alzheimer's Association is that <strong>the Draft Framework should be adjusted to facilitate the Department's incorporation of the recommendations of the three Advisory Council subcommittees, as presented at the January 17, 2012 Advisory Council meeting, into the National Alzheimer's Plan</strong>. These recommendations represent a bold, transformative, and comprehensive way to address the Alzheimer's crisis -- exactly what is needed in a National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>General Comments </strong></p>
<p>We believe the firm deadline of 2025 in this initial framework is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones may be needed, the Department is to be commended for including, for the first time, a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently needed treatment advances.</p>
<p>Second, the draft includes often neglected, but important, issues such as public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection, which are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact.</p>
<p>Third, there is a strong section on expanding and strengthening the health care workforce. Without an adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained, individuals living with Alzheimer's will not have access to coordinated, quality care in all health care settings, including acute care, long-term care, and home care settings.</p>
<p>These are three leading examples of the Draft Framework's many strengths. However, before a draft plan is released, several gaps must be addressed to fulfill the promise of a comprehensive and bold National Alzheimer's Plan. The largest omissions in the Draft Framework are a clear call for adequate and sustainable funding for Alzheimer's disease research, and for the resources required to implement the national plan. A strategy without funds to implement it or resources to drive research breakthroughs will not achieve the goals laid out in the Draft Framework by 2025.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming is that there is little mention of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) beyond general references to increasing clinical trial participation and expediting the development and use of biomarkers, and there is no mention of ways to spur development of treatments or other regulatory science efforts. The draft plan must create opportunities for multi-sector partnerships to stimulate new ideas and innovations, and the FDA must play a pivotal role in the development and translation of these new treatments.</p>
<p>A final overarching weakness in the Draft Framework is the limited emphasis on educating affected individuals, their families, and their caregivers about Alzheimer's. The importance of understanding Alzheimer's disease, particularly in context of other health conditions, should be emphasized, as should educating individuals and their families about the support services available to them and the need for advance planning. Similarly, there is no mention of how to improve documentation of a diagnosis, which is crucial to enabling care coordination among health care providers. A formal and documented diagnosis allows individuals to participate in their own care planning, better manage other chronic conditions, participate in clinical trials, and ultimately alleviate the burden on themselves and their loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments </strong></p>
<p>Following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and strategies as outlined in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong></em><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, there is no mention of funding for Alzheimer's research or what will be required to implement the National Alzheimer's Plan. Without this commitment to adequate research funding, 2025 risks appearing more a hope than a goal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes that Alzheimer's research needs to be a goal of the entire National Institutes of Health (NIH), not just the National Institute on Aging (NIA). NIA is underfunded, so prioritizing funding within NIA does not hold the potential to sufficiently elevate Alzheimer's research. Making Alzheimer's research a priority of the entire NIH is also important to help ensure coordination among the 27 Institutes and Centers, 23 of which are currently funding Alzheimer's research. 3</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					The phrase "...will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials..." should be characterized relative to the scale of the crisis and, by that measure, we strongly disagree that current levels warrant a description of "aggressive" -- aggressive is what we <em>need</em>, not what we <em>have</em>.</p>
<p>When examining how to manage and treat symptoms of Alzheimer's, research should be more closely linked to quality measures. Moreover, novel ways to conduct and encourage prevention trials and trials on agents that are not patentable should be included. This strategy must also address information protection, patents, and technology transfer in academic institutions.</p>
<p>Other than increasing clinical trial participation or expediting the development and use of biomarkers, the Draft Framework does not mention the FDA. FDA is a critical piece to the puzzle and is a necessary player in addressing ways to provide incentives that spur development of treatments or other regulatory science efforts, including biomarkers and critical scientific methods and tools.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					With regard to advances in imaging and other technologies that may enable an earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical settings, the coverage determinations and reimbursement hurdles associated with accessing these new technologies are not addressed in the Draft Framework. In addition, longitudinal trials, which were explicitly endorsed during the 2010 NIH State of the Science Conference, are not addressed but should be in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities</em></strong><br />
					The Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense should work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities, which may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated individual or office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em></strong><br />
					We strongly support a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained will help ensure that people with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and will ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system. Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties should be expanded. 4</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. The Medicare Annual Wellness Visit will help on this front, but we recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection separate from the strategy for diagnosis. While the Draft Framework refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is a mistake to conflate the issues of detection and diagnosis in a single strategy. And, in fact, this strategy could be read as confusing the distinct processes of detection and diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strategy is silent on educating health care professionals, particularly physicians, on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often, many physicians do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing physicians, their lack of training in the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delay detection of cognitive impairment and further diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support Patients and Families Upon Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					The education component within this strategy appears limited. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed after a diagnosis, including referrals to existing community supports and services. It is also important that patient education emphasize the importance of understanding Alzheimer's disease in the context of other health conditions. Moreover, family consultation with appropriately-trained health care professionals should be provided and reimbursed under Medicare, even when the patient is not present, so families do not feel abandoned after a diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the measurement of quality indicators. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems</em></strong><br />
					There is no mention of the use of electronic medical records or the importance of making sure a diagnosis is actually included in a medical record. This is especially important for safe and effective care transitions. Prior to any care transition, an individual should have a documented diagnosis in his or her medical record, as well as a list of relevant medications. In addition, acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					Alzheimer's disease is progressive and terminal and therefore general research on care coordination may not address the unique needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or their caregivers. Additional research should be conducted specifically on care coordination for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					A National Plan must identify the specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias. However, we are looking forward to reviewing specific plans that will meaningfully address the challenges faced by these populations. 5</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</em></strong><br />
					During the course of the Alzheimer's Association's public input sessions last summer, this was a consistent theme, and we commend its inclusion in the Draft Framework. A National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong><br />
					The intent of this strategy is unclear. If the goal is to encourage the purchase of long-term care insurance -- or at least educate families about the option of long-term care insurance -- it is important to realize that the private long-term care insurance market presents particular challenges to those with Alzheimer's disease. It may not be a viable option, and families should be made aware of the potential issues.</p>
<p>In addition, while planning for long-term care is important, there are other future needs for which a diagnosed individual needs to plan -- planning regarding finances, driving and safety, advance directives, and end-of-life care. The Draft Framework should refer to the importance of advance planning education once someone receives an Alzheimer's diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As indicated in Strategy 2A, all health care practitioners should have proper dementia training, which should help mitigate abuse. In addition to health care practitioners, training efforts should include first responders.</p>
<p>The National Plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. This includes the issue of self-neglect, which is not addressed in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p>State Adult Protective Services (APS) agencies are over-burdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire circumstances. The Draft Framework does not address the need for additional resources for APS agencies so that they can adequately protect the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As indicated in Strategy 2G, education campaigns must be language-specific and culturally appropriate.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 5.A: Enhance HHS' Ability to Track Progress</em></strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government. 6 At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance both on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they more adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 5.B: Monitor Progress on the National Plan</em></strong><br />
					Although sometimes overlooked, improving data to track progress is critical, and we commend its inclusion in the Draft Framework. This critical information should be publically available, or at least available to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (early stage through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>The Draft Framework provides a good foundation for a National Alzheimer's Plan. But much work needs to be done to fulfill the promise of a detailed National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, would result in just such a National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Society for Women's Health Research (SWHR) is writing to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services in regards to the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. SWHR has key scientific recommendations that it believes the Advisory Council should consider as it is finalizing the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>SWHR, a national non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C., is widely recognized as the thought leader in research on sex differences and is dedicated to improving women's health through advocacy, education, and research. SWHR appreciates the work the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) is and will be doing to focus our nation's resources on Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative disease of the brain, and the brains of men and women are inherently different. While it is common knowledge that men and women think differently, recent scientific discoveries have demonstrated that the difference goes far beyond thought processes. Sex differences have been observed in the anatomy of the brain, behavioral traits, and in the physiological responses of the nervous system. Differences are also noted in the aging process and for generative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Significant differences have been found in men and women who suffer from Alzheimer's disease. Larry Cahill, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at the University of California, Irvine, explained in a paper published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience that "Alzheimer's disease-related neurofibrillary pathology associated with abnormally phosphorylated tau protein differs in the hypothalamus of men and women: up to 90 percent of older men show this pathology, whereas it is found in only 8-10 percent of age-matched women." Abnormalities caused by Alzheimer's disease may differ between the sexes and result in different symptoms for men and women with the disease, which may lead to the need for different treatment decisions.</p>
<p>In October 2011, SWHR hosted a one-day scientific roundtable of experts to discuss what is known about sex and gender differences in Alzheimer's disease. The meeting focused on basic and clinical science perspectives, as well as those of the caregiver, and included input from industry scientists. Participants were asked what research questions needed to be answered for progress to be made in the disease. Key research recommendations from the roundtable are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Research on the rate of progression of Alzheimer's disease, specifically examining sex differences in the transition from normality to early stages of disease to dementia, and from dementia to outcomes.</li>
<li>Research on the influence of sex steroids, bioenergetic vulnerabilities, synaptic function, and cognition in the brain as it relates to Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Re-examination of existing data for potential sex differences to help define the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and publishing sex-specific results.</li>
<li>Research on the differential impact of the caregiving role on men and women and design interventions to provide more effective services</li>
</ul><p>From the meeting it was clear that research on Alzheimer's disease must account for sex as a basic biological variable and include sex-specific analyses. This type of analysis would be an extremely useful component of a national strategic plan to combat Alzheimer's disease. Approximately two-thirds of all Americans currently living with Alzheimer's disease are women, which is why it is extremely important to ensure that the clinical trials evaluating pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent, manage and treat Alzheimer's disease include an adequate number of women within their study population to perform a sex-specific analysis.</p>
<p>SWHR strongly encourages that these recommendations be incorporated in the Framework goals and strategies and be a part of the continued discussions and work of the Advisory Council.</p>
<p>In addition, SWHR would like to provide comment on several of the specific goals and strategies. Strategy 1.B states that, "new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions." SWHR agrees and advocates for appropriate representation in clinical research based on the disease prevalence in the population, with the specific goal of enrolling sufficient numbers of men and women to achieve statistical significance in the resulting sex-specific data analysis.</p>
<p>SWHR believes that under Strategy 1.C, identifying early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease requires knowing whether there are any particular differences evident based on sex, race, age, or ethnicity. The reporting and analysis of such data should be a part of the strategy even if the results show no difference, as that is important to determine.</p>
<p>In Strategy 1.E, SWHR recommends amending the draft to require the reporting and analysis of sex, race, age and ethnicity in the research findings, as these factors directly impact the quality of the findings disseminated into medical practice. The reporting of these differences, or lack thereof, influences the knowledge and identification of disease by the public health system, including patients and caregivers.</p>
<p>The quality and efficiency of care under Goal 2 would be increased by the measurement of sex and gender differences as well as differences in race, ethnicity and age. SWHR further recommends that gender be a part of the timely and accurate diagnosis strategy of 2.B as well as education and support to patients in Strategy 2.C. The more accurate and informative the information that is provided to patients, family members and care givers, the more likely it will be that they understand and are able to be engaged in medical decision making.</p>
<p>As women age, many experience comorbid illnesses and diseases, making the coordination of care even more critical. Strategy 2.F is critically important as, "coordinating care...can help reduce duplication and errors and improve outcomes," especially for those patients, particularly women with multiple chronic diseases. Coordinated care will also help to lessen the difficulty of decisions made by many women who are responsible for making the majority of healthcare decisions for their household.</p>
<p>While SWHR believes that the groups mentioned in Strategy 2.G are unequally burdened by Alzheimer's disease, we feel that it is important to include women who are disproportionately affected in general as well as within these subgroups. We recommend that women be added as a subgroups being disproportionately burdened by Alzheimer's disease. It is known that approximately two-thirds of all Americans currently living with Alzheimer's disease are women. Moreover, there is a need to examine the data by sex within each population identified in Strategy 2.G, including within racial and ethnic minorities</p>
<p>While SWHR agrees that information and training should be given to caregiver in a culturally sensitive manner, as stated in Strategy 3.A, it is important to note that this information should include information on sex and gender differences, as well as differences in race, ethnicity and age. Providing caregivers with any information available on these differences would allow them to better support and care for persons with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In Goal 4, SWHR believes that the public would benefit from being provided with Alzheimer's disease facts and information specified by sex, race, and ethnicity. This will help ensure that they have all available knowledge, including information to address the widespread confusion and misconceptions surrounding Alzheimer's disease. A better understanding of the disease will allow for the development of more effective preventions, diagnostic tools and treatments through support of the general public.</p>
<p>Data are an essential element of all research and a critical component to the advancement of our knowledge of sex and gender differences in Alzheimer's disease. SWHR is delighted to see that in Goal 5 there will be, "efforts to expand and enhance data infrastructure and (to) make data easily accessible to federal agencies and other researcher." SWHR would like to see that data include information on differences that may exist between sex, age, race, ethnicity and culture and that it is made accessible to the public in order to advance research, treatment and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease . from patients to caregivers to families.</p>
<p>SWHR believes the recommendations and comments it has provided to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services will help to advance more targeted therapies in Alzheimer's disease for both men and women. This will lead to a greater understanding of risk factors for both men and women and more sex-specific treatment of cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</p>
<p>Should the Advisory Council have any questions or would like more information please contact me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) is pleased to submit the following comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (the "Draft Framework"), released by the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) on January 9, 2012.<sup>1</sup> BIO represents more than 1,100 biotechnology companies, academic institutions, state biotechnology centers and related organizations across the United States and in more than 30 other nations. BIO members are involved in the research and development of innovative healthcare, agricultural, industrial and environmental biotechnology products.</p>
<p>As the representative of an industry that is devoted to improving health care through the discovery of new therapies, BIO believes that any framework for improving diagnosis and care for serious, complex illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, must include measures to provide access to innovative treatment options, including new drugs and biologicals. We are pleased that the Draft Framework specifically includes strategies for enhancing scientific research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, coordinating research with international public and private entities, and facilitating the translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs. <sup>2</sup> We offer the following comments to make these strategies more effective.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Draft Framework Should Include a Strategy to Protect Patient Access to Innovative Therapies for Alzheimer's Disease </strong></p>
<p>The draft framework correctly recognizes that after research findings are published in the clinical literature, "additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, industry, and public health systems quickly and accurately."<sup>3</sup> In addition to being shared with patients, caregivers, and practitioners, new clinical evidence also must be adopted into health plans' coverage and payment policies in a timely manner to ensure that access and reimbursement is available for advanced treatment options and improved diagnostic tools that address the eight cognitive domains that may be impaired in Alzheimer's, as recognized in the NINCDS-ADRA Alzheimer's Criteria: memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving, and functional abilities.<sup>4</sup> This is particularly important now because there are exciting new diagnostic tools and treatments for Alzheimer's disease on the horizon, at the same time our health care delivery system is undergoing dramatic change, from the creation of Accountable Care Organizations to increased packaging.</p>
<p>There are several ways the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) can protect patient access to care. CMS should assign Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes in a timely manner for new drugs and biologicals to facilitate claims processing and payment by all health plans. CMS also should expeditiously add new cognitive tests to Medicare's Annual Wellness visit so that beneficiaries will have access to this service on a regular schedule and without out-of-pocket costs. In addition, CMS should work with stakeholders to identify new preventive services and issue national coverage determinations that add those services to Medicare's preventive benefits. Other payers, including Medicaid and private insurance plans, as well as the state agencies that regulate health plans, will need to act promptly on similar matters to protect access to innovative diagnosis and care for patients within their programs as well. CMS and other payers also may need to reconsider their current rules on coverage and payment to support adoption of new approaches to care, such as use of telehealth and increased participation in care by family members and caretakers, and to ensure that bundled payment systems do not discourage the use of novel therapies. BIO recommends that the Draft Framework be revised to explicitly acknowledge the need for prompt action by Medicare and other payers to provide comprehensive coverage, coding, and payment for new methods of preventing, diagnosing, and treating Alzheimer's disease to help meet the needs of this vulnerable patient population.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Draft Framework's Strategies Should Support the Development of Treatment by Facilitating Participation of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease in Clinical Trials </strong></p>
<p>BIO recognizes that no progress can be made without clinical research, yet we also realize that it is difficult for many older patients to participate in trials due to comorbidities and limited access to sites of care that offer trials. These obstacles are particularly significant for patients with Alzheimer's disease, who may have more difficulty deciding to participate in a trial or remaining in a trial unless they have strong support from their family members and caregivers and health care practitioners. The Draft Framework notes that "new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions."<sup>5</sup> BIO believes these efforts are needed. Enhanced outreach is essential to increasing participation in clinical trials through educating patients' families and caregivers, facilitating their access to the patient's health information, and supporting their role in helping patients make treatment decisions. These efforts also need to be applied across all research efforts -- in the U.S. or other countries, public or privately funded -- to encourage optimal participation in these essential trials. BIO recommends that the Draft Framework specifically recognize the need for enhanced efforts to address the factors that frequently inhibit patients with Alzheimer's disease from participating in clinical research. To facilitate this, we recommend that the Secretary involve, consult and engage with industry to address those factors through "new partnerships and outreach efforts."</p>

<p>BIO appreciates this opportunity to comment on the Draft Framework. We look forward to continuing to work with ASPE to refine and implement this plan to improve diagnoses and care for Alzheimer's disease.

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Excellence in Assisted Living (CEAL) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the draft framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>The Center for Excellence in Assisted Living (CEAL) is a non-profit collaborative of eleven national organizations that represent a unique blend of key stakeholders in assisted living. CEAL promotes high-quality assisted living, serves as a convener to bring together diverse stakeholders to discuss and examine issues related to assisted living, helps bridge research, practice and policies that foster quality and affordability, and maintains an objective national clearinghouse of information and resources about assisted living.</p>
<p>The CEAL commends the Office of Disability, Aging and Long-Term Care Policy for developing the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease to address the growing need for treatment and services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and their loved ones.</p>
<p>Assisted living plays an increasingly important role in providing services for persons living with Alzheimer's disease in a safe, structured community based setting. Over 31,000 assisted living communities across the United States provide care and services to nearly 750,000 residents; with more than 40 percent of those individuals living with some form of dementia.</p>
<p>Services offered in assisted living that can benefit individuals living with cognitive impairment include health monitoring, medication management, assistance with activities of daily living, social activity programs, nutrition services, and others. Offering these services in a structured and secure environment creates a unique solution to meet the immediate care and supervision needs of persons living with Alzheimer's disease now and in the future. Indeed many states have special disclosure and staff training requirements for assisted living communities that provide dementia care.</p>
<p><strong>CEAL Recommendations </strong></p>
<p>Because assisted living is clearly a setting of choice for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, we recommend the following technical edits to Goals 2 and 3 outlined in the National Plan:</p>
<ul><li>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency<br />
						"High-quality care should be provided from the point of diagnosis through the end-of-life and in settings including people's homes, doctor's offices, hospitals, nursing homes, <strong>and assisted living communities</strong>."</li>
<li>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support<br />
						"People with Alzheimer's disease and their families need supports that go beyond the care provided in formal settings such as doctor's offices, hospitals, nursing homes, <strong>and/or assisted living communities</strong>."</li>
</ul><p>On behalf of the CEAL board of directors I thank you for this opportunity to comment on the draft framework, and I offer our support for the ongoing work of the advisory council and the Department in implementing the important goals outlined in the National Plan.</p>

<p>Merck &amp; Company, Inc. appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Draft Framework of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Merck is an innovative, global health care leader that is committed to preserving and improving human life. We continue to focus our research on conditions that affect millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>We welcome government's leadership in developing a National Plan to help focus public and private resources on common goals and strategy. The Framework provides the right priorities, balance, and general focus for the effort.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's research and drug development stands on the threshold of a major advance in treatment, with the potential for significant disease modification in the near future. It is a critical time when greater collaboration and resources can have a substantial impact. We look forward to working with HHS to develop a clear pathway in the National Plan for achieving a therapeutic breakthrough in Alzheimer's Disease. This type of breakthrough will not only improve the lives of patients, but will also help ease the cost pressures currently being experienced by government health care programs.</p>
<p>A real advance in therapy will require regulatory alignment with emerging science, including prompt government action to establish biomarkers, provide guidance on clinical trial design, and review and approve new drug applications. We look forward to working with the Secretary to ensure a favorable environment that facilitates efficient clinical trials and expenditious review of new treatments.</p>

<p>As a nurse of over 20 years I was shocked to learn that the draft of recommendations on how to overcome the Alzheimer's crisis didn't include Assisted Living. As our population ages, and is living longer due to advances in detection and treatment Alzheimer's disease will only become more of a problem. Assisted Living is one of the best options for those suffering from this disease. Nursing homes are for those with skilled needs. Medicare will not pay for someone to be in a nursing home because they have Dementia and need help with ADLs they can no longer do for themselves. If a person doesn't have $10.000.000-15,000.00/month to pay privately for a nursing home, which they really shouldn't be in, what option do they have. Children today are no longer able to care for their parents as they were many years ago. Most households have both people working, busy lifestyles, and it's just not an option. Assisted living enables people with dementia to still live independently in a safe environment where help is available when needed, or for those with severe dementia an environment where all of their ADLs, medication management, social, and nutritional needs are provided for. The cost is half the price of a nursing home in a social environment. How this could have been left out makes me wonder who the drafters of the recommendations were, and what their backgrounds are. Not only as a nurse but also as the daughter of a mother who suffered from Dementia, please include Assisted Living. Our older generation deserves the best quality of care in an environment that is enjoyable. We all will be old someday and may have Dementia, we would want this for ourselves so let's give it to our parents.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments Submitted on the<br />
					Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease<br />
					February 3, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease</em>. CCAL is a national advocacy organization working to ensure that person-centered practices are always the foundation of all aging services and supports. Ensuring that person-centeredness is integrated into healthcare practices elevates the experience from a clinical one to a humanistic one. The human emotional experience is important to achieving well-being as are clinical outcomes. The bond between the person receiving services and the individual (as well as the organizations' culture) that provides a healthcare service must be based on the following four principles all working in harmony:</p>
<ul><li>Relationships - valuing the uniqueness of each person</li>
<li>Compassion -caring to build a connection and bond with the person</li>
<li>Empowerment - providing information and options to the person and their caregiver(s)</li>
<li>Autonomy/Choice - respecting the right of the person and their caregiver(s) to make their own choices</li>
</ul><p><strong>Global Recommendations: </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Person-Centeredness </strong></em></p>
<p>Nowhere can principles and practices of honoring the personhood of each individual be more significant than in a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, yet the draft framework is silent on person-centeredness. We respectfully submit that this National Plan should include person-centeredness in its philosophical foundation, core principles , strategies and goals as does the Department of Health and Human Services' National Health Care Quality Strategy and Plan (NHCQS): "Person-centeredness and family engagement will guide all strategies, goals, and improvement efforts". This is "one of the core principles intended to serve as the underpinning of NHCQS and should be reflected not only in the framework, but in how goals, targets, and plans are developed across health care and long-term care settings."</p>
<p>Person-centered language should be used throughout the National Plan. To honor the personhood of each individual and recognize that patient only refers to clinical services and not the broader holistic context, the term "patient" should be changed to "person" throughout the Plan; i.e., "Educate and Support the <em>Person</em> and their Family Members Upon Diagnosis". Indeed, person-centeredness should be a fundamental component of all prevention and treatment plans; i.e. Strategy 2.D - "Guidelines for delivery of high-quality <em>person-centered</em> care and measures of quality are needed…"</p>
<p><em><strong>Enhancing Quality of Life as well as Quality of Care </strong></em></p>
<p>This framework does not reflect our national commitment to providing meaningful lives for all older Americans. Enhancing quality of life and meaningful engagement for individuals with Alzheimers and related dementias must be a fundamental principle and a goal, implemented through training, education, and outreach strategies in tandem with, and comparable to, those for Goal 2 Enhancing High Quality of Care.</p>
<p>Meaningful relationships, purposeful engagement, social interactions and impromptu conversations all serve to enhance the individual's psychological, social and emotional well-being. All should incorporate the person's interests, preferences, strengths, and skills to best maintain their sense of self and to slow down the deleterious effects of the disease. The National Plan should include training for family, caregivers, and staff to heighten their sensitivity to and understanding of positive pathways for communication, interactions, relationships, and meaningful engagement.</p>
<p><em><strong>Family Engagement </strong></em></p>
<p>For those of us who care for loved ones with Alzheimers' and related dementias, we know this National Plan must move beyond encouraging "family engagement" to encouraging caregiver/family/ provider partnerships to best guide and enhance person-centered quality of care and quality of life.</p>
<p>Individuals and families should be empowered through interactions and resources so that they are prepared to make informed choices and be active participants and decision-makers regarding their loved one's care. We recommend the following goals and approach from "Partnering with Patients and Families to Design a Patient and Family-centered Health Care System: A Roadmap for the Future, A Work in Progress" (<em>2006, Institute for Family-centered Care and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement</em>)</p>
<p>"…Develop a shared vision and action plan for improving health care by advancing the practice of patient-and family-centered care and creating partnerships with patients and families in all health care settings and within the organizations and agencies having an impact on health care"</p>
<p><em><strong>Utilize Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) Methodological Approach </strong></em></p>
<p>We suggest adopting the CBPR methodological approach to AD applied research efforts to best inform the work through multiple perspectives and expertise of community-based partners (representing key stakeholders, including family members, direct care staff, practitioners, social workers, long-term service providers, etc.) to inform the research, ensure its relevancy, and enhance understanding and dissemination across research, policy and practice sectors.</p>
<p><em><strong>Public Education Campaign </strong></em></p>
<p>We firmly believe that any public education campaign should highlight non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatment options for enhanced quality of life and care.</p>
<p>We would encourage sustained community-based outreach to the general public through the creation of a "Real People; Real Life with AD" component of this campaign to enable the general public to meet, greet and hear from regular individuals and families who are going through this journey of AD-related life experiences and challenges. We are not suggesting celebrities or authors who have written about family caregiving. We do suggest including the voices, perspectives, and insights of individuals who are living with AD or whose loved one has AD.</p>
<p><em><strong>Improve Coordinated Dissemination of Information </strong></em></p>
<p>We suggest adding this goal as there is no national coordinated network of information about Alzheimer's and related Dementias for professionals or non-professionals. DHHS funds numerous AD research centers, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, and initiatives throughout the country, i.e., Administration on Aging's AD Demonstration Grants; but information and findings are not networked and easily made available.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Recommendations: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1 - Prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>Psychosocial treatment modalities (non-pharmacologic) for AD should also be included in the framework for the national plan</p>
<p><strong>1.A</strong> Ensure that invited expert participants to NIH's May 2012 summit include an appropriate number of non-research, non-clinical dementia experts as well as family caregivers in order to best inform and shape the national plan.</p>
<p><strong>1.C</strong> Consider : a) ethical issues related to such efforts; and b) the potential psychological, social-emotional, medical and economic impact (and unintended consequences) on individuals and their families receiving a diagnosis 10 years prior to emergence of symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>1.E</strong> Consider educational campaign on appropriate and safe use of psychoactive drugs and sedatives and non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatment modalities as related to individual's quality of life</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2 - Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. A</strong> The plan should address solutions for recruiting and retaining high-quality direct care and paraprofessional workers. Best-practice models for AD training should be noted.</p>
<p><strong>2.C &amp; 2.D</strong> The plan should address how individuals and families can be actively engaged in decision making and act as partners on the care team if they so choose. Some individuals and families may just wish to receive counseling, support and information. Both should be addressed.</p>
<p>Palliative care and end-of-life care should be addressed. What interventions are available; what decisions need to be made to have personal wishes carried out by healthcare and long-term support system(s); i.e., individuals with Alzheimer's may want to leave a living will; families should understand the decisions that they may need to make.</p>
<p><strong>2. D CCAL</strong> suggests using a community-based participatory process in which individuals, families, and direct care staff can be partners with experts in developing the guidelines. We suggest examining the national Center for Excellence in Assisted Living (CEAL) "Person-centered Care Domains of Practice" for HCBS which identifies domains of: personhood, relationships and community, governance/ownership, leadership, workforce practices, meaningful life and engagement, services, environment, and accountability.</p>
<p><strong>2.E</strong> Even "safe and effective" transitions can be traumatic for people with Alzheimer's disease, particularly for people with advanced Alzheimer's who are sent to emergency rooms for relatively minor conditions. Emphasis should be on: 1) limiting transitions; and 2) when transitions are necessary--how to make them safe and effective.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3. Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>We strongly recommend including families and direct care staff as active partners in the process of Expanding Person &amp; Family Support, from creating and disseminating culturally sensitive education and support materials to serving as Person &amp; Family Support Guides.</p>
<p>CCAL commends all who were involved in creating the framework for a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias; and appreciates the opportunity to contribute to the process by providing person-centered feedback on its contents.</p>

<p>As a cognitive aging researcher, it's appalling that the new draft framework on AD does not mention the influence of lifestyle and the environment in <strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Assuming that AD is entirely a biological disease and it not influenced by the environment and the stimulation that a person receives goes against basic psychological, cognitive, and neuroscience research (e.g., even rats placed in stimulating environments show more neuronal growth). In addition to this complete oversight, such a framework for prevention assumes that there is nothing a person can do (i.e., "we'll give you a drug, and hope for the best"). Providing older adults with ways they can take control of their own future, and possibly influence their own likelihood of preventing AD (e.g., not smoking, not being overweight, stressed, and staying cognitively and socially engaged) is a far more universal and economical approach and avenue to take, in addition to research on pharmacological interventions. Psychological research has been occurring on AD and MCI for years, and failing to acknowledge this contribution is ignorant and hurts the overall goal of addressing AD.</p>
<p>I would also like to note that relying entirely on general practitioners, not trained in detecting dementia symptoms is a poor focus as well. Personally, my aunt was recently having some memory problems, and after having a MRI that was clear, was sent to her GP for follow-up. Without even conducting a MMSE, the GP told her she had dementia, and he would prescribe Aricept. He didn't conduct a MMSE until 2 weeks later, at which point she received a score of 27/30, and the GP said, "oh, I guess she's fine". There is no way dementia can be diagnosed with such little knowledge, and not even simply relying on the MMSE is sufficient. There is a rich literature on neuropsychological testing in diagnosing AD, other dementia types, and using those tests to detect MCI and other conditions. If we can't subject every person with small memory problems to a spinal tap, neuropsychological testing that has been developed to be sensitive to small changes in cognition is a front-runner in where to focus our efforts. Relying on GPs for this type of diagnosis is not appropriate.</p>

<p>Respite Care Funds for Care Givers:</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of the thousands of members of the National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners, Certified Dementia Practitioners CDP members, NCCDP Certified Alzheimer's and dementia Trainers, Certified Dementia Care Managers (Dementia Unit Managers) CDCM, NCCDP Associate Members, NCCDP Corporate Members and Certified First Responder Dementia Trainers CFRDT.</p>
<p>Respite Care funds must be made available for those people who lack private resources, funds, transportation and family support. Many caregivers provide 24 hour care in their home with no break, financial assistance or outside help. This leaves the care giver exhausted. Many of our nations care givers are elderly themselves. Caring for someone with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or dementia is a full time job. Care givers provide full time supervision, medication disbursements, ADL care (bathing, toileting and dressing), housekeeping services, meal preparation, transportation to and from appointments, etc. Many are unable to work due to the time required to care for a loved one. This depletes their funds.</p>
<p>The respite funds should be used to either place a loved one in adult day care program, hire a private duty aide/home health aide, have a senior companion volunteer come to the home, utilize nursing home and assisted living respite services or whatever community program that works for the Care Giver.</p>
<p>Currently, care givers are exhausted with no relief in sight. Many are depressed and lonely. They are cut off from their friends, church members and neighbors. They are unable to enjoy a quality of life many of us who are not full time care givers take for granted. They are unable to go to church, participate in a hobby or any other social event. Just going grocery shopping is challenging.</p>
<p>Isolation can also lead to abuse and neglect. Most care givers have the best intentions but abuse and neglect can happens when there is stress, isolation, lack of funding and lack of support.</p>
<p>Where there are respite services in a state the Care giver lacks funding and transportation. I saw first hand as a facilitator of a support group the desperate needs of the care givers. Some respite services are time consuming with lengthy paper work required. There may be waiting lists making respite services unattainable when they need it the most. Many community respite services require the care giver to transport their loved one and they are unable to provide this. Or there may be no respite community services with in their community.</p>
<p>There must be state and federal funds available for caregivers without funding to use for respite services. Each community should be looking at ways to keep the patient in the home and provide the care giver options such as home care respite services, assisted living and nursing home respite services and volunteer senior companion programs all of which provides options for the care giver.</p>

<p>I am a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner working with the Geriatric Population. I care for and diagnose Dementia on a very regular basis. After reviewing the document for a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease I recommend the following amendments:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A </strong></p>
<p>Add Neuropsychologist to the list, they are invaluable in the accurate diagnosis of many of the other Dementia's and early identification of mild cognitive disorders, which will likely progress to Alzheimer's. There are not enough of these very specialized professionals to address the wave of dementia that will be occurring with this rapidly growing aging population.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.D </strong></p>
<p>There is a large portion of the population with Dementia, that would be best served by an Assisted Living Setting (not safe at home alone, no family support available, no skilled nursing needs). This large group often live in unsafe conditions because there is no funding source (other than private pay) for this intermediate level of care. Those that need help with meals, transportation, ADL's r/t safety (in and out tub), perhaps medication monitoring/reminders/set-up, daily checks, built in emergency call system in case of falls. This would not have to be manned by RN's like SNF in LTcare. But perhaps monitored by an LPN or Designated Geriatric Provider of some kind with training in the care of mild to moderate Dementia. Families often struggle with putting a loved one in a "nursing home", so those with Dementia are either provided too high or too low a level of care. This would very likely decrease the cost of expenditures for long-term care, as it would substantially delay the use of LTC.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.B </strong></p>
<p>Provisions for in-home respite care for those who choose to have loved ones live with them, is an invaluable service, which would allow for less caregiver burn-out and delay admission to a 24hr facility. Thus cutting down the expenditure of resources, before they are necessary</p>
<p>This Very complex issue will not be solved quickly or easily, I hope the above suggestions from a practitioners point of view are helpful in improving the quality of care and quality of life for those suffering with Dementia.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>New Study Challenges Accepted Approaches to Research in Senile Dementia (Alzheimer's Disease)<br />
					Published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>NEWS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>Amsterdam, NL, 7 November 2011 -- Impacting millions of families and devouring billions of dollars globally, Alzheimer's disease is the focus of exhaustive research to find a cure. Although intensely investigated over the last three decades using cutting-edge technologies, the "pathogenic cause" of Alzheimer's disease has not been found. While many research "breakthroughs" have been claimed and high-profile drugs trials carried out, why does the promised "cure" still seem to elude scientists?</p>
<p>In an effort to address this question, Ming Chen, PhD, Huey T. Nguyen, BS, and Darrell R. Sawmiller, PhD, Aging Research Laboratory, R&amp;D Service, Bay Pines VA Healthcare System and University of South Florida, undertook an independent and systematic analysis of the underlying research assumptions against the established scientific principles. This analysis led them to hypothesize that perhaps the main problem is the research community's perception of the disease.</p>
<p>In an article scheduled for publication in the December issue of the <em>Journal of Alzheimer's Disease</em> the authors suggest that when the National Institutes of Health separated out dementia from other senile conditions and redefined it as a distinct and "curable" disease -- Alzheimer's -- in the 1970s, it opened a Pandora's box and may have misdirected research for decades. It triggered the search for pathogenic factors and cures, and disregarded the role of demographic change and its diverse end results in the elderly.</p>
<p>The authors argue that senile disorders -- diseases occurring after age 60 and eventually affecting the majority of the elderly, such as tooth, hearing or memory loss -- are caused by aging, thus differ fundamentally from distinct diseases by origin, study paradigm and intervention strategy.</p>
<p>Moreover, the authors contend that a central regulator in cognition - the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling system - has been misconceived by institutional thinking that favors a "cure" for senile dementia. The dominant hypothesis, although unproven, is that Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels rise throughout the aging process, leading to cell death, and thus research has focused on calcium antagonists to lower those levels. This viewpoint has been promoted by policy makers, and the subject of a number of high profile clinical trials, but to date no positive results have emerged.</p>
<p>In contrast, the authors propose that declining functionality of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling as a result of the aging process, among a myriad of other age-related changes, leads to cognitive decline. Therefore interventions for senile dementia could activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> function by promoting energy metabolism and also by Ca<sup>2+</sup> agonists such as caffeine and nicotine. At the same time, risk factors play a key role. "Aging and Ca<sup>2</sup>+ deficits set the stage for senile dementia, but do not always lead to senile dementia in real life," explains Dr. Chen. "Lifestyles and other risk factors are the key. So we think that senile dementia may be explained by 'advanced aging plus risk factors.' This model points to a new direction for prevention. This means we must support the elderly in healthy lifestyles. And we should develop medications to extend the lifespan of old neurons, rather than looking for ways to inhibit far-fetched 'pathogenic' factors."</p>
<p>"The model implies that senile dementia is, by and large, a lifestyle disease," says Dr. Chen. "This view, in fact, has been shared by many in the medical and clinical community, but contrasts sharply with current dominant theories in the Alzheimer research field, which assume a linear and 'cause and effect' mechanism. Since they have not taken into account the fundamental roles of aging and risk factors, it is clear that these theories, though highly appealing to the public and researchers alike, are of little relevance to the scientific nature of senile dementia."</p>
<p>"The two overwhelming concepts, senile dementia as a distinct disease and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload hypothesis, have effectively blocked any meaningful progress in senile dementia research, and have inhibited the self-correcting mechanism of science," concludes Dr. Chen. "An independent scrutiny on the field may be helpful."</p>
<p>"Although incurable", Dr. Chen is optimistic. "Our research, if guided by correct theories, will produce medications to help delay dementia to a certain extent - similar to the drugs that delay or ameliorate atherosclerosis and osteoporosis today."</p>

<p>On behalf of the American Psychological Association, I would like to commend the Department of Health and Human Services and its federal partners, the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your efforts to develop the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>The American Psychological Association (APA) is a scientific and professional organization that represents psychology in the United States. With more than 154,000 members, APA is the largest association of psychologists worldwide. The mission of the APA is to advance the creation, communication and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives.</p>
<p>APA would also like to submit the following coments for your consideration as you refine the Plan Framework.</p>
<p>We stand ready to assist by recommending content experts (including researchers, clinicians, educators, specialists in multicultural practice and neuropsychological assessment), publicizing the Advisory Council's efforts, and reviewing and disseminating its work. APA remains committed to partnering with other organizations to prevent and reduce the burdens of this devastating disease. We very much appreciate your consideration of these comments.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions, comments or concerns to Deborah DiGilio, MPH, Director of our Office on Aging.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>APA Comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The science and practice of psychology are integral to efforts to prevent this disease and slow its progression, to assess, diagnose, treat, and support those with AD, and to lighten the burdens of the families and institutions that care for them.</p>
<p>Psychologists:</p>
<ul><li>conduct basic and translational research</li>
<li>develop and implement neuropsychological tests for assessment and diagnosis</li>
<li>develop evidence based behavioral interventions to address age-related cognitive decline and the known behavioral risk factors for AD, to reduce caregiver stress and burden, and to manage the challenging behaviors often associated with the disease, a</li>
<li>assess decision making capacity</li>
<li>use psychotherapeutic approaches to help individuals with AD and their caregivers cope with the illness and its associated consequences</li>
</ul><p>Independently, and as a part of interdisciplinary teams, psychologists have been at the forefront of research and treatment of AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Given the important efforts by psychologists to understand and address AD, it is surprising that there is no mention of the role of psychology in the Draft Framework: not in the sections on research or its translation into practice, nor in the list of professions that provide high quality health care, nor in the discussion of timely AD diagnosis, nor in the framework's discussion of education and support of patients and families. Most notably, neuropsychological evaluation, a component of the original and current gold standard for AD diagnosis, is not mentioned.</em></strong></p>
<p>APA offers its support to your efforts to refine and finalize the Draft Framework. Below, please find our feedback, organized in response to the strategies listed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</em></strong></p>
<p>APA is eager to participate in the development of a strategic Alzheimer's research agenda proposed by the Framework, and in the May 2012 research summit to be convened by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). We encourage NIA to invite scientists who understand not only current gaps in AD research but who also have a broad understanding of such integral topics as normative aging, cognition, clinical care, or caregiving. We also hope there will be an opportunity for scientists who didn't participate in the meeting to comment on the research agenda before it is finalized.</p>
<p>While a focus on biomarkers is propelling the AD field forward, how biomarkers cause or relate to the dementia syndrome (with which we are ultimately concerned) is still poorly understood. Therefore, we believe the participation of scientists who are working in interdisciplinary teams and who understand biomarkers AND behavior would be especially important. We say more on this issue in 1.C.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </em></strong></p>
<p>While the draft plan emphasizes the need to expand research on molecular and cellular mechanisms and genetic research to identify risk and protective factors, a research agenda that neglects the critical behavioral and social aspects of AD would be unsuccessful and insufficient.</p>
<p>The research agenda for the National Action Plan should prioritize research that underlies each section of the plan, e.g., research to enhance communication between caregivers and health care providers, to better tailor interactions with the health care system to the special needs of persons with AD, to enhance communication among interdisciplinary care teams to develop and disseminate 'best practices' for caregivers and to provide support for the caregivers themselves. Significant health risks to caregivers are well documented. To that end, APA would support the convening of additional summits to focus on clinical care research and caregiving.</p>
<p>In the domain of prevention, research focused on enhancing cognitive function may demonstrate pathways to prevention. Two promising areas include research on lifestyle, particularly connections between cognition and exercise (Anderson-Hanley, et al., in press; Colcombe, et al., 2003; Head, et al., in press) and research on cognitive training (Ball, et al., 2002; Basak, et al., 2008; Smith, et al., 2009).</p>
<p>More research needs to be focused on understanding how AD interacts with "other" diseases to cause dementia, and other vulnerabilities caused by normal aging (e.g. vascular changes, inflammation, and immune system changes). Most community based studies indicate that multiple pathologies play a role in the clinical syndrome and <em>all</em> autopsy series would suggest that multiple pathologies <em>must</em> be present in order for a person to have the disease clinically.</p>
<p>Because the first draft of the Framework dealt so cursorily with the issue, we want to emphasize again the importance of expanding research to understand how biomarkers relate to AD symptoms. It is perhaps the single most important area of focus for the reserach agenda, and is discussed more fully in our response to Section 1C.</p>
<p>We also request that the term "non-pharmacologic" be replaced with "behavioral." Behavioral describes a wide variety of interventions that NIA and other NIH institutes have funded and supported, and that may be extremely valuable for prevention and intervention. For example, for the management of behavioral disturbances in dementia, most reviews of this field suggest that behavioral interventions are preferred, due to their effectiveness, and because they help to avoid the serious side effects that are common with pharmacological approaches to dementia management (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Camp &amp; Nassar, 2003; Cohen-Mansfield, et al, 2007; Salzman, 2008; Sink et al., 2005).</p>
<p><em><strong>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presumptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</strong></em></p>
<p>While the increased ability for scientists to monitor changes in biomarkers is certainly promising, psychologists and others are concerned that there is considerable heterageneity in how pathogenic factors in AD are related to the symptoms of the disease. There is strong evidence that some neuropsychological measures can more sensitively predict conversion to Alzheimer's than most biomarkers (Gomar et al, 2011; Heister, et al., 2011; Landau, et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Research to understand and chart the earliest course of the disease should support biomarker development in tandem with neuropsychological research, not to the exclusion of it. More psychological/neuropsychological research needs to be supported to understand the behavioral manifestations of the putative biology. The use of biomarkers to monitor the effects of treatment only provides information on how the treatment affects <em>that biomarker</em>, which may or may not lead to improve in the clinical syndrome associated with the disease. We need better psychological and behavioral markers that are sensitive to disease progression over shorter periods to understand whether treatments improve the symptoms of the disease rather than simply the putative biological features. Right now, treatment trials use neuropsychological outcomes that are specific to diagnosis but may not detect disease progression with high sensitivity. More sensitive neuropsychological markers for diagnosis also need to be developed given that the biology of the disease starts years before evidence of the clinical syndrome. We believe the expertise of psychology in defining relationships between the biology and behavior is critical, and is not acknowledged in this draft of the Framework.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize that the first sentence in the draft Framework's Strategy 1.C is the subject of much disagreement. It is <strong>not</strong> currently possible to track the progression of AD through tracking biomarkers. And it is only possible to monitor the effect of such treatment as may be targeted specifically to a biomarker, not to a larger clinical syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate Translation of Findings into Medical Practice and Public Health Programs</em></strong></p>
<p>It is important for research findings to be translated into a universe much larger than medical practice. Because of the complex needs often presented by individuals with AD and their families and caregivers, the provision of care by an interdisciplinary health care team is generally needed. Thus, useful findings must be translated into the practices of <em>many</em> health care providers and in a <em>variety</em> of settings. Individuals with AD and their caregivers are found in multiple settings, not only traditional, medical settings, including long term care, community, and home care. We recommend the terms "medical" practice and "medical" practitioners be replaced by "health care" practice and "health care" providers to capture this inclusive model of care. Finally, individuals with AD and their caregivers should be explicitly mentioned as recipients of information regarding effective interventions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em></strong></p>
<p>We urge you to include psychologists among your list of specialists that care for people with AD and their families. The major initiatives to expand geriatric training opportunities at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Health Resources and Services Administration cited in this section both include psychology as one of the disciplines targeted.</p>
<p>Psychologists are integral members of the geriatric and dementia care workforce. They include highly trained professionals with unique skills in assessment, research and evaluation, behavioral health, geriatric and neuropsychological practice, evidence-based behavioral treatment and behavioral medicine practice, group dynamics, and systems that are of critical importance in addressing the health care needs of individuals with AD, their families, and caregivers.</p>
<p>Care provided by interdisciplinary health care teams ensures optimal assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning and implementation, and outcome evaluation that is responsive to the physical, behavioral, mental health, and social needs of patients and their families (APA, 2007). Caregivers of individuals with AD, and the individuals with AD themselves when possible, should be included as memebers of the team.</p>
<p>In addition, given the pressures faced by physicians, counseling efforts proven most effective in educating family members about how to handle the problems of AD are impossible to complete during the time allotted to a brief office visit.</p>
<p>Finally, Medicare reimbursement policies act as a deterrent to building the health workforce necessary to provide high quality care to individuals with AD and their caregivers. For example, Medicare will not pay for CPT codes 90846 (family psychotherapy without the patient present), or for 96155 (health and behavior intervention for the family without the patient present). Nor will Medicare pay for a physician service such as an office visit with a patient's family if the patient is not present. For patients with cognitive impairment, there must be options for reimbursement when working with families and caregivers without the patient present. In terms of integrated care teamwork, there are Medicare CPT codes (e.g., 99366 and 99368 initiated in 2008) that allow team conferences that involve interdisciplinary professionals from at least three disciplines to assess a patient's care plan and progress, however these codes are very poorly reimbursed. Reimbursement of behavioral interventions, other than psychotherapy, which would allow psychologists and other mental health professionals to intervene on behalf of people who cannot benefit from traditional therapy because of their cognitive deficits, e.g., behavior management interventions, is also critical.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>We would like to emphasize that the current gold standard for AD diagnosis involves a neuropsychological evaluation - - the integration of objective measures of cognitive performance with historical, neurological, and other diagnostic information. Psychologists, with specific compentency in evaluation of cognition and expertise in the integration of cognitive data with other psychodiagnostic approaches, clearly need to be represented as primary practitioners involved with enhancing AD care quality and efficiency through timely and accurate diagnosis. The APA <em>Guidelines for the Assessment of Dementia and Age-Related Cognitive Change</em> (APA, 2012) note that neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing remain among the most effective differential diagnostic methods in discriminating pathophysiological dementia from age-related cognitive decline, cognitive difficulties that are depression-related, and other related disorders. Even as biomarker identification and analysis improve, neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing will still be necessary to determine the onset of dementia, the functional expression of the disease process, the rate of decline, the functional capacities of the individual, and, hopefully, response to therapies.</p>
<p>The citation for this sentence: "Research has helped identified some assessment tools that can be used to rapidly assess patients showing signs and symptoms of AD and to help health care providers make a diagnosis or refer for further evaluation" focuses almost exclusively on biological markers. However, behavioral (neuropsychological) markers remain the gold standard against which biological markers are validated (Blacker, et al., 2007; Gomar, et al., 2011; Jacobs, et al., 1995; Tabert, et al., 2006). Neuropsychological assessment tools are non-invasive, highly accessible, and reasonable for the assessment of AD either in isolation or with other markers of disease. We request that the literature documenting the usefulness of behavioral markers be included in this section of the framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support Patients and Families Upon Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>Multiple health care providers, including psychologists, are involved in assessment and planning of advance care counseling for individuals with AD. Assuming that these tasks are the sole purview of the physician is incorrect. Thus the term "physician(s)" should be replaced with "health care provider(s)."</p>
<p>The APA Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (2011) state, "individuals concerned about cognitive and behavioral changes associated with aging, generally come to the evaluation process seeking information as well as emotional support. This often is a severely distressing situation for the individual, who may or may not have been the key individual in making the decision to have an assessment conducted (American Bar Association &amp; American Psychological Association, 2008; American Psychological Association, 1998). ... Providing feedback, education, and support to persons significant to the individual, with the individual's informed consent, are also important aspects of evaluations and enhance their value and applicability. Knowledge regarding levels of impairment, the expected course, and expected outcomes can help these significant other to make adequate preparations. Working with the individual's support network in this way can provide them with effective means of responding to the challenges posed by behavior changes stemming from a diagnosis of dementia. Healthy older adults who have had concerns about their cognitive functions can benefit from reassurance based on results of testing and from suggestions as to how they may enhance their everyday cognitive function."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, research on advance care planning for persons with cognitive impairment shows that even when physicians and social workers in a Memory Disorders Clinic encourage advance care planning only about 40% of clients do so (Garand, 2011). It appears that the most effective way to foster the development of advance care plans is to involve multiple face-to-face educational sessions (Bravo, 2008). Thus, support for more intensive interventions is necessary if we are to increase advance care planning.</p>
<p>We would also like to note that at this time, the evidence does not indicate that early detection will lead to improved treatment, or actually help people to plan for their future care. There is a risk to early detection (as noted in recent guidelines for cancer screening) -- large numbers of individuals being identified as patients, or at risk. This can create needless psychological distress because there are so few current treatment options, and those few options are often inappropriate. This may lead to discouragement on the part of families whose support and partnership with care providers is critical to the person with AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong></p>
<p>Identification and implementation of high-quality dementia care guidelines should include both those that focus on pharmacological and behavioral intervention and take the whole person into account, including behavioral and mental health considerations along with physical care. Interdisciplinary consensus development processes, such as the Consensus Statement on Improving the Quality of Mental Health Care in U.S. Nursing Homes: Management of Depression and Behavioral Symptoms Associated with Dementia (American Geriatrics Society, 2003) in which 15 health provider organizations participated is one effective model for developing high-quality dementia care guidelines. APA has developed Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (<a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf</a>) and is interested in working with other organizations to develop additional dementia care guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of health services available to individuals with AD. Psychologists and other mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with individuals with AD and their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of psychotherapy. Behavioral interventions are effective in addressing dysphoria, agitation, anxiety, and apathy in persons with dementia (Teri et al., 2005). Behavioral interventions are an especially important tool as medication treatment of behavioral disturbances in dementia is of limited efficacy and should be used only after environmental and behavioral techniques have been implemented (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Sink, et al., 2005). At more advanced stages of dementia, use of sensory stimulation often assists in addressing issues related to agitation or anxiety (Lin et al., 2009). At all stages of dementia, apathy is the most common behavioral challenge facing caregivers. Therefore, provision of optimal stimulation and ensuring positive engagement are critical features of interventions to improve the quality of life of both persons with dementia and their caregivers (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>A major challenge arising from the anticipated rapid growth in the population of those suffering from AD is provision of support, both to the individuals with AD and to their caregivers. It may not be feasible to construct the number of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) required to provide a continuum of care for individuals with dementia in the coming decades. Even if it proves possible, the cost of maintaining people in such facilities may be prohibitive without a rapid enrollment of people into long-term care insurance programs. In addition, home and community-based care is often preferred by patients and their families. Finding ways to support those with AD and other dementias in their homes is going to be critical to effective coordination of care.</p>
<p>Randomized control trials, such as REACH and REACH II, have shown that innovative health care tools, such as remote delivery of services through telemedicine with the support of integrated health care teams, can relieve caregiver burden, particularly depression, for those caring for people with AD (Eisdorfer et al., 2003; Czaja &amp; Rubert, 2002; Finkel et al., 2007). Such interventions can be structured to provide effective, culturally-sensitive support (e.g., Belle et al., 2006).</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>APA concurs that improved care is necessary for populations disproportionally affected by AD. Health care providers must understand and competently manage the cultural differences in these populations. In many ethnic minority groups, familial support extends beyond the immediate family system. Thus it is important that providers be as inclusive of the extended family system as possible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials</em></strong></p>
<p>We concur that ensuring the development and receipt of culturally sensitive education, training and support materials by family caregivers is crucial as there is evidence that the problems experienced by caregivers differ in occurrence and intensity across racial and ethnic lines (Dilworth-Anderson, Williams, &amp; Gibson, 2002; Janevic &amp; Connell, 2001; Pinquart &amp; Sörenson, 2005). Replication and dissemination of model interventions such as REACH II (Belle et al, 2006; Burgio, 2009; Elliott et al., 2010) that are proven to be effective with diverse populations, is encouraged.</p>
<p>The strengths and coping mechanisms of culturally diverse groups should not be overlooked. For example, in a study of caregivers of patients with AD, Morano and King (2005) found that caregivers with higher levels of religiosity reported significantly lower levels of depression. Inter-ethnic comparisons showed that, African American caregivers reported the highest level of religiosity and the lowest levels of depression.</p>
<p>When considering issues of diversity and the effective provision of culturally sensitive education, the special needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities who develop AD should be considered. In addition, culturally sensitive education should include efforts directed to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. In these communities, "familial support" includes "families of choice," a term which is often used in lieu of family of origin for many LGBT adults.</p>
<p>Psychologists have a long history of involvement in the development of culturally competent health care interventions (e.g., many of the lead investigators on the REACH and REACH II projects were psychologists) and could provide additional direction in the development of this strategy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</em></strong></p>
<p>Rather than beginning the description of this strategy with a sentence about the eventually of nursing home placement, it would be more useful to begin with the second sentence that speaks to supports for families and caregivers. This is an area in which we <em>do</em> have evidence-based interventions to assist caregivers in maintaining their own health and well-being. Research on the effectiveness of behavioral inteventions for caregivers of individuals with dementia has been quite prolific (APA, 2011). For example, The New York University Caregiver Intervention (NYUCI) benefits the caregiver's mental and physical health and delays institutional placement of the care recipient (Mittleman et al., 2006). This intervention provides dementia caregivers with 6 sessions of individual and family counseling, support groups participation, and additional on-call telephone consultations in a flexible counseling approach that is tailored to each caregiving family. The STAR-C intervention (Teri, et al, 2005) produces benefits for both the caregiver and care recipient, improving caregiver depression, reducing burden, improving sleep, lessening subjective ratings of burden, improving caregiver reaction to behavioral problems, improving care recipient quality of life and memory-related behavioral problems. The STAR-C program has been successfully taught to community consultants, providing evidence that it can be disseminated into diverse community settings. In this intervention, caregivers are taught to monitor problems, identify possible environmental or interpersonal triggering events, and develop more effective responses in order to improve patients' environment, maximize their abilities, and minimize their impairments. Psychologists have been involved in the development and evaluation of each of these interventions and have trained masters level professionals and aging and community service workers to implement them in community settings.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that the use of the term "supports" is a bit misleading in this strategy's description. The meta analysis cited (Sorensen, 2002) shows that interventions that <em>only</em> offer supports are much less effective than interventions that offer caregivers information and skills training -- that is, psychoeducational interventions with an "active" component. Cognitive behavioral therapy was found to be the most effective intervention in decreasing caregiver depression in this meta analysis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong></p>
<p>Assistance is critical for family members who must prepare to transition from care partners to caregivers (Aneshensel, et al., 1995). Families need not only education but skills training and the availability of counseling services as they take on multiple roles and responsibilities (Zarit, 2009). As noted elsewhere in this document, individuals with AD should also be included in planning for their future needs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the resources for planning and meeting long-term care needs are woefully inadequate. Many families and caregivers of individuals with AD perceive themselves as not 'fitting' many of the support options communities may have to offer. Often the individual with AD does not qualify for services because they do not have IADL limitations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Psychological interventions stress the importance of personhood and preserving the individuals' dignity in AD and person-centered planning during MCI and mild AD. Enabling family members to accept, support, and engage the person with dementia as he or she is now is an important challenge to address. It is also critically important that therapeutic goals be discussed directly with the individual who has dementia. This not only provides the respect and dignity that should be given any individual, but also provides highly relevant information regarding the individual's understanding and attitude about the goal, his or her motivation in achieving the goal, and his or her willingness to expend time and energy working toward the goal (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>Regarding safety, although physical neglect and abuse tend to occur most of the time during the more severe stages of the AD, it is also important to recognize that older adults during the stages of MCI and mild AD are vulnerable to neglect and abuse in other domains. This is particularly true for financial abuse as there is evidence that diminished financial capacity or decision making is one of the early signs of cognitive decline (Marson et al., 2000). Individuals who are living independently are at high risk. It is not enough to say that we have APS or the Ombudsman program in place -- we must be much more proactive to prevent abuse before it happens. Psychologists play a key role with regard to assessment of capacity (e.g., capacity for medical consent, financial capacity, testamentary capacity, capacity for independent living).</p>
<p>APA and the ABA Commission on Law and Aging have jointly published a series cost-free handbooks on the Assessment of Older Adults with Diminished Capacity for psychologists, lawyers and judges <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx</a>. The handbooks have proved useful to a variety of health and aging professionals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The public health initiative described focuses on enhancing public awareness about AD, including misconceptions about diagnosis and treatment. We believe the main focus of a public education campaign should be on modifiable risk factors for AD -- including diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity or low educational attainment, and physical inactivity - and actions individuals can take now to reduce their risks. We know enough about these modifiable risk factors to institute a public health/awareness campaign, even if the risk factors are not related to the putative pathology. A recent study (Barnes, et al, 2011), notes that up to half of AD cases worldwide are attributable to seven potentially modifiable risk factors -- and that a 10-25% reduction in all seven risk factors could potentially prevent as many as 1.1-3.0 million AD cases worldwide.</p>
<p>In addition, the educational effort should not be alarmist, rather clearly state that the <em>majority</em> of older adults before the age of 80, which is currently about the average life expectancy for U.S. citizens, do not develop AD. AD is not a normal part of cognitive aging. Findings from longitudinal studies of intellectual development, such as the Seattle Longitudinal Study (Schaie, 2005), suggest that individuals who develop dementia after the age of 60 need to show multiple risk factors, including both genetic and behavioral risk factors. To be specific, estimates of the prevalence rates of dementia (i.e., most of the time estimates of dementia of the Alzheimer's type) for different age groups vary across study and range from about 5% to 13% for individuals age 65 and older to over 40% for adults age 85 and older (Hebert et al., 2003; Plassman et al., 2007). Thus, it is well established that the prevalence rate increases disproportionally with age and that individuals who are at greatest risk for showing signs of dementia are not individuals in the young-old age range, but individuals in the old-old and very-old age range (i.e., 80 years and older). This information should inform the public education campaign.</p>
<p>There are also pronounced racial differences in the prevalence rate of dementia and that this should be taken into account when raising public awareness and discussing the needs of this segment of the population. Gurland et al. (1999), for example showed that while the prevalence rate for white Americans was 2.9%, 10.9%, and 30.2% for the age groups of 65-74, 75-84, and 85+, respectively, the rates for the same age groups for African-Americans were 9.1%, 19.9%, and 58.6%, respectively. The pattern of prevalence rates for Hispanics was even higher in the age groups of 75-84 and 85+ (i.e., 27.9% and 62.9%), respectively.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the comments I provided on January 17, 2012 during the Public Input session of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services meeting. In addition, I have also included other comments based on discussions heard over the 17-18 Jan meeting.</p>
<p>As a sibling, caregiver, registered nurse, health care executive, and advocate to improve the care and support for individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their families and caregivers, I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to provide the following comments for the Council's consideration and action. The work and commitment of the Health and Human Services staff and the Advisory Council in developing a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease is to be commended.</p>
<p>My youngest brother, Carl Srsic, who was born with Down's syndrome, died from the advanced stages and complications of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 50 years old on October 13, 2010. My experiences in caring and coordinating my brother's care first with my parents and then his group home staff, parallel the issues identified by the thousands of family members and caregivers who provided input for the National Alzheimer's Plan. The issues however, are compounded for individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities. Therefore, the National Plan must address the needs of these individuals. I will address my comments in general and within the framework of the national Alzheimer's plan framework presented on 17 Jan 2012.</p>
<ul><li>In general:
<ul><li>Funding must be prioritized to address the devastating and growing impact of Alzheimer's disease particular in the baby boomer's general and for caregivers, particularly family caregivers. In the past, this nation prioritized funding to combat heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and HIV/AIDs. The time is now to prioritize funding to combat Alzheimer's disease. We cannot afford to delay.</li>
<li>I also encourage a balance between research and building evidence-based prevention, slowed progression, and ultimately effective treatment and cure for Alzheimer's disease with meeting the current day to day needs and support of individuals, families, and caregivers.</li>
<li>Fragmentation and 'silos' must be eliminated so that collaboration and coordination can provide the synergy needed to address effective action and outcomes.</li>
<li>One size does not fit all in terms of prevention, screening, treatment, and ultimately a cure. For instance, individuals with intellectual disabilities and Alzheimer's have confounding cognitive and other medical conditions that can make screening and assessment challenging and they react differently to medications and other treatment modalities. Therefore, individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities must be considered as a special population affected by Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>I applaud and encourage applications to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to develop new guidelines and creative care management and service support programs.</li>
<li>At some point, Alzheimer's disease must be incorporated into the National Quality Strategy. Much discussion occurred about the need for data and metrics - process and outcome success measures must be developed to measure success. In addition, as CMS developed evidence-based core measures for heart failure, community acquired pneumonia, etc. , so too, there should be core measures developed for care management and service support for Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>The Center to Advance Palliative Care should be consulted to collaborate on palliative care guidelines for individuals with AD.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Goal 1 - Prevent and Effectively Treat AD by 2025</strong>: Individuals with intellectual developmental disabilities (IDD) must be included as a population within and specific to all the goals of the National Alzheimer's Plan. Research priorities must include studies specifically focused on individuals with IDD as the prevention, screening, and treatment methods may not be applicable as in the general population. To even gather an adequate sample of individuals for potential research study samples, more effective means of identifying individuals with IDD must be developed and databases established locally, regionally, and nationally. Individuals with IDD are not a socioeconomic or race or ethnic population that is commonly associated with health care disparity groups; they are a special population in and of themselves that must be recognized and identified as such in the national plan.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 2 - Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong>: While there are health care providers who are limited in their knowledge and plan of care about AD in the general population, there are even less providers who have the knowledge and skill to manage individuals with both IDD and AD. Finding a qualified, competent, and compassionate provider to guide and coordinate care management is difficult, for individuals who even know and work in the health care system. Current centers for the aging may not have the knowledge and skill for managing individuals with IDD and AD and centers for those with developmental disabilities many times do not have the knowledge and skill for managing individuals in various stages of aging and AD. Support to family members and caregivers is crucial -- as these individuals have had to deal with multiple challenges in caring for a son, daughter, or sibling from birth and then that caregiving becomes even more overwhelming when AD develops. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines must address the multiple needs of individuals with IDD and AD. Aging in place, such as in group home settings with augmented services and supports must be explored as a cost -effective alternative to nursing homes. Consistency, familiarity, and minimizing transition are key to the overall well-being for individuals with IDD and those elements of care are even more relevant for an individual with IDD and AD. With the advent of ACOs and medical homes, models of care coordination management and transition within types of care should be developed to include individuals with IDD and AD. These new approaches to care center on the patient in a truly more holistic approach to care. As in many approaches used for management of other diseases, such as multidisciplinary care coordination or the use of patient navigators or specific case managers, so too should such strategies be considered for individuals with AD.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 3 - Expand Patient and Family Support</strong>: Many individuals with disabilities still live at home with aging parents who also may be developing or have Alzheimer's disease. Families may not be within any support system to specifically help them manage and cope with AD in addition to IDD. They need information about AD, resources, safety, coordination of care, respite care, end of life care, etc. Community supports and easy to find information about resources must be developed and/or incorporated into services for families. It is not just a matter of disseminating information - reaching individuals, helping them know how to access resources from a central location rather than fragmented searching is critical.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 4 - Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Parents of individuals with IDD need to be alerted to potential early onset Alzheimer's. Caregivers, particularly those in group homes, day programs, etc must have required training in not only IDD but also aging and AD care management. The state Developmental Disability Services must also incorporate timely resources to support individuals, families, and caregivers specifically addressing the needs of those with IDD and AD. The need for services (e.g., increased staffing, environmental safety measures, etc) must be available when there are acute needs and not delay care and services due to bureaucratic processes. Collaboration among agencies and services must develop synergy and cost-effective strategies rather than having 'silo' services that are limited, fragment, or overlap.</li>
<li><strong>Goal 5 - Improve Data to Track Progress</strong>: Data about individuals with IDD is often lacking and not uniformly centralized which compounds accurate data collection for those with IDD and AD. Tracking for high 'at-risk' populations with IDD and progress in care management is crucial for effective and efficient resourcing.</li>
</ul><p>While I realize there are many competing priorities and limited funding, the Plan must address the needs of all people with Alzheimer's disease/ related dementias. Our nation made it a health priority to address other major diseases in the past such as cardiac/stroke, diabetes, cancer, and HIV/AIDS with remarkable advances. Action to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease must be now. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments for your consideration into the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p>Good afternoon. My name is Caroline Rodgers. I am a researcher and writer specializing in public health issues.</p>
<p>I am sure that everyone here would agree that Alzheimer's disease has turned the prospect of aging into a scary and uncertain future that will rob many of us of our memories, our dignity and even our lives. I am here because I envision a world in which Alzheimer's is once again a rarity and our senior years are a true Golden Age.</p>
<p>Last year my article proposing that dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's disease was published in the Journal of Medical Hypotheses<sup>1</sup>. I also made a poster presentation on the subject at the 2011 Alzheimer's Association International Conference<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The technical explanation of my hypothesis is:</p>
<p><em><strong>Ionizing radiation from dental X-rays shortens the telomeres of microglia, which are critical to maintaining neuronal health. This reduces the lifespan of microglia, stranding neurons. Stranded neurons subsequently die, causing irreversible dementia. </strong></em></p>
<p>More simply stated:</p>
<p><em><strong>Head exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation is causing us to outlive the brain cells designed to support our neurons all lifelong. </strong></em></p>
<p>NOTE: Dental X-rays are the only form of ionizing radiation that virtually all Americans are routinely exposed to at regular intervals throughout their entire lives, starting in early childhood. Although low-dose ionizing radiation amounts have been compared to background radiation exposure received during long airline flights, the amount of whole-body ionizing radiation received cannot be fairly compared to the amount beamed directly into the head.</p>
<p>It is not realistic to believe that decades of dental X-ray exposure would be without consequence for all people. The question is not, "Why should we consider whether dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's," but rather, "Why didn't we think of this sooner?"</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis foundation: </strong></p>
<ol><li>Alzheimer's prevalence data</li>
<li>Population-based dental care information</li>
<li>Scientific studies<sup>1-4</sup></li>
</ol><p><strong>Dental care &amp; dementia: A sampling of countries </strong></p>
<p>INDIA</p>
<p>67% have never visited a dentist<sup>5 </sup><br />
					Dementia prevalence estimated at 1/5 -1/4 that of Europe's<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>CHINA</p>
<p>30% to 43% adults have never visited a dentist<sup>7</sup><br />
					Dementia prevalence about half of Europe's<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>UNITED STATES</p>
<p>1% have never visited a dentist<sup>8</sup><br />
					13% of people 65 and older have AD<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><strong>Let's test this hypothesis against the facts </strong></p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: The emergence of AD symptoms is delayed 10 or more years following the presence of AD brain pathology.</p>
<p>Microglial telomere shortening would have a delayed effect on neurons because it reduces microglial lifespan, not function.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD mortality increased rapidly after 1979, making it the sixth leading cause of death by 2000.</p>
<p>Since AD symptoms are delayed by 10 or more years, it is worthwhile to look at health trends taking place in the decades before the surge in AD mortality. This was a time of major changes in the nation's dental health habits.</p>
<p><strong>1940</strong> it wasn't until the '40s that X-ray machines were common in America's dental offices<sup>10</sup>. However, nearly two decades later, in 1954 . . .<br /><strong>1957</strong> only 37% had visited a dentist within the year, while 18% reported never visiting a dentist<sup>11</sup>.<br /><strong>2008</strong> 59% had visited a dentist within the year, with only 1% never having visited a dentist<sup>8</sup>.<br /><strong>2010</strong> The national average that had been to a dentist or dental clinic within the year was 69.7%<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: The hippocampus is one of the first brain regions to suffer AD-related damage.</p>
<p>It contains both microglia and neural progenitor cells which -unlike other mature brain cells -- keep dividing, making them more susceptible to radiation-induced damage.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Men die sooner than women following an AD diagnosis<sup>12</sup>.</p>
<p>Older men have shorter telomeres than women the same age<sup>13</sup>, so they would have less time if their microglia telomeres were prematurely shortened.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Virtually all people with Down syndrome have AD brain pathology by age 40 -- but there is a wide variance in the onset of dementia<sup>14,15</sup>.</p>
<p>People with Down syndrome lose telomere length faster than the general population, but just like others, there is variation in newborn telomere length<sup>16,13</sup>. Also, people with Down syndrome are subject to many genetic dental anomalies that could entail additional X-ray exposure.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD prevalence is higher in urban areas<sup>17</sup>.</p>
<p>City dwellers make more dental visits<sup>18</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD is increasing most rapidly in developing countries -- especially Latin America<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>In the last few decades, many countries started providing free dental care to all citizens, such as Cuba in 1976, Venezuela in 1999 and Brazil in 2004,.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD does not respond to anti-inflammatory or cholesterol-lowering drugs -- even though AD is associated with brain inflammation and high cholesterol<sup>19,20</sup> .</p>
<p>Neither treatment can help neurons that have lost their support system.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Mentally stimulating activities initially delay AD, yet ultimately accelerate it<sup>21</sup>.</p>
<p>Additional brain growth would eventually overwhelm microglia struggling to support existing neuronal networks.</p>
<p><strong>If dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's, it raises new questions and concerns, such as:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Could diligent dental care explain the increase in non-familial early-onset AD?</li>
<li>At what price, a smile: What are the long-term risks for orthodontia patients exposed to cone-beam CT scanners that create 3-D images -- at much higher radiation levels?</li>
<li>Could head X-rays after sports injuries contribute to early-onset dementia?</li>
<li>If dental X-rays pose risks, could brain imaging utilizing ionizing radiation to monitor AD accelerate disease progression?</li>
<li>Do plateaus in declining cognition relate to intervals between X-ray exposures?</li>
<li>Could the ratio of dental professionals to population be used to create accurate algorithms to predict dementia trends?</li>
</ul><p><strong>What are the prospects for Alzheimer's prevention, treatment or cure? </strong></p>
<p>If dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's disease, future cases can be decreased by eliminating or strictly limiting dental X-rays. Dentists can also turn to alternative imaging technologies already developed, yet not in common use. Interventions for people already exposed to dental X-rays yet without AD symptoms could include developing ways to safely transplant self-donated bone marrow or dental stem cells to replenish microglia populations. Other possibilities would be to develop ways to preserve or even lengthen microglia telomere length or to selectively remove permanently senescent microglia cells to stimulate replacement microglia that would actively provide neuroprotection. Sadly, there is no evident cure for people who have already lost their microglial support system to the point where enough neurons have died to cause symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Closing comments </strong></p>
<p>I don't know the answer to the questions I have raised in this short talk. I do, however, know that we have to look in new places with open minds to solve the puzzle of AD's emergence as a major killer and to restore health, dignity and luster to our "golden years."</p>

<p>I'm adding my families voices to those who want to see Alzheimer's disease eradicated ASAP. The NAPA framework is a great start -- a late start, but a great start none the less.</p>
<p>Please accelerate the 2025 goal &amp; support the investment in Alzheimer's research &amp; figure out ways to accelerate the drug treatment. I realize this is probably one of the worst times in history to be asking for more government funding -- but we didn't make significant progress on any of the other major illnesses until we focused on them by utilizing our national resources &amp; making the eradication a priority!</p>
<p>This illness kills people, depletes their savings &amp; takes a significant toll on families &amp; caregivers. I know first-hand -- my mom has Alzheimer's, my aunt has Alzheimer's, looking back -- my grandma had some form of dementia too. Illness is never easy, but when the course of the disease is so long &amp; it takes away the essence of who you are, it becomes devastating. There are no words to express the heartache &amp; loss.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>

<p>The greatest challenge to finding new treatments to AD is:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Funding from all agencies that normally fund AD research is at a historic low. This along with the traditional bias inherent in our peer review system holds back any hope for developing effective drugs to treat AD. The NIA, which is the primary government agency that funds AD research, is doing the best they can with a system that still carries significant bias towards funding research groups that hold strong lobbying power within the scientific community. Unfortunately, our scientific peer review system continues to be too easily influenced by entrenched scientific review committees, and the NIH staff is left powerless to correct damaging political decisions. The scientists who serve on these committees are too fearful to speak out against established investigators in the field in fear of retribution against their own research programs.</p>
<p>As too often seen in Washington DC, the people in power are more concerned with keeping power (and the funding that goes with it) for themselves and their friends, than doing their job which is to serve the best interests of the patients and their families. The Alzheimer's Association lost money in the financial collapse of 2007-08, lessening their ability to fund research, and they have many of the same inherent problems discussed above in our peer review system. The pharmaceutical companies are losing billions of dollars every year to patent expiration causing them to gut their research and development efforts. The drug pipelines are becoming drier each day with diminishing input from a weakened R&amp;D effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have undergone a significant paradigm shift in our approach to creating new therapeutics. Frustration from legislators that the system wasn't producing drugs fast enough forced a change in the way we perform science. Rather than taking the traditional approach of building from the ground up with knowledge based science (e.g. basic science research) we have decided to take the "shot in the dark" approach with little if any scientific backing or forethought. Current research funding is disproportionately appropriated towards "translational" proposals with the hope (and a prayer) that a new miracle drug will be found, lacking well tested and knowledge based scientific ideas. I suspect one of the reasons for this shift in the scientific method is the increasing tendency towards "instant gratification" that all of us have become accustomed to in our lives. This may explain the frustration with the "old" way of doing science, but doesn't necessarily mean it will work for producing new drug treatments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't know about other fields, but in the AD field there continues to be a disproportionate amount of money spent on ideas that have been tested for decades that have yet to show any success. This may be explained by the fact the scientists perpetuating these ideas are still in power and don't want to give up their jobs (or power) yet, even at the expense of families living with AD. They may feel very strongly about their long held beliefs, but this doesn't justify excessive domination of research dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One potential solution is to fund more basic science research. We don't have to completely abandon the high risk "shot in the dark" strategy, but simply appropriate more funding to basic science initiatives rather than putting all our eggs in the "translational" basket.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Another solution is to fund <strong>truly</strong> novel ideas and spend less money on ideas (amyloid based) that haven't worked for decades. Simply changing (not eliminating amyloid based research) the proportion of funding amongst various research ideas would be helpful.</p>
<p>These strategies, however, are long sighted and politically unpopular. Many people have become addicted to or expect "instant gratification" (e.g. bench to bedside in less than 4 years) and institutions (and scientists) with power do not want to lose their grip on the power (and money) they hold. This is where true leaders capable of acting selflessly are needed to change the way the system works. My willingness to speak out and express the opinions of many scientists in the field may lead to the demise of my career in this field, but I can't go along with the charade any longer.</p>

<p>As a long standing researcher on what causes Alzheimer's disease, and how to prevent and cure it, I urge you to immediately sponsor the proposal to increase funding for Alzheimer's disease research; the figure of $2 billion sounds about right. This was done for HIV/AIDs which is now a manageable disease. The same can happen for AD- The last few years have been exceedingly bad for AD research funding -- I have never before seen my research colleagues have to leave their positions, or leave science all together because they have not been able to secure NIH funding. The usual casualties are the more junior faculty, but I have seen it happen to senior faculty also, here at Columbia, one of the powerhouses of AD research. All of us spend much more time writing grant proposals than doing science which is a disaster if you really want progress.</p>
<p>I myself have cut way back on expensive translational research that uses mice genetically engineered to have Alzheimer's disease to identify good drug targets, so I now use much cheaper (but far less informative) cell models. This is entirely due to my inability to fund the much more costly translational research, even though I have been pretty successful competing for NIH funding.</p>
<p>Please, if you want to prevent and cure this disease, which is entirely possible with the right support, adopt the 2020 goal by increasing investment in Alzheimer's research and faster drug development and start by immediately injecting a realistic amount of funding into the research so we dont continue to rapidly slip backwards from the great progress we have made in the last 20 years.</p>

<p>I heard about this Federal, national initiative with great interest. Like cancer care, there needs to be an emphasis on research; however, there also needs to be an emphasis on finding high-quality, low cost, exceptional long-term care with dignity for persons with Alzheimer's and their families.</p>
<p>I am attaching a proposal I have for such (nationwide) care. I would like it to be considered by the committee as part of the national plan. I think it addresses care-giver support, the health care and other financial expenses, and the need for persons with Alzheimer's to live the rest of their lives with dignity.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>PROPOSAL FOR A NEW STATE (NATION)-WIDE MODEL FOR LONG-TERM ALZHEIMER'S CARE DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The problem</strong></em>: We know that Alzheimer's Disease is putting an ever increasing burden on persons with the disease, their care-givers, the health care system, and society at large. It presents an urgent problem for our Nation, our State and our local communities.</p>
<p><strong>One key issue is finding affordable care for persons with Alzheimer's</strong>. This presents significant challenges for spouses, children and friends of those with Alzheimer's. Adult children often have to leave the workplace to provide care for aging parents, resulting in economic hardships and increased emotional stress as well as physical illnesses for themselves and their family members. Spouses may also end up with financial struggles as well as social isolation and additional psychological and physical ailments at the end of their lives, taking care of their spouse with dementia. The toll on children, spouses, friends, businesses, the healthcare system, and governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, mark this challenge as a future crisis for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>Currently, there is a lack of affordable care options for persons with Alzheimer's</strong>. The cost of care ranges from $4,000-$5,000/month for assisted living/memory unit care to $5,000-$7,000/month for nursing home care. Daycare is around $10/hour. Long term health insurance often pays for a limited number of years of care, requiring families to assume costs after this period ends. For many persons with Alzheimer's, Medicaid may eventually pay for their care.</p>
<p><strong>Most would agree that whenever possible, care should be given at home</strong>. The benefits of optimal home care are many, and include:</p>
<ol><li>the familiarity and security of a home-like setting</li>
<li>24/7 supervised care from familiar individuals</li>
<li>constant interaction/stimulation/socialization</li>
<li>adequate diet and nutrition</li>
<li>the possibility of regular outings outside the home, such as trips to the gym, salon or dinners out with familiar companions</li>
</ol><p><strong>In a word, such care ideally enables the person with Alzheimer's to age with dignity, respect, optimal health, and have excellent, continuous care for the rest of their lives. </strong></p>
<p>But what does this require? It often means the care-giver leads two lives, theirs and that of the person with Alzheimer's. Those who have done it know this is unsustainable and will take a significant and dramatic emotional, physical, and financial toll on them and their families.</p>
<p><strong><em>The solution</em>: What is needed for persons with Alzheimer's is <em>optimal, AFFORDABLE care in a home-like setting without requiring 24/7 care from their family members or friends</em></strong>. Imagine a world in which NO ONE WITH ALZHEIMER'S WOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LONG-TERM CARE! You and your family members/friends could rest assured that you would have an optimal, affordable long-term care option if you had or were to develop Alzheimer's. Although this sounds like a dream, <strong>it can become reality if several parties who are impacted by this problem (basically, all of us!) work together. THIS REQUIRES A DIFFERENT CARE DELIVERY PARADIGM, one that is NON-FOR PROFIT, IN WHICH LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS FAMILIES AND LOCAL BUSINESSES WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN</strong>.</p>
<p>What would this look like? How could this be achieved? The following is a suggested model.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong><em>First, there would be a registry of individuals needing such care</em></strong>. This could be developed by the State for each county. Registries would include personal and financial information for each applicant. In addition, APPLICANTS WOULD NEED TO BE LOCATED IN THE SAME AREA (COUNTY) AS THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS/FRIENDS WHO WOULD BE ASSISTING IN THEIR CARE. So, for each county in Florida, a registry (waiting list) would be established showing individuals with Alzheimer's needing care as well as locations of nearby family members/friends who would need to commit to helping in their care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Local homes for sale/in foreclosure would be purchased to create home settings in which the applicants would live</em></strong>. This would be the responsibility of the State, working with local governments, possibly with Federal/agency grant support. Initial costs for setting up the home might also be covered by Federal grants, possibly coupled with local government tax breaks as well as local business and charity support. Each home would have 3-4+ residents living there (depending on the size of the home) The residents for each home would be selected on the basis of their monthly incomes, with each home including a mix of upper, middle and lower income residents to insure a sufficient income stream to take care of home costs (mortgage, utilities, food). Each person in the home would be required to pay only their monthly income (be it Social Security or other pension or income source), allowing for spousal support, if that were an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Staffing for each home would include a small number of full-time professional staff (again, supported by State funding/Federal grant support) as well as MANDATORY VOLUNTEERS comprised of family members/friends</em></strong>. A REQUIREMENT OF RESIDENCY IN THE HOME IS THAT FAMILY MEMBERS/FRIENDS <em>MUST</em> WORK A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF HOURS/WEEK IN THE HOME. The less income a person living in the home has to provide to the home for his /her care, the more hours would be required of their family/friends as "sweat equity" to support the home. Volunteers would undergo criminal background checks and mandatory drug testing at their own expense. They would also undergo possible inservice/orientation training. THEIR ATTENDANCE FOR WORK SHIFTS AT THE HOME WOULD BE MANDATORY. Not showing up for their scheduled weekly times could result in their family member/friend being expelled from the home. (Family members could substitute time shifts for each other, provided they were in-serviced/screened to work at the home.) These volunteers would take care of all home needs such as meal preparation, home maintenance (cleaning, lawn work, home repair, etc.), driving residents to appointments, socializing with residents, etc. They would also complete select activities with their own family members, such as bathing and when working their shift, dressing their family member, as possible. Their general supervision and schedules would be established by the permanent staff. Given the presence of the volunteers, at any given time, there would be a minimum of a one-to-one or greater staff-to-resident ratio. That is, there would always be optimal supervision, socialization, and attention given to each resident and their individual needs. Also, given that family members would always be working at the home, <em>everyone would have a vested interest in the success of the home</em>. This arrangement would also insure that family members/friends would have exposure to Alzheimers/senior needs and care and the aging process, resulting in a more educated, informed population with respect to these issues. Finally, family members and staff would have an available, in-house network of support, to assist with any issues or emotions they might be experiencing as family members/caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Salaries of the permanent staff, although possibly a government expense, would be small in comparison to the increased burden to the State and Federal governments of escalating healthcare costs. For example, how much would Medicare and Medicaid save in not having persons with Alzheimer's over-medicated, incorrectly medicated and/or in and out of emergency rooms/hospitals/doctor's offices for preventable problems, not to mention the costs of taking care of the health issues of their family/friend care-givers? How much would Medicaid save in not having to provide indigent care to these individuals once they've exhausted all their resources?? These cost savings could be enormous.</p>
<p>A further benefit to the healthcare system might be in the training of professionals dealing with Alzheimer's care and care of the elderly given that resident physicians and other professionals in geriatric medicine might staff the homes or be on-call for the homes, increasing their direct exposure to aging individuals and those with Alzheimer's. Such an arrangement might significantly decrease the need for emergency room visits, doctor's visits, and hospital stays for persons with Alzheimer's. This would also increase professional education/experience and, as a result, might dramatically decrease healthcare costs for this population. An alternate model might include established physicians volunteering some of their time to examining residents of the homes or consulting with the permanent staff in the homes re: health issues of the residents, again eliminating unnecessary use of the medical system.</p>
<p>Residents would stay in the home, with hospice care as needed, until the end of their lives. Transfers to nursing homes might be needed in some cases. When a resident left the home permanently, another resident on the registry (waiting list) would take that individual's place, preferably matched on the basis of financial criteria to insure the continued viability of the home.</p>
<p>If less homes are needed at some time in the future (possibly due to effective Alzheimer's treatments or a cure), homes could either be sold with the purchasing agent (State or Federal government) recouping the costs + profit OR the registry model and homes could be used for those with different, chronic health issues, such as housing for adults with Autism. THIS MODEL OF CARE WOULD <em>NOT</em> AFFECT CURRENT DELIVERY MODELS in that there will always be a need for existing assisted living facilities for persons who do not want to relocate close to family members/friends, have sufficient funds to be cared for as part of different care models or in their own homes, who prefer current facilities, and/or have significant medical needs to require nursing home care. WHAT IMPLIMENTATION OF THIS MODEL PREVENTS IS THE PROFLIFERATION OF NEW FACILITIES AND THE ESCALATING COSTS TO CONSUMERS, WHO, ALONG WITH LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, WILL BE CRUSHED BY THEM.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><strong>In conclusion, we all know that something MUST be done to care for persons with Alzheimer's. The current model of care delivery, whether done at home or in a facility, is UNSUSTAINABLE for the majority of citizens</strong>. It is crushing to care-givers, the government, the business community, and society at large. The care given to the person with Alzheimer's is often inadequate. The current model will destroy our healthcare system and economy if something isn't done soon to change it. And the human toll is most significant, for persons with Alzheimer's as well as their family members, friends, and community at large.</p>
<p><strong>What is needed is a dramatically different model of care deliver AT THE STATE LEVEL with Federal support. It must be not for profit to contain costs. It must be a model in which all levels of government (local, state, federal) work with patients, families and local businesses to provide compassionate, dignified, and quality care to persons with Alzheimer's until the end of their lives</strong>. Our country is well positioned to show the world how this can be done, and Florida, with its large elderly population, should be at the forefront of this effort. If we can put a man on the moon 40 years ago, we can solve this health care crisis and show the rest of the country and world how it can be done!</p>

<p>The following are comments left by my readers regarding the draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan. Thank you for developing this plan and soliciting feedback!</p>
<p>(1) Jim says:</p>
<p>Back in 1961 president John F. Kennedy made a commitment of going to the moon. Then in 1969 NASA accomplish that goal, so if you do the math it only took about 8 years. Why does the government feel it would take only13 years to find a cure for Alzheimers? The drug industry have tried for years.in finding a cure. Meanwhile, the skilled nursing homes are being filled with dementia/Alzheimers victims in different stages that either end up dying of malnutrition or pneumonia. The disease is rapidly growing out of control as we are living longer.I fear the time to address this problem has already passed.</p>

					(2) C. Danesi says:</p>
<p>Its up to us as the americans who are caregivers for those afflicted to get involved with the council and help drive their progress so that it wont take 13 more years.i arranged care for my mom who has severe alzheimers and traveled to Washington to be involved with the councils first meeting.im on a limited budget.We can make this happen-We must!thankyou carla danesi glorias daughter "remember gloria,gloria lives"</p>
<p>January 16, 2012 at 5:10 pm<br />
					(3) T. Litz says:</p>
<p>In an effort to help people with Alzheimer's and their families the government should help financially by adding to medicare a provision to help pay for care givers, The cost of care is outragious. In the beginning some care and then 24/7. Nursing home options are just as expensive and take the quality of life away from individuals with dementia. When there is no money left and medicaid is the only option left the government intervenes. Then the Alzheimer's person has to have all their caregiver's changed to an approved medicaid agency. This change alone is frightening for the family and changes the relationships built up over years with private caregivers. My mother has had Alzheimer's for 9 years so far. Benefits from the VA have not been forthcoming for almost a year and seem almost unreachable. More documentation, more waiting and never an answer as to when her aide and attendance benefits will start or if she will ever even receive it. My father was a VET from World War II. I call the VA every 2 weeks and get no where. More documentation -the application was filed last Febuary and now almost a year later they are asking for more information/ medical information faxed 3 weeks ago and now they want financial documentation. It seems that they are waiting for my mom to die. Advocate all the time and get no where.</p>
<p>January 16, 2012 at 6:45 pm<br />
					(4) K. Lockhart says:</p>
<p>Besides the research that needs more money for this disease, medicare and other insurance companies need to support care in the home 24/7. My 83 year old mother can not do it for my dad who is 84. We have needed in home care for that past 2.5 years. We have been fortunate to afford the care so far but it isn't going to last. I do NOT want to put my father in a nursing home that still does not know how to care for Alzheimer or any other dementia patient.</p>
<p>Changes in the healthcae system to prepare and regulate whether or not they are in fact providing best practices for these patients is important. Without government interventions, families struggle inordinately financially, emotionally, and physically. The caregiving will kill my mom before anything else. Unless I quit my job to help, I can only do the weekends. Isn't it cheaper to keep him at home than place him?? Looks that way to me. Thanks, Kathy</p>
<p>January 16, 2012 at 11:16 pm<br />
					(5) M. Brennan says:</p>
<p>To prevent Alzheimer's disease, let's consider how people in countries with little Alzheimer's disease live (differences in diet? stress? sleep? environment? other differeces from us?)</p>
<p>Let's assure funding for any reasonable research proposal that could help prevent or delay Alzheimer's. The federal deficit is no excuse for skimping on this urgent need. The deficit will be far greater if we don't prevent or delay Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>January 17, 2012 at 12:38 am<br />
					(6) M. Monfredo says:</p>
<p>I will echo what others have said in regard to the need to fund home caregiving through a medicare provision. The cost of hiring someone from outside for even one day a week is prohibitively expensive for many families. It's far less expensive to society overall for Alzheimer's patients to remain in their homes and this fact should be reflected in financial relief to their primary caregivers. Until a cure is found, this financial need will become even more acute in our aging population.</p>
<p>January 17, 2012 at 6:29 am<br />
					(7) T. Mumby says:</p>
<p>I know it fantastically difficult for all of us to STOP, turn around, see the person with dementia as OUR teacher and learn what changes we have to make in ourselves to promote well-being in our lives.</p>
<p>Seeing our loved one as a SICK PATIENT compounds the agony.</p>
<p>How many more trillions of dollars will poured into the monster money eating pharmaceutical industry? (Are you watching our financial decline?)</p>
<p>The variety of behavioural challenges is the MAJOR problem.</p>
<p>Doctors, nurses and the medical model is for SICK people, not people who are challenging us and our own mental strength 24/7.</p>
<p>It is not really surprising to explain the difficult behaviour around people where dementia is being experienced.</p>
<p>Acute fear, panic, confusion, irrational actions are telling us to LEARN the art of conducting situations in a light creative style. When the lessons are mastered, the progression of dementia is about how well YOU are developing into a wise and kindly person through using your new skills.</p>

<p>Many of us believe that it is very important that the National Alzheimer's Plan address mental health issues in the lives of people with dementia and their family caregivers. That was the gist of the discussion that took place at SAMHSA on December 16 when a group of experts were brought together to provide recommendations for SAMHSA regarding NAPA. This past week I published a short piece in the <em>Huffington Post</em> that elaborated on this position a bit. I would be glad to provide more extensive ideas if that would be useful.</p>
<p>Here is the link to my piece. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-friedman-lmsw/dementia_b_1189082.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-friedman-lmsw/dementia_b_1189082.html</a></p>

<p>People living with Alzheimer's or other dementias often have mental health problems -- especially depression and anxiety disorders -- as well as dementia. Memories they have always relied on become hazy and uncertain. Knowledge and skills cultivated over a lifetime diminish. Relationships change or are lost. Ordinary activities at work, home or leisure become difficult. Eventually, other people may be needed to help manage finances, make plans, get back and forth from home, eat, stay clean or go to the bathroom. As these sources of identity, personal pride and satisfaction are lost, people with dementia can become deeply sad, fearful and/or angry. Sometimes their behavior becomes a challenge for people who care for them.</p>
<p>These obvious facts should be part of what drives our nation's preparation for the vast growth of the number of people with Alzheimer's or other dementias that will take place over the next two decades.</p>
<p>The good news is that pursuant to The National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/</a>] signed into law in January 2011, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has begun to develop a long-term plan regarding dementia. The planning advisory committee for this project includes a representative of the Substance Abuse and Services Administration (SAMHSA) as well as representatives of many other federal agencies. In mid-December SAMHSA brought together a small group of experts who recommended that SAMHSA speak to the critical importance of addressing mental health problems experienced by people with dementia, Hopefully, it will do so at the next meeting of the advisory committee, which will take place on Jan. 17 and 18.</p>
<p>That's the good news. The bad news is that there is a battle shaping up about what the nation's priorities regarding dementia should be.</p>
<p>Some argue that there should be one and only one priority -- investing in research to discover a cure for Alzheimer's or at least to invent medications to stop the ineluctable decline the disease brings with it. For example, in an editorial in <em>Alzheimer's and Dementia</em>, Zaven Khachaturian of the Campaign to Prevent Alzheimer's Disease by 2020 argues, "Ultimately, the only deliverable that counts is a credible plan of action that calls for significant and systematic increases in the allocation of resources and funds for Alzheimer's research... particularly in the discovery and development of interventions to prevent disability."[1]</p>
<p>Others of us believe that, however promising biomedical research is, it will probably not bring relief in time for the 5.4 million Americans who already have dementia or for the additional five to six million people who will develop dementia over the next two decades. [2] We believe that humane care to help them have the best possible quality of life is the critical goal. We see this not as competing with biomedical research but as work that is necessary in addition to it.</p>
<p>But even among those of us who are focused on the need for more humane and more effective services and supports, there is some dispute about the importance of mental health services.</p>
<p>In part, this is the result of an outmoded view about the separation of mind and body. Dementia has physical roots with mental manifestations. Many advocates for better Alzheimer's care and treatment focus on the physical roots and do not regard dementia as a mental health condition. Others of us believe that mind and body are inextricably intertwined and that both physical and mental health perspectives and interventions are needed to help people with dementia and their families to have the best possible quality of life.</p>
<p>Many mental health issues arise in the lives of people with dementia and their caregivers. In a recent article in the same journal that published Khachaturian's editorial, Constantine Lyketsos and others argue that "neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias." They cite "depression and apathy ... verbal and physical agitation ... [and in later phases] delusions, hallucinations and aggression" as particularly common and important to address with mental health interventions, preferably non-pharmacological interventions. [3]</p>
<p>Psychological understanding can also contribute to improved quality of life for people with dementia and their families even if they do not have diagnosable mental illnesses. Dementia is often thought of as an unmitigated horror, but the truth is that some people with dementia lead lives that they find satisfying. Helping people with dementia to retain a sense of self-worth and be at peace with who they are is a very important goal for them. [4]</p>
<p>Mental health issues also touch family caregivers who provide 80 percent of the care for their relatives with disabilities. They are at high risk for depression, anxiety and physical illnesses that contribute to burn-out. Solid research by Mary Mittelman has shown that psychological support helps family caregivers live better with the stress they face, resulting in delay in nursing home placement by upward of 18 months. [5]</p>
<p>If the National Alzheimer's Plan does not reflect these facts, life for people with dementia and their families will end up far worse than it needs to be. That is why I and many others are advocating [<a href="http://www.imstillhere.org">http://www.imstillhere.org</a>] that the plan establish meeting the mental health needs of people with dementia and their families as a core priority for our nation.</p>

<p>My name is Bruce Lamb and I am an Alzheimer's researcher and Staff Scientist in the Department of Neuroscience in the Lerner Research Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. I would like to provide comments and suggestions regarding the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease that was released on January 9, 2012.</p>
<p>I think this is a very welcome and important first step in devising a National Plan for combating Alzheimer's, and the goal laid out for developing a treatment/prevention for Alzheimer's disease by the year 2025 is admirable and likely achievable, provided the plan is sufficiently bold and transformative. While I appreciate that the current document is only a Framework for the National Plan, there are several significant issues that I hope you will consider as the details of the plan are developed, in particular as it relates to research investments, strategies, goals and infrastructure (Goal 1).</p>
<p><strong>1) Committing Additional Resources to Research</strong><br />
					The planned NIA sponsored conference in May 2012 will provide invaluable insight into the goals and strategies required to achieve the goal of a treatment/prevention by the year 2025. However, while a reorganization and coordination across all research domains will increase research productivity, without additional research funds, the goals of having a treatment/prevention by 2025 is likely unattainable. There is currently no effective treatment for AD and thus additional funds are necessary to promote basic research, translational research, drug development and clinical research. Currently, funding rates at NIH and most non-profits is in the single digits (5-10% of all grant being funded), thus leaving a very large number of meritorious applications (the top 20-25%) unfunded. If we are truly serious about achieving the goals set forth in the Draft Framework, additional federal, non-profit and industrial investments in Alzheimer's research have to be part of the answer. While there will likely a considerable debate about the exact amount of investment required to achieve this goal, a starting point would likely be $2 billion/year as put forward in the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2010. As clearly laid out in the attached paper by myself, Dr. Todd Golde and Dr. Doug Galasko, similar types of investments in other diseases (i.e., HIV/AIDS) have proven transformative and lead to effective therapies. While I appreciate that the current funding climate is very tight and highly political, it is only with these types of investments are we likely to transform the Alzheimer's research endeavor and achieve Goal 1 of the Framework.</p>
<p><strong>2) Strategies/Goals</strong><br />
					The conference in May of 2012 will certainly help identify the key research areas that need to be addressed to achieve Goal 1 of the Framework. As part of the detailed National Plan, it will be important to both identify these targets as well as commit funding commensurate to achieve the goals identified. Funding one research domain at the expense of another with not enable us to achieve the ultimate goal laid out in the Framework. For each target, clear goals must be identified and a infrastructure/organization (see below) put in place to regularly assess progress within these areas.</p>
<p><strong>3) Infrastructure/Organization</strong><br />
					To achieve Goal 1 of the Framework, it will be absolutely critical to have an infrastructure and organization that can coordinate federal research efforts across all funding agencies, interact with non-profits and industry, promote awareness of the disease and the role that research will play in combating the disease as well as reporting to the Advisory Council directly as outlined in the Framework. In order for this organization/infrastructure to be truly successful and transformative, it will be essential that its efforts are entirely focused on combating Alzheimer's disease. This will provide a uniquely focused organization that will have the most chance of success. A similar "disease-focused" agency was created in 1988 for HIV/AIDS entitled the "Office of AIDS Research" (OAR) within the Office of the NIH Director, that played a key role in successfully coordinating the federal response to AIDS. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 strengthened the OAR, providing it with increased authority in the planning, coordination and evaluation of AIDS research. If we are truly serious about transforming Alzheimer's research and achieving the goals laid out in the Framework, a similar type of organizational structure (perhaps an Office of Alzheimer's Research?) is required.</p>

<p>This is an important step in the fight to cure Alzheimer's. More money allocated for research and the development of drugs to cure the disease will lessen the huge toll on our health system if nothing is done. Sometimes you have to pay up front to avoid even more cost in the future. My dad is currently at mild stage and it is doubtful anything new will help him. But there are millions of other people that will benefit. Let's fight to keep another family from going through this atrocious disease.</p>

<p>First of all, I would like to commend HHS for proactively working towards a comprehensive plan to address the personal and public impact of Alzheimer's disease. This plan is needed to ensure that there is proper allocation of resources to address dementias both empirically and clinically.</p>
<p>I was surprised to find that the plan did not mention the field of Psychology. Psychological researchers have played an integral role in the knowledge base on dementias and have developed diagnostic tools which are highly specific, yet cost effective. Furthermore, Psychologists and Neuropsychologists are often called upon to make formal diagnosis of dementia, relay this diagnostic information to patients and families, provide psychoeducation and support, assist with advanced care planning, assist teams/families in identifying and using non-pharmacological strategies for managing difficult behaviors, and provide services at the end-of-life.</p>
<p>As a Psychologist within the VA healthcare system, I provide such services within our Community Living Centers (i.e., nursing homes). Psychologists are specially trained to understand the psychosocial factors impacting older adults, as well as cultural/diversity impacts. As such, Psychologists are poised to deliver high quality assessment and intervention services to persons with dementia and their families. Furthermore, Psychologists have unique skills in assessment and program evaluation which allows us to monitor and measure our work in a way that can be directly linked to cost savings. I have seen how Psychology's presence on the CLCs has led to more positive outcomes, such as the significant reduction of use of antipsychotic medications, reduced caregiver burden, improved mood functioning for patients, and reduced strain on staff.</p>
<p>The exclusion of Psychologists in this framework could have detrimental financial impacts on our ability to provide these services in the future. I strongly believe that the elimination of Psychology from the interdisciplinary teams serving dementia patients would have dire effects on the provision of quality care.</p>
<p>I appreciate your strong consideration of including Psychologists in this framework.</p>

<p>Presently there are no approved treatment to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or cure this devastating disease. Filling the AD drug pipeline will require facilitating translation of basic research discoveries and increasing collaboration with the FDA and international regulatory agencies. The Critical Path Institute, working in a public-private partnership with the FDA, created the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) to identify improved methods and tools that accelerate drug development in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. NIA contributes to the consensus science for AD drug development tools in CAMD, as do our 16 member companies and other key stakeholders.</p>
<p>The goal of improving the drug development process for Alzheimer's disease can be addressed by incorporating the following actions into the National Plan for Alzheimer's Disease:</p>
<ol><li>Widespread adoption and use of the AD data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) to facilitate data sharing. These CDISC AD data standards should be used in all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored AD clinical trials. While the FDA currently encourages sponsors to use CDISC standards when submitting data, the ability for the FDA to require such standards in applications should be considered. The AD data standards should be frequently updated and expanded to cover any new measures.</li>
<li>Construction of a comprehensive AD clinical natural history database that could be mined by qualified investigators. This database should contain both control and active intervention arms of clinical trials and include trials of failed drugs. For optimal data mining, the data should be deposited in CDISC format with legacy data remapped to the AD data standards. Such a database, whether constructed by a foundation or a public-private partnership, would need to address privacy and informed consent concerns as well as liability issues. Moreover, a mechanism to protect proprietary, confidential data would need to be built in. Incentives for pharmaceutical companies to submit deidentified and appropriately coded treatment arm data include immediate access to a rick source of pooled data. Data mining of the AD clinical database should provide information on which biomarkers accurately track disease progression and response or non-response to treatment. This aggregated mega-database should also offer valuable insights for repurposing drugs.</li>
<li>Regulatory qualification of biomarkers that can be applied to testing new AD drugs. Progress in developing AD drugs has been hampered by the lack of biomarkers qualified by regulatory agencies for testing efficacy, particularly in the earliest stages of the disease. While AD researchers have identified some tantalizing candidates, providing the level of evidence needed for FDA qualification typically requires additional evidence and analysis. Such efforts are beyond the scope and resources of individual companies or academic researchers, and are best carried out through a public-private partnership/consortium model (e.g. ADNI, CAMD).</li>
<li>Development of analytic standards and reliable methods for measuring AD biomarkers. The lack of standardization for imaging modalities and/or assays of CSF analytes can prevent the FDA from accepting a biomarker for use in AD clinical trials. Standardization of analytic methods, together with establishing a resource of appropriate reference samples, should be a national priority.</li>
<li>Development of quantitative disease progression models to inform the design of AD clinical trials and evaluate new medicines. Mathematical models offer ways to differentiate between symptomatic and disease-modifying drug effects, determine the optimal sample sizes and sampling times, identify subpopulations with unique characteristics, assess the impact of baseline disease severity on drug response, and more. In short, models can prevent a good drug from failing, and keep bad drugs off the market. Modeling and simulation tools can be built using the clinical data of a large AD database, such as the one constructed by CAMD that contains ~ 6000 AD patients enrolled in the control arm of clinical trials. Even larger databases with cognitively normal controls and patients at the earliest stages of the disease, along with richer sources of biomarker information on these patients, should be constructed to facilitate the decision-making process in prevention trials as well as AD clinical trials. These quantitative disease models need to be evaluated by the FDA and accepted as "fit for use" so that the pharmaceutical companies can better design AD clinical trials.</li>
</ol><p>Each of these drug development tools fall within the "precompetitive space", where the knowledge gained and time saved can benefit individual company efforts to bring new drugs to the market. The National Plan for Alzheimer's Disease would benefit by incorporating these action items to spur the development of safe and effective medicines for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>As the Co-founders and Co-chairs of the Bipartisan Congressional Taskforce on Alzheimer's Disease and House authors of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA), we are writing to urge the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to continue its swift and efficient implementation of the Act. NAPA is intended to be transformative, creating a groundbreaking, far-reaching, and thoughtful National Alzheimer's Plan to improve care for Alzheimer's patients across the country and ultimately cure this disease.</p>
<p>We applaud the ongoing work of the Nation Alzheimer's Project Act's Advisory Council and federal agency working groups. We are pleased to hear that a draft National Alzheimer's Plan required by the law will be read by early next year. As you know, several of the largest Alzheimer's advocacy, care, and research organizations have submitted ideas and priorities for the National Alzheimer's Plan.<sup>1</sup> We hope that the agencies working to develop the draft plan will strongly consider these various proposals.</p>
<p>We provide below our recommendations for your consideration as you prepare the National Alzheimer's Plan:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Increase medical research funding and coordination</strong></p>
<p>As millions of baby-boomers age and retire, Alzheimer's is becoming a national pandemic, threatening to undermine our Medicare and Medicaid systems. Today the federal government spends $93 billion out of Medicare to care for Alzheimer's patients -- almost one out of every five Medicare dollars (18%) each year. This money pays for hospitalizations, doctor visits, and drugs associated with the disease. An additional $37 billion comes out of the Medicaid budget every year -- more than one out every 10 Medicaid dollars (11%). Taken together, that's $130 billion every year from Medicare and Medicaid that is spent on this one disease alone.</p>
<p>In addition, nearly 15 million caregivers provide approximately 17 billion hours of unpaid care to family members and friends with Alzheimer's, which represents a large drain on the time and the resources of families and employers. Now more than ever, we need to accelerate research breakthroughs in the causes, treatments and prevention of this disease and reduce the emotional and financial burden of Alzheimer's on families and federally-funded programs.</p>
<p>Basic research is our best hope for understanding the fundamentals of this disease and finding a cure. Currently, Alzheimer's research is underfunded across the federal government, academia and the private sector. According to data from HHS, Alzheimer's disease receives a franction of the research funding at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) compared to other diseases. Today, the NIH spends about $6 billion a year on cancer research and $3 billion a year on AIDS research. Alzheimer's has five times as many victims as AIDS, yet receives only $469 million in research funding a year -- less than 1/6 the amount spent on AIDS research.</p>
<p>Deaths from AIDS, cancer, and heart disease have fallen in the last decade. As a nation, we should learn from our past successes. Prioritizing and funding medical research has lead to breakthroughs and treatments and ultimately saved lives. In the same way, we must expand funding for basic medical research for Alzheimer's disease, which continues to have a dramatically increasing number of patients every year across the country.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>It is also our hope that in drafting the National Alzheimer's Plan, HHS will also explore ways to better coordinate research and grants dollars within the centers and institutes of the NIH. Currently, over a dozen institutes at the NIH support or conduct Alzheimer's related research. Perhaps there is a need for an institute focused solely on the disease or a way to enhance data sharing amongst researchers. Whatever the solutions, the National Alzheimer's Plan should include concrete ideas to guarantee that all money, given through grants or used internally, is spent effectively and in coordination with other research projects in support of a larger research agenda.</p>
<p>In addition, we urge HHS to consider innovative projects to facilitate research and therapy development across public and private sectors. For instance, HHS should consider the feasibility of increasing accessibility to lumbar punctures for patients in order to develop national databases and registries for at risk patients. Cerebral spinal fluid tests are proven to identify those at high risk of Alzheimer's disease.<sup>3</sup> Increasing access to this screening technique would help facilitate entries into clinical trials, and, once therapies have been developed, identify those who should receive such therapies.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Incent private sector research and development</strong></p>
<p>Biopharmaceutical companies have approximately 21,000 ongoing clinical drug trials in the U.S., yet only 100 of them are focused on Alzheimer's disease. It is our hope that new incentives for pharmaceutical companies to invest in research and therapy development, including the development of new drugs, devices, biological products, biomarkers, or diagnostic tools, are included in the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p>Federal agencies have adopted methods in the past for encouraging research and therapy development under adverse conditions, including: extended market exclusively for demonstrably effective treatments, priority review or fast-tracking by the Food and Drug Administration for treatments in the pipeline, review of guidelines regarding clinical trials, and patent life reform. It is our hope that the benefits and consequences of all methods are thoughtfully examined and considered in this case.</p>
<p>In addition, we urge HHS to consider ways to increase public-private partnerships for research and therapy development including possible strategic investments in start-up or growth companies engaged in advanced research and novel therapeutics, especially those companies willing to match funds from HHS.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Expand public awareness efforts</strong></p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Plan should call on relevant government agencies to work with local and state governments to develop public awareness campaigns around Alzheimer's disease, in the way HHS and the Centers of Disease Control have spearheaded public awareness campaigns in the past. It is our hope that the campaigns would focus on: the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, the importance of diagnosis, how to access clinical trials, and the availability of resources and services for patients, families and caregivers.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Provide reimbursement for comprehensive diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Reports estimate that as few as 19 percent of people with Alzheimer's disease have a documented diagnosis of their condition in their primary care medical record.<sup>4</sup> African-American and Hispanic populations are even less likely to be diagnosed than whites despite being at higher risks for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Medicare currently covers diagnostic evaluations and some imaging tests. However, if the signs of dementia have not been detected in the first place, a diagnostic evaluation is not conducted. Furthermore, after a diagnosis has been made, time constraints and lack of reimbursement often preclude a necessary discussion with the newly diagnosed patients and their caregivers regarding the diagnosis, treatment options, and support services available. As a result, many people with dementia and their families are not effectively connected to resources to help them manage the condition and avoid crises.</p>
<p>With an early diagnosis, patients and families can prepare for the oncoming symptoms of the disease. Facilitating conversations between doctors and caregivers and providing resources for patients' families can help mitigate the number of hospitalizations and complications for patients and ultimately bring down Medicare costs.</p>
<p>H.R. 1386, the Health Outcomes Planning and Evaluation Act (HOPE) for Alzheimer's, which we co-authored, proposes that the Centers for Medicare And Medicaid Services develop a new Medicare reimbursement code for a comprehensive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease to help drive best practices among doctors. This includes reimbursement of the following: screening of dementia, diagnostic evaluation, discussion with doctor and caregiver, and medical record documentation.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Expand outcome-oriented care programs and dementia training for healthcare professionals</strong></p>
<p>Models such as Independence at Home (IAH) and Resources for Enhancing Caregiver Health (REACH) have proven to improve the quality of care for patients and reduce health care costs by keeping patients in the comfort of their own homes longer and coordinating care services. IAH, currently a demonstration project slated to begin January 2012, creates a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, pharmacists, physical therapists and others to provide proactive care in the home for seniors with multiple chronic conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and congestive heart failure. As you know, there are more than 57 million Amerians living with multiple chronic illnesses in our country. These patients typically have numerous prescriptions written by an array of doctors, and struggle to visit their physicians when they need care. IAH aims to end the current disjointed approach of caring for these patients. Such successful programs that reduce costs and improve health care outcomes should be considered in the National Alzheimer's Plan and enacted across the country to support caregivers and increase access to quality care for all patients.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>In addition, it is our hope that the National Alzheimer's Plan will call on federal agencies to work with state and local governments to increase Alzheimer's and dementia training for health care professionals, social workers, employees of long-term care facilities and law enforcement. Increased training and education could dramatically improve the treatment of Alzheimer's patients and help avoid unnecessary costs and harm as the result of wrongful diagnosis and mistreatment.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Encourage State Plans</strong></p>
<p>30 states currently have or are in the process of developing plans for supporting Alzheimer's patients.<sup>6</sup> The Massachusetts Executive Office of Elder Affairs, for example, established a committee of experts to evaluate services and resources available to Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers and develop a strategy for improving care. Their initial reports focused on the need to diagnose patients early, connect patients and their families to available resources, and facilitate at-home care.</p>
<p>The challenges associated with Alzheimer's disease are too varied and far-reaching for the federal government to tackle alone. From improving transportation services for patients in rural neighborhoods to assisting in the creation of new adult daycare centers, state and local governments are well positioned to improve the day-to-day care of Alzheimer's patients. In order to fully support the millions of Americans with Alzheimer's disease and their families struggling to care for them, we need local and state governments involved in developing appropriate service models.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we hope the National Alzheimer's Plan will encourage states to assess the services they currently provide and develop plans for caring for the growing number of patients in the future. In addition, the National Alzheimer's Plan should look for ways the federal government can support or reward state efforts to improve and coordinate care, especially if states develop innovative solutions with measurable cost-savings or improvements in care.</p>
<p>Caring for the aging baby-boomers will be one of the greatest tests of our society. Today, over 5 millions Americans and their families are struggling with Alzheimer's disease. Unless we find a way to prevent, slow, or cure this disease, in less than one generation those struggles will nearly triple, as millions more Americans face the prospect of an Alzheimer's diagnosis. We must change our current trajectory. NAPA was intended to outline innovative and large-scale strategies for improving care for our senior citizens, to which we owe so much, and ultimately find a cure for this devastating disease. We encourage HHS and its partnering federal agencies to continue their diligent, timely, and thoughtful work to implement NAPA and draft this historic National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p>CAUSES AND PREVENTION CAN BE DISCLOSED WITH STATISTICS! I am an 84 year old woman and a member of a genetic-Alzheimer's family. In my lifetime I am aware of eight family members who have been victims of Alzheimer's, the last three in my generation. Like so many families, I have watched my mother and my sister slowly lose their identities to this tragedy.</p>
<p>In the 21 years since an autopsy specified my mother's AD, dementia-research has mostly consisted of the very limited success of pharmaceutical trials, and more recently, gene-testing. This tunnel-vision has resulted in many family's continuing tragedies.</p>
<p>Currently, researchers are seeking new ways to identify pre-symptomatic members of such genetic families. They are searching for methods to identify those at high-risk, who are not yet experiencing cognitive impairments, so as to test "preventive" medications or life-styles.</p>
<p><strong><em>There is no need of evaluating pre-clinical subjects, when critical diagnostic testing and histories already exist, or can be researched, for those who have already been diagnosed with dementia. </em></strong></p>
<p>Current testing is uncovering conditions that may be causing dementia; injuries, diet, diseases, pathologies, environment, without the additional knowledge of possible <strong><em>linkage to commonality!</em></strong></p>
<p><em>It is time to invest in a "National/International Registry" to uncover the comparative histories of millions of patients. A computerized dignostic framework and guiding terminology needs to be created, to organize a vital public-reference as an ongoing global study of all brain diseases. </em></p>

<p>Enclosed please find the report entitled <em>The Path Ahead: A Framework for a Transformative National Plan to Defeat Alzheimer's Disease</em>. This report provides a series of recommendations developed by Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) around research, clinical care, long-term care and support services, and drug discovery and development for consideration by the Advisory Council as it develops a national strategic plan for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>LEAD was created to bring together stakeholders from all segments of the Alzheimer's-serving community - including government, business, and civic sectors -- to increase attention to and awareness of Alzheimer's disease, its care, treatment, prevention, research, and eventual cure. As you know, the increasing prevalence of this disease and the costs of caring for its victims is creating a grave and growing public health, fiscal and economic concern for our nation. With the goal of changing the trajectory of Alzheimer's disease, LEAD convened representatives from more than 40 organizations to develop strategies and recommendations focused on reducing costs, improving care and preventing Alzheimer's disease. We believe that these recommendations, if implemented, offer our best hope to save millions of American lives and trillions of taxpayer and family dollars in the coming decades otherwise lost to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>LEAD members and participants, including nationally renowned experts representing the full range of voices of the Alzheimer's-serving community, actively supported the passage of NAPA and are now willing to be a resource to the Advisory Council as it moves forward with the development and implementation of a strategic plan. We respectfully submit our recommendations in the attached report for consideration and stand ready to support the Advisory Council efforts as the national plan is developed.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this report, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Sue Peschin, Vice President of Public Policy for the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>

<p>Dear Advisory Council, for the past 7 years my siblings and I have been assisting my mother manage the challenges of Alzheimersdisease. I am a veteran of the nursing/psychiatric field with training in Geriatric Mental Health. When our mother began to show signs of the disease I urged her doctor to do a mini mental exam. At the time she scored below 20 and I believe this was due in part to the fact that she is Spanish speaking only and the test was designed for the English speaker. And I don't believe she comprehended its purpose and mostly joked around with the questions and answers. The fact remained that she missed all the critical orientation questions and her recent memory was severely impaired. Today she remains coherent, jovial and she converses easily. She has some difficulty with remote and recent memory, and item recognition, but she still recognizes familiar faces and is able to do most familiar tasks. She can still prepare simple meals, make coffee, and perform all ADLs. Recently, she has shown signs of new memory formation. These memories are based on new information obtained a month or two prior. The new memories are usually linked to an emotional response, eg; something she enjoys or wants to do. The new memories are formed after she has asked the same question repeatedly and it has been answered each time as though it was being asked for the first time. She has been on a combination of drugs called Namenda and Aricept, as well as the chewable version of Melatonin that only Trader Joes sells. She does not experience sundowning and sleeps 8 or 9 hours per night. She experiences one waking about 4 am when she takes another Melatonin and sleeps until 8 or 9 am. The geriatric mental health training I participated in was offered by the University Of Washington School of Social Work, it featured a wonderful section on a program called the Beyond Love Project. The project workbook was written by Moyra Jones and it is a community based model that can be adopted by any community. The Beyond Love Project utilizes the collaborative effort of various medical and legal professionals, as well a community volunteers to teach caregivers to care for themselves and their loved ones with compassion. It provides tools to assist caregivers in recognizing the stages ofdementing disorders, as well as the limitations and challenges of each stage. I have been working on distribution of pamphlets that are produced by the Dept of Health and Human Services to encourage education and early detection. But I am one person and it is not enough. Our Medical professionals are the first line of defense and often they are not aware of the early signs. My mother's own doctor said to me in horror "how did I not see this? I've known this woman for 10 years." I responded "she presents well doesn't she?" The truth is, like any other disease, the only way for a medical professional to detect this disease is by testing for it. My point here is that a Mini Mental Exam should be as standard as a colonoscopy or prostate exam at 55. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing about the new plan and I hope to be a part of bringing much needed services to my community. In the meantime, I will continue my efforts to bring awareness, education and support and advocacy to my community.</p>

<p>My name is Lane Simonian. I am an historian. Seven years ago when my aunt and cousin were in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease and my mother was in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, I began searching for ways to prevent and treat the disease. As an historian, I began to collect a mass of abstracts and articles in an attempt to tell the story of Alzheimer's disease. At first with a limited background in biology, I made very slow progress in understanding Alzheimer's. Now, though, I can explain almost every new finding in regards to the disease with the attached hypothesis. What used to take me months to figure out now usually only takes a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>The critical finding in regards to Alzheimer's disease was made by Mark Smith and his colleagues in 1997: Peroxynitrite-mediated damage is widespread in Alzheimer's disease. This damage includes the oxidation (loss of electrons and hydrogen) of glucose transport systems, choline transport systems, the enzyme cholineacetyltransferase, g protein-coupled receptors (muscarinic, serotonin, dopamine, olfactory, adrenergic), the nitration of tau proteins, lipid peroxidation, and the influx of calcium. This damage results in a lack of focus and energy, impaired short-term memory due to a shortage of acetylcholine, disturbed sleep and mood, lack of awareness, impaired smell, behavioral problems (in some instances), disrupted neurotransmission, damage to cellular membranes, and neuronal cell death.</p>
<p>The factors that lead to peroxynitriteformation include (but again are not limited to) high glucose levels, high blood pressure, the APOE4 gene, presenilin gene mutations, bisphosphonate osteoporosis drugs, late estrogen replacment therapy, mercury, aluminum fluoride, and stress. Most or all of the factors that lead to peroxynitrite formation also lead to Alzheimer's disease (the connection has not been made as of yet between bisphosphonateosteoporosis drugs and Alzheimer's disease, but the fact that the numbers of cases of Alzheimer's disease has skyrocketed since the introduction of these drugs is perhaps concerning).</p>
<p>Phenolic compounds in various fruits, vegetables, spices, and essential oils and polyunsatured fats inhibit peroxynitrite formation and thus inhibit the development of Alzheimer's disease. The most direct and concentrated way to deliver phenolic compounds to the brain is through aromatherapy with essential oils high in phenoliccompounds.</p>
<p>An impressive number of animal studies, case studies, and clinical trials indicate that Alzheimer's disease can be treated effectively with peroxynitrite scavengers (compounds that are hydrogen donors convert peroxynitrites into a nitrogen dioxide anion and water). These scavengers partially reverse or prevent all of the damage done by peroxynitrites listed above (for example, they add hydrogen back to muscarinicreceptors allowing more choline to enter cells). In the reference section of the attached hypothesis you will find a partial list of peroxynitrite scavengers (most of them are phenolic compounds) which have helped correct cognitive deficits in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. These include rosmarinic acid, grape seed extract, cinnamon extract, eugenol in Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil, and thymol and carvacrolin Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil. In addition, Jimbo and colleagues in Japan were able to improve cognitive function in dementia patients after giving them rosemary and lemon to smell in the morning and lavender and orange to smell in the evening for 28 days. Akhondzadeh and his colleagues achieved similar results using tinctures of sage and lemon balm essential oils for four months. One reviewer looking at this (and perhaps other clinical trials) concluded "excellent results have been obtained with peroxynitrite scavengers, with reversals of Alzheimer's disease in human clinical trials being repeatedly demonstrated."</p>
<p>Several case studies add further validity to the findings from animal studies and clinical trials. Dramatic improvements in alertness and awareness and modest improvements in short-term memory have been noted. In my mother's case she recognizes her home again, feels comfortable around her brother who she used to think was an impostor, sleeps through the night, can recall her name and sometimes spell it, can sometimes remember the order of days and months, can complete phrases such as I scream, you scream, we all scream for...ice cream and April showers...bring May flowers, and is much more alert and aware than she was four years ago before we began aromatherapy.</p>
<p>Essential oils high in methoxyphenols (such as rosemary, sage, thyme, oregano, clove, and cinnamon leaf) and citrus based essential oils appear to work the best. The patient can smell them under each nostril for a few seconds. It takes about a month to begin seeing some improvement (perhaps because it takes time to reverse the damage that peroxynitrtes do to smell).</p>
<p>Let me highlight the critical points:</p>
<ul><li>Peroxynitrite-mediated damage is widespread in Alzheimer's disease and directly or indirectly causes all the features of the disease.</li>
<li>Most or all of the factors that lead to peroxynitrite formation can cause Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Compound which inhibit peroxynitriteformation inhibit the onset of Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>In animal studies, clinical trials, and case studies, peroxynitrite scavengers have lead to improvements in cognitive function.</li>
<li>Phenolic compounds can be used both to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease. In both cases, aromatherapy is likely the most effective way to deliver these compounds to the brain.</li>
<li>This disease can be treated effectively immediately with few side effects.</li>
</ul><p>I wish you good luck in your work. If the opportunity arises, I would like to meet each of you in person. In the meantime, please feel free to contact me. Nothing pleases me more when I receive questions from people interested in my research.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Hypothesis for Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The three factors which increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease are high levels of myo-inositol (a precursor to phosphatidylinostiol 4, 5 biphosphate), increased phospholipase C gamma activity (whose substrate is phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 biphosphate) and the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3/AKT pathway (the PI3 kinase converts phosphatidylinostiol 4,5 biphosphate into phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 triphosphate). Factors which increase myo-inositol levels are high glucose levels (due to the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate into myo-inositol), high blood pressure (due to the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter), and Down syndrome (because people with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome containing the sodium/myo-inositol transporter). Factors which reduce levels of myo-inositol are certain blood pressure medications, certain diabetes medications, estrogen, tamoxifen, lithium, and scyllo-inositol. Factors that increase phospholipase C gamma are glucose, estrogen, and angiotensin II (a cause of high blood pressure). Factors which lower phospholipase C gamma activity are fish oil (and other polyunsaturated fats) and phenols in various fruits, vegetables, spices, and essential oils. Factors that prevent or inhibit the activation of the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway are presenilin gene mutations, APOE4, and bisphosphonate osteoporosis drugs. Insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and drugs which increase high density lipids can to a limited degree stimulate this pathway. These are the main risk factors and preventative measures for Alzheimer's diseas</p>
<p>e Phospholipase C gamma increases the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (via inositol 1, 4, 5 triphosphate) which in turn stimulates Protein Kinase C. Protein Kinase C processes the amyloid precursor protein and a calcium dependent enzyme cleaves this protein to form amyloid plaques. Phospholipase C gamma exports zinc and zinc and copper are entombed in the amyloid plaques. This results in higher levels of homocysteine and a decline in the superoxidase dismutase which converts the superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide. Protein kinase C increases choline uptake (and phospholipase C beta) and phospholipase C gamma increasing the number of plaques created. Homocysteine via Protein Kinase C increases the production of the superoxide anion and inducible nitric oxide. The two combine to form peroxynitrites.</p>
<p>The effects of peroxynitrites are as follows:</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites lower levels of intracellular magnesium which allows more calcium into the cells via the now open gate of the NMDA receptor.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites cause lipid peroxidation (including the final product of lipid peroxidation--HNE)</p>
<p>The combination of peroxynitrites, HNE, and calcium influx leads to neuronal cell death. Peroxynitrites oxidize g-protein coupled receptors and nitrate tyrosine. The result is the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Moreover, peroxynitrites nitrate tau proteins preventing them from being reconstituted for proper neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize choline transport systems, muscarinic receptors (a g protein-coupled receptor involved in the uptake of choline), and the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, thus resulting in a critical shortage of acetylcholine which is needed for the retrieval of short-term memories.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize a series of other g-protein coupled receptors including olfactory, serotonin, and dopamine receptors. The results respectively are impaired smell, poor sleep and depression, and lethargy and apathy.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize glucose transporters resulting in a lack of energy and focus.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites can be scavenged using phenolic compounds (one or more OH groups). Phenols in essential oils can be breathed directly into the hippocampus via aromatherapy. They accomplish the following conversion (ONOO- + 2H+ + 2 electrons--&gt;NO<sub>2</sub>- + H<sub>2</sub> 0). Essential oils add hydrogen back to g-protein coupled receptors and partially reverse the nitration of tyrosine (including tyrosine residues on tau proteins). They thus partially reverse many if not all of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's has a very simple and avoidable cause: steam-refined polyunsaturated vegetable oils. I have been working this out since 1990.</p>
<p>The unsuspected vitamin E deficiency in these widely consumed food oils leads to brain cell membrane oxidation, that impairs the function of important enzymes that normally degrade the beta-amyloid protein. This protein therefore accumulates, incredibly slowly, in the brain of a regular consumer of deodorized vegetable seed oils.</p>
<p>After the age of 65 or so, accumulated beta-amyloidmay release highly toxic soluble aggregates (called oligomers), that are the immediate cause of synaptic toxicity and neuronal death.</p>
<p>That is exactly how over 5 million Americans have ended up with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>My suggestion to your Government, is simply to legislate a requirement for all refined seed oils in your country to have any vitamin E deficit (usually 30%) corrected before distribution and sale. This simple step will also prevent ADHD occurring during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Already, this basic preventive step is under consideration by the Australian Government's Food Standards Authority, and we may be the first nation in the world to eliminate the twin brain epidemics of Alzheimer's and its prenatal partner, ADHD.</p>
<p>The USA--where vacuum steam-refining of seed oils was invented, in 1899 (David Wesson, Savannah)--has no shortage of brain power. What you lack is a safe level of vitamin E in your brain-oxidizing vegetable oils.</p>
<p>Can you fix the problem, and catch up with Australia?</p>
<p>When your Norfolk, Virginia shipyards were mass-producing Liberty ships for WW2 Atlantic convoys, a large banner was hung across the docks, saying:</p>
<p>IT CAN AND WILL BE DONE!!</p>
<p>Can you make vegetable oils safe? Can you do this too?</p>
<p>I attach a draft hypothesis for your inspection: I shall be trimming it down shortly, for submission to The Lancet, in London.</p>
<p>Here, at long last, is the direct cause of the disease: knowing this, we can easily prevent it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Disease And Attention Deficit Disorder May Share A Single Cause: Refined Vegetable Oil</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>By Dr Robert Peers, General Practitioner, North Carlton, MELBOURNE</strong></p>
<p>In 1990 I identified a potential cause of typical late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), reporting my findings (a small case/control study) in a letter to the New Zealand Medical Journal [Ref 1] in 1993 (letter: "Alzheimer's Disease And Vegetable Oils"). I found that 12 cases of diagnosed AD had all consumed refined polyunsaturated seed oils for many years, contrasting with 20 age-matched control subjects with good memories, none of whom used such oils.</p>
<p>The reason for seeking a dietary cause was simple and compelling: AD had been seen to sometimes affect only one of a pair of identical twins [Ref 2], a striking finding that points strongly to some toxic or dietary cause. In addition, it was very unlikely to be caused by ageing itself, since the other twin was the same age, but remained unaffected in the long term; and because most older people do not in fact get the disease. I reasoned that those who were affected were somehow getting it from their diet, but how?</p>
<p>My initial reading even disclosed a likely dietary suspect: Professor Scott Henderson, an Australian research psychiatrist, cites in his 1988 AD review/hypothesis paper [Ref 3] a remarkable study [Ref 4] done by Professor Denham Harman in 1976, in Nebraska. Harman had a free radical theory of ageing, and knowing that both seed oils and the brain are rich in oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids, he wondered whether feeding safflower oil to his rats might cause free radical damage to the brain: it certainly did, as his rats soon lost their way in a maze. Furthermore, giving vitamin E to a new group of rats, fed the same oil, prevented these cognitive deficits--a finding that suggests that his oil, and perhaps other seed oils too, were low in vitamin E.</p>
<p>This work made me very curious about common vegetable seed oils, which were well known to reduce cholesterol and heart disease risk, but nobody had previously suspected them of actually causing a disease, and here they were evidently oxidizing the brain!</p>
<p>Soon after setting out on my library search for a dietary factor in 1990, I discovered that deodorized seed oils lose about a third of their antioxidant vitamin E during refining [Ref 5]--a potentially serious deficiency not seen in the soft margarines made from the same oils, which suffer polyunsaturate losses during hydrogenation, restoring the vitamin E/polyunsaturate balance. I realized immediately how important this deficiency would be in the brain, whose nerve cell membranes are very rich in highly oxidizable long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>Since the main function of vitamin E is to protect these vulnerable essential fatty acids against oxidation, a low level of vitamin E in the nerve cell membrane would invite cerebral "lipid peroxidation". Oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids breaks up the fatty acid chain, and among the fragments are neurotoxic aldehyde molecules.</p>
<p>Oxidized Omega-6 fatty acids, in particular, release the highly reactive aldehyde 4-hydroxy nonenal (4-HNE), whose toxic effects on nerve synapses may account for the faulty memory seen in "Seed Oil Syndrome", described below. But 4-HNE does more than that: it activates a key enzyme involved in AD development, and may also--more importantly--mediate the impaired beta-amyloid clearance caused by cerebral lipid peroxidation.</p>
<p>Elena Tamagno, in Turin, has shown [Ref 6], in recent years, that 4- HNE indirectly activates the pivotal AD enzyme beta-secretase (BACE 1), a small rise in the activity of which causes a sharp increase in betaamyloid formation [S Cole, Ref 7]. Beta-amyloid is a peptide--a small protein fragment--that is the molecular cause of AD, as in rare genetic cases, where a gene mutation increases the production of a more toxic form of this peptide (the longer form, with 42 aminoacids, rather than the 40 residues seen in the much less toxic and more abundant form).</p>
<p>Although small amounts of this important protein fragment are produced in the normal brain, it is easily cleared away by degrading enzymes, and it can also exit the brain through the blood-brain barrier. However, people consuming refined vegetable oil will be forming increased beta-amyloid in abnormal oxidizing conditions, that may damage the clearance mechanism, resulting in progressive betapeptide accumulation and, ultimately, Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>One possibility is that lipid peroxidation products, like the same 4-HNE, might inhibit a key clearance enzyme, called Insulin-Degrading Enzyme (which also degrades beta-amyloid). In fact, an amyloid clearance problem is all that is required to cause AD, since even a mild over-production of beta-amyloid--as I postulate above--may still be successfully cleared.</p>
<p>So my theory does require a clearance defect, whether or not amyloid production is increased. And now, in 2009, Dr Y Nishida in Japan has shown [Ref 8] that by blocking vitamin E transport to mouse brain, lipid membrane peroxidation ensues, which impairs beta-amyloid clearance, by somehow reducing the expression of the gene coding for the above Insulin-Degrading Enzyme. Vitamin E-depleted seed oils, likewise, lower vitamin E levels in most tissues, causing lipid peroxidation [Y H Wang, Ref 9], which must include the brain, as shown by the early cognitive deficits seen in Harman's pioneering work (above), and their notable prevention with vitamin E.</p>
<p>Common Omega-6 seed oils, which are usually steam-deodorized, have been linked to cognitive decline in Holland [S Kalmijn, Ref 10], and also in Greece [D Psaltopoulou, Ref 11]), and to over double the risk of incident dementia (70% being AD) in the prospective "Three Cities Study" in France [P Barberger-Gateau, Ref 12]. Processed safflower oil, as discussed above, was shown many years ago (1976!) to cause memory faults in rats, which could be prevented with vitamin E. For some reason, Dr Harman did not alert the US food safety authorities to this alarming discovery.</p>
<p>Low vitamin E levels in corn, soya and safflower oils were first demonstrated by Dr David Herting in Rochester, New York State (Ref 5--see "herting d and 1963" on <a href="http://www.pubmed.gov">http://www.pubmed.gov</a>, to find and download his free Journal of Nutrition paper). He concluded that widespread vitamin E deficiency would occur in populations consuming processed polyunsaturated seed oils. However, he did not realize the extreme peroxidation vulnerability of the brain and retina, where reduced vitamin E levels mean rapid lipid peroxidation of long-chain Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, in synapses and in retinal rod cell disc membranes. Had he known this, he could have predicted a new disease of the brain, with the further possibility of a new childhood brain disorder, arising in the fetal brain during pregnancy.</p>
<p>It was precisely these most vulnerable tissues that were tragically ignored in the landmark nutritional study, completed in 1960 in Illinois, on which current recommended daily intake of vitamin E is based [Ref 13]. Although lead investigator Dr Max Horwitt should have been aware of the brain's rich concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (mentioned, for example, in 1950s biochemistry texts), he judged vitamin E requirement exclusively by testing the fragility of red blood cell membranes in vitamin E-deprived human subjects, finding even greater fragility when the subjects were given vitamin E-stripped corn oil.</p>
<p>It did not occur to Horwitt to ask his vitamin E-deprived subjects about higher mental functions like memory or mood. Memory difficulties (and glare sensitivity and night-blindness from retinal damage) are likely to occur long before the red cell test becomes positive in response to gradual dietary vitamin E depletion, because the oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids are much less concentrated in the red cell membrane, than in retina and brain. Lipid peroxidation is a very rapid chain-reaction, that proceeds much faster in a vitamin E-depleted cell membrane containing a high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially when those fatty acids--as in brain and retina--are of the long-chain variety, full of oxidizable double bonds.</p>
<p>To his credit, Horwitt did realize that the main function of vitamin E is to protect polyunsaturated fatty acids, so he based the recommended daily intake on the ratio of vitamin E to the intake of these fatty acids. He assumed that higher polyunsaturate intake, for example seed oil, would automatically mean higher vitamin E intake, but neglected the possibility that processed seed oils might lose some of this vitamin E during refining, and so cause some new disease specifically involving tissues prone to lipid peroxidation.</p>
<p>Indeed, he failed to pursue this possibility, even when he found that some members of staff at the Elgin Mental Hospital, who were not on the vitamin E deficient test diet, also had an abnormal red cell test. He did not ask himself how that could have happened, but could have taken a dietary history, and might have discovered that they were consumers of common vegetable oils, which could therefore have had something in common with his experimental stripped corn oil: low content of vitamin E. He may then have gone on to investigate the vitamin E content of such oils, and found it to be low--as David Herting found three years later, in 1963. Had Horwitt detected mild memory faults in consumers of refined seed oils, and set himself to do a little thinking, he could have nipped Alzheimer's in the bud, in 1960.</p>
<p>Any child, young person or adult consuming refined seed oils will report, if asked, memory problems, poor dark adaptation and glare sensitivity (photophobia--which is irreversible). I discovered this syndrome in general practice, and I call it Seed Oil Syndrome, and it probably reflects 4-HNE neurotoxicity in the synapses. Lipid peroxidation, which in the long term causes impaired beta-amyloid clearance, has early clinical effects due to synaptic damage: 4-HNE impairs neuronal glucose uptake, among other effects.</p>
<p>I have seen this hitherto undescribed syndrome in 100s of oil-using patients in family practice, over many years. The memory responds well to vitamin E (I sometimes add fish oil, for a faster response), except after the age of 50 or so, when subjects report long-term stability of memory, without actual improvement.</p>
<p>I am hoping that these cases, who, after some 20-30 years of refined oil exposure, may have a significant brain amyloid load, will not progress to AD, once off seed oils, and using olive oil, vitamin E and fish oil supplement. I also have some of them on Inositol, a seed sugar known to neutralize toxic Abeta oligomers [Ref 14] and improve language and orientation in established AD [Ref 15].</p>
<p>This simple glucose isomer, which is easily obtained in the diet (from grains, nuts, legumes, soymilk, cantaloupe and citrus), may prove to be a powerful weapon--along with cessation of refined-oil exposure-- in preventing Seed Oil Syndrome progressing slowly to Mild Cognitive Impairment and, ultimately, diagnosed AD. Given the extensive neuronal damage already evident in these two later stages, ultra-early prevention is now thought to be the only way to stop this disease, and nutrition--if it can do the job--is far preferable to preventive drugs.</p>
<p>From the public health angle, all cases of Seed Oil Syndrome--which is easily identified by symptoms and diet history--should change to olive oil (or any cold-pressed oil), eat a high.Inositol diet (even citrus juice is very rich in Inositol), and preferably take fish-oil capsules as well.</p>
<p>Saturated fat intake from butter, cream, cheese, fatty meat, pastries etc., must also be reduced, for it commonly causes co-morbid vascular dementia in the Alzheimer victim.</p>
<p>Inositol, given as a higher dose (5 gm/day) via supplement, also reverses anxiety disorder and depression [Ref 16], which affect perhaps 40% of AD cases. Anxiety alone doubles the risk of progressing from Mild Cognitive Impairment to AD [Ref 17], possibly because of cortisol-induced hippocampal damage, low Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor levels and poor hippocampal neurogenesis. Depression, often resulting from anxiety plus fatty diet, may increase inflammation--pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin 1-beta may aggravate neuronal damage and increase stress axis activation even further. Anti-anxiety doses of Inositol also have a place here, by greatly decreasing stress-induced comfort-eating of fatty foods like chocolate, cheese, cakes and pastries [author's clinical observations].</p>
<p>One extra benefit from Inositol in brain disease is its unexpected antiageing effect [Ref 18], a possible example of which is the NIH 31 grain-rich mouse diet, that prolongs the median lifespan of female mice by 25% [Ref 19]. By altering the same genes that are altered by caloric restriction--including the key mitochondrial biogenesis gene PGC 1 alpha--Inositol is clearly a caloric restriction mimetic, with the same potential as dietary restriction to provide neurotrophic, antioxidant and energizing benefits in brain, as described by nutritional neuroscientist Mark Mattson [Ref 20]. Already, a multiple sclerosis animal model has been found to respond well to caloric restriction [Ref 21]: Inositol is a more practical intervention.</p>
<p>Variations in AD incidence around the world (low in West Africa, very high in Wadi Ara Arabs in Israel, 4 times higher in Pittsburgh than in Ballabgarh, Northern India) probably reflect local patterns of refined seed oil consumption. In Northern India, unrefined traditional oils are still very popular (eg. pungent mustard oil, crude peanut oil), and in the South there is mostly coconut oil and crude peanut oil--and possibly an even lower AD rate.</p>
<p>Refined oils are, however, encroaching on these traditional markets. Palm oil is the main cooking oil in Malaysia and Indonesia, where AD rates may be low, but in the US and Europe--and the Middle East too-- refined oils are the rule, apart from those people lucky enough to still use mainly olive oil. A study in Bari, Italy, some years ago, showed cognitive decline in older subjects not using olive oil [Ref 22]; they were apparently using common refined supermarket seed oils, which are widely used in Italy for frying.</p>
<p>An oil that causes a serious brain disease in adult life might also be expected to affect the fetal brain: when asking many oil-using patients about symptoms of Seed Oil Syndrome, I have noticed--as a family doctor--that young adults with the syndrome frequently have children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). I proceeded to do a pilot case/control study on retrospective pregnancy diet, in 80 cases versus 80 controls.</p>
<p>Almost all (78) of the mothers of ADHD cases gave a history of regular consumption of refined seed oils during all or part of the pregnancy, often from fried takeaway food. All of these mothers had permanent glare sensitivity (most carried sunglasses, usually perched conveniently on their head), and those who still consumed these oils had ongoing memory difficulties and impaired night vision.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have met young adults with residual ADHD, who report that their mother, if still using such oils, and now in her mid- to lateforties, has an obvious memory problem. The Scottish breath-analysis scientist Brian Ross has found evidence of lipid peroxidation (increased breath ethane gas) in some children with ADHD [Ref 23], probably due to ongoing childhood exposure to the same refined seed oils that caused their condition during gestation.</p>
<p>In my child patients, such further exposure significantly worsens the ADHD, by increasing cognitive problems, mood issues, aggression and impulsivity--all of which improve rapidly by stopping the exposure and recommending fish oil, to assist synaptic recovery and plasticity. Not only does fish oil work faster when refined oils are first excluded from the diet (to prevent peroxidative destruction of the fish oil fatty acids in vitamin E-depleted synapses), but the synaptic benefits of fish oil may be greatly enhanced by adding two more "synaptic building blocksh--uridine and choline--as proposed for Alzheimer's, by nutritional neuroscientist Dr Richard Wurtman, at the Massachusets Institute of Technology [Ref 24]. Uridine sources include brewer's yeast, broccoli and beetroot, while choline is found in egg, chicken, lecithin and wheat germ. Wurtman's "Souvenaid" synapse-restoring mixture, which increases synaptic density and cognitive function in gerbil rats, does improve Alzheimer symptoms, and may work even better in the developing ADHD brain of a young child, to the extent that usual medications for the latter disorder may become obsolete, due to advances in brain nutrition.</p>
<p>I believe there is enough evidence available to conclude that deodorized seed oils are a major public health hazard, being directly responsible for ADHD, widespread Seed Oil Syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease. I notice in my clinic that Seed Oil Syndrome causes depression and irritability in anxious subjects, and aggravates ADHD in children and adolescents, promoting delinquency, serious aggression, antisocial behaviour, and substance abuse. These problems are now endemic in Western cities, and increasing world-wide.</p>
<p>Correction of all such brain peroxidation problems is very simple: to protect their citizens, while at the same time keeping these heartfriendly oils available, governments must be persuaded to pass laws requiring that all deodorized seed oils be rendered safe, with respect to their vitamin E content, before being sold. Natural vitamin E can 8 easily be recovered from the steam distillate at the food oil refinery, and replaced in the deodorized oil: or synthetic vitamin E could be used instead. Urgent action is required.</p>
<p>The highly desirable result of fixing this seed oil catastrophe would be to eliminate the twin epidemics of Alzheimer's and ADHD, along with the alarming antisocial effects of refined seed oils, as specified above.</p>

<p>I think that the most urgent problem in Alzheimer's research is the need for a soul-searching by policymakers for a correct perception of the disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer research has been misled by hypes and illusions for too long. We believe that the ultimate strategy to delay it and ameliorate its social impact will take two basic approaches. First, motivate society as a whole to supports the elderly for better social connections and healthy lifestyles; and second, develop medications to extend the lifespan of old neurons by activating their lifeline metabolisms, rather than "inhibiting" the farfetched "causal" factors as widely believed today.</p>
<p>Please see our recent article (attached) in which the rationale for this strategy is discussed.</p>

<p>I have two questions: will there be public comment at any or all of the advisory council meetings and what would be the best way to communicate with members of the committee?</p>
<p>Based on animal model studies, clinical trials, and case studies (including my mother), I know how to treat this disease and likely how to delay its onset. In the hypothesis, you will find references that show that peroxynitrite-mediated damage is widespread in Alzheimer's disease and that this damage can partially be corrected with peroxynitrite scavengers. Some of the most effective scavengers are methoxyphenols (eugenol,thymol, and carvacrol) in various essential oils (such as cinnamon leaf, clove, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and sage) in part because they can be inhaled directly into to the part of the brain affected by Alzheimer's disease: the hippocampus.</p>
<p>With some help from this committee, it is likely that Alzheimer's disease could be effectively treated within this next year.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Hypothesis for Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The three factors which increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease are high levels of myo-inositol (a precursor to phosphatidylinostiol 4, 5 biphosphate), increased phospholipase C gamma activity (whose substrate is phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 biphosphate) and the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3/AKT pathway (the PI3 kinase converts phosphatidylinostiol 4,5 biphosphate into phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 triphosphate). Factors which increase myo-inositol levels are high glucose levels (due to the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate into myo-inositol), high blood pressure (due to the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter), and Down syndrome (because people with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome containing the sodium/myo-inositol transporter). Factors which reduce levels of myo-inositol are certain blood pressure medications, certain diabetes medications, estrogen, tamoxifen, lithium, and scyllo-inositol. Factors that increase phospholipase C gamma are glucose, estrogen, and angiotensin II (a cause of high blood pressure). Factors which lower phospholipase C gamma activity are fish oil (and other polyunsaturated fats) and phenols in various fruits, vegetables, spices, and essential oils. Factors that prevent or inhibit the activation of the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway are presenilin gene mutations, APOE4, and bisphosphonate osteoporosis drugs. Insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and drugs which increase high density lipids can to a limited degree stimulate this pathway. These are the main risk factors and preventative measures for Alzheimer's diseas</p>
<p>e Phospholipase C gamma increases the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (via inositol 1, 4, 5 triphosphate) which in turn stimulates Protein Kinase C. Protein Kinase C processes the amyloid precursor protein and a calcium dependent enzyme cleaves this protein to form amyloid plaques. Phospholipase C gamma exports zinc and zinc and copper are entombed in the amyloid plaques. This results in higher levels of homocysteine and a decline in the superoxidase dismutase which converts the superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide. Protein kinase C increases choline uptake (and phospholipase C beta) and phospholipase C gamma increasing the number of plaques created. Homocysteine via Protein Kinase C increases the production of the superoxide anion and inducible nitric oxide. The two combine to form peroxynitrites.</p>
<p>The effects of peroxynitrites are as follows:</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites lower levels of intracellular magnesium which allows more calcium into the cells via the now open gate of the NMDA receptor.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites cause lipid peroxidation (including the final product of lipid peroxidation--HNE)</p>
<p>The combination of peroxynitrites, HNE, and calcium influx leads to neuronal cell death. Peroxynitrites oxidize g-protein coupled receptors and nitrate tyrosine. The result is the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Moreover, peroxynitrites nitrate tau proteins preventing them from being reconstituted for proper neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize choline transport systems, muscarinic receptors (a g protein-coupled receptor involved in the uptake of choline), and the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, thus resulting in a critical shortage of acetylcholine which is needed for the retrieval of short-term memories.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize a series of other g-protein coupled receptors including olfactory, serotonin, and dopamine receptors. The results respectively are impaired smell, poor sleep and depression, and lethargy and apathy.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize glucose transporters resulting in a lack of energy and focus.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites can be scavenged using phenolic compounds (one or more OH groups). Phenols in essential oils can be breathed directly into the hippocampus via aromatherapy. They accomplish the following conversion (ONOO- + 2H+ + 2 electrons--&gt;NO<sub>2</sub>- + H<sub>2</sub> 0). Essential oils add hydrogen back to g-protein coupled receptors and partially reverse the nitration of tyrosine (including tyrosine residues on tau proteins). They thus partially reverse many if not all of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
