    <p>As this Primer has frequently noted, people experiencing chronic homelessness and those who have spent years living on the streets and in shelters before moving into PSH often have complex co-occurring health conditions. These include chronic medical conditions as well as mental health and/or substance use disorders. Some have cognitive impairments that result from brain injuries, substance use, or other health conditions, and many have experienced trauma and toxic levels of stress that have had significant long-term health consequences. Their circumstances call for mechanisms that coordinate and integrate care for physical, mental, and substance use conditions and incorporate links to housing and coordination with staff that can provide the supports that help people maintain that housing.</p>
<p>Many Medicaid beneficiaries who have not had the misfortune to be homeless also experience this complex pattern of health conditions and would benefit from similar coordinating and integrating mechanisms. Attention to housing circumstances as part of the package is not misplaced for this larger group of beneficiaries with complex conditions, as their housing circumstances could change in ways that would put their health and health care at risk. Some beneficiaries could leave institutional care in nursing facilities or IMDs once they are able to access supportive housing in the community; others could lose a caregiver or no longer be able to maintain independent living. Care coordination and service integration will have the greatest impact if it includes a commitment to assure housing stability with supports as needed to maintain and improve health conditions.</p>
<p>The approaches described earlier in this Primer are primarily mechanisms for coordinating and integrating care for physical, mental, and substance use conditions. Development of these mechanisms has been spurred by the increasingly widespread recognition that, for people with complex needs, such integration is needed. Integrated care helps lead to better health outcomes, better care experiences for patients or clients, and care that is more cost-effective. The current state of the issue can be summed up as follows:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Many useful approaches are being pioneered; using Medicaid to serve people experiencing chronic homelessness and PSH tenants is complicated, but it can be done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medicaid will not cover everything, but it can support various services needed by PSH tenants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many types of Medicaid providers--managed care organizations, FQHCs, behavioral health providers, and ACOs--are playing important roles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conditions are ripe for improving care coordination and services integration, but achieving these goals will take the work of many parties. Some communities are already seeing the benefits from Medicaid expansion, both from Medicaid covering individuals who are homeless and from local resources being freed up to fund PSH programs.</p>

          8.1. Making Changes, From Small Steps to Comprehensive Redesign      </h4>

              <p>People experiencing chronic homelessness or living in PSH are part of the larger group of Medicaid beneficiaries with the most complex co-occurring health conditions. They are the most vulnerable to negative outcomes and most likely to incur avoidable costs for crisis services if they receive inadequate and uncoordinated care. People with histories of chronic homelessness have added difficulties with building trust and engaging in services, and the added need for a strong focus on housing acquisition and stability. In thinking about changes to a state's Medicaid program to facilitate delivery of appropriate services to this group, it would be important to plan for the needs of the larger group of people with chronic and disabling health conditions and co-occurring behavioral health disorders, with special attention to housing and engagement for those who are or have been chronically homeless. With appropriate modifications to Medicaid state plans, Medicaid could cover the costs of many of the services needed for this group of beneficiaries. In turn, effective integrated services linked to housing for people who have experienced chronic homelessness could help to achieve savings to the Medicaid program by reducing avoidable hospitalizations and facilitating more appropriate use of other Medicaid-covered services.</p>
<p>For the group of people who are or have been chronically homeless, positive outcomes have been demonstrated by approaches that link medical care, behavioral health care, and supports to housing stability. These approaches focus on engaging and building trust with the most vulnerable people to help them get and keep housing and receive the care they need to manage their health needs. Effective program models incorporate recognition of housing as a social determinant of health. Efforts within Medicaid programs to align benefits, eligibility requirements, qualified service delivery personnel, service delivery sites, and payment mechanisms would promote integration by making it easier for providers to be paid for serving this population and removing current obstacles to integrated care. Risk adjustment and other incentives may be needed to make it feasible for health plans and provider networks to focus on the most high-cost, high-need individuals, for whom there are the greatest opportunities for achieving savings and improving outcomes.</p>
<p>To help state Medicaid officials working toward a more aligned system and greater integration, the Center for Integrated Health Solutions, co-funded by SAMHSA and HRSA, identified a set of promising approaches to integrating physical and behavioral health care that range from small steps to major system change.<sup><a href="primer-using-medicaid-people-experiencing-chronic-homelessness-and-tenants-permanent-21.html#note108">108</a></sup> The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured has released an issue brief based on that report, highlighting five promising approaches ranging from those that are relatively simple to adapt to more ambitious levels of system redesign.<sup><a href="primer-using-medicaid-people-experiencing-chronic-homelessness-and-tenants-permanent-21.html#note109">109</a></sup> Most of these approaches are being used in one or more case study sites, as reported earlier in this Primer.</p>
<p>The five approaches described in the Kaiser Commission brief that are currently being modeled in Medicaid case studies aimed at better integrating physical and behavioral health care, are described below:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b><i>Universal Screening</i></b>. Integrated care begins with screening patients for conditions in addition to the ones they present for. A number of evidence-based tools are available for primary care providers to use to easily screen for behavioral health disorders. Routine screening for common medical conditions among adults with behavioral health conditions can be accomplished by providing behavioral health practitioners with basic equipment like a scale, a blood pressure cuff, and a stethoscope, along with training in how to use them. Early identification of conditions helps to prevent or mitigate their progression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Navigators</i></b>. Even when individuals get screened for other conditions and referred for care, obtaining the recommended services can be challenging. Some state programs or managed care plans are deploying a new cadre of "navigators," who may be nurses, social workers, or trained paraprofessionals, to help beneficiaries navigate the health care system. Navigators' functions can range from simply helping individuals to seek care, to interacting with their health care providers on their behalf, to improving home and community-based support for their clients. Navigators also foster patient engagement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Co-Location</i></b>. Geographic distance between physical and behavioral health provider settings can itself be a significant barrier to coordinated care. Some Health Centers and community behavioral health service providers are leaders in the "co-location" of physical and behavioral health care. Medicaid's system of prospective, cost-based payment for Health Centers supports this model because the costs of licensed behavioral health practitioners can be included in the calculation of Health Centers' prospective rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Health Homes</i></b>. A growing number of states are using the Medicaid "health home" option, established by the Affordable Care Act, to advance the integration of physical and behavioral health care for Medicaid beneficiaries with SMI. Health home services, which are eligible for a 90 percent federal match for two years (100 percent for those who enrolled under the expansion of Medicaid eligibility), include comprehensive care management, transitional care, referral to community and social services, and other services to foster integrated care for people with complex conditions and needs. Community mental health centers are one natural choice to be designated health home providers for Medicaid beneficiaries with SMI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>System-Level Integration of Care</i></b>. System-level integration of services and fiscal accountability underpins truly person-centered, holistic care and represents the most advanced model on the integration continuum. A fully integrated system for Medicaid beneficiaries is one that directly provides and is at financial risk for the entire complement of acute physical and behavioral health services covered by Medicaid.</p>

          8.2. The Focus of State Change Efforts      </h4>
    </a>
    
      <ul class="collapsibleChild level5" id="ajax-target-node-54506">
        
                      <li class="chapter_content without_highlight">
              <p>As more people who have experienced chronic homelessness get enrolled in Medicaid, states, health plans, and Medicaid providers will continue to learn more about their needs, and about opportunities to improve the quality of care and health outcomes for them while also managing costs. States that have expanded Medicaid eligibility will now have in their Medicaid program many newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries who have experienced homelessness and have health care needs that are complicated by substance use disorders and other challenges related to mental health, trauma, isolation, and social service needs.</p>
<p>States and health plans are likely to learn a great deal about the types of services and supports that can help people engage in appropriate health care services, manage chronic health conditions, and reduce risky behaviors to achieve better health outcomes and avoid unnecessary hospitalizations. As they do so, they may want to consider making changes to the benefits and services included in their Medicaid programs, or request federal approval for waivers to develop and implement new approaches to health care that include coverage for diversionary services and tenancy supports. These approaches can achieve better outcomes while also controlling costs.</p>
<p>Often the benefits that states provide through their Medicaid programs are fragmented, in part because benefits have been added or modified by different administrators and stakeholders over a period of decades. This may result in different payment mechanisms for each piece of the package of services and supports needed by people who have experienced chronic homelessness, or gaps in Medicaid reimbursement for some of the services that are needed by this population and delivered in PSH. Many states have established separate benefits and program rules for Medicaid-covered medical care and treatment for mental health and substance use disorders. Often there are separate delivery systems and administrative structures associated with these Medicaid-covered services. To make innovative practices work within the Medicaid framework, states will need to examine, and likely modify, service definitions, medical necessity criteria, and specifications of which people can deliver which services and in which settings to make the services Medicaid-reimbursable.</p>
<p>Fragmentation of benefit design, program rules, financial responsibility, and delivery systems create challenges to delivering integrated, person-centered care for people with complex, co-occurring disorders, including people who have experienced chronic homelessness. State policymakers and Medicaid program officials recognize these challenges. Some are working on innovative approaches to support pilot programs or performance requirements that create more opportunities and incentives for health care providers and delivery systems to establish coordination mechanisms.</p>
<p>For example, states may require Medicaid managed care plans that are responsible for medical care to establish written agreements with counties or managed care plans that are responsible for Medicaid-covered mental health and substance use disorder services. These agreements can facilitate information sharing among the health plans and providers that work with the same Medicaid beneficiaries. This information sharing can be an important starting point for better care. For example, health care providers who prescribe medications or help a patient manage chronic medical conditions can make better clinical decisions if they know about other medications prescribed by a mental health provider.</p>
<p>States could require closer collaboration in the development of plans to provide care to people who receive services in separate systems. For now at least, these arrangements often focus on facilitating referrals, providing authorization for care and reimbursement, and limited information sharing among providers. These arrangements do not usually include mechanisms to support the integration of ongoing care by a multi-disciplinary team of providers working together to serve the same people. As states consider new approaches to care coordination, often in collaboration with Medicaid managed care health plans, there will be more opportunities to align and adapt benefits and payment mechanisms to support innovative approaches that integrate care at the service delivery level through teams or partnerships.</p>
<p>In some states, financial responsibility for the nonfederal share of Medicaid program costs is divided among different government agencies or between states and local governments, and the cost-sharing arrangements are different for medical care, mental health services, services for substance use disorders, and other Medicaid benefits. This can create incentives for cost-shifting, and it can make it difficult to align the incentives of government agencies to achieve overall savings in Medicaid program costs. For example, Medicaid-reimbursed mental health or behavioral health services delivered in PSH are likely to achieve savings in medical costs by reducing avoidable hospitalizations and emergency room visits. However, those impacts may not appear in the same budget that includes costs for the services in PSH. State leadership is often required to support the analysis of overall costs and savings to the Medicaid program and other public systems, and to use this analysis to inform policy decisions.</p>

          8.3. The Need for Flexible Funding and the Role of Local Public and Private Funders      </h4>
    </a>
    
      <ul class="collapsibleChild level5" id="ajax-target-node-54511">
        
                      <li class="chapter_content without_highlight">
              <p>Additional flexible funding is essential to achieve better results for both Medicaid beneficiaries and state Medicaid programs. Medicaid reimbursement can pay for many of the services needed by people with disabilities experiencing chronic homelessness or living in PSH, as well as services that help people experiencing chronic homelessness access housing assistance. But Medicaid will not be able to cover all the activities needed to truly stabilize this population's health conditions and housing situations. To engage some very vulnerable people, including those who have significant untreated mental health or substance use disorders who may be reluctant to seek the care they need, and to support stabilization, it is critically important to have funding that is flexible enough to allow programs truly to do "whatever it takes."  Such funding may come from states, local governments, foundations, and other sources. In addition to Medicaid reimbursement for covered services, other support from public and private funders helps to pay for many of the services and supports without which people cannot get and keep housing.</p>
<p>As states take on the many administrative tasks related to Medicaid eligibility expansion, expanded partnerships with Medicaid managed care plans, and the design and implementation of new types of Medicaid benefits, support from private funders can support the planning, data analysis, and stakeholder engagement that contribute to innovation. In some states, foundations have provided funding to match or leverage state funding commitments that qualify for matching federal funds through the Medicaid program. In other cases, foundation funding has supported data analysis and planning for a state's Medicaid waiver proposal and the design and implementation of new covered benefits.</p>

                      <li class="chapter_content without_highlight">
              <p>For their clients and patients to benefit from these evolving innovations, health care providers and the provider organizations that work with people experiencing chronic homelessness or living in PSH will have to make parallel changes. Those that are not already Medicaid providers will have to become qualified themselves, or partner with agencies that are already Medicaid providers, to deliver and bill for covered services. Several aspects of their current operations may need significant investment to build infrastructure and organizational capacity, including staffing, administrative systems, and ability to produce electronic health records and exchange them securely with other providers serving their clients.</p>
<p>Service providers must make substantial investments in staff credentialing, training, and development; leadership development; and management to make the shift to Medicaid reimbursement if programs have relied on grant funding, fee-for-service, or other forms of Medicaid payment. They will have to implement electronic health records and data management systems that can serve their own purposes and also interact with systems operating at other providers and with Medicaid systems. They will also have to prepare administratively to participate in new Medicaid financing arrangements while simultaneously sustaining programs that rely on existing payment mechanisms. Finally, many will find that they can better serve their clients if they establish partnerships or implement new practice models to deliver more effective and integrated care. Some states and health care providers have received substantial support from foundations to supplement public investments by state and local governments and federal grants to make the investments needed to prepare for the future.</p>

          8.5. Conclusion--Making It Happen      </h4>

      <ul class="collapsibleChild level5" id="ajax-target-node-54521">
        
                      <li class="chapter_content without_highlight">
              <p>If the promise of new and emerging approaches to integrated and cost-effective care for people experiencing chronic homelessness and PSH tenants is to be realized, many aspects of Medicaid state plans will have to be brought into alignment. Service definitions will need to be updated to assure that they can accommodate evidence-based practices and emerging, more integrated models of care, particularly for people who have co-occurring behavioral health and chronic health conditions or other medical needs. The administrative silos in which physical health care, mental health care, and substance use disorder treatment currently reside in many states will have to be breached so service providers can treat people holistically, request payment, and report performance through streamlined and coordinated mechanisms.</p>
<p>Gaps in covered services (e.g., outreach and engagement, collateral contacts, and services that explicitly focus on helping people get and keep housing as a social determinant of health and a driver of health care utilization and costs) will have to be closed to the extent possible under Medicaid, and alternative funding mechanisms identified if possible to fill those gaps. Given the enormous pressures currently facing state Medicaid agencies working to implement changes consistent with Affordable Care Act requirements, in the short term it may not be easy for them to make the time to focus on the needs of the relatively small population of PSH tenants and people still experiencing homelessness who could benefit from PSH.</p>
<p>Although the population of people experiencing chronic homelessness or living in PSH is a very small part of the total Medicaid-eligible population, it is no simple matter to design programs within Medicaid that meet its needs. For this reason, it makes sense to work with other constituencies who need services delivered in their homes and communities to develop care structures that work across a wider range of populations.</p>
<p>In the context of preparing to meet the 2014 requirements of the Affordable Care Act and other major pressures for change, it is remarkable that so many states and health care providers have made it a priority to work on using Medicaid to improve care for people experiencing homelessness, and to find ways to better integrate care and connect housing and services to better serve a small number of the most vulnerable people, including those with the most complex needs. It is not surprising that in some cases this work has moved more slowly and that progress has been more uneven than some might have hoped.</p>
<p>As attention focused on the activities that were most critical to preparing for 2014, stakeholders involved in Medicaid were often reminded that this has been an important deadline for some major activities, but it is not the finish line. While the enrollment of millions of Americans into Medicaid or subsidized insurance coverage began in October 2013 for coverage starting in 2014, the work of ensuring that coverage and care delivery systems work well for the most vulnerable people, including those experiencing homelessness or living in PSH, will require sustained attention in the coming years. This reality makes 2014 a beginning for the next phase of work to achieve the goals of health reform.</p>
