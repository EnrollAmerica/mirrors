<p>Hello and thank you for another opportunity to address the council. On behalf of The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration I would first like to thank the new council members for agreeing to serve as members of the advisory council and contributing their time and expertise to this important project. My name is Matthew Sharp, Program Manager for AFTD. For those who do not already know AFTD, we are the only national non-profit advocacy organization dedicated to frontotemporaldegeneration in all its various forms. AFTD's mission includes: raising public and professional awareness of FTD, supporting research to effectively treat and ultimately cure the disease and improving the quality of life for all people coping with the related dementia, FTD.</p>
<p>AFTD is sorely disappointed that none of the 5 nominees we proposed or supported to serve on the advisory council were selected. However we do appreciate that at least one new council member with expertise in a non-Alzheimer's dementia was selected and are glad Angela Taylor from LBDA has agreed to serve a term on the council. The secretary would be hard-pressed to find a more dedicated, knowledgeable and articulate advocate to represent Lewy Body and the other "related dementias" to advise and inform the National Plan.</p>
<p>Ms. Taylor's selection is an excellent step toward continued inclusion of the non-Alzheimer's dementias in the National Plan. Her perspective and expertise will continue to ensure that NAPA benefits all those affected by dementia.</p>
<p>While we congratulate the Secretary for adding such an excellent advocate to the council AFTD still recognizes the need for additional expertise and perspectives regarding the related dementias and especially FTD. As AFTD and Ms. Taylor suggested at prior council meetings adding a seat on the advisory council specifically for the related dementias is perhaps the simplest way to ensure that all relevant perspectives are brought to bear on the immense task before the council and will help accomplish the ultimate goal of the ending Alzheimer's disease and related dementias by 2025.</p>
<p>On another note, I am excited to share with Council the news that with the help of a generous donor AFTD is initiating a $5 million biomarkers initiative. Dedicated to stimulating discovery and development of biomarkers specifically for the various FTD clinical disorders and pathologies, we anticipate investing these funds October 20, 2015 over the course of the next 5 years and plan to leverage this investment to attract additional funding from various parties in the private sector.</p>
<p>I will also note that the AFTD Biomarkers Initiative is directly responsive to one of the recommendations to come out of the 2013 NAPA ADRD conference, which was--and I quote--to <em>Develop FTD biomarkers for diagnosis and disease progression. </em>In this, as in all programs we sponsor, AFTD is pleased to represent our community and cognizant that success in developing biomarkers to accurately diagnose or track progression of any of the FTD subtypes will also inform similar initiatives for Alzheimer's and all of the related neurodegenerative disorders, including Lewy body dementia, Parkinson's disease and ALS.</p>
<p>I look forward to keeping this council apprised of our progress and, as always, appreciate the opportunity to speak on behalf of our patients, their families, and the professionals who work with them.</p>

<p>Hello. My name is Matthew Sharp. I am the Program Manager for The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (or AFTD). I would like to take today's focus on the related dementias as an opportunity to share some more details about the work AFTD does and the resources and information available to help people living or working with FTD understand this complex disease and connect with others for help and support.</p>
<p>But first I want to acknowledge the time and attention given to the Related Dementias today and express AFTD's gratitude to this morning's speakers, for sharing their time, knowledge and expertise. Opportunities to hear from expert physicians with experience diagnosing and treating people with FTD or LBD are nearly as rare as these related dementias are. AFTD recognizes the council's commitment to understand the related dementias and appreciates the efforts made to find and invite this morning's speakers to today's meeting.</p>
<p>AFTD is a small, but growing, non-profit disease advocacy organization based outside of Philadelphia. We were founded in 2002 in order to support people living and working with FTD, provide current and accurate information about the disease and caring for a loved-one, and promote and support medical research to develop effective treatments and ultimately find a cure for FTD.</p>
<p>AFTD supports clinical and basic science research on FTD through a Pilot Grant program and a Post-doctoral Fellowship. We also offer a drug discovery grant in collaboration with the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) to accelerate and support innovative drug discovery programs and biomarker development for FTD. Our newest grant program, currently in development, will support an Economic Burden Study on FTD, to look at the toll FTD imposes across many levels of society and provide objective information to clarify the real costs of the disease.</p>
<p>AFTD is also excited to be one of the primary advocacy organizations involved with The Advancing Research and Treatment for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ARTFL) consortium. With funding awarded through NIH last fall, the ARTFL consortium will join advocacy organizations like AFTD together with academic research centers for the purpose of conducting clinical trials in FTD. The ARTFL consortium is, without a doubt, the most exciting and hopeful FTD research projects ever and AFTD is honored to be involved.</p>
<p>In addition to promoting research AFTD is dedicated to helping anyone coping with FTD find the support, information and resources needed to maintain as high a quality of life as possible for both themselves and their loved-ones. AFTD's website offers up-to-date and reliable information about the disease and appropriate care, and we will send printed material to anyone who requests it. All the medical information on the site is reviewed by expert physicians and neurologists from our Medical Advisory Board (which includes Dr. Lippa) and is updated as needed to reflect the progress being made by research on FTD and related neurological diseases. We also include regional listings of medical centers in the US (plus a few in Canada) with a special interest in FTD research. These centers offer diagnostic expertise for anyone worried about having FTD as well as opportunities for people with FTD to participate in clinical trials or other types of medical research. Whenever possible we include the name and contact information of the individual to follow-up with to enroll in a research study, schedule an appointment for a diagnostic evaluation, or access other services that may be available. I am pleased to report that we currently struggling to come up with the best way to respond to medical centers and neurological practices that ASK US to be listed on the website. For the first decade or so of AFTD's life we faced the opposite problem and didn't know enough centers doing FTD research as we would like to list on the website. And while there are still some large sections of the country without any specialized medical resources for FTD this is definitely a good problem to have and another sign of progress.</p>
<p>In addition to the website, the primary point of contact for people to learn more about the resources available from AFTD is our Helpline. The Helpline is not "live" but people may call (toll-free) or email the Helpline as needed with questions or concerns and an AFTD staff member will respond as soon as possible. On average, AFTD staff respond to about 40 Helpline cases per week, and provide answers and information, help finding necessary services or connecting to others for support, as well as material and resources as requested. If we cannot answer a question or find a resource we will try to connect callers to someone who can. While fewer than in the past, there are still too many Helpline calls for which we can only offer our time to listen with a sympathetic ear. It is our sincere hope that the number of these cases will continue to decrease as awareness spreads and resources grow, but, nothing else AFTDs Helpline still provides a doorway through which people struggling with FTD can connect to a growing network of caregivers, people with the disease, and knowledgeable professionals for help and support.</p>
<p>Thanks again for this opportunity to describe the resources available through AFTD, as well as the interest and attention given to FTD today. The Councils continued commitment to including the related dementias in the work and scope of NAPA is deeply appreciated.</p>

<p>We would like to thank and commend Co-chairs Laurel Coleman, M.D., and Susan Mitchell, M.D. as well as the staff of Institute of Medicine, for inviting us to the recently concluded series of meetings on advanced dementia care. Observing the discussions on research, innovative program models and policy was stimulating, and reflected a deep commitment on the part of the presenters and IOM to promoting person-centered dementia care. The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) strongly supports the resulting recommendations for the 2015 update of the National Plan to address Alzheimer's disease, developed in consultation with the experts invited to speak at the IOM meetings, and presented on January 26 by Dr. Mitchell and Laurel Coleman, M.D. Chair of the clinical care sub-committee of the NAPA advisory council.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the National Alzheimer's Plan defines "Alzheimer's disease" to include related disorders, it is important to note that existing research, policy and models of care in advanced dementia focus exclusively on an older adult and frail elderly dementia population. Persons with younger-onset dementias and their families face additional complex needs throughout the course of the disease, including in advanced stages. To be consistent with the aims of NAPA, any plan for advanced dementia care must therefore address the needs of the entire dementia population, including those affected by rarer, younger-onset disorders, such as frontotemporal degeneration (FTD).</p>
<p>FTD disorders are distinct from elderly dementia and Alzheimer's disease in two important aspects: they have an earlier age of onset; and cause impairment in executive functioning, language and movement, rather than memory. The age of onset is usually between 45 and 65 years but FTD can affect people as early as their 20's. While the aging services network is the principle provider of services needed by people with FTD, individuals and families are routinely denied services because they do not meet age eligibility, criteria and providers do not understand their needs</p>
<p>Recommendations to improve advanced dementia care including access to palliative care and hospice, preparation of a competent workforce, establishment of quality metrics, and leveraging policy and payment mechanisms to ensure high quality, person-centered care are necessary but grounded in elderly dementia and not sufficient to address the needs of younger persons with dementia and their families. For example:</p>
<ul><li>Hospice criteria for dementia must reflect an understanding of the erratic course of disease and varied end of life symptoms in a younger person with advanced frontotemporal degeneration. Predicting the last six months of life in persons with FTD can be especially challenging; and the lack of specific criteria for appropriately initiating referrals for hospice services means many medical providers and FTD families do not benefit from this important resource.</li>
<li>Research has shown that the difficulty obtaining a diagnosis of FTD, the early age of onset, and the presence of behavioral symptoms contribute to greater caregiver burden in FTD compared to Alzheimer's disease. Families facing FTD are more likely to be at the height of careers and family life; coupled with a higher burden of disease management, this can easily preempt discussions around plans for future healthcare needs and reduces the use of advanced directives or other tools to clarify vital care choices prior to medical crises.</li>
<li>Education on the distinct diagnostic, medical and psychosocial characteristics and needs of persons with FTD disorders is sorely lacking and much needed for geriatricians, palliative care physicians, neurologists, psychiatrists, primary care physicians and other healthcare providers who serve people with advanced dementia across federal and state long-term services and supports.</li>
<li>People with FTD face many difficult care transitions as the disease progresses. Poor coordination of services and the lack of access to appropriate care in the community frequently result in costly psychiatric inpatient admissions, greater use of psychotropic medications and increased utilization of high-cost care in advanced stages of the disease.</li>
</ul><p>Anecdotally, we know that the medical, behavioral and psychosocial needs of persons with younger-onset dementia differ from elderly persons with advanced dementia; yet health policy research initiatives typically focus on an elderly population and exclude data on individuals under 65. Additional mechanisms are needed to fill knowledge gaps and track the functional and cognitive trajectories of people with FTD or other forms of younger-onset dementia in order to fully inform and improve the quality of advanced dementia care.</p>
<p>As the Advisory Council considers the recommendations developed through the advanced dementia meetings at IOM and the important issues surrounding advanced dementia, AFTD implores you to not neglect the needs of people with FTD and other forms of dementia, many of whom are under age 65 and not adequately represented in current thinking about advanced dementia care focused on the elderly population. Some possible mechanisms to ensure this broader perspective are:</p>
<ul><li>Include representatives from FTD and other younger-onset dementias in the development and implementation of the goals and strategies in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease to improve care in advanced dementia</li>
<li>Promote initiatives to fund and conduct research into the health care utilization of persons under age 65 with dementia and develop innovative models of care for persons with advanced younger-onset dementia.</li>
<li>Expand and develop services under Title III of the Older Americans Act to include people with younger-onset dementia.</li>

<p>I am very impressed by the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (and Related Dementias). It is well written and quite comprehensive from my perspective. But I do have some concerns and suggestions.</p>
<p>My wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease in February 2010. I am her primary caregiver and health advocate. Fortunately, long-term care insurance has afforded us the opportunity to have two very good caregivers thus providing me the ability to work part time as a research scientist at CNA, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). My wife and I have experienced both the classical, traditional clinical medical approach and, more recently, the alternative complementary medical approach. In addition, I am a member of two caregiver support groups: one offered by a Ministry to the Aging at my church, and the second offered by the Alzheimer's Family Day Center of Fairfax, VA.</p>
<p>From this base of experience and education, I offer my observations and suggestions:</p>
<ol><li><strong>The plan seems to lack a sense of urgency</strong>. While the goal "to prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025" is laudable, the selection of 2025 along with the general tone of the plan does not convey the urgency I believe is necessary. Selecting either 2020, because it's sooner and a nice round number, or 2022, as it comes 10-years after the release of the National Plan and is akin to President Kennedy's announcement in 1960 of manned flight to the moon by the end of that decade, would be better. Both years signal a message of boldness and ambition more so than does 2025. I believe caregivers and family members would be encouraged by such ambitious goals.</li>
<li><strong>The plan appears to display certain biases that may restrict the search for alternative solutions</strong>.
<ol><li>First, there seems to be an emphasis on searching for "pharmacological" solutions. Certainly, the plan recognizes other approaches, e.g. "While research on AD has made steady progress, there are no pharmacological or <em>other interventions</em> to definitively prevent, treat, or cure the disease" and "<em>non-pharmacological management</em> of physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms." But it does not clearly state what such "other, non-pharmacological" approaches might be. This suggests to me a bias toward pharmaceutical solutions and therefore a favoring of the pharmaceutical industry, which seems to be more motivated by profits than solutions. I encourage that these other approaches be specified. The effectiveness of public health communications necessitates clear, plain-English language.</li>
<li>There also seems to be a bias toward the time-consuming approach of clinical trials. The plan clearly recognizes the need to the pharmaceutical bias, I think.</li>
<li>The plan rightly includes "related dementias" in defining Alzheimer's Disease. But it identifies only Lewy body, frontotemporal, and vascular dementias as examples. Unless recognized but not stated by the drafters, I suggest including other neurological diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, ALS/Lew Gehrig, and MS. Such an expansion might introduce synergies and efficiencies and potentially a considerably more significant effect.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><p>Admittedly, my own personal research into AD is limited. I have only recently begun to dig more deeply into the subject. Much of my motivation comes from frustration over the silence and apparent helplessness of the traditional medical community toward my wife's disease. I have recently read two books that have strongly influenced me: "Alzheimer's Disease---What If There Was a Cure"---The Story of Ketones" by Dr. Mary Newport, and "Stop Alzheimer's Now! How to Prevent and Reverse Dementia, Parkinson's, ALS, Multiple Sclerosis and Other Neurodegenerative Disorders" by Dr. Bruce Fife.These books introduced me to the "Type 3 Diabetes" aspect of AD, which I find most intriguing and compelling. If what they say is true about insulin-deficiency and insulin-resistance in the brain and the resultant "starvation" of neurons, and that nutritional substitutes in the form of ketone bodies from medium-chain triglyceride fatty acids already exist on the shelves of health food stores in the forms of coconut oil and MCT oils, THIS IS HUGE. Considering that I might be "starving" my wife's neurons by not providing this source of fuels (already used by neonatologists, according to Dr. Newport and in pediatrics, according to my RN daughter), ignoring this evidence is morally unconscionable to me. Also if true, this nutritional approach could be a "silver bullet" of vast consequence.</p>
<p>Thank you for soliciting comments from the public in reaction to the draft plan. I apologize for missing the March 30 deadline. Such tardiness has become commonplace for me as an Alzheimer's caregiver and health advocate. And thank you for your contribution to this important work.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments on NAPA from an Alzheimer's expert with 30 years of dementia experience</strong></p>
<p>NAPA's outline is a <strong>comprehensive masterpiece</strong> which I am grateful for the opportunity to offer comments...I've waited decades for this!</p>
<p>I want to thank President Obama, for keeping the promise he made in response to my Town Hall question in Scranton PA during his initial campaign. My question to him was: "What do you plan to do about the Alzheimer's epidemic?"</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</strong><br />
					Only 1% of physicians specialize in geriatrics; even fewer are experts in Alzheimer's and dementia. Less than 5% of nurse practitioners are certified as gerontological nurse practitioners. Similar statistics exist for psychiatrists who specialize in geriatrics or dementia care. We are about 13,000 geriatric physicians short now: the American Geriatrics Society estimated it will get worse: a 36,000 deficit of geriatric physicians by 2030. Is there hope?</p>
<p>The lack of Medicare reimbursement for comprehensive geriatric assessment, dementia assessments, family caregiver support, counseling and education have deterred young medical students from entering geriatrics. Geriatricians' salaries are considerably than physicians in sub-specialties. If the annual threat to cut Medicare continues, elders and Baby Boomers will suffer even further access to elder care specialists. If NAPA has any influence in this area, it is essential to have Alzheimer's experts for the dementia bubble ready to burst!</p>
<p>I, as a Gerontological Nurse Practitioner, taught family medicine residents Alzheimers and dementia care in nursing homes, assisted living facilities and on house calls between 1987-1999. Most medical students during the nineties were graduating with less than 10 hours of lectures specific to geriatrics: with no little or curriculum on Alzheimer's, dementia or geriatric pharmacology. Geriatric rotations were not common in many primary care residencies at that time. Even today, primary care provider attendance is lacking at continuing education programs on Alzheimer's disease. I suggest that NAPA offers funding for Alzheimer's CE programs to be offered by geriatric educators. I recommend at least four hours of annual mandatory CE for practicing physicians and other primary care providers on the following topics:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Geriatric Prescribing</strong>: This should include emphasis on the <em>Beers List of potentially inappropriate medications in elders</em>. Adverse drug events affect elders more than any other age group. Persons with Alzheimer's disease are at even greater risk for delirium due to their low levels of brain acetylcholine. There are over 6 million elders on one or more potentially inappropriate medications for elders. Adverse drug reactions in seniors are a leading cause of ER visits and hospitalizations; hence further driving up US health care costs. <em>Many providers remain uneducated re the Beers list</em>. This has been confirmed by many nurses who participated in my 600+ seminars in over 40 states).</li>
<li><strong>Alzheimer's Disease (Late Onset and Early Onset) Vascular Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia, Parkinson's Dementia, and Frontotemporal Dementia</strong>: Primary health care providers need to be comfortable diagnosing and differentiating the major types of dementia, performing a dementia workup and treating Alzheimer's Disease/dementias using clinical guidelines. There are simply not enough dementia specialists for PCP's to refer to. The waiting times for families to see a dementia expert are much too long!</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia</strong>: All prescribers treating elders need to fully understand the risks of antipsychotic therapy, paradoxical effects of benzodiazepines in frail elders, and the non-pharmacological approaches to dementia behaviors. Providers should become familiar with the evidence-based research on these topics. This will enable them to help patients and their families learn the benefits of antidementia medications and the risks of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines in elders.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce </strong><br />
					With a rate of 50% turnover of nursing assistants and direct care staff in states like my own (PA), we need to make LTC a setting where staff remain, ensuring continuity for resident care. Direct care workers are at risk of physical injury and disability. Administrators face rising workman's compensation costs when behaviors of dementia re not optimally treated. Staffing issues, poor retention, burnout and lack of dementia education contribute.</p>
<p>I request that national dementia experts who are entrepreneurs have opportunities to partner in business with governments and state agencies in educating the direct care workforce. I feel that at least 50% of training should be live; to allow staff to ask questions relevant to the patients they serve. Video and online learning can be a supplement, but should we not give the best to the staff that spend the most time with Alzheimer's residents? The #1 reason they resign is because they don't feel that they are respected. Honoring their efforts with live dementia education is an excellent strategy that will save money that is being spent on training a transitory workforce.</p>
<p>Many of us have been working in the community trenches of Alzheimer's care, outside of academic or research settings for decades and want to share our wealth of knowledge and experience. I've been educating nursing assistants, nurses and interdisciplinary staff for 12 years! The National Council for Certified Dementia Practitioners offers a full-day live curriculum that could lead national certification as a CDP: Certified Dementia Practitioner.</p>
<p>Dementia education should not be limited to nursing assistants. It should be available and funded for LPNs (who run most LTC units). Dementia research changes daily to weekly, so updates need to be shared with RN's, administrators, social workers, pharmacists, physical, occupational, recreational and speech therapists, social workers, and dieticians. Only through interdisciplinary education will senior communities be on the "same page" for best practices in long-term care, assisted living, CCRC's and home and hospice care.</p>
<p>I request that dementia education businesses that have clinical experience in dementia care be included in the force to strengthen the direct care workforce.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong><br /><em>HHS will coordinate with states to develop aging workforces that are AD-capable and culturally competent.<br />
					AoA will ask states to specify strategies to improve the AD-capability of the workforce. </em><br />
					I would request that state agencies will have grants and opportunities to partner with for-profits dementia education corporations, especially those that are reaching families currently though the power of social networking.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B: Ensure timely and accurate diagnosis</strong><br />
					I have been diagnosing Alzheimer's and dementia for 30 years. I still see nursing home residents, home care patients or nursing home residents who are not yet diagnosed until the moderate or late stage of Alzheimer's disease. I've met families in which loved ones were killed in auto accidents due to a driver with undiagnosed dementia, spouses who have been bankrupted by their husband's undiagnosed Alzheimer's disease. Part of the problem is family denial, apathy, fear, and helplessness. The remaining problem is that some health care providers lack knowledge of the dementia workup and evidence-based clinical guidelines for treatment. Continuing education is essential for providers: families need to be educated of the warning signs and know where to go for help.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting people with Alzheimer's disease and their families and educating the public and providers. </strong><br />
					This is HUGE. Families are starved for direction, information, support and resources. I have provided approximately 200 caregiver workshops in 40 states across the country. The lack of information on Alzheimer's disease causes family turmoil and division. I've seen cases of anger and elder abuse between family members who misinterpreted the personality changes of Alzheimer's as intentional behaviors. Many families have shared with me their frustrations with dementia care in the current health care setting. Seminars should be funded in the community, in senior centers, or in faith communities; where access is easy for stressed families and friends.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.3: Educate the public about the latest research findings</strong><br />
					Translating research on dementias to professionals and the public has been the main focus of my dementia and geriatric education businesses for the past 12 years. I would request that HHS, VA, federal agencies, ADEAR will also partner with for-profit businesses who have been sharing Alzheimer's information in their businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.1: Educate physicians and other healthcare providers about accessing long-term services and supports<br />
					Action 2.E.1: Evaluate the effectiveness of medical home models for people with AD</strong><br />
					Interdisciplinary collaboration needs to be initiated at the undergraduate level in the health sciences, including pre-med. I have taught graduate level geriatrics for 25 years. Evidence-based studies on quality of life, morbidity and mortality, functional state in elders consistently show that the interdisciplinary team approach offers better outcomes than standard medical care. Teams consistently outperform the hierarchical model of care. This should not be surprising, as Alzheimer's care and general geriatric care is functional, medical, psychological, pharmacological, social, spiritual, legal and financial. Alzheimer's care needs to be shared jointly, not "directed" by a single profession. Re the medical home concept, I would request that nurse practitioner with Alzheimer's or gerontological experience, be included as leaders in the Alzheimer's medical home model.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term services and supports system</strong><br />
					I would request that Medicare reimbursement codes be established for comprehensive caregiver assessments and that providers can choose the caregiver assessment instrument that works best for them; rather than be directed by a 3rd party. Suggested instruments are the The Zarit Burden Interview or the Modified Caregiver Strain Index (CSI). Reimbursement should be allowed for both initial diagnosis and counseling as well as ongoing caregiver assessment and support.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease</strong><br />
					I feel that for-profit Alzheimer's/dementia education corporations, non-profit dementia educators; Alzheimer's Association chapters should have the ability and financial incentives to educate attorneys. My opinion is that only attorneys who are CELAs (Certified Elder Law Attorneys) should be able to title themselves as elder care experts.

<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong><br />
					I have prescribed medications in LTC units over three decades. Over the past 20 years, OBRA had some impact on dementia antipsychotic use in nursing homes, but not as much as was hoped for. Despite a nearly doubled risk of mortality (1.7x) due to stroke, pneumonia, cardiovascular disease, antipsychotics are still routinely prescribed for behaviors related to dementia. Many prescribers are not aware that antipsychotic effectiveness for dementia was less than 20% effective in the CATIE study. Several studies revealed that staff dementia education was more effective than antipsychotic treatment for dementia behaviors. Funding should be available to educate prescribers regarding risks of antipsychotics for dementia. 88% of reimbursement claims submitted to Medicare for antipsychotic drugs prescribed for nursing home residents during a six-month review period (January to June 2007) were for residents diagnosed with dementia! So I applaud the recent work of Dan Levinson and the Office of Inspector General to reduce antipsychotic use for behaviors in dementia.</p>

<p>The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) congratulates the Advisory Council of the National Alzheimer's Project on the creation of the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (the draft plan). The draft plan is a major step forward in meeting the current and future challenges posed by progressive neurological diseases for the benefit of all who are affected by these devastating illnesses.</p>
<p>AFTD is honored to offer our input on behalf of the thousands of Americans living and working with frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), a group of clinical disorders resulting from a progressive loss of neurons in the frontal and/or temporal lobes of the brain. AD and FTD are related by pathological inclusions, often called neurofibrillary tangles, of the essential brain protein tau but differ in many critical ways. Memory loss, the characteristic symptom of AD, is rare in FTD and, when it does occur, is most often seen only during the later stages of FTD. The initial presentation of FTD can comprise a mix of symptoms, including: changes in behavior and personality diminished cognitive and executive functioning, language and communication problems, as well as motor impairments similar to those found in ALS or Parkinson's disease. FTD progresses unpredictably but inevitably results in complete dependence on medical care to sustain life during the final stages of the disease.</p>
<p>The average age of disease onset in FTD is in the late 50's, about a decade earlier than in AD. This difference poses special challenges shared only by the small percentage of people with the early-onset form of AD. Accessing insurance and finding appropriate health care for a debilitating neurological disease is a tremendous challenge for people under the age of retirement. Furthermore, the stigma associated with cognitive symptoms like dementia for people in their 40's-60's combined with a lack of public and professional awareness of FTD can create an overwhelming sense of isolation for people and families coping with FTD.</p>
<p>As an organization whose mission is devoted exclusively to this "related dementia", we believe that the inclusion of language in the draft plan explicitly addressing the distinct challenges posed by FTD and the related dementias will enable the proposed Actions and Strategies to better meet the needs of those affected by a non-Alzheimer's neurological disease. We strongly urge HHS to solicit input from experts and members of non-Alzheimer's disease communities and to specifically include such individuals as members of the task force detailed by Action 2.H.1 under Strategy 2.H.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevention and Treatment by 2025. </strong></p>
<p>AD and FTD are related through a shared underlying pathology. This connection offers exciting research prospects with enormous potential for AD and FTD patients alike. Therapeutic compounds that target the protein tau could have equally effective application for treating both diseases. FTD offers pharmaceutical companies opportunities for drug development not available with AD, such as a larger number of cases related to identified mutations on a small number of genes and a regulatory status to facilitate progress toward clinical drug trials. It is our sincere hope that the draft plan will stimulate aggressive efforts to exploit this point of mutual interest for the sake of both FTD and AD patients and their families.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>The primary obstacle to the efficient delivery of high-quality care for FTD in any professional setting is the overwhelming lack of qualified providers experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of FTD. Obtaining a diagnosis of FTD often takes several years, an amount of time equal to ¼ or more of the total life expectancy for some patients, and like AD a definitive diagnosis is still only obtainable by autopsy. Ambiguity in diagnosis during the life of the patient complicates care, clinical trial recruitment, financial planning and all other aspects of coping with a neurodegenerative disease of any kind. Reliable diagnoses that accurately differentiate AD from FTD and all other related diseases would benefit everyone. Once diagnosed, the only professional care available to those with FTD is by providers who advertise services with phrases like "Memory Care" or "Dementia Services" that are intended for people with AD. Some who have FTD, especially people in their 50's or 60's, fail to realize that such resources even apply to them since they do not have memory problems and dementia is widely perceived as a condition that affects only senior citizens. In order to measure and improve care for people affected by FTD any quality improvement tool developed through the draft plan must include data, information, and content addressing the scarcity of professional expertise and knowledge of FTD and recognize the enormous challenge patients and families face in accessing appropriate healthcare services that is not experienced by most of those with AD.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expanded Support for Patients and Caregivers </strong></p>
<p>Due to the earlier average age of disease onset relative to AD, FTD is more likely to strike people who are still employed and raising a family and inevitably deprives them of their ability to function in either a professional or private capacity. FTD robs families of a parent, and makes experienced professionals incapable of successfully concluding a career. The paucity of public awareness and scarcity of professional expertise can combine with the debilitating symptoms of FTD and throw entire families into personal, financial, and legal turmoil prior to diagnosis. Thus magnifying the impact of FTD on not only the healthcare system, but all other social and legal systems well beyond what is expected of a rare disease. Currently the main source of support for FTD patients and caregivers is extended families, close friends, and perhaps most importantly, other FTD caregivers. The need for strategies and action to expand support for patients and caregivers around the unique challenges posed by FTD is desperate.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Public awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>AFTD respectfully submits that without language explicitly describing the differences between the etiology, demographics and symptoms of FTD and AD, and the distinct challenges these differences impose on patients, caregivers, and the health care system as a whole, the draft plan will not successfully attain this goal for stakeholders involved with FTD. When FTD is subsumed under the phrase "related disorders" critical distinctions are lost, promoting the mistaken belief that dementia is a disease synonymous with AD rather than a symptom with a variety of causes. This, in turn, leads many healthcare professionals across all settings to treat people as if they have AD regardless of their actual diagnosis and provide them with inappropriate care which may even cause harm. Furthermore, when families and patients fail to respond as expected to the inappropriate care they receive they are too often denied care entirely rather than offered alternatives, exacerbating the sense of helplessness and the stigma that is all too common in those diagnosed with FTD. Unless more explicit attention is given to how FTD, and other neurological diseases differ from AD any increase in public awareness and engagement achieved through the draft plan will fail to fully benefit patients, families and caregivers coping with FTD and other neurological disease beside AD.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improved data infrastructure. </strong></p>
<p>Any data infrastructure created as part of the draft plan needs to be designed to include fields, criteria, and values specific to the impact of FTD, and other non-Alzheimer's diseases, on patients, families, and healthcare systems, if it is to benefit those with a neurological disease besides AD.</p>

<p>Please find attached feedback from the Lewy Body Dementia Association on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The letter is from the President of LBDA's Board of Directors, Angela Herron, in consultation with our <strong>Scientific Advisory Council</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>An Open Letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services<br />
					Feedback on the Draft Framework for the<br />
					National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA) supports and applauds the development of a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.</p>
<p>With appreciation for the magnitude of the task at hand and the complexity of the issues, LBDA is providing limited feedback that is a) relevant for dementia in general and b) an important consideration specific to the spectrum of Lewy body dementias (LBD): dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD).</p>
<p>An estimated 1.3 million Americans have LBD, which features progressive dementia plus varying combinations of symptoms (especially at onset), ranging from parkinsonism, fluctuating cognition and visual hallucinations, to REM sleep behavior disorder, a severe sensitivity to antipsychotic medications, mood disorders and autonomic dysfunction. Both clinical diagnoses within the LBD spectrum feature Lewy body pathology, but the timing and severity of symptom onset differs.</p>
<p>Dementia with Lewy bodies represents approximately 20 percent of all dementias and is the most frequent dementia type misdiagnosed clinically, most often as Alzheimer's. Features that differentiate LBD from Alzheimer's at the early stage include visual hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder and results of neuropsychological assessment.</p>
<p>Most older adults with Parkinson's disease have some degree of cognitive impairment at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 80% of people with Parkinson's will ultimately develop dementia. The prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson's disease has not yet become common knowledge among clinicians. There is no general public awareness about dementia in Parkinson's disease. Caregivers of people with PDD report to LBDA that the progression to dementia ultimately proves to be their most difficult caregiving challenge.</p>
<p><strong>It's not always Alzheimer's. </strong></p>
<p>We appreciate the importance of communicating the plan in a manner that is both straightforward and understandable by the general public. While Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, there are millions of Americans whose lives are deeply affected by related disorders like stroke, LBD and frontotemporal degeneration; while they receive nominal mention in the background material as being included in this plan, there is no mention of them in the draft agenda.</p>
<p>Public awareness and education is one of the core goals of the draft agenda. LBDA urges the names of related disorders be included in the opening statement of the draft agenda, so that educating the public about the most common forms of dementia begins now and continues throughout the advancement of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, through public relations efforts of federal agencies, disease advocacy organizations and academia.</p>
<p>As the plan receives coverage in the media, deliberate inclusion of related disorders will also minimize disenfranchisement of Americans affected by lesser-known, non-Alzheimer's dementias like LBD, many of whom might easily infer the omission indicates the federal government does not appreciate that their plight is as fraught with burden as those dealing with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis </strong></p>
<p>While improving the timeliness of diagnosis is important, the Lewy Body Dementia Association strongly recommends the inclusion of the word 'differential' when referring to diagnosis.</p>
<p>A general dementia diagnosis or an inaccurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease leaves people with LBD at risk for exposure to potentially severe or irreversible medication side effects. (Approximately 50% of people with DLB who are exposed to neuroleptics will experience a severe reaction.) Inaccurate diagnosis also prevents the opportunity to prepare families for the complexity of LBD symptoms, treatment and high toll of LBD caregiving. Accurate differential diagnosis not only leads to more appropriate therapeutic interventions but also improves the selection for study candidates in research trials.</p>
<p>Primary care physicians must become more familiar with the top four causes of dementia, specifically Alzheimer's, LBD, stroke and frontotemporal degeneration. Delayed or inaccurate diagnoses are further compounded by the low percentage of referrals from primary care physicians to specialists. Simple screening tools to highlight when a referral is warranted for differential diagnosis are urgently needed, especially for people with LBD.</p>
<p><strong>Care Quality </strong></p>
<p>When assessing the care needs of persons with dementia, it is essential to look beyond the cognitive deficits and their impact on employment, incidental activities of daily living and activities of daily living. In the case of Lewy body dementias, care quality must also address motor symptoms (such as the risk of falls), behavioral problems, sleep and autonomic issues. Other professionals who regularly provide care for people with dementia include specialists treating sleep and autonomic symptoms as well as physical, occupational and speech therapists.</p>
<p><strong>Care Guidelines across Care Settings </strong></p>
<p>Given the increased rate of hospitalization of people with dementia, hospitals should be included in the list of care settings for which dementia care guidelines and measures are to be developed. Many hospitals are not equipped to provide adequate care to people with dementia, especially those with behavioral problems, leading to excessive or avoidable treatment with antipsychotic medications. (This is especially dangerous to the person with LBD, who may experience modest to significant decline without a return to their baseline from as little as a single dose of haloperidol.) Additionally, consideration should be given to non-cognitive symptoms, such as motor problems, which affect activities of daily living and increase fall risk.</p>
<p>As LBD is a multi-system disorder, routine care coordination between multiple physicians is particularly challenging with LBD. By changing medications without consulting the treating neurologist, another physician may unknowingly exacerbate any one of several LBD symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>In addressing the long term care needs of people with dementia, caregivers need more accessible resources to provide quality care for the person with dementia in their own home as long as possible, while also maintaining balance of the equally important quality of life for the family caregiver.</p>
<p>Patient advocacy groups should be included in the draft framework as an important source of counseling, support and information to patients and families upon a differential diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Public Awareness </strong></p>
<p>The general public needs to be educated about the difference between dementia and the disease processes that cause it, much like the education the public received about HIV and AIDS. Few people understand that dementia is sometimes treatable. Educating the public that dementia is a symptom requiring medical attention, not a disease in itself, will help de-stigmatize both dementia and the many related clinical diagnoses.</p>
<p>In order to improve the reporting to physicians of all dementia-related symptoms beyond memory problems alone, such as those seen in stroke and LBD, it is imperative that the general public learn that the most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer's disease, stroke and LBD, and what symptoms should be reported to their physicians.</p>
<p>The Lewy Body Dementia Association is encouraged at the expansive nature of this draft agenda, especially as it pertains to the impact of dementia disorders not just on the patient but on the family caregiver as well. We look forward to following the progression of your work with great anticipation.</p>
