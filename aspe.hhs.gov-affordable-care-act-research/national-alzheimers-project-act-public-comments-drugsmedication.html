<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Good afternoon. My name is Ian Kremer and I serve as executive director of Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (the LEAD Coalition). The LEAD Coalition is a diverse and growing national coalition of 77 member organizations [<a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/">http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/</a>] including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, home and residential care providers, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. LEAD is co-convened by the Alzheimer's Foundation of America and USAgainstAlzheimer's. The coalition works collaboratively to focus the nation's strategic attention on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and to accelerate transformational progress in: detection and diagnosis; care and support to enrich quality of life; and research leading to prevention, effective treatment and eventual cure. For more information about the LEAD Coalition, please contact me.</p>
<p>Congratulations and best wishes to the newly appointed members of the Advisory Council. We look forward to you building on the strong legacy of your predecessors, forging even more productive bonds with your colleagues, and being the catalysts for truly transformational progress in the quality of life for people facing dementia and the scientific pursuit of a world without dementia.</p>
<p>For the past several years, I have said during the public comment portion of Advisory Council meetings that the National Plan needed to match the aspirational and transformative 2025 goal for biomedical progress with similarly aspirational and transformative goals for clinical care and long term services and supports. At the Advisory Council's July 27 meeting, that conviction appeared to have sunk in with quite a few of the Council members. In particular, I want to thank Laurel Coleman and Harry Johns for their expressions not only of exasperation but of determination that this Advisory Council, this National Plan, and this country must achieve vast improvements in quality of life for those living with dementia and for their families.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I'll offer a sample of a dozen actions that might help the Advisory Council get started (I'll be happy to flesh out any of these points):</p>
<ul><li>Because the National Plan should be about person-centered progress that improves lives, not about issuing reports, holding events, and delivering units of training or service: <strong>work with public and private stakeholders to establish an ambitious national goal -- with metrics and milestones -- for lowering rates (among people with dementia and their caregivers) of isolation; neglect, abuse, and exploitation; falls; wandering; premature institutional placement; depression; pain; impoverishment; and inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in home and community-based care settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Because transformative innovation requires multi-sector collaboration, strong coordination, and a purposeful confluence of priority-setting, resource commitment, and accountability: <strong>recommend that the National Plan include creation of a dementia care a services parallel to the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (being led by NIH in the biomedical research sphere)</strong>.</li>
<li>Because people living with dementia and family caregivers should have an easier time participating in and contributing to the Advisory Council process ("Nothing About Us Without Us"): <strong>the Advisory Council should conduct regularly scheduled public listening sessions in-person around the country or at least by web-conference and social media (e.g. Google Hangouts, Twitter Chats); add a "Comments" form to its ASPE website; add to each workgroup additional members (non-voting, if statutorily necessary) who are living with dementia or are caregivers; and consult with disabilities experts about other accommodations that would facilitate greater access and participation</strong>.</li>
<li>Because there is dignity in knowing your diagnosis and because diagnosis is the door to quality care, self-determination, and advancing social and biomedical research: <strong>work with public and private stakeholders to establish an ambitious national goal -- with metrics and milestones -- for rates of accurate, timely, and actionable diagnosis</strong>.</li>
<li>Because this is a national plan -- not a federal plan -- and quality of life issues are in no small measure defined by state and local policies and practices: <strong>actively engage in the National Plan process the National Governors Association, the National Council of State Legislatures, the National Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the National League of Cities to determine their capacity, interests, and best-practices</strong>.</li>
<li>Because, by statute and by common sense, Congress is a stakeholder in the NAPA process: <strong>work with the relevant congressional committees, the House and Senate Alzheimer's Task Forces, the congressional caregiver caucus, and the congressional neuroscience caucus to more deeply engage them in the advisory council's work whether by attending meetings, appearing as guest presenters, or simply making sure they receive meeting agendas, announcements and links to materials and meeting videos</strong>.</li>
<li>Because dementia is an enormous and under-addressed workplace challenge both for employers and employees: <strong>actively engage in the National Plan process the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, the Society of Human Resource Managers, and representatives of both the business and labor communities to quantify those challenges and identify best-practices to change outcomes</strong>.</li>
<li>Because most people living with dementia and their caregivers have additional health challenges: <strong>actively engage public and private stakeholders focused on commonly co-occurring medical conditions -- such as diabetes, cardio-vascular disease, mental health disorders, hearing loss, and mobility loss -- to participate in the NAPA process of developing recommendations and action plans to improve quality of life</strong>.</li>
<li>Because dementia does note respect state borders: <strong>help states not only to share best-practices but also to form inter-state collaborations to address the needs of people living with dementia and their families who cross those state borders for services and for reasons of shared family caregiving</strong>.</li>
<li>Because dementia does not respect international borders either in its challenges or its solutions: <strong>formalize the National Plan goals and objectives with milestones and metrics about fostering international collaboration on research investments and priorities, regulatory harmonization, and translation and scaling of clinical and care practices</strong>.</li>
<li>Because living with dementia and caregiving for people with dementia is hard enough under normal circumstances but far more difficult during, or in the wake of, natural disasters: <strong>encourage the Federal Emergency Management Agency to participate in the NAPA Process to help develop recommendations and action plans to meet the ongoing and emerging needs of individuals, families, and institutions</strong>.</li>
<li>Because the Advisory Council is a bully pulpit: <strong>be vocal, candid, and relentless is pressing Congress to end sequestration and lift the budget caps that do very real harm to millions of people living with dementia today and in the future</strong>.</li>
</ul><p>In closing, I offer my apologies for topics I have failed to address and I offer my thanks to others making public comments addressing such omissions. I offer my appreciation to Advisory Council members and staff who give of their minds and hearts beyond what words can express. I offer my hope to all those living with dementia and their loved ones that they will be heard, heeded, and healed through the work we all do together.</p>

<p>My name is Dayne DuVall, I'm the Chief Operating Officer of the National Certification Board for Alzheimer Care (NCBAC). For over 11 years, our organization has been at the forefront of setting benchmarks in dementia care for direct care workers and the professionals who train them. We are the only organization that offers dementia care certifications based on the healthcare licensure model.</p>
<p>I want to offer my welcome to the new members of the Council, and thank ALL the members of the Council for their dedication. While much of the attention nationwide is placed on finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease, I want to ask this Council to concentrate on the CARE of people with ADRD and their families. As many of you know, my father died from Alzheimer's disease. It was a 13-year gut-wrenching and tormented journey that devastated our family.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the care of people and their families going through this fatal disease doesn't get enough attention. Compared to research dollars, resources for proper care and support of people with this disease is relatively non-existent. Ask a family what they need most to help their loved one, and their number one concern is NOT finding a cure. In fact, a recent survey conducted by the University of Buffalo found that the #1 concern was money and help to support caregiving, followed by financial aid and other help for long term care and aging in place. Research dollars ranked lower than these concerns. According to the study published by the University, in 2014, "hundreds of millions of federal dollars were spent on science and drug development," but only "$10 million to care, services, and education". The author continues, [That] "represents less than $2 per person for care-related support…Are these the priorities that people and families living with dementia want? Their voices have not been heard over the clamor for research dollars." I know that this Council has advocated for long term support and services (LTSS) in the past, but the families have told us that this is what they need most!</p>
<p>One area that needs more attention on the national and state level is training of the direct care workforce. Dementia education is greatly lacking in most states. I believe federal dollars should be devoted to making sure that everyone who provides care to people with ADRD -- whether they work in skilled nursing facilities, hospice, adult day care, assisted living and ESPECIALLY home care -- should be required to prove their competence in providing care. CMS has highlighted competency training in their proposed regulations for nursing facilities; I am told that they will provide specific guidelines for dementia care.</p>
<p>I know that we all want to see the day when we don't have to have these meetings. However, I think that day is far into the future. I believe that the work that this diverse group of individuals, along with those of us who work daily to advocate for proper care and support for people with Alzheimer's and related disorders AND their families, will help secure more resources from federal, and thereby, state governments to make the lives of these individuals more manageable.</p>
<p>Thanks, again, for your dedication to the fight for the millions of people suffering from ADRD. And, yes, I said, SUFFERING. I know that in certain circles that is not politically correct. However, if you have been through this with a loved one, that is indeed what you, your family, and more importantly, the person who you love experiences. Yes, they LIVE with Alzheimer's, but we all SUFFER the disastrous effects of this disease and we should never forget the physical, financial, and emotional toll it takes on all of us.</p>

<p>Good afternoon and thank you for your time today. My name is Grace Whiting and I am the Director of Strategic Partnerships at the National Alliance for Caregiving. The Alliance is a national non-profit organization dedicated to the mission of advancing family caregiving through research, innovation, and advocacy. By way of introduction to the new members of this body, we have over 40 national and multinational organizations in our membership, including four federal agencies and both not-for-profit and corporate organizations.</p>
<p>Together, we firmly believe that if our society is to rely on family caregivers to provide long-term care, then it is our duty to provide support for family caregivers -- at home, within models of healthcare delivery, in the workplace, and in the workplace. To that end, there are three comments I'd like to make today.</p>
<p>First, I would encourage you to consider international perspectives through your work on this council. As Secretariat of the International Alliance of CarerOrganizations, the Alliance often learns about new models of support for caregivers of people with Alzheimer's and related dementias. These models offer insight into how we can better support families in the United States who are managing this terrible disease.</p>
<p>For example, Scotland's "Focus on Dementia" model provides a meaningful framework for integrating a diagnosis for dementia into care and support. The Focus on Dementia model creates a "hub" for the patient and family to navigate the challenges of the disease. The hub has eight domains, including: a Dementia Practice Coordinator; therapeutic interventions; general health care; mental health care; environmental adaptations; community connections and engagement; personalized support; and support for caregivers. Diagnosis operates as a touchpoint to refer the individual with dementia to the Dementia Practice Coordinator, and it allows both that individual and their caregiver to become eligible for services. As many of these services are government-provided, there is data captured on both the caregiver and the care recipient (or patient) that can address the effectiveness of the support provided and received.</p>
<p>The Scotland model reminds us that diagnosis can serve as launching point for referral to information, resources, and caregiver supports. While our long-term care system is not as robust, there are existing community, private, and government resources that could help the newly diagnosed. For example, diagnosis could activate referrals to: disease-specific advocacy organizations; information about the National Family Caregiver Support Program and Lifespan Respite program; or information about family and medical leave or other workplace supports.</p>
<p>To the larger point at hand, Scotland's Focus on Dementia is an example of what we could learn from other nations. Groups like the Global CEO Initiative, the Global Dementia Framework, and caregiving groups like the International Alliance of Carers Organizations can offer insight into the issues this council is currently wrestling with.</p>
<p>Second, I would encourage the council to prioritize a national Care and Support Summit. It has been acknowledged by academic experts and drug innovators alike that we are still many years from a disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's and dementia. While we work towards research that will improve our future, there remains unmet needs now. Please remember the needs of families who are caring for individuals with dementia in our midst and the costs inherent in their contribution such as lost income, foregone retirement, and worsened health.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like you to join the Alliance and the Alzheimer's Foundation of America in an ongoing social media discussion during November on brain health and brain screenings. #TalkBrainHealth is an educational campaign to encourage family caregivers to talk with their families about brain screenings for older adults over the holiday season. We will be sharing a one pager that can be used as "talking points" for caregivers of older adults to discuss brain health and the role of screenings, which draws from key resources like the Institute of Medicine report on cognitive aging. More information is available at <a href="http://www.caregiving.org/talkbrainhealth">http://www.caregiving.org/talkbrainhealth</a> or you can find us on Twitter at #TalkBrainHealth.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your time and for your continued commitment to the people and families living with dementia.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Is age-related excess brain iron causing Alzheimer's disease?</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon. My name is Caroline Rodgers. Some of you may remember me from previous presentations regarding ionizing radiation. Today I am confining my comments to work done by scientists -- some of them giants in the field -- investigating the role of excess brain iron in Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>We know that excess brain iron is associated with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and that iron stores accumulate with age <sup>1-6</sup>. Many diseases that are risk factors for Alzheimer's, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, also are associated with accumulated iron stores <sup>3</sup>. Studies have shown consistent correlations between iron overload and cognitive deficits, with the reduction of iron stores via chelation showing some cognitive improvement <sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>There is evidence that health issues associated with Alzheimer's that affect seniors, such as the onset of epilepsy <sup>7,8</sup> or age-related macular degeneration <sup>9, 10</sup>, also involve excess iron, making one wonder whether many diseases considered "age-related" would be more accurately termed "iron-related."</p>
<p>In terms of Alzheimer's distinctive neuropathology, investigators have found evidence that its two hallmarks, amyloid plaques and tau tangles, are involved with iron regulation <sup>1, 2, 4-6, 11, 12</sup>.</p>
<p>On the genetic front, scientists have found that Alzheimer's and hemachromatosis, which causes iron overload, have genes in common <sup>3, 6</sup>. Even more interesting is the discovery earlier this year suggesting that the APOE gene is involved in iron regulation. In the study, the APOE4 allele -- the one most clearly associated with Alzheimer's -- was linked to higher cerebrospinal ferritin levels, which are considered a marker for brain iron load <sup>13</sup>. Perhaps analyzing the iron levels of individuals with the APOE4 variation would shed light on why some, but not all carriers of this allele develop dementia.</p>
<p>If excess brain iron is the key to what has become such a major threat to individual and national health, it opens up many promising avenues for diagnosis, intervention and prevention. For instance:</p>
<ul><li>Blood tests can be used to detect when iron excesses are developing <sup>13, 14</sup></li>
<li>MRIs can identify those most at risk of Alzheimer's in time for interventions <sup>5</sup></li>
<li>Geneticists can devise gene therapies for variations that cause iron dysregulation</li>
<li>Pharmaceutical companies can develop more effective chelators that reduce side effects <sup>1, 2, 5, 6</sup></li>
<li>Phlebotomy can be employed as a non-toxic, long-term means of reducing iron stores <sup>3</sup></li>
<li>Dietary initiatives can reduce iron absorption <sup>6</sup></li>
</ul><p>A national campaign to address dementia by monitoring and safely minimizing iron accumulation in adults could simultaneously reduce the prevalence of other costly diseases that impair quality of life or cause premature death.

<p>There is much to praise and to be grateful for in the 2015 National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Thanks to Secretary Burwell, Assistant Secretary Frank, Deputy Assistant Secretary Elam for their leadership on the plan and the impressive progress that has been made since 2011 in all areas.</p>
<p>Calls for additional investment in Alzheimer's disease research and care have been a consistent theme in the 3.5 years since the National Alzheimer's Project Act was implemented. The 25% increase in AD research funding at the NIH since 2011 is significant and appreciated.</p>
<p>A larger issue that we've been discussing around NIH funding prioritization is for NIH to consider costs to public healthcare programs (i.e. Medicare and Medicaid) as part of its prioritization for research investment in specific conditions. Economic burden on public healthcare programs is <strong>not</strong> currently considered as part of the existing strategic planning process at NIH. An April 2014 GAO [<a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/gao-14-246">http://www.gao.gov/products/gao-14-246</a>] study found that the five selected ICs--awarding the largest amount of research funding--that it reviewed did so considering similar factors and using various priority-setting approaches. In priority setting, IC officials reported taking into consideration scientific needs and opportunities, gaps in funded research, the burden of disease in a population, and public health need, such as an emerging public health threat like influenza that needs to be addressed. Those are all very valid and important considerations, but we would argue that costs to healthcare programs should also be a part of the research funding prioritization equation.</p>
<p>We encourage everyone here to take up this issue as part of the request for comment to the NIH-wide Strategic Plan by August 16, and I would ask that ASPE provide the RFI and instructions on how to submit comments at <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=46">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=46</a></p>
<p>Additionally, I want to call everyone's attention to the report FDA released about a week ago called "Targeted Drug Development: Why are Many Diseases Lagging Behind?" that specifically points to the scientific challenges that are thwarting drug development in complex diseases. Alzheimer's is one disease they mentioned <a href="http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/ucm454955.htm">http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/ucm454955.htm</a>. The piece basically say FDA is doing all it can but they need more science: "Like many other diseases of the brain, Alzheimer's illustrates the obstacles to development of biomarkers and targeted drugs when scientific research has not yet uncovered the underlying causes or pathways of a disease." It is sobering report, but very much on point and we look forward to exploring these issues further with the Neurology Review division at our September 16 ACT-AD meeting.</p>
<p>I was excited to see the reference to "expansion and enhancement" of Lifespan Respite Care in the plan as well as the regulatory review of adult day services. Both respite and adult day services are incredibly important aspects of family caregiver support that may reduce or delay institutionalization among individuals with dementia. While the initial work has been promising, these programs need much wider support and coverage in order to meet the huge demand.</p>
<p>I want to say a more specific word about the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer Caregiver Health (REACH) program. Believe it or not, this program was first funded by the NIA and NINR in 1995--20 years ago. There has been a REACH I study and a sequel, REACH II. It has been a VA-wide program since 2011 and AoA has also funded REACH programs throughout the country. Findings from the REACH studies showed improvements across many areas. Caregivers reported less "burden" and depression, and improved emotional well-being overall. They also reported gains in the areas of self-care and healthy behaviors, social support, and management of problem behaviors on the part of their loved ones with Alzheimer's disease. Plus, they gained an hour a day of time that was not consumed with caregiving duties.</p>
<p>While expanding REACH to Indian Country is another great step for this awesome program, I am wondering why HHS has not yet taken the step of making this a CMMI model program, or better yet, just going for it and implementing REACH CMS-wide. How many more years do folks have to wait?</p>
<p>Last, it is terrific that HHS is refreshing the Alzheimer.gov website. Two things I noticed: 1) it takes several clicks to get to specific info on research studies. It would be great if this could be more streamlined and if folks could access it more directly from the home page with a "find out about research studies in your area" subhead.</p>
<p>And 2) the tagline for the site- "alzheimers.gov- for the people helping people with Alzheimer's" seems to unintentionally overlook individuals with the disease, as well as others who may know someone dealing with it, or just want to learn about it. I'd love to see another tagline that invites everyone in. The community needs it, and it's getting bigger and bigger every day.</p>

<p>Hello. My name is Matthew Sharp. I am the Program Manager for The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (or AFTD). I would like to take today's focus on the related dementias as an opportunity to share some more details about the work AFTD does and the resources and information available to help people living or working with FTD understand this complex disease and connect with others for help and support.</p>
<p>But first I want to acknowledge the time and attention given to the Related Dementias today and express AFTD's gratitude to this morning's speakers, for sharing their time, knowledge and expertise. Opportunities to hear from expert physicians with experience diagnosing and treating people with FTD or LBD are nearly as rare as these related dementias are. AFTD recognizes the council's commitment to understand the related dementias and appreciates the efforts made to find and invite this morning's speakers to today's meeting.</p>
<p>AFTD is a small, but growing, non-profit disease advocacy organization based outside of Philadelphia. We were founded in 2002 in order to support people living and working with FTD, provide current and accurate information about the disease and caring for a loved-one, and promote and support medical research to develop effective treatments and ultimately find a cure for FTD.</p>
<p>AFTD supports clinical and basic science research on FTD through a Pilot Grant program and a Post-doctoral Fellowship. We also offer a drug discovery grant in collaboration with the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) to accelerate and support innovative drug discovery programs and biomarker development for FTD. Our newest grant program, currently in development, will support an Economic Burden Study on FTD, to look at the toll FTD imposes across many levels of society and provide objective information to clarify the real costs of the disease.</p>
<p>AFTD is also excited to be one of the primary advocacy organizations involved with The Advancing Research and Treatment for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ARTFL) consortium. With funding awarded through NIH last fall, the ARTFL consortium will join advocacy organizations like AFTD together with academic research centers for the purpose of conducting clinical trials in FTD. The ARTFL consortium is, without a doubt, the most exciting and hopeful FTD research projects ever and AFTD is honored to be involved.</p>
<p>In addition to promoting research AFTD is dedicated to helping anyone coping with FTD find the support, information and resources needed to maintain as high a quality of life as possible for both themselves and their loved-ones. AFTD's website offers up-to-date and reliable information about the disease and appropriate care, and we will send printed material to anyone who requests it. All the medical information on the site is reviewed by expert physicians and neurologists from our Medical Advisory Board (which includes Dr. Lippa) and is updated as needed to reflect the progress being made by research on FTD and related neurological diseases. We also include regional listings of medical centers in the US (plus a few in Canada) with a special interest in FTD research. These centers offer diagnostic expertise for anyone worried about having FTD as well as opportunities for people with FTD to participate in clinical trials or other types of medical research. Whenever possible we include the name and contact information of the individual to follow-up with to enroll in a research study, schedule an appointment for a diagnostic evaluation, or access other services that may be available. I am pleased to report that we currently struggling to come up with the best way to respond to medical centers and neurological practices that ASK US to be listed on the website. For the first decade or so of AFTD's life we faced the opposite problem and didn't know enough centers doing FTD research as we would like to list on the website. And while there are still some large sections of the country without any specialized medical resources for FTD this is definitely a good problem to have and another sign of progress.</p>
<p>In addition to the website, the primary point of contact for people to learn more about the resources available from AFTD is our Helpline. The Helpline is not "live" but people may call (toll-free) or email the Helpline as needed with questions or concerns and an AFTD staff member will respond as soon as possible. On average, AFTD staff respond to about 40 Helpline cases per week, and provide answers and information, help finding necessary services or connecting to others for support, as well as material and resources as requested. If we cannot answer a question or find a resource we will try to connect callers to someone who can. While fewer than in the past, there are still too many Helpline calls for which we can only offer our time to listen with a sympathetic ear. It is our sincere hope that the number of these cases will continue to decrease as awareness spreads and resources grow, but, nothing else AFTDs Helpline still provides a doorway through which people struggling with FTD can connect to a growing network of caregivers, people with the disease, and knowledgeable professionals for help and support.</p>
<p>Thanks again for this opportunity to describe the resources available through AFTD, as well as the interest and attention given to FTD today. The Councils continued commitment to including the related dementias in the work and scope of NAPA is deeply appreciated.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>NAPA Advisory Council Meeting<br />
					Public Statement</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to address the Council today. Some of you may remember me as a regular attendee during the first two years after the NAPA was implemented. It is a privilege to be back again today.</p>
<p>I am here as a <strong><em>family advocate</em></strong> for individuals with intellectual disabilities and their families. I also come as a member of the NTG, a grass roots organization designed to increase the awareness of and services for those with ID who face the challenges of aging and further cognitive decline, including dementia.</p>
<p>My Brother Bill had Down syndrome and died of complications of Alzheimer's disease at age 49. (<em>Page 1 handout</em>). As advocates, our family was dedicated to insuring quality of life and quality of care across his life span, with a focus on physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease required intensified efforts that we could barely muster and was the greatest challenge that we faced as a family in Bill's lifetime. It was a cruel and painful journey, filled with many unanticipated obstacles. After Bill's death I vowed that I would work hard so that other individuals and families would be spared this same experience. Today I am joined in spirit by the NTG and many families as I appeal to you to further include this special population in all aspects of research, care planning and funding.</p>
<p>Over the course of the past five years I have been blessed to meet many families from across the country. Some have been siblings and some aging parents who have continued to care for their loved ones as they all age simultaneously. There are a number of common concerns (<em>Page 2 handout</em>) that have been expressed. These include:</p>
<ul><li>Lack of information, especially at time of diagnosis</li>
<li>Profound sense of <strong>Loss</strong> with further diagnosis</li>
<li>Fear about future-including financial fears</li>
<li>Difficulty formulating long term plan</li>
<li>Struggle to access community based coordinated care</li>
<li>Difficulty partnering with medical community</li>
<li>Being overwhelmed by demands of caregiving</li>
<li>Isolation and abandonment</li>
<li>End of life issues</li>
</ul><p>During my last public statement at a Council meeting a little over two years ago in the spring of 2013, I spoke of the urgent need of aging caregivers. I told of Betty, currently age 86, Frank, currently age 90 and Richard, soon to be 49, a special family who lives in a very small mid-western town (<em>Page 3 handout</em>).</p>
<p>Despite the presence of a small group home for medically fragile in their former community, Richard was not able to access the facility because of his diagnosis of AD. In April 2013, with family care giving resources depleted, Richard made the move to a 60-bed nursing home that was designed to meet the needs of individuals with ID and physical and mental health challenges. Richard was one of very few patients with AD and the staff was not specifically trained in the disease process. He was initially treated with Risperdal, as he was mobile at the time of admission and deemed a "challenging patient". Soon after he exhibited an adverse drug reaction. His parents alerted the staff to the observable changes and the medication was Dc'd. However, within 4 months of his admission to the facility, Richard had declined rapidly. By August 2013, Richard became wheel chair bound, had limited oral or physical responses and was totally dependent on others for all care. He experienced more frequent seizures and has been on increased medications.</p>
<p>Because of the distance of the facility from the family home and failing health, Betty, age 86, and Frank, age 90, relocated to the town of 1500 where Richard currently resides. They are a presence in the facility and committed to being there for Richard as he continues his decline. They are grateful for the care that Richard receives but mourn the loss of their socially active, garrulous son who can no longer utter a word. Formerly a man with a robust appetite, he can no longer lift a spoon to feed himself. They are pained by the emptiness in his once sparkling eyes. Richard will mark his 49th birthday in August of this year. (<em>Page 4 handout</em>)</p>
<p>Mr. S., age 87, still works part time including as a statistician for a major league football team, despite Parkinson's disease. His wife, soon to be age 84, has Alzheimer's disease. Their son Georgie, who had Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, died at home, this past March with his parents and sisters at his bedside. He was 51 years old and succumbed to aspiration pneumonia, a common complication of AD. (<em>Page 5 handout</em>)</p>
<p>Georgie's parents <strong><em>paid</em> for 24 hour private care</strong> and they honored his wish to stay home for over 3 years, as he declined. The only other option was a nursing home, where he did have a short stay after a broken foot. His sister Mary reported that every day after the nursing home stay, Georgie would wake up and he'd ask his Dad..."I stay home, Daddy?" Three of Georgie's sisters, Nancy, Pattie and Debbie live nearby and were instrumental in his care and that of their Mother. Georgie also had two special caregivers, Chris and Mark who helped to make home care possible. For all it was a labor of love, performed without question. The high cost was heartbreak. (<em>Page 6 handout</em>)</p>
<p>Georgie's family misses his smile and his sense of humor. And when they think of him, they remember his favorite song... <em>I've got that joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart...Down in my heart to stay!</em></p>
<p>I close with a brief recount of Fran and her family. She notes that 4 generations have been impacted by aging and concomitant decline. Fran's mother had been in a nursing home for a prolonged period of time and diagnosed with Parkinson's diseases and Lewy Body Dementia. The family assumed the cost of her care up until the time of her death. (<em>Page 7 handout</em>)</p>
<p>Fran's only sibling is a brother, age 65. He lives 7 hours away from her, has Down syndrome and is in the end stages of AD. Efforts to bring her brother closer to her were complicated by funding restraints from state to state and guardianship challenges. When her brother was no longer able to stay in the group home in which he had lived for 2 decades, a crises occurred. Where would he live? Who would cover the cost? What happened to his former funding stream? Her brother is now in a nursing home and the family worries from month to month about how the costs will be covered. Hospice came and went when he no longer met their criteria, taking a greatly needed wheel chair with them. The family then funded a $3500 chair so that he would not be bed ridden. Exhausting advocacy issues have intensified as his disease has progressed.</p>
<p>Fran, like many others, is emotionally overwhelmed and plagued by guilt over lost time with and attention to her husband, children and grandchildren as she tends to issues of intergenerational decline. She laments the fact that her brother, with his lifetime of cognitive impairment, was never able to communicate end of life wishes. She is often is faced with guardianship issues that may have best been modified years ago.</p>
<p>Their plight is real...the needs of individuals and families great. Families who have been lifetime caregivers often feel abandoned in the end. They have worked hard to independently provide care in the past. They now need extensive support that they struggle to access. I urge you to leave here today, more than 4 years after NAPA was signed and implemented, with a renewed awareness of the critical needs that remain in existence today for this underserved group of people.</p>
<p>Documents were previously provided for today's presentations. I am hopeful that Director Hoffman of the Dept. of Health, State of NY will review the populations identified as "disproportionately impacted" in the ADCSI initiative and consider including family members with ID. This could serve as a model of what might be done across the USA. Director Hoffman and many other Advisory Council Members have been our great champions in the past and I am hoping to count on all of you in the future. Thanks for this opportunity to be the voice of many who would otherwise not be heard.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Statement of:<br />
					Ian N. Kremer, Esq.<br />
					Executive Director<br />
					Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD Coalition)</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon. My name is Ian Kremer and I serve as executive director of Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (the LEAD Coalition). The LEAD Coalition is a diverse and growing national coalition of 76 member organizations [<a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/">http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/</a>] including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, home and residential care providers, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. LEAD is co-convened by the Alzheimer's Foundation of America and USAgainstAlzheimer's. The coalition works collaboratively to focus the nation's strategic attention on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and to accelerate transformational progress in: detection and diagnosis; care and support to enrich quality of life; and research leading to prevention, effective treatment and eventual cure. For more information about the LEAD Coalition, please contact me at: ikremer@leadcoalition.org.</p>
<p>Typically, my public comments at the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services meetings are based on what has been presented and discussed by Advisory Council members to that point in the meeting day. In light of the recent request for comments to be submitted several days in advance of the meeting, this document submitted on July 22 attempts to anticipate what I might wish to say on July 27. I hope that the Advisory Council will forgive me any extemporaneous remarks that I might offer during the public comment session on July 27.</p>
<p>I must begin by recognizing HHS staff and Secretary Burwell for the recently published <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease: 2015 Update</em> [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/NatlPlan2015.shtml">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/NatlPlan2015.shtml</a>]. The 2015 Update reflects enormous good work done to date and constructive work being planned. It is particularly valuable that the 2015 Update reminds us all that the National Alzheimer's Project Act called for a 'national' rather than 'federal' plan. While many of us outside government will continue to call for even more robust federal efforts in a number of areas (including and particularly areas in which the 2015 Update appears to come up short of the Advisory Council's recommendations), it is essential that those of us in the private sector continue to look for ways in which we can collaborate with federal partners and work to fill gaps in federal efforts. Exemplary of productive collaboration between private and federal partners is the recently announced launch of the Dementia Friendly America initiative [<a href="http://www.dfamerica.org/">http://www.dfamerica.org/</a>] to build dementia friendly communities across the country. More than 50 national organizations and several federal agencies have worked together closely to reach this starting point. Our success depends on that collaboration growing more robust, more imbedded in the organizational cultures of our public and private partners, and on us sustaining our moral and substantive commitment to be guided in our work by those who rightly measure our results: people with dementia and their loved ones whose quality of life we seek to transform. National organizations interested in learning more about the Dementia Friendly America initiative are encouraged to contact us at: partners@dfamerica.org.</p>
<p>I also want to take a moment to thank the organizers, sponsors, attendees, presenters, and journalists reporting on last week's Alzheimer's Association International Conference [<a href="https://www.alz.org/aaic/">https://www.alz.org/aaic/</a>]. It isn't enough that important science be conducted. It must be exposed to scrutiny, put in context, disseminated among colleagues, and understood by those who fund, who volunteer, who stand to benefit. Children wonder how Santa delivers all those packages in a single night; I wonder how Maria Carrillo herds 4,000 scientists for a week. Somehow -- perhaps with the help of Alzheimer's Association elves -- magic happens and we're all the better for it.</p>
<p>Today's Advisory Council meeting focus on non-Alzheimer's dementias [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/meetings.shtml#Jul2015">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/meetings.shtml#Jul2015</a>] -- while overdue -- is highly encouraging. I hope it represents a sustained commitment both to discuss and to substantively address these issues more consistently in the Advisory Council and National Plan Update processes. Certainly, the upcoming ADRD Summit organized by NINDS provides another important pivot point for the Advisory Council and Plan Update processes to engage non-Alzheimer's dementias more effectively.</p>
<p>While we all ought to be sympathetic to the limitations of time and other resources available to the Advisory Council, to make the Plan genuinely 'national' and not only 'federal,' it is essential to find creative, manageable and productive ways to add more -- and more diverse -- voices. A number of us have encouraged expansion of the Advisory Council to include both more appointees living with dementia and more representatives from non-Alzheimer's dementia communities. Those remain good, constructive, and achievable recommendations; as private sector stakeholders, we are ready to work with our federal partners to achieve the achievable. Similarly, I would encourage collaboration between private sector stakeholders and our federal partners to find new and better ways for people to participate in the Advisory Council process even if they are unable to attend the quarterly meetings in Washington or do not want to be limited to submitting written comments or watching a live-streaming video. While those options may be sufficient for some, clearly they are inadequate for many. Just to offer one example (and I have others), with support from private sector stakeholders, it ought to possible to conduct regularly scheduled public input listening sessions around the country, attended by Advisory Council members either in person or at least by video feed who then could report back to the full Advisory Council.</p>
<p>This is a time of great and deserved hope in dementia. No one could miss the depth and breadth of attention devoted to dementia throughout the White House Conference on Aging (thank you Nora Super, AARP, and everyone else who led and contributed). We all anticipate anxiously NIH's so-called "bypass budget" [<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/features/nih-estimate-total-funding-needs-alzheimers-research">https://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/features/nih-estimate-total-funding-needs-alzheimers-research</a>] recommendation for federal funding needed to reach the 2025 goal. The advocacy and research communities have been vigorous in encouraging NIH to be bold in its recommendation and take confidence in the legislation put forward by the House and Senate appropriations committees along with the 21st Century Cures legislation. Shortly after the Advisory Council's last meeting, 137 LEAD Coalition member organizations and other supporters submitted to HHS a recommendation that federal agencies and private sector stakeholders partner to organize and conduct a dementia care and services research summit [<a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/?wpfb_dl=158">http://www.leadcoalition.org/?wpfb_dl=158</a>]. HHS recently responded that Secretary Burwell will ask the Advisory Council for guidance so -- on behalf of those 137 signatories -- I'll take this opportunity to encourage the Advisory Council to advise the Secretary to be bold in collaborating with us to identify research gaps and priorities as well as opportunities to translate and scale what we know already to be effective in improving the quality of life for the most important stakeholders: people living with dementia and their care partners. And in the best interests of those most important stakeholders, we will begin now with our private sector partners to develop the resources necessary to conduct such a summit as soon as our federal partners are ready to join us.</p>
<p>The need for wide dissemination of effective care and services interventions is highlighted in part by the recently released report <em>Caregiving in the U.S. 2015</em> [<a href="http://www.caregiving.org/caregiving2015/">http://www.caregiving.org/caregiving2015/</a>]. I would encourage the Advisory Council to invite Gail Hunt from the National Alliance for Caregiving and Susan Reinhard from AARP to provide a briefing about the report at an upcoming Advisory Council meeting, with a particular focus on care involving people with dementia.</p>
<p>In closing, I offer my apologies for topics I have failed to address and my thanks to others making public comments addressing my omissions. I offer my appreciation to Advisory Council members and staff who give of their minds and hearts beyond what words can express. I offer my hope to all those living with dementia and their loved ones that they will be heard, heeded, and healed through the work we all do together.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Public Comments to the NAPA Advisory Council<br />
					July 27, 2015</strong></p>
<p>My name is Karen Love and I am here representing the Dementia Action Alliance. Thank you, NAPA Advisory Council members, for the opportunity to provide comments today. The release of the <em>2015 National Alzheimer's Plan</em> is a testament to the amount of work undertaken by federal agencies since 2011 as well as the many efforts currently underway. Thank you, Dr. Elam and Dr. Petersen, for your committed and able leadership.</p>
<p>To date NAPA has not yet addressed the need for a coordinated, national plan to address societal misperceptions and stigmas about dementia, including Alzheimer's that affects how people live with this chronic condition. The internet has provided a valuable way for people who are living with dementia in the early stages to write about their lived experiences and express how stigmas impact their well-being.</p>
<p>Sandy Halperin, who you met during the April Advisory Council meeting, often has to remind people that he is still living and not dead yet, so please treat him as a living human being. Another outspoken advocate, Harry Urban, writes, "Don't stereotype me or underestimate me because I have Alzheimer's...help us regain respect and dignity so we may have a better quality of life". Imagine having a life-altering health condition AND having to advocate to be treated normally!</p>
<p>Kate Swaffer, diagnosed with young-onset dementia at the age of 49, was told by health care professionals to put her affairs in order and to begin looking into long term care options for later on. Others, including Harry Urban, are given prescriptions and told to come back in six months. Kate coined the term "prescribed disengagement" to describe this mindset. She say, "This sets us up to live a life without hope, without a sense of a future and destroys the notion of well-being." Christine Bryden, in her 2005 book "Dancing with Dementia: My Story of Living Positively with Dementia," says -- "How you relate to us has a big impact on the course of the disease. You can restore our personhood, and give us a sense of being needed and valued...Give us reassurance, hugs, support, a meaning in life. Value us for what we can still do and be."</p>
<p>Most people do not realize they have misperceptions about living with dementia let alone realize the impact the misperceptions have on the emotional and social well-being of individuals who are living with the condition. Understanding how important it is for them to be meaningfully engaged in things they find interesting in daily life, having purpose and being valued are as vital to their well-being as their physical health.</p>
<p>Additionally, many of the words that are widely used are stigmatizing. Often words such as "victim," "demented," and "sufferer" are used to describe a person who has dementia and words including "dementing illness," "tragedy," and "affliction" to define the condition. This type of language can make a tremendous impact on how people living with dementia feel about themselves, and how they are treated and considered by others. Using appropriate words is respectful, supportive, and non-discriminatory.</p>
<p>Under GOAL 4 of the National Plan -- Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement -- we ask you to please include this year in your planning the development of a coordinated public-private, national awareness campaign to educate the public about living with dementia including addressing the stigmas and misperceptions.</p>

<p>Good Morning, my name is Yvonne Eisner. I would like to thank you and the Care More Medical Group for the opportunity to speak today. I am speaking of my experience as a caregiver for my mother Amelia Simpson who suffered from Dementia.</p>
<p>I cannot remember when I first heard my mother was diagnosed with dementia or when I first saw it written. It just seemed to appear without any official acknowledgement of its existence. In some ways dementia affected me the same way it affected her. Little by little your life changes and you become involved in the problem or issue of the moment and you don't see that you are deeply involved in a very daunting and emotionally draining journey. Vascular dementia slowly shut her physical and mental function.</p>
<p>We were referred to Care More's Mental Health Clinic where Monica Cheng the psychiatric nurse practitioner prescribed medication and referred us to the Brain Health Clinic. The clinic not only treated my mother but in a sense treated me, ensuring I would be able to cope and provide her the care she needed. Unfortunately, mom's condition worsened rapidly and she was not able to fully benefit from the program.</p>
<p>As her caregiver I was at a loss, tending to the day to day issues of caring for my mother that I was not able to understand and or deal with her decline. I could have read all the information available on the internet regarding dementia but I could have not been able to process the information until Dr. Debra Hadden and Amy Pound, MSW of the Care More Brain Health Clinic explained it. It was then that I understood the reasons for her behavior. They also taught me how to understand the disease and take better care of her.</p>
<p>Dr. Hadden and Amy, educate patients, family and caregivers on what the disease is, how to cope with it and most importantly provide support. The three Brain Health Classes provided are Disease Management for basic understanding of her individual case; how the dementia affected her ability to swallow and walk and the nuance of dementia such as personality traits can be exaggerated which was making her difficult to deal with and care for. Safety issues of dementia, which had we attended sooner could have avoided urgent care visits and Legal Issues of Dementia, the importance of an advanced directive and power of attorney for health care</p>
<p>This leads me to an example I would like to provide of why educating the patient, family and caregivers early is extremely crucial. My mom was experiencing shortness of breath. She was tested for blockages. The test was inconclusive, the shortness of breath continued. I thought the shortness of breath was minimal and might actually be anxiety. What she was experiencing did not interfere with her quality of life but stents were placed in her arteries. The procedure itself went well, but she lost a lot of blood and needed a transfusion, upon being discharged she had a seizure and was then admitted for observation. If there had been a protocol in place where the Brain Health Clinic had been in the loop, the procedure may have not taken place and she would not have had to experience that ordeal, which was very traumatic for her and me.</p>
<p>Early detection and education is so crucial not only the reasons I mention but mostly to provide the patient with the best quality of life during their last years by educating the family and caregivers to develop the coping skills necessary to care for the patient. Before being a part of the Brain Health Clinic I wasted so much time and energy attempting to reason with her, only to increase her anxiety and paranoia. I worried, cried and became so stressed that I was considering the possibility of admitting her into a nursing home. Something I never wanted for my mother.</p>
<p>Please understand this is very personal to me because if it were not for the support of the Brain Health Clinic I would have not been able to keep my mom at home. So if you can please put yourself in my place and see that without this program my mother would have spent her last year or years living with and being cared for by strangers.</p>
<p>I would like to close this by expressing my most sincere wish. I hope that the words I and speak will lead to a protocol that would include early detection of dementia and Alzheimer's to be placed on the annual physical exam, where a patient can be referred to the Brain Clinic for further evaluation. In the event that dementia or Alzheimer's wasn't detected at least it will bring awareness to the patient and family. In the event that it is, it will provide education of the disease, knowledge of how to handle it and the support to do it successfully.</p>

<p>We would like to thank and commend Co-chairs Laurel Coleman, M.D., and Susan Mitchell, M.D. as well as the staff of Institute of Medicine, for inviting us to the recently concluded series of meetings on advanced dementia care. Observing the discussions on research, innovative program models and policy was stimulating, and reflected a deep commitment on the part of the presenters and IOM to promoting person-centered dementia care. The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) strongly supports the resulting recommendations for the 2015 update of the National Plan to address Alzheimer's disease, developed in consultation with the experts invited to speak at the IOM meetings, and presented on January 26 by Dr. Mitchell and Laurel Coleman, M.D. Chair of the clinical care sub-committee of the NAPA advisory council.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the National Alzheimer's Plan defines "Alzheimer's disease" to include related disorders, it is important to note that existing research, policy and models of care in advanced dementia focus exclusively on an older adult and frail elderly dementia population. Persons with younger-onset dementias and their families face additional complex needs throughout the course of the disease, including in advanced stages. To be consistent with the aims of NAPA, any plan for advanced dementia care must therefore address the needs of the entire dementia population, including those affected by rarer, younger-onset disorders, such as frontotemporal degeneration (FTD).</p>
<p>FTD disorders are distinct from elderly dementia and Alzheimer's disease in two important aspects: they have an earlier age of onset; and cause impairment in executive functioning, language and movement, rather than memory. The age of onset is usually between 45 and 65 years but FTD can affect people as early as their 20's. While the aging services network is the principle provider of services needed by people with FTD, individuals and families are routinely denied services because they do not meet age eligibility, criteria and providers do not understand their needs</p>
<p>Recommendations to improve advanced dementia care including access to palliative care and hospice, preparation of a competent workforce, establishment of quality metrics, and leveraging policy and payment mechanisms to ensure high quality, person-centered care are necessary but grounded in elderly dementia and not sufficient to address the needs of younger persons with dementia and their families. For example:</p>
<ul><li>Hospice criteria for dementia must reflect an understanding of the erratic course of disease and varied end of life symptoms in a younger person with advanced frontotemporal degeneration. Predicting the last six months of life in persons with FTD can be especially challenging; and the lack of specific criteria for appropriately initiating referrals for hospice services means many medical providers and FTD families do not benefit from this important resource.</li>
<li>Research has shown that the difficulty obtaining a diagnosis of FTD, the early age of onset, and the presence of behavioral symptoms contribute to greater caregiver burden in FTD compared to Alzheimer's disease. Families facing FTD are more likely to be at the height of careers and family life; coupled with a higher burden of disease management, this can easily preempt discussions around plans for future healthcare needs and reduces the use of advanced directives or other tools to clarify vital care choices prior to medical crises.</li>
<li>Education on the distinct diagnostic, medical and psychosocial characteristics and needs of persons with FTD disorders is sorely lacking and much needed for geriatricians, palliative care physicians, neurologists, psychiatrists, primary care physicians and other healthcare providers who serve people with advanced dementia across federal and state long-term services and supports.</li>
<li>People with FTD face many difficult care transitions as the disease progresses. Poor coordination of services and the lack of access to appropriate care in the community frequently result in costly psychiatric inpatient admissions, greater use of psychotropic medications and increased utilization of high-cost care in advanced stages of the disease.</li>
</ul><p>Anecdotally, we know that the medical, behavioral and psychosocial needs of persons with younger-onset dementia differ from elderly persons with advanced dementia; yet health policy research initiatives typically focus on an elderly population and exclude data on individuals under 65. Additional mechanisms are needed to fill knowledge gaps and track the functional and cognitive trajectories of people with FTD or other forms of younger-onset dementia in order to fully inform and improve the quality of advanced dementia care.</p>
<p>As the Advisory Council considers the recommendations developed through the advanced dementia meetings at IOM and the important issues surrounding advanced dementia, AFTD implores you to not neglect the needs of people with FTD and other forms of dementia, many of whom are under age 65 and not adequately represented in current thinking about advanced dementia care focused on the elderly population. Some possible mechanisms to ensure this broader perspective are:</p>
<ul><li>Include representatives from FTD and other younger-onset dementias in the development and implementation of the goals and strategies in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease to improve care in advanced dementia</li>
<li>Promote initiatives to fund and conduct research into the health care utilization of persons under age 65 with dementia and develop innovative models of care for persons with advanced younger-onset dementia.</li>
<li>Expand and develop services under Title III of the Older Americans Act to include people with younger-onset dementia.</li>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>NATIONAL PLAN GOALS: TIME TO MAKE THEM HAPPEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>I. NAPA Accomplishments </strong></p>
<p>Since the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease was first released,<sup>1</sup> there has been progress in establishing a cohesive and comprehensive national strategy to fight the illness. Strides have been made in federal agency interaction and coordination, increasing educational materials and outreach and promoting awareness through social and traditional media. National action has spurred movement at the state level and a vast majority of states now have their own plans to coordinate resources and services, often resulting in dynamic care delivery programs that provide better outcomes at lower costs.</p>
<p>Yet, more must - and needs - to be done. Many of the action steps taken have required little resources. While it's a start, these are merely low-hanging fruit and the heavy lifting remains. In addition to increased federal resources, we need better tools are needed to ensure early and accurate diagnosis of dementia. New, coordinated care delivery models that are more efficient and yield better outcomes must be adopted nationally. States need to be more fully engaged and the US needs to further its commitment to international efforts.</p>
<p>As the NAPA Advisory Board continues its work, we must move beyond the edges of policy. While the national Alzheimer's plan established lofty, but achievable goals, sufficient resources are needed if we are to make real progress in eradicating this devastating brain disorder and developing a cure or meaningful treatment by 2025. Further, federal health programs need to remove barriers to access and recognize the growing need for custodial and long-term care services and supports for individuals living with dementia and their family caregivers.</p>
<p>Solutions are readily available to reduce costs of care while promoting better outcomes for individuals with dementia and their family caregivers. The national Alzheimer's plan already contains a number of such recommendations, which, if implemented could save significant resources. In addition national stakeholders, including the Alzheimer's Foundation of America (AFA), have contributed constructive comments, ideas and proposals for the NAPA Advisory Board to consider when developing their annual report for HHS.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>AFA would like to build upon these past proposals and offer the following new recommendations to further the process and ensure implementation of the national Alzheimer's plan on a credible pathway toward achieving its core objectives. These new proposals, moreover, are not costly, can be quickly implemented and will have an immediate, positive impact in achieving the objectives of the national Alzheimer's plan. They include:</p>
<ul><li>Calling on CMS to develop and execute a timeline in which they will nationally adopt and broadly implement innovative care delivery models.</li>
<li>Encouraging states to develop their own Alzheimer's plans and increase states' involvement in the national Alzheimer's plan.</li>
<li>Promoting and expanding opportunities for cognitive memory screening.</li>
<li>Increasing the federal commitment to international efforts fighting Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Increasing resources for Alzheimer's disease research and caregiver supports and services.</li>
</ul><p><strong>II. AFA Recommendations </strong></p>
<p>Adopting innovative care delivery models, expanding transitional care programs, and expanding caregiver supports can reduce hospitalizations, decrease emergency room visits and delay costly nursing home placement.</p>
<p>As outlined in AFA's "Cost of Care: Quantifying Care-Centered Provisions of the 'National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease" report,<sup>3</sup> recommendations such as medical homes and enhanced caregiver training and supports, will provide significant cost savings--more than $110 billion during a 10-year period--while promoting better health outcomes for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, and improving quality of life for their caregivers.</p>
<p>An independent study of a Minnesota dementia caregiver program found that, if fully implemented, the program would save the state nearly $1 billion over 15 years,<sup>4</sup> further underscoring the findings of AFA's "Cost of Care" report.</p>
<p>In the coming year, CMS is expected to release data from demonstration projects, including several involving dementia care delivery models. This should provide the necessary evidence for federal health programs to move ahead with alacrity to implement such programs nationwide. As demonstrated in Minnesota, small investments in supports that provide caregiver tools and strategies yields major savings and better outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>AFA, therefore, urges the NAPA Advisory Board to recommend that CMS develop and execute a timeline in which they will nationally adopt and broadly implement the innovative care models and enhanced caregiver support recommendations that are included in the national Alzheimer's plan. </strong></p>
<p>In an effort to help advance the goals of the national Alzheimer's plan at the state level, the National Alliance for Caregiving and AFA released a white paper that examines the scope of the Alzheimer's crisis, and the need for wide-scale implementation of state plans that address supportive services specific to state localities.<sup>5</sup> The report offers six key recommendations, applicable to both new and existing state plans:</p>
<ul><li>Establish and maintain a task force of Alzheimer's disease stakeholders, including government officials, community groups, individuals with dementia, and family caregivers.</li>
<li>Assess the ability of the state Alzheimer's disease community to support diagnosed individuals and their families.</li>
<li>Develop a state plan for Alzheimer's disease that includes goals specific to the state population, and outlines measures to track progress.</li>
<li>Keep stakeholders engaged in the design, implementation and evaluation of the plan.</li>
<li>Recognize that state plans are "living documents," and modify them, as appropriate, over time.</li>
<li>Learn from the successes and challenges of other states and the national plan.<sup>6</sup></li>
</ul><p>States are the often called the laboratory of democracy<sup>7</sup> and their freedom to innovate, customize and target policy can produce effective models, some of which can be replicated on both state and federal levels. Yet, there is no process or forum to share successes, discuss failures and identify gaps in policy. There needs to be greater communication, not only between states, but between states and the NAPA Advisory Board so federal officials can be keyed into valuable input from their efforts.</p>
<p><strong>AFA urges further encouragement of states to develop their own plans, increase states' involvement with the NAPA Advisory Board and establish a forum within the National Governors Association or National Council on State Legislatures for states to share best practices and successful recommendations with their peers. </strong></p>
<p>Misdiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is already rampant, leading to unnecessary costs and, most importantly, risks to individuals. Memory screening is necessary, therefore to ensure a timely and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. With early detection, individuals with dementia can receive available therapy earlier in the disease progression when most available treatments for Alzheimer's disease are most helpful. Early identification allows optimal therapy with available and emerging medications.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), moreover, is focusing more clinical research on individuals earlier in the disease process. AFA can appreciate the difficulty in developing meaningful diagnostic criteria for preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Yet, cognitive screening can help identify pre-symptomatic individuals and others with mild cognitive impairment who can populate these necessary and vital drug trials that give hope to millions with dementia.</p>
<p>Despite these advantages, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has failed to recognize cognitive screening as necessary for older adults.<sup>8</sup> While USPSTF found adequate evidence that some screening tools have sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful in identifying dementia, they found inadequate direct evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment and of non-pharmacologic interventions.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Memory screening is gaining ground thanks to increased awareness about Alzheimer's disease, as well as the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, which includes a cognitive assessment.<sup>10</sup> In addition, during AFA's 2014 National Memory Screening Day this past November, more than 6,000 sites across the country provided free confidential screenings, as well as education on good brain health, to tens of thousands of participants.</p>
<p><strong>AFA urges the NAPA Advisory Board to further promote and expand opportunities for memory screening. The NAPA Advisory Board should call for more research on cognitive screening and its impact on individual care choices and identify new technologies that can test and track cognitive functioning. </strong></p>
<p>There has been considerable movement in the worldwide effort to fight Alzheimer's disease. Since the G8 Summit held in London in late 2013, there has been a more coordinated international effort in combating dementia. The G-7 has committed to identifying a cure or a disease modifying therapy by 2025 and to increase funding for dementia research.<sup>11</sup> To this end, international policy makers have met at various legacy meetings throughout 2014 (with more scheduled in 2015, including a meeting in February at NIH). In addition, Dr. Dennis Gillings, consultant to the pharmaceutical industry and founder of a drug trial, has been appointed by the UK Prime Minister as the World Dementia Envoy.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>As a leader in Alzheimer's disease research, the US needs to continue its commitment to these international organizations. The sharing of research data, best practices and study results will speed drug development and help achieve the shared 2025 goal. The NAPA Advisory Board acknowledges this need and, in the past year, has heard from international Alzheimer's advocates and has been briefed on worldwide efforts.</p>
<p><strong>It is imperative, therefore, that the 2015 NAPA Advisory Board recommendations include greater commitment to these international efforts. In addition, representatives of the State Department be invited to join the NAPA Advisory Board. </strong></p>
<p>Without adequate resources, getting to the 2025 NAPA goal will be arduous and success will be put in doubt. Investment in promising research is imperative to meet these ambitious, yet achievable goals. Despite the need, spending on Alzheimer's disease research lags far behind research resources spent on other major diseases. In FY 2013, the National Institutes for Health (NIH) spent approximately $504 million for Alzheimer's disease, while $5.2 billion went to cancer research; $2.9 billion for HIV/AIDS; $2 billion for cardiovascular disease; $1.2 billion for heart disease; and more than $1 billion for diabetes.<sup>13</sup> Without the same commitment for Alzheimer's disease, costs will continue to rise at unprecedented rates, promising research will remain unfunded, and hope will be diminished for the millions living with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>The NAPA Advisory Board needs to recommend Congress "double down" on Alzheimer's disease research to $1 billion in FY'16 and work with appropriating committees in Congress on a pathway to get Alzheimer's disease research funding at $2 billion by the end of the current decade. </strong></p>
<p><strong>III. Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>These are challenging times, and limited resources call for creative solutions. Yet, we cannot simply maintain the status quo. Investment in research and caregiving services is the only way to ensure that we, as a nation, can overcome the growing human and fiscal crisis that is Alzheimer's disease. An international, comprehensive and coordinated effort is needed to combat the growing worldwide crisis of dementia impacting individuals and families regardless of race, creed, color or national origin.</p>
<p>The recent worldwide effort against Ebola can be instructive in developing a strategy that can contain and ultimately defeat the disease. In the case of Ebola, after an initial period of unpreparedness, economically advantaged nations took action and developed an international strategy to control the outbreak and develop a vaccine. For its part, the US will spend $5.2 billion in FY'15 alone on care, prevention and development of a viable vaccine to fight Ebola. While it is far from certain whether this current Ebola outbreak can be contained; the international commitment to adequately respond to the crisis, with proper initial resources, cannot be questioned.</p>
<p>Unlike Ebola, however, we know we are facing a growing worldwide dementia crisis and its impact on society is arguably greater. The national Alzheimer's plan sets a stage and provides guideposts and impactful endpoints. Yet, the missing piece is the necessary investment that can change trajectory of this disease and transform outcomes. Progress has already been made in several areas of the plan and some modest goals have been completed, yet we are nowhere near the ultimate prize of finding a treatment or cure, and our time to meet the 2025 goal is ticking away. Now is our time to make it happen, or chances are it never will.</p>

<p>Anthem appreciates the opportunity to submit comments to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer’s Research, Care, and Services. We share the Council’s goals to improve health outcomes, enhance quality care, and meet the needs of individuals, their families, and caregivers who are facing Alzheimer’s Disease or Related Dementias (ADRD).</p>
<p>Anthem is working to transform health care with trusted and caring solutions. Our health plan companies deliver quality products and services that give their members access to the care they need. With nearly 67 million people served by its affiliated companies, including nearly 37 million enrolled in its family of health plans, Anthem is one of nation’s leading health benefits companies. Anthem companies serve members as the Blue Cross licensee for California; and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield licensees for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (as the Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee in 10 New York City metropolitan and surrounding counties and as the Blue Cross or Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee in selected upstate counties only), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.), and Wisconsin. In most of these service areas, Anthem does business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, or Empire Blue Cross (in the New York service areas). It also serves customers in other states through its Amerigroup, CareMore and UniCare subsidiaries. To find out more about Anthem, go to AnthemInc.com.</p>
<p>Though important work continues on prevention of ADRD, we believe it is vitally important to address necessary systematic improvements in health care quality for individuals living with ADRD. As you are acutely aware, ADRD and the effects of these diseases can be devastating for individuals, as well as their families and caregivers. Over 5.2 million Americans of all ages have Alzheimer’s disease, including 5 million individuals age 65 and older and 200,000 individuals under age 65.<sup>1</sup> Additionally, it is estimated that 13.9 percent of individuals age 71 and older have dementia.<sup>2</sup> Individuals with ADRD are also more likely to have other chronic conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and these individuals are more likely to be hospitalized when compared to those without ADRD<sup>3</sup> . With an aging population and estimates that 13.8 million individuals or more will have Alzheimer’s by 2050, barring medical breakthroughs, there is an urgent need to find a better solution to improve the quality of life for individuals affected by ADRD.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>CareMore Health System, an Anthem subsidiary that operates Medicare Advantage plans, including Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plans (SNPs), provides proactive and innovative solutions to the complex issues associated with aging and chronic conditions, including ADRD. To address fragmented care and to ensure individuals with ADRD are receiving optimal care at the right time, CareMore developed and implemented a Brain Health Pilot Program (Brain Health Program).</p>
<p>CareMore’s specialized Brain Health Program is holistically centered on each individual member and excels by simplifying access to quality care, increasing communication, and providing a high-touch, timeintensive process of care. A multidisciplinary team consisting of a primary care provider, social worker, nutritionist, neurologist, neuropsychologist, pharmacist, education specialist, care manager, and other specialized ADRD caregivers work together to ensure care is appropriately tailored to each individual member.</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to increase each member’s quality of life. To achieve this, the Brain Health Program focused on the following objectives:</p>
<ul><li>Reduction of unnecessary hospitalizations</li>
<li>Reduction of falls and accidents, with an increase in overall safety</li>
<li>Reduction of medication errors</li>
<li>Optimization of medications across all chronic conditions</li>
<li>Increased treatment adherence</li>
<li>Increased coordination of care</li>
<li>Increased member, family, and caregiver satisfaction</li>
</ul><p>The impact of CareMore’s Brain Health Program has been striking. Over the course of a six-month screening period, we were able to significantly impact health outcomes leading to improved quality of care, while also supporting families and caregivers. Specifically, our care model resulted in:</p>
<ul><li>100% reduction in unnecessary emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations due to Behavioral and Psychiatric Systems of Dementia.</li>
<li>Significant reduction in falls. Prior to joining the Brain Health Program, 71% of participants had a documented fall, with 40% requiring an ED visit. Throughout the Brain Health Program falls were reduced, with only 14% experiencing a fall. Notably, none required a medical visit. CareMore was able to impact and reduce falls through a comprehensive program, including: home safety evaluations which helps families identify even hidden dangers; increased education; regular visits with a social worker; a complete pharmacy review to identify any drug interactions; a dietary review with a registered dietician to ensure optimal nutrition; and regular meetings with care staff to provide continuing support.</li>
<li>More caregivers began taking an active role in medication monitoring. We saw a trend where individuals with dementia were allowed to manage their own medications. Through education, we were able to impact medication safety, with 76% of caregivers stating they had an increased understanding of safety issues.</li>
<li>67% of caregivers made changes to increase safety. We work with members, families, and caregivers to provide education and training about home safety, social safety, and public safety. We also connect members to the Alzheimer’s Association and other community-based programs.</li>
<li>68% of members in the Brain Health Program made dietary and hydration changes. Members with ADRD experience changing tastes, and proper hydration needs to be watched closely. We work with registered dieticians to provide education and to assist the member as their tastes change. Additionally, the ability to chew food declines as disease progresses. Chewing evaluations are completed to take into account food-related choking hazards.</li>
<li>100% reduction in emergency department visits for urinary tract infection (UTI). Prior to joining the Brain Health Program, 19% of participants had a history of UTI, with 5% visiting an ED. This is often due to reduced hydration. We were able to impact proper care management and help support families and caregivers through nutritional education and dietary assistance.</li>
<li>94% reported the Brain Health Program improved their understanding of ADRD.</li>
<li>94% of caregivers stated they feel satisfied and supported, and are better caregivers since participating in the Brain Health Program.</li>
</ul><p>By providing high-touch care management and social support, we were also able to help primary care providers, hospitals, and EDs see more patients in the right setting, as shown by the reduction in unnecessary and preventable visits. We also believe that premature placement in skilled nursing facilities will be prevented.</p>
<p>CareMore’s Brain Health Program has made a significant difference in the lives of our members and their families and caregivers. However, these innovations are not widely available as Medicare doesn’t properly identify or reimburse for ADRD care.</p>
<p>Medicare SNPs are able to limit membership to individuals with specific diseases or chronic conditions, allowing SNPs to provide effective, specialized, and innovative care. SNPs provide all Medicare benefits, while offering tailored supplemental benefits and low to no out-of-pocket costs. Chronic-care SNPs are able to tailor their benefits for certain chronic conditions or diseases, as defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Today, Medicare does not allow for specialized ADRD SNPs.</p>
<p>CareMore started the Brain Health Program because it is the right thing to do for our members. By focusing on ADRD we have been able to directly improve health outcomes as we detailed above. However we, as an industry, can do so much more with appropriate attention and resources. Systematic barriers to ADRD quality care need to be removed. Allowing SNPs to offer specialized and innovative choices for those with ADRD would help recalibrate the system, leading to improved health outcomes and lower out-of-pocket and system costs for more individuals impacted by ADRD.</p>
<p>In addition, Anthem believes the current Medicare risk adjustment model consistently under-predicts the risk scores for high-cost populations, which results in underfunding vulnerable subgroups like those with ADRD. Currently, dementia care is not represented in the risk model therefore plans providing this care are not appropriately reimbursed, which in turn limits plans ability to provide more robust care. As you know, there is no single test that can diagnose Alzheimer's disease with complete accuracy during a patient’s life. A diagnosis is made through a complete assessment. Anthem understands that in order add Alzheimer’s and dementia care to the model there needs to be a standard process for diagnosis. The Brain Health Program follows the Alzheimer’s Association Cognitive Assessment Toolkit.</p>
<p>In sum, to ensure individuals with ADRD have access to sensitive, effective, and innovative care, we encourage CMS to use its authority to:</p>
<ol><li>Permit health plans to develop and offer SNPs for individuals with ADRD, so that all members stricken with these diseases have increased access to high-quality care; and,</li>
<li>Ensure proper payment for care provided to members with ADRD. We urge CMS to add Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC) codes within the Medicare risk adjustment model to ensure individuals with ADRD continue to have access to innovative and effective models of care.</li>
</ol><p>We applaud your continuing dedication to the individuals with ADRD, as well as their families, and caregivers. We too believe Medicare can and should do better for individuals with ADRD. There is a real opportunity to improve care and the lives of individuals with ADRD, as shown by our Brain Health Program’s improved outcomes and high member, family, and caregiver satisfaction. We would like to further discuss our experiences and how we can all work toward improving care for those touched by these diseases. In addition, we would like to invite you to visit a CareMore Care Center to experience our innovative member-centric model of care.

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Based on the question I believe I was asked by George, I decided to expand on it since I may have not painted the right picture an may have rambled a bit. I will share to attached documents that have been edited for me. This email will be completely unedited and you will see firsthand how my writhing and word finding has been impacted. I decided to give you an idea on what is like for me to plan and be at NAPA.</p>
<p>It all starts almost at the end of one of the meetings. I need to add it to my outlook otherwise I may forget about it. Once I get that information I will probably check it 3 or 4 different times just to insure I entered it right. I cannot begin to tell you how I want to select a certain date and instead I choose the wrong on. I can tell you I cannot understand that as I was such a perfections.</p>
<p>As we get closer to the date I search for hotels that I can get a better rate. I cannot begin to tell what burden it cost this is to me. My wife and I are not always in agreement in doing this and I feel so guilty of spending the money. When I final find a hotel I give the information to my wife to do the booking. I am so afraid that I will do something wrong or even book the wrong date or even misunderstand what they tell me. At one time in my life I would have made this trip all in the same day even though it would have been exhausting. Now days because of my location and in order to be of useful when I attend I need to arrive the night before so I am not stressed out. I am a little without the drive already. When I am finished the meeting I am so stressed and over whelmed that I would truly be a risk of driving all that way. My head feels like it is in the clouds and so unclear. I cannot begin to tell you how I need to unwind an relax after the meeting. It may be easier to possibly take the trains to get there but that would add to the cost and so much more confusion to me to try to interconnect with the trains and find the different ways to get to them from one train to the other and on time. I know this may be hard to understand as it is for me who once traveled regularly this way but when you cannot find the signs and get lost finding room numbers in a build then you would understand what all those other things do to you and the amount of pressure and stress it creates. ( on a separate note. I went to one of the congress buildings with a room number. I must have spent over a half hour or more trying to find it. I keep asking people to point me to it but somehow I just kept missing it. I cannot begin to tell you why. Thank god I finally ran in to someone that I knew and I asked them if they could personally take me there. I cannot begin to tell you how embarrassed I felt that I could not find my own way and do something so simple. Even with asking for people to point me I could not get there. It is even hard for me to understand why I cannot do that. That is why I am terrified these days to travel the trains, airports and metros but I will If I have to. I just know that it may have some issues along the way, Just hope they are not costly. I do real hat that to because I was so cost conscious in my life so that creates another level of stress)</p>
<p>As we get a month out I try to recall what new issues need to be addressed that may be important. Not necessary related to your topic. That would be tomuch to even begin to figure out. I also hat to be repetitive as so many tell me I should be. I believe you are all smart people and get it the first time. I cannot begin to tell you what pressure it si to try to stay within your time frame and I am not even sure I can even figure that out. I usually come up with so many topics and must limit it because of the time. I really have trouble prioritizing any more. To me they are all important. I believe part of the problem is in order to do that one needs to use executive functions that I no longer have or capable of using. I do believe they are there, just some broken path to the highway. And I do have the thought an times but just cannot seem to get them into words because as I try to think of what I am thinking to translate it stress me out that I forget what I am trying to write. It is crazy by far. It like I can only handle one task at a time and anything else is overload to me. Go figure, people say I had one of the most stressful jobs in my career and I thrived on it while others could not keep up with me or even handle it. It is so hard to write these days because I cannot remember what I said in the previous sentence. In fact as I write as sentence I make so many errors and by the time I go back at the end of the sentence to reread it I have so much difficulty trying to even know what the words were that I was using just for that sentence. I can take so much time trying to do that part. As I right and all I can say is thank good for Word. I can assure you if that did not exist today I would have died by now. It takes what I can no longer spell and make sense of it for me. Not always sure it using the write words. Sometimes my spelling is so bad and I cannot even being now to even spell the word for it to even help, so frustrating.</p>
<p>Now after probably many days of working on my speech I sent it to Emma Steel who is my editor all the way in the UK. She is the only person I could find that was willing to help volunteer her time. I had reached out to so many local like high schools, colleges and no one would give me just a little time to help in editing my work, not even a friend who was teacher who said she is to busy to help. All I wanted was one or two things a month. So many people offer there help but when it comes down to asking them for it they don't . Very frustrating for one that always help others when they were in need. I need it now so badly just the be heard as I am slowly losing my abilities and there is no one there for me. While I ask my wife on some It so much for her to handle as I have already added to burned on her already.</p>
<p>Emma does such a beautiful job especially with the poor information I give her. I could not even image what it must be like for her because I cannot even figure it out and I wrote it. Takes a special kind of person. She does all this from the goodness of her heart and I am demanding at times.</p>
<p>When I get the work back some time we need to go back a few time because some of points may not be there with the passion I like to put in this. Many times I just settle just because it's not worthy of the added work I would need to place on her and don't want to make her feel bad. Sometimes I amy go to someone else to help in order to get it closer to where I feel it should be. To many times in my writing I go over board and they all tell me to tone it down which I do many times but I have learned in life that on very important issues you need to be very direct if you want something done and it may need to be unpleasant if you tell the truth. While you folks my not believe it I hate it every time I must say something negative to you. It does hurt me inside and I continuously think about it as it may possible jeopardize the relationship we have. This works on me from before the meeting to weeks later. Even more because when I speak there are no comments made to even get a sense to how you feel. Any way once I final get my speech I send it to two trusted individuals who are in the dementia arena for guidance. Based on their comments I may change or remove something. I always want to insure I get it right since I may no longer be the best judge for that. These people have been extremely important to me in making all this possible.</p>
<p>If everything is okay with the speech then I need to get it ready so I can read it. First I change the font size to 18. Then I need to place unusual spacing in there so I can continue to read it and so I can stay focused. If I do not do this the words all look like they are shifting. I have trouble f keeping track of whereI am and if the font is to small I see the entire page of data coming at me as one, and cannot focus on a simple word. This what I have been able to figure out to help me cope and to be able to continue.</p>
<p>A few day before the meeting I must write an agenda of the places I need to be it with the complete address information. I will check that over at least 3-4 times to insure I did not error. If I am to meet with someone and have a phone number I will ask my wife to added to the cell phone so I have it in the memory. I can no longer do that. Kind of strange for someone who was responsible for Data and Voice for 70,000 people and was always a gadget person. I have become fearful of much of technology because I struggle to use it and cannot remember the mistakes I make so I don't do them again.</p>
<p>The day of or night before I need to get ready and pack what I need. I really rely on my wife to do much of it any more as I cannot keep it straight and remember what I need or packed. It also seems that I lost the ability to kind of plan to organize ahead matching cloths which I was once very good at. I would have never allowed my wife to just select something and be okay with it. I try to place as much as possible in the car as soon as possible so I don't have to many things I need to worry about when I leave. I even add my wallet to by brief case because I have ben know to forget it recently.</p>
<p>The day I leave I need to insure I am not in one of those days that my mind is all foggy. If that happens I would probably need to cancel the trip because I would not be able to drive that long under those conditions. I worry about that for while till I get on the long stretches of high way. When I do start out in my car I add the address to my GPS. From that point on till I get there I am on autopilot and following what it tells me to do. I don't always understand so I may take the wrong turn but the great thing about it is it will recalculate and get me there no matter how many mistakes I may make. Cannot even image what life would be like without it. I never even needed a map before. It was like I had built in GPS. While I am driving I am using ever once of energy that I have to try to stay focused and alert to what I am doing and the road and cars around me. I cannot begin to tell the amount of stress that is created when I drive now days. While I drive good it takes so much energy to do it. I feel like I am leaving my finger prints embedded in the steering wheel. I pretty much tune out everything else. Since I consecrate so much on the road, I sometimes have difficulty in following the road signs following on where to turn but that is okay because I have learned to not panic or get upset as much. That is the worst thing when can do with this disease is get stressed out because it leads to a serious snowball effect that can really make the mind go into a cloud and so unable to think. That is probably the most important think one can teach us. Not to panic and remain calm. I believe if we can master that it will go a long way. While I have driven to DC so many times it would sure be nice to look at place on the road as a landmark so I can gage about how close or far I am. Many place I see appear like I seen them while others look so new to me and cannot even understand. Sometimes all of a sudden I thing I know where I am going to only realize I am confusing it with some other road or place and it had nothing to do with where I am headed.</p>
<p>I was once the person that waited to run on fumes in the car before getting gas. Today I start to panic as I head to DC because I have gotten caught in paying super high prices for gas because I went to the wrong location. I still had tree bars but concerned of not being able to find the next gas station because I cannot follow directions. Because of that today I now try to fill up before Dc and I still pay more that I would like to but I do so many other stupid things to day that just keep adding to my cost of living because of lack of memory. It amazing how much one needsit and how we take it for granted until you lose it. When I final get there it is such a sense of relief to be able to check into the hotel. I call my wife to let her know I got there. Sometimes she calls me as in this last time because it took me much longer to get there and she was wondering why. Lots of traffic. In the hotel it can be easy or embarrassing when you need to fill the form out. I may not remember the type of car I have or even how to spell it. I do get my address wrong from time to time now. I usually don't understand all they tell me with their instruction on the internet and all the other things they say. I almost need a hotel for dummies on a piece of paper to read as I needed for what they tell me. Then I go to park my car which some time is challenge. I try to use the handicap spaces because It makes it easier to find, Just need to get to the right level. But as Leave the car and others are around me I feel so guilty by taking that spaces as they see me carrying all this luggage and walk without any issue. It has already happened where I could not find the car, so this method works.</p>
<p>When I get in the room I am very careful to put my items in one or two places in fear that I may lose track of them and forget them. It takes me many hours to finally unwind from that drive. Before I leave the hotel room I go thought some kind of a ritual every time. I feel all my pockets multiple times that I have all what I need. My instructions paper that also has the address, my room key and other things.I probably do this 2 -3 times because I may not remember I did it on unsure. As I am going down the elevator I may be rechecking again. I am not sure if it because I have total lost self confidence in myself or if its I forget I had checked.</p>
<p>Now that it's time for dinner I would like to really go somewhere else, but close to hotel makes it easier since I don't to risk getting lost and don't like driving when its dark. Especially when I am out of my comfort zone. When I return I call my wife to let her know I am safe so she does not worry. I could only imagine what goes through her head when I leave. But she wants me to keep my impendence for as long as I can even if that means there will be issues along the way. Sometimes she may need to guide me of setting up my alarm or the internet on my tablet. I do call the hotel for a wakeup call but like to have a backup in place. That night I try to prepare most of what I need for the next day so I am not forgetting something and to keep my anxiety down. The next morning I am head for my NAPA meeting and of course doing my rituals. I have even more to do because there is so much more I must take with me this time, like brief case with all my information, pens, business card.</p>
<p>This last time it was such a pleasure because someone was kind enough to offer to pick me up from the hotel. If not I would have receive a ride to the metro were I would have difficulty in adding money to the metro card. I really need someone to help me do that. Gas stations is even a problem some times because they are to quick and I am slow at replying. They need an AD mode to select. If I had the card then I only need to wonder if I get to the writ track. People are not so friendly when you are stopping them on the way to work as they are rusting for their train. Oh and the noise in those places really create a problem for me because I cannot filter the sound out so when the person is speak to me which I would have hard time understanding any way and remembering the noise only raise the bar for my failure.</p>
<p>Once I get to the sop if I am lucky to get off at the right one because I find the signs that tell you the stop a bit confusing at times. It's also hard to process as the train is coming into the station to read what is on the walls with the anticipation of trying to get off and all those people around me. Once I do get off it becomes a problem of asking lots of people to guide me so I can find my way at NAPA. I always ask two people because so many send you the wrong way. Not sure why people can just say they don't know.</p>
<p>Now that I made it I start to unwind because all this builds new stress. It makes it challenging going thru the metal detector because I don't always remember what I should remove. When I get up stairs I always feel a bit awkward because I cannot remember people's names and not always even sure of their face. Sometimes I think I met them but I did nt. I never had those issues in the past in fact most were surprised by my recall. I actually look forward to see people with name badges as that helps me a lot. Not that I am always able to read it as I am starting to speak with them. Can not multitask. I was a bit disappointed at this last meeting because they did not use the tags. When the morning gets started I am pretty good. It takes so much energy for me to sit there and try to focus and concentrate on what is being said. It's like using 110 present of all my power during that time. (I know this is hard to relate to but picture a moment in your life were it required full concentration and all your attention to insure you did something right. It feels like you are drained if you did it for a while. That is what happens to me most of my day as I do what most of you just easily cruise through the day) When you folks talk I do not necessarily hear everything you say. Well I guess I do but my mind doe not process it fast enough. So I am constantly trying to fill the gap for missed words and trying to make sense of it all. As I get back from lunch I am stating to feel the drain on my body which is huge by then. That whole afternoon I am fighting so hard to keep my body engaged to continue the process of absorbing what you are saying. I start to lose some of that ability but when topics of real interest come up I do get more out of it. You will me going out more often or standing. I am trying to keep myself calm as I am real having a very difficult time being there at that point. Just try to image that you had to concentrate on one thing all day. This time it was great because you made it so much better because of the technology. I could hear very one because of the new microphone. I cannot being to tell you what an improvement that was for me. Not so much when we lost the projector. I could not follow and had lost of difficulty. In fact those handouts are useless if you cannot even read the print. You may as well save the tress if it cannot be read. When the meeting stops it's like instant relief and I start to unwind. I do like to speak with many of you after. I am okay at that time but still winding down..</p>
<p>The trip back to the hotel is about the same but this time my head is a bit foggy. Ok for a short drive but not long.</p>
<p>The next day when I leave DC I always know I am going to get lost. There are two areas that I keep making mistakes and for the life of me I cannot remember were to go. One day I made the same mistake 3 times. This was during rush hour traffic. Can you image to turn wrong and it takes 20-25 minutes to get back to where you turned wrong original and you still not sure where to turn and turn the same wrong way again. That day I was almost ready to just pull the car off the road and call for help. Lucky something in my mind told me to take a completely different route for a while and this way the GPS final figured out a new way. Talk about frustrations that day. That is why I no longer drive home the same day. It is so much more relaxing to leave DC at 6:30 AM. I just want you to remember because so many of you are thinking why is this guy driving? I and many others who see me drive agree that I do very good. I need to keep an eye on that as I know it won't be long before I can't. But don't confuse ones driving capability to being lost or getting lost. That is hard for many to understand. I have been put in many recent situations where my reaction was needed to avoid any accident and I did better a normal person may have reacted. My wife was in the car. My reactions are still good. They may be slower then they were, but stall faster than many on the road without AD. My biggest fear is to be in an accident and it as absolutely not my fault, but because I have the AD someone may take action to make themselves feel better. After all mydoctor made the recommendation 6 years ago to stop because I would not know the day on my own. Just think how many good years would have been taken away from me. As you can see I did skip a lot from my trip but when I arrive home I finally have this huge sense of relief that I was able to make it to the meeting without any major issues. I continue to wonder if I can make the next or was this the last.</p>
<p>I must tell you I did not even think of all these things being that bad until I wrote this. Is even worse by far when something unexpected happens like getting lost or went down the wrong metro lane. I waste so much time an energy all day long just to correct mistakes.</p>
<p>I do believe I did much better in this wring than usual. I really spend a long time putting this together. About 11 hours and it seemed to be clear headed.</p>
<p><strong>I cannot tell you how please I was that someone asked me a question at the last meeting.</strong></p>
<p>I hope this more of a incite for what it is like to be in my shoes.</p>
<p>I always welcome your questions because that is the only way people will learn.</p>
<p>P.S, Whilethis letter was not edited I did share it with my editor who made the following comment.</p>
<p>Ironically this is the clearest I have seen you write in long time, your spelling is almost spot on, and so is you word usage etc.</p>
<p>Not sure why but I did spend a lot more time on it. I just hope you read it all.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's Disease, My Daughter, and Me</p>
<p>I am not sure how much longer I can take this. I truly miss my daughter, who lives in New York. She is so much closer to home nowadays than she was four years ago. This weekend she decided to come home to visit. While I wanted to have some kind of conversation with her, I struggled and could not seem to figure out what I should say. I am so glad when she is here.</p>
<p>It was Sunday afternoon when my wife said my daughter would be leaving in about 45 minutes so she could catch the bus. They were both sitting at the kitchen table. I felt like I should go there and spend some time with her before she left. So I turned off the TV and sat at the table. I sat for almost 50 minutes and hardly said a word.</p>
<p>That whole time, I kept thinking that I must and need to say something, but I just could not figure out what to say. I felt like crying so many times because I just could not come up with any words. My mind was so empty, without any thoughts. During the last 10 minutes I felt even more pressure to say something, but I had no thoughts in mind nor could I even be creative enough to start a dialogue.</p>
<p>I cannot understand why it is so hard. I can jump in on conversations once in a while to make a comment, but I struggle so much to have some conversations. I really do not believe people understand how painful Alzheimer's disease can be.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes after my wife and daughter left, I began writing this. I was doing everything possible to hold back my tears. Is this what I am becoming or have become?</p>
<p>So many people say to me, "You don't seem like you have Alzheimer's or dementia." I only wish they could see the pain I go through on a daily basis. I am not sure I want to continue down this lonely road much longer. I only wish my daughter remembers me for who I was and not for the person I am becoming.</p>
<p>I love you so much, Jamie, and I wish I could still show it. I am so proud of who you are and have become. I only wish you could feel the same way about me. Just another bad day for me, but it was so wonderful to see you.</p>
<p>I am so fearful that it will become even worse, not that I am sure how that is possible since I did not say much at all.</p>
<p>I pour my heart out to you not for your pity, but for you to do something to change the course of dementia. No one should be forced to deal with this. There are no excuses for doing nothing.</p>
<p>Michael Ellenbogen [<a href="http://michaelellenbogenmovement.com/">http://michaelellenbogenmovement.com/</a>] was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at age 39, in 2008. He has since started a campaign to raise awareness of the daily struggles of people living with Alzheimer's and dementia.

<p>Imagine if you will waking up one morning and going about your daily business, you have had breakfast and are about to leave for work, but you can't remember where you left your keys. Common enough you say; we have all done that at some time or other. Your wife hands you your keys and off you go. Life carries on as normal for a few weeks then one day, while at work you have to call a colleague, but you have inexplicably forgotten his extension number; an extension number you have called numerous times a day for the past 10 years. You feel silly but put it down to being tired. You work hard and hold a high profile position in a financial institution so it is understandable that you will have memory lapses now and again. Like the key incident you laugh it off.</p>
<p>Over the next few months things start to get worse, you are forgetting people's names even though you have worked with them for many years, you are making stupid mistakes at work, you are forgetting to go to meetings, you are finding it really difficult to do the simplest of tasks, you continually forget where you parked the car. Again you are told by friends and colleagues and doctors that it is down to stress; that you need to slow down, maybe take time off etc. But you know there is something wrong, you know that it is more than stress.</p>
<p>So you start keeping a record as best you can and you pester your doctor for answers. One day you get the answer. An answer no one expected.</p>
<p>An answer that will change your and your family's life forever.</p>
<p>You have Young Onset Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is an incurable, progressive loss of brain cells. In the beginning it targets the memory and speech, as time goes on the symptoms become wider ranging and debilitating and include disorientation, difficulty judging distances, poor vision, poor speech/writing abilities, repetitive behaviour, mood swings, and depression. Then in the final stages of the disease it is not just the mind that is affected; the body is rapidly declining also. In the late stages of Alzheimer's there will be difficulty swallowing, a needed for assistance when changing position or moving from place to place, there is increased vulnerability to infection and a complete loss of short-term and long-term memory. Death is slow, painful, undignified, and inevitable.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen and this is my diagnosis.</p>
<p>For the last decade I have campaigned on behalf of myself and all those suffering from this devastating disease. Why do I have to campaign? I do it because over five million Americans have Alzheimer's, and other forms of dementia. And what is more shocking is the lack of knowledge out there about this illness.</p>
<p>I have become extremely surprised by the lack of public commitment to my pleas for support of Alzheimer's disease. While some may be sympathetic in the moment, there appears to be little follow-through.</p>
<p>People look at me and think there is nothing wrong; I am not in a wheelchair, I have full use of all my limbs, I can see, hear, speak and listen...... but not for much longer.</p>
<p>I am dying; day by day hour by hour my life is ending.</p>
<p>So much of my life has changed with this disease; household chores that were once second-nature, like cutting the grass have become frustrating difficult and for me to perform. I leave things lying around the house; not to be difficult, but because I have forgotten where they go, and I am also afraid that if they do get put away I will not remember where they were put.</p>
<p>I was once a very sociable person but now I go to a happy affair only to be tortured by the noise and surrounding conversations because I am overwhelmed by the stimulus of sight and sound. I don't understand what people are saying; the words run together and they may as well be speaking a foreign language.</p>
<p>I can no longer write or speak like I used to, what you a reading now has been written by a friend of mine who helps me put my words onto paper. My friends have become distant and even when in their presence they will address my wife, even when enquiring after me they rarely direct their questions to me. This is heart-breaking for me, the fact that they feel they can no longer talk to me really saddens me.</p>
<p>Grocery shopping with my wife is time consuming and frustrating as I find it difficult to make decisions and plan ahead for meals. Eating out was something I used to enjoy but now I am unable to read the menu and assimilate the information into a decision. At home my wife has to assemble my meals in a series of individual decisions.</p>
<p>There was a time when I could follow a map and easily get from point A to B. Now I rely on my wife for navigation, I know that it won't be long before I can no longer drive and that really upsets me because I love going out for long drives in my car, it is the last vestige of independence I have left.</p>
<p>I used to be smart, I worked hard, and I accomplished a lot. Seeing all my failures today are giving me a new appreciation for the things I was once capable of doing. I was a very different person, but that intelligence still shines through occasionally as I am challenged to invent new coping strategies to respond to these changes.</p>
<p>This disease is costing me money in so many ways because of the problems and issues I create; I have broken gardening tools because I have forgotten how to use them properly.</p>
<p>Personal grooming is a problem as well; as I can never remember the last time I washed my hair or changed my clothes.</p>
<p>In meetings I will lose track of the subject matter if the information is shared in long sentences. If I am speaking at events or meeting I must have my speech printed a large font size with clearly marked punctuation.</p>
<p>Sometimes my mind does not communicate with the rest of my body; I had to turn the grate on my fireplace but instead of tentatively feeling if it was hot or not I just picked it up and badly burned my hand.</p>
<p>I can no longer use my video recorder. I had trouble remembering which way to turn off the water in the garage for the hose</p>
<p>I lost my job because I could no longer function in the environment, so now I spend my days advocating for Alzheimer's it gives me a reason to get out of bed in the morning, it stimulates what is left of my mind.</p>
<p>Do you know what the worst part of this is? I have to watch my wife struggling to do the things that I once was capable of doing, and know I cannot do anything thing to help. I see my wife becoming stressed, depressed and overwhelmed, and know it will only continue to get worse.</p>
<p>My wife is on the road to hell; I have not even reached the worst stage. That scares the hell out of me.</p>
<p>I am losing my mind and I can see it happening, but I cannot do anything to change the course. I am slowly becoming a child again, and will soon be a body with no mind.</p>
<p>At what point should I give up? At what point would give up?</p>
<p>What do I have to look forward to?</p>
<p>Why should I put my wife through any more pain and sadness, do I really want her to watch me slowly die in front her eyes?</p>
<p>Any chance I had at a good life and a happy retirement has gone; my life is pretty much over. If you were in my shoes would you want to carry on, knowing what is in store for you?</p>
<p>I want to die on my own terms, I want to die with dignity, I want to die while I can still make the decision to die, and that is a very small window because I know in the not too distant future even that choice is going to be taken from me.</p>
<p>The laws we have in place today do not take into account the needs of people suffering from dementia; we need to rethink not only how we regard people with this disease, but also how we look after them. We need to have things in place not only to help those suffering live vital and productive lives, but also provide the means necessary for them to die with dignity and at a time of their choosing. We need to take our heads out of the sand; we can no longer turn a blind, this is a very real problem, this is happening now to millions of people across America.</p>
<p>We need your help!</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>I have three issues I would like to address briefly today. Please contact me via telephone or email if you have would like additional information concerning any of these issues.</p>
<p>As many of you know I have shared with you my vision of dementia friendly communities. I believe Project Lifesaver International should be part of our future plans. Project Lifesaver provides timely response to save lives and reduce potential injury for those who wander due to dementia including Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>The task of searching for wandering or lost individuals with cognitive conditions is a growing and serious responsibility. Without effective procedures and equipment, searches can involve multiple agencies, hundreds of officers, countless man hours and thousands of dollars. More importantly, because time is of the essence, every minute lost increases the risk of a tragic outcome. This is a program that must be offered in all states. We currently use tax dollars to pay for these bands that track prisoners under house arrest, we need to make this technology available to those with dementia, at no cost, to keep them safe. Statistics show it will save money and produce better outcomes if we all invested.</p>
<p>My next concern involves the verbage associated with certain medications. For many years now most in the medical community, non profits and I have been preaching what I believe is questionable information to others. I have been telling people that (colon - ester - ace) cholinesterase inhibitors, such as (Dan - ep- azil) Donepezil and (Meh - man - teen) Memantine may work for only 50 % of people and when they do they only work for 6- 18 months. This is the information reported by drug manufacturers, physicians and patient education portals. I have learned that this is reported because that is the longest length of time that the drugs have been clinically studied. Recent information, circulated by many experts in the field, suggests that these drugs can continue to be effective for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>The language concerning the use of these medications must be changed if we are going to help people. The benefit of continuing medication is a complicated question as I have found in the last 6 months. People are encouraged to check with their clinicians and make an informed family decision. While further research needs to be conducted, whether it's best to continue or discontinue (colon - ester - ace) cholinesterase inhibitor use I believe we need to error on the side of caution and include some language that states that it could have a negative effect if one was to stop taking it. It can also include that more scientific studies are needed. I have spoken to many doctors over the past few months who are also looking for clear direction. I would think we should make the decision on the side of caution and keep the patients best interest in mind. I believe that if the patient started taking these drugs and they did benefit from them originally then they should stay on them until the end, even if the benefit is small. When your brain function is at a very low capacity, any help is good. I say this as long as they do not have any serious side effects from the medication. I have a comprehensive bibliography on this topic and suggested guidelines in medical language that I can share. It includes information from many doctors/experts in the field. The reason I am so concerned is because I constantly hear others who are on the drugs question whether they should still be on them after they have been taking them for over a 1 1/2 years. I have also spoken to some who stopped it and realized in a week or so that they were not performing as well and went back on the drug. Then I have heard some horror stories where they stopped taking the drug and realized it had helped. When they went back on they never seemed to recover to the same level of cognitive function as they were before. I say all this based on their own viewpoints and those of their care partners. They regret ever doing this, but they only did it because of what they heard about effectiveness only lasting 6-18 months. Please help change this confusing data.</p>
<p>Finally, as you know I have been pushing for the World Purple Angel to be the same as the Pink Ribbon or as the handicap sign. We have now trademarked that here in the US and in the UK. It is free for use with our permission if the guidelines are met. Please adopt this symbol as part of your continued support for dementia. We need to stand as one on this cause.</p>
<p>On one Final comment - At our last meeting I think some of my comments were taken personally. The goal behind them was a call for action. Many outside of the committee told me that they would have liked to have said those things also. My response to them is don't be afraid to speak up honestly and from the heart.</p>

					Subject: Curing dementia and memory loss by bypassing the messed up functions with plugged in hardware and preprogrammed software</p>
<p>Last weekend the Class of 59 had its 55th reunion at the University of Rochester. It is a weekend called "MELIORA" WITH TERRIFIC EVENTS AND PRESENTATIONS THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOLS-MED, BUS , EDU ETC.</p>
<p>One of the events I went to was a presentation by four Bio-engineering graduates from the U of R bachelor class of 2004. 2 males and 2 females. 1 Male is now an MD researching male fertility, one male is now a Program Manager at Google. One Female is a PHD faculty member at another University whose postdoc in Austria was in imaging, the other is in imaging in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>Another event I attended was the future of higher education by four University Presidents. At the reunion dinner I was at the table the U of R Dean Philosopher was at. He, like the University presidents who addressed the future of Universities, started to express concern on the future of Universities. I told him he needn't worry, the next generation of U of R Bioengineers would develop a pill an English major could take to accumulate the knowledge a 4 year program would provide.</p>
<p>I now think rather than a pill it will be a plug in brain/memory module. The same way we replaced horse teams with steam, gas and electric powered cars and trucks or snail mail with email....</p>
<p>Would the agelab help get DARPA to sponsor a competition to provide the electro/data storage/imaging/plug in module and a way to connect it to people that could provide an education equivalent at 1/100th the current cost of a 4 year degree in time and expense and soon provide an alternative to Parkinsons and Alzheimers? Such an approach could accelerate by decades relief much like the autonomous vehicle competition accelerated achievement of that objective.</p>
<p>Something like this will solve a multitude of problems-cost of education, time involved in learning stuff, overcoming learning difficulties....dementia, memory inneffectivity/loss WOW!</p>
<p>In addition to the military benefits of plug in learned modules there might be an ability to avoid mistakes like deciding terrorists are not state sponsored and then we could end it by holding states responsible and get unconditional surrender and sufficient occupation of the sponsors/hosts so they learn english (less extreme thought patterns) and how to live peaceably with each other and us.</p>

<p>I have attached my October 2013 fifteen page response to the Florida Purple Ribbon Task Force's recommendations. In so doing, I apologize in advance for the quality. Post ADRD estate resolution after 10 years of full time care of a level 6, I went through three bilateral reconstructive surgeries with post op complications resulting in over two years restricted mobility. I had hoped to assemble a more comprehensive document reflecting the needs of the hundreds of caretakers I have communicated with over the years and testify at federal and state hearings on the issues raised in this document but was not able to walk/drive until a few months ago.</p>
<p>We had a triple dose of ADRD in our extended family. As such, all of your efforts to find a cure are deeply appreciated.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Response to 2013 Florida Purple Ribbon Task Force Report</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>I have reviewed the Purple Ribbon Task Force Report and the survey. I don't agree with the approach, recommendations or the data and underlying assumptions forming the basis of same. I was particularly concerned with the failure to address abusive practices, systemic industry reform, and secondary impact. After repeated review of this document, I arrived at the conclusion that proposals were no more than plugged holes in a dike with the damn about to burst.</p>
<p>ADRD is a global health crisis of frightening proportion. It is a vicious and insidious disease with debilitating economic, psychological and physical consequences extending far beyond the directly afflicted. This Task Force had the unprecedented privilege to not only place Florida in a national leadership role in addressing and responding to an international humanitarian medical crisis but to shine a light of hope in a very dark place for millions of elderly and their families. Your response was insular and short sighted. It will cripple this state.</p>
<p>First, it was my understanding that the impetus for Task Force creation was the 2011 Miami Herald investigative report series, "Neglected to Death", the focus of which was facility abuse of elderly, particularly ADRD, and state regulatory oversight. It is simply unforgivable and irresponsible that this emergent and heartbreaking crisis as to the elderly in general, and ADRD in particular, was not met with regulatory reform, expanded enforcement and financial/criminal sanctions for this conduct.</p>
<p>Not only was this not addressed but, amazingly, a statement was made that placement of small groups of ADRD elderly in homes was the best solution. I have serious concerns over the justification for this conclusory remark as to ADRD and the source's understanding of disease impact. These homes are not subject to regulatory oversight and are thus a prime target for incompetent coverage and abusive practices. (I thought it was illegal for professionals to recommend unlicensed facilities.) ADRD are not able to articulate their needs, complain, or ask for help under the best circumstances. Removing a layer of government protection, however remote, is ill advised and careless. Even in a facility, this concept of small groups, dating back to the early 90's, struggles because success was predicated on an interdisciplinary team approach which does not exist.</p>
<p>Second, public policy and elder service delivery has fallen prey to an out of control, self serving, self perpetuating and self aggrandizing provider controlled industry dedicated to achieving maximum profit with minimal overhead. Often owners and investors are outside the state or international. Profiteers want a piece of the elderly and layer by layer, they take it. Owners can run a 30% profit level on a facility or HHC business. The best way to evaluate this, outside SEC, IPO or tax filing, is to look at listings or private offering representations of gross revenues and owner benefit. After a few are open, whether or not an IPO is filed or ownership transfers, investors do expect continuation of the same return. Bare minimum revenues are directed toward elder services. The State does not benefit.</p>
<p>Truly outstanding health care professionals, including RN's, LPN's and CNA's suffer and eventually abandon direct service delivery because they cannot control the desired quality of their efforts. Caretakers suffer because they cannot insure that the safety, medical needs and quality of life of their loved one will be served and personally take on the burden. Elderly suffer because they are personally, physically and financially abused and victimized.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association Campaign for Quality Residential Care: Dementia Care Practices Recommendations for Assisted Living Residences and Nursing Homes is a valuable reference. It conditions successful implementation of recommendations on having a sufficient number of appropriately trained staff. This is not evident in practice, was not translated to statutory or regulatory obligation by the Task Force and should be immediately addressed before additional elderly are harmed.</p>
<p>Many families could have paid the $120,000 annual fee for SNF care and continued with their lives. Most don't make that election because the ADRD were repeatedly injured when attempts were made, that avenue was closed to ADRD by the provider, or only made available with doping and/or a 24/7 aide. ALF's are simply out of the question because, in most cases, they can't meet the base medical needs and life quality for non ADRD elderly. ADRD shares the same expected medical and ADL needs normally attendant to aging and many cognitive challenges are based on failure to responsibly meet these needs.</p>
<p>Florida AHCA and CMS deficiency reports and judicial filings, in the public domain and available for your review, reflect across the board abuses. Facilities are not safe and engage in abusive practices directly or by quality understaffing and neglect.</p>
<p>Third, the "aging in place" policy statement, particularly as to mid to upper level ADRD or sundowners is simply cruel and dysfunctional. It will economically destroy this State, families, and future generations because it not only fails to take into account the needs of the ADRD but fails to assess and quantify the secondary destructive personal and financial impact on families. As to the majority of elderly who live alone, it is life threatening. Norway parrots this approach in its 2015 report but, in the absence there of admission to SNF's without acute condition, has their own issues with death and injury by release of isolated non ADRD elderly to a home environment. I don't understand the policy advocate's underlying motivation. Is it an HHC profit oriented response, a mathematically challenged but otherwise well meaning individual, or someone who desperately needs a reality check as to disease manifestation at the mid to upper levels?</p>
<p>I don't know your proposal for single ADRD, particularly those homeless without financial resources, when SNF Medicaid beds are scarce and selectively reserved for non ADRD. I do know that elderly spouses can't handle ADRD. They have their own needs and are often continuously and irrationally verbally and physically abused. It is just too much. Most look to divorce to avoid ADRD caretaking, simply leave or predecease the ADRD. At some point, children, if there are any and if they care, have to gratuitously assume this full time obligation.</p>
<p>In December 2012, the New York Times, after a comparative international review of efforts in this area concluded</p>
<p><em>"Is care at home for patients with Alzheimer's necessarily more humane? Only if caregivers have the resources -- financial, physical and emotional -- to handle this draining, exhausting, immeasurably difficult job. And only if the institutions that serve people with more advanced forms of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia are so poorly financed, staffed and operated that we wouldn't feel comfortable leaving loved ones in their care…. </em></p>
<p><em>Anyone who's followed reader response to <strong>Jane Brody's column</strong> this week on aging in place knows the burden that this can place on families, especially if government support for home-based services (companions or home health aides who help with bathing, dressing, toileting and other tasks), adult day care or respite care is scarce or nonexistent, as is the case for most middle-class families in the United States. … </em></p>
<p><em>Other countries with which the United States is closely aligned have embraced long-term care as an essential social responsibility while we have not. Unless and until we do so, caregivers here will be among the most harried, stressed and burdened among wealthy, developed countries in the world." </em></p>
<p>Children caretakers are former attorneys, architects, doctors, engineers, technology and security consultants, teachers, industry executives, police, prosecutors, university professors, fire, health care professionals etc. No profession is excluded. The reason why we are "former" is because, in the absence of essential industry facility reform, regulation and enforcement, there is no responsible choice.</p>
<p>These caretakers are comprised of both sexes, cross party lines, and are frustrated, not simply because control over their own economic, professional and personal future has been taken out of their hands by small time industry profiteers, but with the fact that the quality of the lives of their ADRD loved ones could have been immeasurably improved if safe, quality facilities existed.</p>
<p><strong>Our economic loss and that of our families is Florida's current loss and future burden. Caretakers, professionally and financially, were critical contributors to Florida's economy. We bought and provided goods and services. We contributed to the community. We saved money for our children's education and our future through 401K's. We preserved our health. Now, as caretakers, we do not engage in any of these efforts. </strong></p>
<p><strong>A new classification of poverty has been created which is "intergenerationally" contagious to join the current ADRD unserved homeless population. Put another way, at the end of the caretaking period, which can exceed a decade, our resources have been depleted, we might have MCI, ADRD or a physically debilitating condition, we don't qualify for SS disability or unemployment since we have not contributed, and there may not be family to provide care. 50% of the future generation will be ADRD caretaking. Grandchildren want to know whether to invest in their future if everything is going to fall apart. How do we respond based on your plan? </strong></p>
<p>ADC does not help the ADRD if continuous doping is used to protect other participants from sporadic bouts of agitation occasioned by infection or alienation of environment. ADC does not help if the home caretaker works and the disease manifests itself at night by sundowning, whether or not the ADRD is otherwise normal to easily manageable during the day and particularly considering the lives of children and their schooling. Segregating all ADRD to one ADC but intermingling levels is traumatic for the lower levels that retain some sense of self, daily facing their possible future particularly if operations are not individually medical and cognitive need responsive. ADC is one entity depending on staffing which might not realize the profit level of facilities, if any, depending on quality of service.</p>
<p>With HHC, demand exceeds quality supply for elderly in general. The usual bare minimum wage does not otherwise attract quality applicants particularly if a non ADRD position opens. Occasionally, through internal networking, as opposed to HHC agencies, a miracle occurs but it is usually short lived. Unqualified HHC pose a danger to the patient. Again, this is a complex disease. It varies in form and manifestation and can change without notice. It requires an interdisciplinary team effort focused on the ADRD.</p>
<p>Last survey, 25% of ADRD caretakers repeatedly engaged in suicide ideation. 10% engaged in it after the protracted caretaking period was over. Individuals personally advised of this diagnosis contemplate suicide because they don't want it for themselves or the burden they have already experienced for their children. Absent reform, this will continue.</p>
<p>We want the lives of our ADRD loved ones immeasurably improved in a properly staffed safe and secure environment conducive to their special needs and enriched with advanced cognitive or sensory stimulation like a Snoezalen room, interactive games and activities, supported by responsible, dedicated, trained and educated interdisciplinary professionals who care that ADRD and their medical needs are attended to without chemical or physical restraints and promote level appropriate company of friends. We want them to enjoy their life as it reaches its conclusion, to be protected from abuse in all its forms, and to have a choice in the manner in which quality care is provided.</p>
<p>Reports like this have repeatedly issued over the past 15 years. They are always well written, there is always a survey eliciting information which has been in the public domain for so long, judicial notice would be taken of the conclusions without need for evidentiary support. They define the disease, introduce impact and demographic review analysis and recommend research, education, awareness campaigns of whatever kind, some legislative public pronouncement of caring, and reinforce support for research to find a cure through another commission or office. Occasionally ADRD are thrown a bone through subsidy of providers whose conduct is the basis for complaint. Operational regulatory reform is never addressed because tasks forces are controlled by the entities which should be regulated. Scientists never receive sufficient direct funding. Elderly ADRD never receive the services they need because critical issues are never addressed. One frustrated attorney caretaker made a remark that such reports all be filed away under the category "don't ever do this again".</p>
<p>The following provides limited comment on your report, including your needs analysis, rejects historically structured commissions and task forces, introduces issues not covered but with the focus on necessary reform, and presents recommendations and comments assimilated over the years from caretakers, attorneys and health care professionals including doctors, RN's, and CNA's with prior industry affiliation. The goal is to accomplish reform and proceed in a new direction without state financial stress.</p>
<p>There is a two part solution.</p>
<p><strong>First, clean up existing operations though regulatory reform outlined below more specifically, particularly focusing on increasing staffing and quality control, and take out the trash. Set up sufficiently harsh fines and sanctions individually and by facility to insure that abuses will not continue and to support enforcement in cases of repeat violations. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Second, set up a revolving account for seed monies and loan guarantees, including interest subsidies for infrastructure/development, consolidate IDG and other state and federal resources to support nonprofit operation of multilayer extensive campus developments, sufficiently attractive to entice those amply able to pay for residency, including high level medical care, cognitive services and activities to improve quality of life. Attach it to a university for memory disorder service (like John Hopkins Copper Ridge) independent medical oversight and student involvement. By eliminating owner benefit, the 30% differential may also be applied to cover those unable to pay but in need of services. The goal is a physically and financially self sustaining campus, where no one is turned away. </strong></p>
<p>In other word, change the conception of aging from a depressing environment to one where spouses without ADRD can live and regularly visit their loved ones happy in the knowledge that their needs are addressed in a positive way while they pursue their own interests. Change the attitude of staff towards their role, change the name to a university concept with individual neighborhoods/dormitories, and make it an interactive campus and a wonderful place to be. Instead of being the country that can't get it together in terms of aging and ADRD, let the United States be a leader.</p>
<p><strong>ADRD Population and Needs Assessment </strong></p>
<p>Data challenges based on elevation of presentation form over substance consist of the following:</p>
<p>First, in order to presumably substantiate policy recommendations, the Task Force had a survey. The survey structure was borrowed from, I believe, Oregon, despite the wealth of talent in this state and the issue intimacy of highly educated resident professionals. The survey was not publicized and was open for a period of about two weeks on a site not regularly visited. As to ADRD and family caregivers, the response was so insignificant that no responsible economist would have publicized the survey results much less used it as a basis for defining issues because it lacks statistical integrity. It otherwise substantively failed because the primary focus was asking questions which supported a provider private pay response, not otherwise responsive to ADRD needs.</p>
<p>Second, there is a concern that the base from which linear projections have been made as to the number of ADRD in Florida is not valid and existing and future service delivery needs estimation will suffer. The Rush CHAP's report has routinely been used nationally. The base for this report was an older population on the south side of Chicago and early onset, to the best of my recollection, was not taken into consideration. Over time, studies have repeatedly made extrapolations applied to census, disease incident reports and other variables using this baseline. I would suggest that this may not result in statistically significant results as to, at least, Florida and California.</p>
<p>Third, I also question whether projections should be linear. These numbers do not take into consideration the possible contagion factor by example but not limitation, prion scabie migration, infection and replication (if a causation) not prevented through traditional surgical sterilization methods, the impact of surgical inhalational analgesics as a contributing factor in neurotoxicity/dementia, and the rising incidence of vascular dementia, all of which would suggest an exponential as opposed to linear projection approach.</p>
<p>Fourth, ADRD is a primarily a hidden population. Death certificates rarely report ADRD as a cause of death because other health factors intervene before the afflicted reaches the terminal stages of the disease. Inferring from presentation of county cause of death statistics that ADRD may be quantified in this manner is improper.</p>
<p>Establishing a form of reporting of this disease to more closely define the scope of the problem, particularly in a state which bears a substantially disproportionate share of the ADRD population might be helpful. I don't understand why Florida has an issue with doing, on first impression, a more statistically significant analysis and quantification. Inquiry through residential property tax billing with pass through to non owner occupants was suggested as one way, without incurring significant cost and more closely reflective of county/local needs, to solicit this information. As a secondary benefit, it would also be a way to publicize the brain bank, obtain dedication and encourage, at the early ADRD stages, assembly of diagnostic and cognitive history to accompany donations in furtherance of research.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Disease Advisory Committee </strong></p>
<p>There is a critical and urgent need for provider industry reform, particularly staffing of facilities, as to the elderly in general and a complete reorientation and restructuring of approach as to ADRD. The Task Force declined to address reform. The responsibility for the future of ADRD was left to the industry dominated Alzheimer Disease Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>The constituency, if you will, is the elderly, particularly the 30% or more ADRD elderly and growing proportion of early onset afflicted with ADRD. Yet repeatedly over time, attention is directed, not to the needs of this population, but to the interests of service providers.</p>
<p>When you have a regulatory structure controlled by the regulated through Committee participation or otherwise, evidenced by policy encouraging direct provider benefit through subsidy or oversight avoidance, you have a form of indirect and constitutionally prohibited entrenched special interests influence. It is a little like stepping in quicksand. Once you have lost your way, you are pulled deeper and deeper into the quagmire of minutia driven situational response from which it is impossible to extricate yourself no matter how well meaning your efforts. Your Baker Act justification and analysis is a good example. Proposed respite care funding is another. Underlying all of this is the complete destruction of all hope of responsible choice to caretakers and quality of care for the ADRD as a matter of Florida public policy.</p>
<p>The Committee contains representatives of the assisted living, home health care, hospital and pharmacy industries. They should be removed and replaced by individuals who do not have financial ties by investment, ownership or employment with a provider. Preferential composition, given the enormity of issues, should be given to a retired judge, Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, an economist, attorneys, prosecutors, nurses associations and legislative representatives who are all able to ask the essential questions and perform investigations without challenge to neutrality.</p>
<p>This is not a personal or professional criticism of any of the individuals involved. I don't know them. It is simply that, as a matter of public policy, no industry should be in a position to control, influence or otherwise make policy which regulates its conduct or in which it might directly or indirectly receive a financial benefit. It is a conflict of interest. Industry input is important but not in this way.</p>
<p>You should seek an opinion from the State Attorney General's office on this matter. At minimum, participation creates an appearance of impropriety which could directly or by inference undermine the integrity of efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Department of Elder Affairs. </strong></p>
<p>I was legislative liaison for a State Department many years ago for Aging, Housing, Local Government, MFA, HFA etc.. Back them we had floor privileges in both houses so information exchange was ongoing. No bipartisan disputes attached to any elder issues. During that time, the legislature passed protective measures like the uniform construction code, planned real estate development full disclosure, nursing home patient's rights and a full range of elder services directly or through state matching funds for federal programs with bipartisan support.</p>
<p>When money did not exist for requests that were truly beyond any realistic appropriation expectation, we found a source. For example, when we wanted to fund pharmaceutical assistance for the elderly on the state level, we attached it to the gaming referendum for revenue dedication. When we needed a design/materials/best practices for affordable housing, we did not pay someone to do it, we went to a television network and announced a contest.</p>
<p>As to the Department of the Elderly, I noticed you contracted with an entity to provide design or whatever development plans for a LTC. I did not see the specifications you put out for bidding on this so I can't comment. Facility design and building specs information are easily internet available. I believe the University of Florida already built one of the original Smart Houses and green facility construction is a fact of life as are sustainable communities internationally. (Germany apparently has an entire town self sustaining.)</p>
<p>You might consider publicity, through contests, as a major motivating factor for free design concepts without financially obligating the State. You receive more truly exciting and innovative solutions en masse and if you integrate it with interdisciplinary considerations from technology, security, surveillance, assistive devices, to artificial intelligence and sensory input, entertainment, activities and acute care advanced equipment, with building considerations, you might get past an extended stay design with a pacing circle. Finally, design concepts which integrate isolated small groups are physically and personally dangerous to the welfare of residents unless and until adequate quality staffing with oversight is mandated and aggressively enforced.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Industry Reform </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of these recommendations following is to make facility owners start taking issues concerning elderly seriously because the State of Florida finally does. If it takes sanctions, penalties and other costs as well as license disciplinary/revocation as to staff and owner/facility, so be it. The conduct is wrongful and someone should start caring before injurious results are out of control. Further if conduct would have been criminal outside the walls of a facility, including accessory before and after the fact in cover up, it is time to recognize it for what it is.</p>
<p>Years ago, I was Director of Licensing engaged in casino development at a time when State regulation over construction, all casino and hotel operations and employees was intense. When a facility or operations are heavily scrutinized and fined for misadventure, a higher level of conduct emerges.</p>
<p>The following, from professionals in the field, is exemplary but certainly not exclusive. It does not but should address hospital failure to have in house coverage of ADRD fall risks or wanderers. Caretakers, particularly the sandwich generation who work or have dual elderly/family responsibility and are without funds, cannot sit for 24/7 with a hospitalized ADRD. Some hospitals let an aide do coverage for a group of 2-4. This is extremely helpful and reduces hospital liability risk.</p>
<p>Ownership and Management<br />
					Prequalify, through a 4 way investigation and license owners, investors and management. Educational, experiential and training prerequisites are currently insufficient and should be strengthened. (in Florida you only need high school to operate an ALF) There is precedent for this in NJ's gaming industry and other sensitive fields. We need to start treating the needs of our elderly as critically.</p>
<p>Staffing<br />
					Identify the nature, function and specializations of interdisciplinary staff dealing with ADRD. Increase minimum per patient staffing ratio per shift with specification of their qualifications for dealing with cognitive challenged particularly at night. Background investigations, qualifications and training of staff need to be expanded and reassessed.</p>
<p>Economic Fines and Sanctions<br />
					Continuously inspect and severely economically sanction those substandard facilities which harm the elderly.</p>
<p>Staff and Owner Liability for Violations<br />
					Take action to discipline or revoke the licenses of operators and staff that participated in or were aware of violations or falsified records and failed to report same.</p>
<p>Facility Compliance Repeat Violations<br />
					Federal or state trustee supervised independent contractor assumption of operational activity over extensive or repeat offenders should be provided to bring a facility into compliance with the cost of same borne by the owner/operator. Sanctions should be automatic and not negotiable.</p>
<p>Criminal Liability<br />
					Assault, battery, criminal negligence and endangerment, pain medication theft and financial abuse should be treated through the prosecutor, not the ombudsman, in the same way it would be treated if outside the facility. Staff who participated in or were aware of the offensive conduct and failed to report same should be similarly charged. Inception of any such investigation and criminal proceeding or license sanction or revocation hearing, should be communicated to all concerned federal and state authorities.</p>
<p>ALF and ADRD Care<br />
					ALF classification of care, as it currently exists, should be eliminated as a vehicle for ADRD care. It does not even meet the basic needs of elderly without ADRD and this should be addressed.</p>
<p>Doping<br />
					There is a need for explicit verifiable protocol for the prescription and administration of medication for ADRD as to nature, duration and dosage, documentation of use of off-label drugs and physician (not nurse) justification for exceeding any recommended dosage or duration of administration <strong>after seeing the patient</strong>. There should not be an automatic presumption of physician competence in this area. (One psychiatrist had no knowledge of Lewy body dementia.) When elderly are ignored or have ADRD or are otherwise doped with off label drugs for behavioral control purposes, they cannot articulate pain. It is a form of involuntary imprisonment not unlike the Argentinean prisons in the 50's which used a rudimentary form of psychotropic drugs on inmates. (In Florida, drugs are also being used on juvenile detainees to control behavior.) If elderly ADRD are doped when they act out and they act out because they have untreated cancer or undiagnosed medical condition which they are unable to communicate, they face years of pain in a semi comatose condition before their life ends strapped in a wheelchair or urine soaked bed without relief. There is an urgent need for immediate action. This conduct is criminal and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>Cognitive/sensory activities for ADRD.<br />
					Identification of advanced cognitive conditions which mandate immediate facility release and transfer to a specialized facility dealing with memory care or to a SNF, if attendant medical issues, should be automatic to preclude doping. Facilities should have structured interventions and activities for ADRD which respond to their unique needs.</p>
<p>Financial Abuse<br />
					Prior court approval (after family and beneficiary notice) of any gift, behest, testamentary or other property transfer to a facility or any of its employees should be mandatory.</p>
<p>Surveillance<br />
					Provision of distance web cams to permit HCS and staff monitoring of their charges, particularly in the case of ADRD should be provided. There is ample evidence to suggest that when staff are under surveillance, abuse abates. Similarly female patients in understaffed facilities need to be protected against sexually aggressively ADRD men. The use of minimum wage employees in egregiously understaffed facilities particularly at night is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Fall Risk and Wandering Prevention/Notice to HCS<br />
					Remote notice of bed vacation through sensor monitoring technologies to staff to prevent fall risks and ADRD wandering at night prior to injury is critical. Absence of such protection resulting in death or serious injury has been the basis for substantial litigation. There further needs to be mandatory immediate notification to HCS of injury to patient and accurate record preservation of same.</p>
<p>State of the art lifting devices/equipment<br />
					Staff and patients have been injured by lifting challenges. Staff has a brutal experience lifting physically challenged/obese with long term chronic consequences. Patients are injured if mishandling occurs. This needs to be remedied.</p>
<p>Record Management/Interaction<br />
					HCS's should be able to directly access the patient's records, including medication management and nurses notes through online interactive software between HCS's and facility. No medication or medical treatment should take place without an HCS's consent. Interactions between medications or other medical conditions and side effects should be self contained within this data base, continuously monitored and addressed. There is no need for handwritten files which can be manipulated/altered pre inspection.</p>
<p>Ombudsman<br />
					There needs to be strict guidelines as to the use of the ombudsman function, the obligation of the ombudsman to immediately refer elder endangerment or possible financial abuse to the appropriate authorities and to advise HCS, POA and family of their options, including referral to prosecutor, counsel and a NAELA contact number, or availability of court mediation services as recommended herein. The ombudsman role should be carefully redefined and restricted in scope to matters not possibly criminal in nature. (Some issues are just not appropriate for the ombudsman.)</p>
<p>Facility License Manipulation<br />
					There should be an absolute prohibition of facility license downgrading to avoid continuing state scrutiny and oversight when the facility is faced with closure at the higher level.</p>
<p><strong>Intergenerational Support and Information Access </strong></p>
<p>The "intergenerational" approach suggested would make a nice Hallmark card but you have to deal with reality. It is not going to happen and with ADRD there is an issue as to whether, as to children, it should. There is a reason the ADRD caretaker community has the saying "There is always one" (who takes on the responsibility). Another way of putting it is "There is only one".</p>
<p>Many of us started caretaking in the 90's when we were in our 40's and continued through our late 50's. There is no way to accurately convey the absolute shock of initial ADRD diagnosis and the immediate and complete upheaval and destruction of finances, health, and professional and personal life. The unrelenting stress of the behavioral challenges of this horror of a disease, ongoing sleep deprivation occasioned by sundowning and the sporadic and unpredictable agitation/violence which can result in actual physical injury to the caretaker are not the only challenges. The caretaker must deal with non ADRD medical conditions attendant to the aging process.</p>
<p>In order to understand this, you have to get past the marketed mental picture of a sweet grandmother, mildly confused, smiling at a helpful grandchild. This is a fabrication along with an intact family unit working together when ADRD reaches the upper stages.</p>
<p>The ADRD are agitated, offensive, argumentative and occasionally violent with errant behavior predicated on infection, pain, boredom, frustration and fear. They will pace incessantly, wake you in the middle of the night pulling hair because they want to "go home" or because they think you stole the (deceased) spouse or (deceased) mother. They will get up repeatedly in the middle of the night to get dressed for school, stand by a window or door to protect the family all night and punch anyone who comes close. Alternatively, they just wander out the door. They bite, scratch, hit, and accuse anyone of stealing whatever is on their mind at the time. Then they might stop for a few weeks and just when you think things are good and you attempt to drop them off at ADC so you can get to work, they refuse to move. If you take them out, they can refuse to get out of the car for hours on end when they return since they don't recognize where they are. If they are a fall risk, the problem is worse since you have to follow them to protect them. They might go through a fear of water period for weeks or months. They will take things and hide them or take off their clothes in public. Men, usually, may act in a sexually aggressive way toward children or grandchildren because he thinks they are his wife. The challenges are endless. Children might want to help but the ADRD might not like them. Elderly might be able to handle the ADRD during the day but experience unbearable night challenges. (Perhaps there should be Adult Night Care.)</p>
<p>Whoever they were that you loved, as a spouse or a parent, only exists in decreasingly rare glimpses and disease ramifications have made them unknowable. Maybe they occasionally know you and maybe they just know your name. This can continue for 10-15 years.</p>
<p>Children can't and should not be exposed to this unnecessarily because they are not sufficiently mature to handle it. No one really is. Even adults struggle with being accused of something they never did or being hit when violence was never a part of their life. Why should children have to deal with it when the ADRD might not like having them around? Each case is different but the presented characteristics are common.</p>
<p>Family problems range from lack of cooperation to money and estate issues. I will address this in the section on mediation. However, the recommended approach is through professional ongoing interdisciplinary interaction where intergenerational support is gratuitous or not necessarily family related.</p>
<p>Caretakers are daily exposed to the ravages of this disease and are highly motivated. If a USF professor discovers that when the stress related protein FKBP51 partners with protein Hsp90 it contributes to tau toxicity, we want to find out more. If a student grandchild sees the disease progress, preferably infrequently, research becomes more interesting and an interest in biogenetics, psychiatry or neuroscience might emerge. In those cases, you will start to see intergenerational support in ways you never contemplated.</p>
<p>Research grants issue to the scientific community. (Caretakers become very annoyed when scientific research monies are redirected for any reason particularly industry self training.) Subsidized research finds its way into professional journals inaccessible to the general public except though subscription, per article payment or university affiliation. Accumulated costs to review research for interested caretakers and students coupled with the cost of distance viewing of conference presentations is collectively exorbitant, effectively denying the intended beneficiaries access. I believe the cost of the 2013 pharmaceutical industry report on international advances on Alzheimer's drugs is $1600. Yet they want us to participate in their trials. Journals cost about $37 an article. The Alzheimer's Organization charged $500+ to caretakers for internet viewing of conference proceedings though they exist by virtue of our ADRD.</p>
<p>This somewhat circuitous and incestuous proprietary orientation creates an informational glass ceiling caretakers and students can't afford to break through. Information actually conveyed is usually abstract in content although there are exceptions. NIH did permit free web cam access to the 2012 Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit. Some universities, like University of Miami, permit distance access, without charge, to cognitive training at a level sufficiently advanced to be of interest.</p>
<p>The State Library System could be engaged in concert with state universities to assist access. Alzheimer's national and international interdisciplinary publications on all matters from the scientific (journals on molecular biology, neuroscience, and biogenetics) to new forms of cognitive interventions are of interest along with conferences and lectures. Caretakers and students can get to the local library or access through Kindle etc.</p>
<p>Many caretakers are certified in their profession and/or have one or more doctorates. As to students, I believe it was a 15 year old that discovered an inexpensive strip test for a type of cancer a few years ago. One scientist who was participating in the UW "foldit" program of protein structure modeling, (available online to anyone desirous of participation in research) said that his high school son was much more proficient than he was. If you want student interest in this field and you want to help caretakers help their ADRD, respect their level of intelligence and open the door.</p>
<p>A World Autism Center in Jerusalem is underway through the support of the International Center for Autism Research and Education, which is based in New York City. It plans to include a state of the art research facility, a "global platform" for field researchers, continuing education programs and "university level" courses on the condition. It will also have a residency program and will otherwise include advances in autism research including early detection. In other words, it plans to be the world's "largest multidisciplinary center for autism research, diagnosis, treatment and prevention."</p>
<p>I proposed a similar structure for an international Alzheimer's Center, under the umbrella of the 78 nation Alzheimer Federation and in affiliation with the WHO, providing technologically advanced facilities for scientist and independent NGO research, as well as consolidation and development of available international resources and technology addressing cognitive challenges. This would be an interesting project if Florida wanted to take on the challenge (and it could also incorporate facility design elements).</p>
<p><strong>Court Mediation Services, Caretaker Responsibility and Compensation </strong></p>
<p>In recognition of the statistically significant percentage of the future generation who will be full time caretakers of ADRD parents, disputes as to responsibility and compensation for care whether during the life of the ADRD patient or as to unjust estate enrichment for uncompensated services provided as a post DOD claim thereafter, will impose an overwhelming burden on the courts.</p>
<p>There is an immediate need for the state courts to make available, publicize and encourage pre filing court mediation of any and all family/beneficiary disputes relating to care, including caretaker compensation, whether continuing during the term of the caretaking or post DOD in estate distribution, immediately on diagnosis or indication of need, and reducing same to written agreement. In the absence of such agreement and to the extent this becomes an estate issue, mediation should immediately follow the assertion of an unjust enrichment claim by the caretaker.</p>
<p>Most family disputes are based on allocation of caretaking responsibilities and compensation. Family members may refuse to participate except when their financial interests are concerned at which time they become highly active. Caretakers struggle to find time to sleep much less take on a court battle for compensation particularly when liquidity is limited, they have already lost their income and the only asset is the home.</p>
<p>Absent agreement or early court intervention, an unjust enrichment claim may be asserted against the estate post DOD. Historically these were difficult because there was a presumption that family caretaking should be gratuitous. However, recently and thanks to the Alzheimer's Organization, the nature of ADRD and the demanding nature of the care is receiving international public attention. Courts are now recognizing this claim in ADRD cases and some states have passed laws specifically providing for caretaker compensation.</p>
<p>Provision for special needs or other trusts may not be available or have been addressed in many of these cases. This goes further. Caretaking is sufficiently traumatic without family dissension. Early, expeditious and affordable recourse is essential. Mediation provides it.</p>
<p>This is particularly critical since caretakers of Alzheimer's patients, who collectively save the government billions of dollars are (1) denied Social Security disability benefits, no matter medical conditions which would otherwise justify entitlement or prior contributions to Social Security, usually spanning decades, because of the time restricted credits contribution prerequisite to qualification, (2) further penalized by reduction in future social security benefits by inability to contribute during the protracted caretaking period which consumes what would have been the most economically significant period of their lives, and (3) denied unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>Often, caretakers do not receive compensation (or later assert unjust enrichment claims against the estate) because of (1) insufficient resources, (2) family dissension, (3) exhaustion, and/or (4) a general feeling of obligation toward the afflicted parent or spouse which would make taking compensation for caring personally offensive. They are usually unaware of the loss of Social Security disability benefits for failure to contribute during the caretaking period, have no idea of the potential for their physical harm and immune system collapse from the disease or are unable to do anything about it. They can lose income, savings, assets, and children's college funds during a caretaking period which can continue for ten years or more.</p>
<p>At best, if a personal caretaker, at the end, they are old, they have lost their professional marketability, they don't have the physical strength or emotional stamina to pick up their lives and they are usually medically in trouble. The experience is not unlike PTSD and the caretaker has become the patient without a caretaker. At that point, caretakers are advised that, not only is the enrichment of SS by their efforts not acknowledged, but they are penalized by SSA for the caretaking period in the denial of essential benefits and are denied unemployment benefits. This injustice needs to be addressed and rectified.</p>
<p><strong>Solicitation Practices and Non Profits </strong></p>
<p>In June and July 2013, Tampa Bay Tribune issued an expose' of charitable industry abuse, misuse and outright fraud in solicitation practices. "America's Worst Charities" is the result of collaboration with the California Center for Investigative Reporting, the nation's largest and longest serving nonprofit newsroom dedicated to watchdog journalism. CNN joined the partnership in March. Reports indicate that even the best charities may have a solicitation/public relations cost of up to 40%. After that, take away the balance for infrastructure support which may still not be sufficient if labor intensive services are involved. How much makes its way down the pike to the victims? It is just an overwhelming struggle particularly in today's economy when governments are facing their own crisis. <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page">http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page</a></p>
<p>There are too many low rent operators in Florida, operating out of post office drop boxes and, through internet and other solicitation practices, holding themselves out as ADRD research or educational ventures without qualifications or staff. The underlying motivation is to non profit salary themselves by redirecting funds which should have gone to dedicated university and brain institute research scientists. In furtherance of the public trust which motivated the donation, it is time to take a closer look at the ventures legally permissible in this state and weed out the scams.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>STATEMENT FOR THE RECORD SUBMITTED TO THE<br />
					Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services<br />
					U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center">April 29, 2014</p>
<p>AARP appreciates the opportunity to comment as the Advisory Council prepares to make 2014 recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (National Plan). AARP's mission is to enhance the quality of life for all as we age. Living independently, connected to family, friends and community is key to a high quality of life. As we age, a decline in cognitive health is not only one of people's greatest fears, but it is also one of the greatest threats to living independently and a high quality of life. As with all family caregivers and the loved ones they are helping, tangible steps can be taken to improve the quality of care, quality of outcomes, and quality of life for people living with dementia and their family caregivers. As this country moves forward with the National Plan goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025, we also need to move forward with more effective care for those already affected by dementia, including better care coordination and planning, better access to affordable care, and support for family caregivers who take care of their loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>A. Translate evidence-based, person and family-centered care into widespread practice. </strong></p>
<p>It is important to expand person and family-centered care models broadly to reach the tens of millions of people and their families who could benefit from them. We know that person and family-centered models of dementia care that emphasize continuity of care and coordinate across settings and providers can also improve outcomes. Thanks to academic researchers across the country and the support from federal agencies who are represented on the Advisory Council such as the National Institutes of Health, the Administration for Community Living, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, we have developed an evidence-base from which we can implement better care.<sup>1</sup> In some cases, in addition to improving individual outcomes, we can even deter or delay expensive, disruptive, unwanted hospitalization and institutionalization.<sup>2</sup> Both domestically and internationally, models of care exist which demonstrate interventions that preserve abilities, improve behaviors, and reduce caregiver burden. These models show that we can do more to help those with a diagnosis of dementia -- and find ways to do it in responsible, cost-effective ways.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Despite the evidence that we can improve outcomes for people with dementia, these models of care are unfortunately neither widely known nor widely adopted. All too often, people either go untreated, or even after diagnosis, think there is nothing that can be done. It is important to educate people with dementia and their family caregivers that medical, social and behavioral interventions can help even while we struggle to find a cure for the future. <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>That is why AARP urges the Council to redouble their efforts around goals 2 and 3 of the plan:<br />
					Goal 2: To enhance care quality and efficiency and<br />
					Goal 3: Expand supports for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families.</p>
<p>More broadly, individuals and their family caregivers should be made aware of interventions that can help them.</p>
<p><strong>B. Apply evidence-based quality of care across all settings -- for those living at home receiving care through primary care settings, as well as in residential and institutional settings. </strong></p>
<p>Individuals should receive quality care no matter where they live. As the Advisory Council considers how to achieve the goal of enhanced quality and efficiency of care for those with dementia, it is critical to think about the care provided for those with dementia living in different types of settings. People often live with dementia for long periods of time -- and dementia manifests itself over a continuum of time and abilities. Therefore, quality care needs to adapt over a continuum as well.</p>
<p>AARP is striving to make it easier for older people to live with independence and remain in their homes and communities for as long as they can, surrounded by family and friends. People with dementia are often happier and have more control in their own familiar home, and with the right help and support, they too can continue to live independently.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>While we want people to have the option of living in their homes as long as possible, for some people, particularly those who face advanced stages of dementia, living in a residential setting or nursing home may be the best option for them. Clearly these people still want and deserve to live life on their terms, with dignity and respect, and need high quality care that is affordable and sustainable. Our emphasis on promoting independent living applies to people living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities as well as in home or other smaller community settings.</p>
<p><strong>C. Recognize that quality of care also must include family caregiver support. </strong></p>
<p>In 2009, about 42 million family caregivers in the United States provided care to an adult with limitations in daily activities at any given point in time. They provided unpaid care valued at $450 billion that year, more than total Medicaid spending in 2009 and more than twice the total for paid services and supports, according to AARP's Public Policy Institute.<sup>6</sup> The Alzheimer's Association estimates that more than 15 million of those caregivers are providing care for someone with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>While this concept is important in family caregiving broadly, best practices of care for those with dementia recognize caregiver well-being is essential to maintaining the well-being and abilities of the individual as well.<sup>8</sup> It has been clearly established that counseling and support for spousal caregivers of those with dementia benefit the individual, family caregiver and society. Individuals whose family caregivers received the counseling and support interventions designed by the New York University Caregiver Intervention Study compared to usual care experienced a 28.3% reduction in the rate of nursing home placement.<sup>9</sup> A 2012 report released by AARP's Public Policy Institute and the United Hospital Fund also found that almost half of family caregivers perform medical/nursing tasks for care recipients, such as managing multiple medications and helping with assistive devices for mobility.<sup>10</sup> Families generally do not receive training and other assistance to help them provide care. Such training and supports also benefit the person receiving the assistance.</p>
<p>We need to help the millions of family caregivers navigate the confusing care systems to provide assistance for their loved ones and otherwise support them in their caregiving roles. Family caregivers should be given an assessment of their needs and then receive help based on the assessment, especially when a care or discharge plan depends on a family caregiver voluntarily providing services to an individual. Such assistance should include information, training, counseling, links to community resources, help locating services, respite care, or other supports. In September, a federally appointed Commission on Long-Term Care released a report with important bipartisan recommendations to help build a better system to support individuals and their family caregivers nationwide. <sup>11</sup> Importantly, the Commission called for a national strategy to address the needs of family caregivers. The Commission specifically recommended assessing family caregivers and their needs in the care planning process, including family caregivers in patients' health records and as members of care teams, ensuring family caregivers have access to relevant information technology and, importantly, encouraging family caregiver interventions, including respite, training, and other supportive services. We need to provide the support and tools to all family caregivers so that both the recipient and provider of care can sustain themselves.</p>
<p><strong>D. Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>AARP is dedicated to improving the quality of care to all individuals who need long-term services and supports (LTSS) and supporting creative, innovative mechanisms by which that care can be personalized, delivered, evaluated and financed. We know that older adults with end stage dementia are some of the most complicated and expensive individuals with LTSS needs. They often are living with multiple chronic conditions -- and if we can improve the quality of care for those with dementia, we can use those lessons to improve the care for all people with LTSS needs. Focusing on concrete steps to deliver on goals 2 and 3 of the plan could help make significant strides to assist all older adults and their families.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Additional evidence that ionizing radiation causes Alzheimer’s</strong></p>
<p>In 2011, <em>Medical Hypotheses</em> published my paper proposing that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a long-term consequence of ionizing radiation (IR) due to dental X-rays.<sup>1</sup> Since then, three more articles have been published in scientific journals raising concerns that ionizing radiation may be a cause of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<ol><li>In 2012, a review in the <em>Journal of Radiation Research</em> by Begum et al posed the question, “Does ionizing radiation influence Alzheimer’s disease risk?” The authors declared “significant evidence suggests that exposure to ionizing radiation can lead to the development of AD,” noting that “even relatively low dose exposures” were of concern. In their conclusion, although they note “the absence of conclusive epidemiological or molecular data proving unequivocally that exposure to IR increases the risk of developing AD … there is consistent evidence that IR might trigger mechanisms that could ultimately favor AD.”<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>A few months later, a review by Kempf et al was epublished by <em>Radiation and Environmental Biophysics</em> titled, “Long-term effects of ionising (sic) radiation on the brain: cause for concern?” The authors concluded that beyond the fact that ionizing radiation can cause cancer, the “…latest evidence from epidemiological data as well as animal and cellular studies suggests an additional role in increasing the risk of non-cancerous diseases, including neurodegeneration.” They suggested that ionizing radiation may be causally linked with both Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.<sup>3</sup></li>
<li>Later that year in <em>PLoS One</em>, a study by Cherry et al designed to find out whether astronauts on long flights would experience cognitive deficits made national headlines. The environmental factor being tested was cosmic radiation, which is an umbrella term for a number of different types of radiation, including X-rays. In the experiment, mice exposed to ionizing radiation in the form of highly charged iron particles developed brain pathology and cognitive deficits that were consistent with Alzheimer’s.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ol><p>All four papers propose different pathways to neurodegeneration via ionizing radiation, with some overlap, yet with all of the scientific literature on the subject -- each review has well over 100 citations, many of which relate specifically to radiation-induced effects -- why has the possibility that ionizing radiation may be a major cause of dementia not been properly addressed?</p>
<p>Traditionally, radiation experts, doctors and dentists have compared low levels of medical radiation to a single airplane flight or an extra day of environmental exposure. They point out that we are naturally exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation arising from the ground and descending from the sky, called “background radiation,” without apparent ill effect. However, it is only within the last 100 years that frequent, lifelong head exposure to X-rays from dental visits has become “normal.”</p>
<p>Before proceeding further, it is important to note that the three latest papers only suggest that ionizing radiation could be causing dementia and do not venture that dental X-rays are the source. Begum et al clarify that by “relatively low doses,” they are referring to computed tomography (CT) scans (versus Caroline Rodgers • Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services 4/29/14 • 2 | P a g e oncological doses); Kempf et al do not address dental X-ray exposure beyond noting that together, diagnostic medical and dental radiation exposures have increased significantly in recent years. Cherry et al only consider the possible consequences of space travel, not oral health as it is practiced today.</p>
<p>Dental X-rays, unlike comparable levels of background radiation that occurs over several hours or days, can involve multiple head exposures in quick succession, which could overwhelm cellular recovery mechanisms. Consider that a full mouth series usually involves between 14 and 21 individual X-ray images; a panoramic X-ray systematically scans the jaws, jaw joints, nasal area, sinuses and teeth; bitewings expose upper and lower back teeth at the same time and usually are done in pairs; and occlusal X-rays aim at the floor or roof of the mouth. Can we really state with confidence that this increase in head exposure to ionizing radiation, which starts in early childhood and continues throughout adulthood, is unrelated to the increase in dementia? Alzheimer’s is distinct from age-related cognitive loss both in terms of brain pathology and symptoms and has become a major killer within the same 100 years that has brought us this array of common dental X-ray procedures.</p>
<p>If the answer to stopping the Alzheimer’s epidemic is not drug or therapy development but simply taking many fewer X-rays with head involvement, the kind of market-driven research that America is good at and has yielded results in cancer treatment will not work. That is why we need government and/or academic leadership to form and fund research teams that will properly investigate the effects of ionizing radiation on the brain.</p>

<p>I am submitting the enclosed 5-page statement to be read at the April 29, 2014 meeting of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services. My statement addresses the importance of determining the cause of dementia when it is recognized in medical practice.</p>
<p>I am a geriatric and cognitive neurologist. My clinical activities primarily involve the evaluation and care of patients with cognitive deficits. I wish to provide greater insight from the perspectives of practicing clinicians, patients, and their families. I propose that the Council adopt two recommendations as outlined in my statement:</p>
<ul><li>The Council should unequivocally, firmly and explicitly recommend that when dementia is identified, its cause should be determined.</li>
<li>The Council should prioritize research that expands the evidence base evaluating the value in clinical practice of knowing the cause of dementia.</li>
</ul><p>==========</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Public Comments to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services</strong><br />
					Tuesday April 29, 2014</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide public comments to the Advisory Council. I am unable to attend today's meeting in person so I request that this statement be read to the Council. The content and motivations for this statement are entirely my own. Citations and conflicts of interest are listed in the written version of these comments I have submitted.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide public comments to the Advisory Council. I am a board-certified geriatric neurologist, Professor of Neurology and Senior Investigator in The Brain Institute at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. I direct the Center for Alzheimer's Care, Imaging and Research and I am Chief of the Division of Cognitive Neurology. Over the past 30 years I have maintained an active clinical practice as a cognitive neurologist. My clinical activities primarily involve the evaluation and care of patients with cognitive deficits. Our Center has a unique role. We are the sole academic dementia program in the Intermountain West, and our Cognitive Disorders Clinic is the primary referral center for 10% of the geographic United States. This provides a unique perspective I hope you will find helpful in your deliberations.</p>
<p>The single most significant factor impeding the care of patients is the lack of consensus about the value of knowing the cause of dementia. <strong>The Council should unequivocally, firmly and explicitly recommend that when dementia is identified, its cause should be determined</strong>. Patients with dementia and their families deserve the dignity and respect of knowing the cause of their illness. It should no longer be acceptable to have their problems simply dismissed as "dementia".</p>
<p>I see in my practice daily the adverse consequences when the cause of dementia is not identified. Without a known cause, treatment is chaotic, fragmented, and ineffective. Without a known cause, prognosis is uncertain and there is little care planning or support. I recently saw a highly educated patient with diabetes that exemplifies this problem. Although his diabetes always had been well controlled with insulin, his doctors several years ago began to notice he wasn't paying attention to his blood sugars. No mental status was performed (after all cognitive screening isn't a recommended procedure). When his family became increasingly concerned about his memory problems, they were told he just had dementia and was put on Aricept. Perhaps because of his physician's uncertainty of this course of treatment, he provided no counseling about what to expect. His family discontinued this drug when his memory problems continued. Later, he was prescribed a scopolamine patch when he went on a cruise; treatment that would clearly be contraindicated in Alzheimer's disease. He became dramatically worse -- his family never understood why. Meanwhile he continued to manage his own insulin. Predictably and unnecessarily if his dementia had been recognized as due to a progressive disease, he developed hypoglycemic seizures requiring emergency treatment and hospital admission. Just before I saw him a Medicare annual wellness visit was completed, but without an assessment of cognition (this is very common, even though supposedly required). His family became uncomfortable with the lack of guidance they had received. By the time of his first visit with me, he had severe memory loss, hesitant speech, was unable to name simple objects, copy simple figures or draw a clock. Even though he had trouble dressing and became very anxious when his wife left the room, he continued to drive. (His physician hadn't restricted driving or indicated his abilities might change. His wife had no support in his care, his daughter accompanying him didn't know what she should do to help, and they had not contacted the Alzheimer's Association. My evaluation led to the conclusion that he has Alzheimer's disease dementia, but that 3 small previously unsuspected strokes also had likely contributed to his relatively rapid decline. Now we can begin appropriate care and help his family avoid future care crises and manage a progressive dementing disease.</p>
<p>Dementia is not a medical diagnosis; it simply describes a syndrome that can be due to any of several dozen causes. It is inconceivable that a physician today would fail to determine the cause of chest pain, stroke, shortness of breath or any symptom as serious as dementia. Yet, this is the current state of affairs with dementia. Why? It is considered axiomatic that knowing the cause of a medical problem is necessary for appropriate treatment. Why isn't doesn't this seem to apply to dementia? Physicians usually vigorously pursue an accurate and precise diagnosis.</p>
<p>My clinical colleagues, health systems and insurers are all well aware that no existing guidelines require determining the cause of dementia. The American Academy of Neurology provides guidelines for what testing should be performed in a dementia evaluation, but offers no opinion regarding whether or not such a diagnostic evaluation should be undertaken (Knopman et al., 2001). Reportedly, this is because there is no supportive evidence from clinical trials! Who would suggest a randomized trial where a diagnostic evaluation is withheld from half of patients? Is there really equipoise about this question? The American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians guidelines for treatment of dementia fail to mention evaluation and seem to assume that determining causation is unexpected and unnecessary since treatment is discussed only on in the context of dementia syndrome (Qaseem et al., 2008). The Council through its recommendations and influence can begin to change expectations so that the cause of dementia always is sought.</p>
<p>The consequences of diagnostic nihilism are everywhere manifest. The US Prevention Services Task Force has decided not to recommend screening to detect cognitive impairment in primary care (Moyer et al., 2014). Insurers often have failed to reimburse testing shown to increase the accurate and confident understanding of causation, justifying this with the belief that the effort has no value. In this environment, the Council's important recommendation of early recognition and evaluation is unlikely to be implemented. The concept of precision care, embraced in other fields, and critical for improving quality, seems nearly unattainable unless we agree that cause of dementia is important.</p>
<p>Diagnostic nihilism also breeds therapeutic nihilism. If there is a feeling of "why bother" about determining the cause of dementia, then existing treatments also become dismissed. Needed services are not offered and we hear that there is no treatment for Alzheimer's (even among some experts). This nihilism often extends to families and has huge implications for care. When causation is irrelevant dementia care becomes unlinked to medical practice. As a result doctors can feel that dementia is just a social problem not of their concern (Connell et al., 1996). They justify using drug treatments simply to "offer something" rather than treat a disease (Franz et al., 2007). Determining the cause of dementia is difficult and time consuming. As long as insurers, health systems and professional societies find it acceptable, doctors will find it easier and financially advantageous to opt out of investigating the cause of dementia. The price is paid in the quality of care patients receive. How can we expect treatment to improve when those providing care don't even know what disease they are treating? How can patients and families make difficult life-changing decisions when they are uncertain about cause of the problem and its likely course?</p>
<p>The Council also can begin to change expectations through its recommendations about research. <strong>The Council should prioritize research that expands the evidence base evaluating the value in clinical practice of knowing the cause of dementia</strong>. Research centers should be encouraged to begin generating data addressing the relevance of improved accuracy and specificity of diagnosis. Validated measures of high quality care outcomes relevant to clinical care are necessary to change existing practice expectations among insurers and providers. Our concept of treatment should be expanded beyond drug treatments and to populations reflecting clinical practice, rather than highly selected groups needed for mechanistic and proof-of-concept studies.</p>
<p>We who are most committed to improving the quality of life of patients with dementia and their families must agree on the simple proposition that determining the cause of cognitive impairment should be a fundamental expectation in clinical practice. Peer expectations are critical in clinical practice. We must help define those expectations. Otherwise, our patients will be sentenced forever to poor quality care. Caring without knowing causation is well-intentioned kindness, but it's not medicine.</p>

<p>Jane Tilly made some comments about ACL and ADSSP programs. It sounds like some great things are starting to happen. I just hope they are involving people with YOAD in the creation of these programs.</p>
<p>During my time as an advocate I have made contact with people all over the world, and I have come to realize that there are some great and pioneering programs happening out there in the dementia arena. Some are based on scientific research, and some are not but they all have great outcomes. Unfortunately these programs go unnoticed by the majority of people. I have seen famous institutions try to invent a program from scratch, unaware that the same program had been established in the same area some time-ago. This wastes time, money and vital resources that can be better spent on other ventures.</p>
<p>A good example comes from a well-known scientist based on the west coast with whom I spoke with a few weeks ago. We were discussing a new trial he was considering perusing, a trial that he assumed was the first of its kind. However, I had previously spoken to a person on the east coast who had already started a similar program. Knowing that the program had already been established elsewhere saved the scientist time and money. This is a clear reason why it is vital that information be shared.</p>
<p>We must develop a way of sharing the best ideas from around the world, and at the same time educate people. An ideal solution would be to have an international information portal where people can share ideas, and upload information about programs that have been created. The site will have an administrator whose job it is to review the information provided.</p>
<p>The portal should be broken down into categories including location, type of program e.g. drug trial or meeting and who it suits best. Ideally there will have a top three recommendations. An already-existing government site would be an ideal place for this portal to be located.</p>
<p>At our last meeting I mentioned the need for dementia-friendly communities and businesses, and that I was in talks with a local hospital in my area. Well I am happy to announce that after two long years the hospital has now not only decided to create a dementia-friendly hospital, they have also decided to educate and engage the community so we can build a dementia-friendly community.</p>
<p>This vision has been shared with the committee and I hope that this program can be used as a model that can be rolled out across the US. I hope to put Doylestown PA on the map as being a true dementia-friendly community, because until we have a cure we must create environments that enable and encourage those living with dementia to live full and productive lives within our communities.</p>
<p>I believe the best ideas come from those directly impacted by dementia since they know what it's like to deal with this disease. So many like me can be true assets if given the opportunity to be included in the process. The sad fact is that many institutions and programs are not willing to include us which I cannot understand. How can you resolve the issues that affect us if you do not completely understand them all? Companies, organizations, health providers and the public need to be encouraged to use us as a resource.</p>
<p>By taking these steps we will start to eradicate the stigma that goes hand in hand with this disease.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to be changed to take into account those who are no longer able to operate a vehicle safely, but not to impact those, like me, who are still able to drive. First responders need educating, and a system needs to be created that will help identify a dementia patient.</p>
<p>In my opinion awareness continues to be the biggest problem for those impacted by dementia. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show that Alzheimer's is a disease that affects all ages and not just associated with getting older. Education will lead to many other benefits.</p>
<p>While it is very important that people know that there is no cure; that those affected will die, there should be no excuse for not encouraging those who have the diagnosis to live life to the fullest. Having a diagnosis of dementia does not mean we lose our willingness to live, or motivation to contribute to society. We need opportunities to engage in meaningful activities throughout the course of the disease.</p>
<p>We should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. While this is still a taboo subject we must talk about these issues.</p>
<p>I hope you have read my vision. I welcome the opportunity to speak with you further and go into more details. My idea highlights the problems and points to a simple solution, but it's not the only solution. I leave that up to those who understand the system better then I. I just took a stab at it.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the committee for electing a member who has dementia. This is an important role, with a great deal of responsibility being placed on the elected member to represent us in an adequate manner. As a person with Alzheimer's who serves on the PA State committee I know how challenging it is to be a part of the process, and to communicate with the people I serve with because of my disease. We as representatives and advocates need to be effective, and as the disease progresses and renders us ineffective we need to have the strength and fortitude to step down, and allow another with the disease to take the reins. Mr. Moore, I wish you the best of luck, we are all counting on you. Please feel free to reach out to me and your friends living with dementia.</p>
<p>Good Luck Don and I will miss you!</p>

<p>Below are my comments for the public record. If you can group this with the earlier files I sent you that would be great. This being first. Thanks</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>Some comments on the earlier topic on CMS.</p>
<p>In reference to the availability of PET Amyloid scans.</p>
<p>I think it is very important to the outcome of people like me to these tools.</p>
<p>For me it took 9 years to get a diagnoses. It was not until I received the PET scan that it confirmed that something was truly wrong. Many insurance companies still do not pay for that test. I cannot begin to tell you how many times I had repeat many of the test hoping for an answer. I even had 3 Neuropsychological tests that cost over $2500.00 each during that time.</p>
<p>Because of this diagnose.</p>
<p>I was able to start my medications.</p>
<p>Start my end of life planning and make plans to live life to the fullest in the short time I had left.</p>
<p>Able to get in Clinical trials</p>
<p>Apply for disability</p>
<p>Able to now focus my effort to being an advocate for the disease which had now given me a new life's purpose.</p>
<p>When I need surgery the doctor was able to avoid anesthetics contraindicated in AD.</p>
<p><strong>The delay in my diagnose led to being fired from my job and losing the very benefits I had contributed to that would have taken care of me for the rest of my life. It would have even simplified it for my caregiver. Now we both suffer. I lost it all and must rely on social security. </strong></p>
<p>I would like to personally thank this advisory council for supporting the Department of Health and Human Services decision to include someone living with dementia on the committee. I believe people around the world will view this as a major step forward for people with dementia. Ideally this should set an example to be followed by all people, businesses and organizations. While we may have a progressive disease we still have a lot to contribute to society if we are just given the chance. It is decisions such as this that will help reduce stigma, and prove to people what we are capable of doing. I speak for myself and many others when I say thank you so much.</p>
<p>As some of you know I have been appointed to the PA State Alzheimer's Planning Committee. I was very excited by the feedback I received after the first meeting on the commitment to make the plan successful before it was even discussed or even created. I wish I could be as excited about the work being accomplished here at NAPA. While there are great ideas coming from all of you, and plans and polices are being created, there is still a distinct lack of funding. Many of you here have the power to influence those who are in a position to increase funding; I encourage you to do more. We are all aware that Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease of the century, more than heart disease and cancer, yet the leaders chose to do nothing, in effect ignoring those of us who are dying in the most horrible way possible. The funding that we have for this disease is even less today than before; we are heading the wrong way. Many people get excited by the comment on proposed budget increases; people like me only get excited on the actual budget changes. Budget proposals are even more disappointing than the failure of clinical trials.</p>
<p>For some time I have worked on putting together a vision of what people with dementia need. I believe many people have an idea of what is required, but I feel the best ideas come from those directly impacted by dementia because those of us who are living with dementia know how we feel, and what we need. My vision has been shared with the PA state, and I have sent a copy to all those on the NAPA Advisory Council. It is my hope that this document becomes shared with all the states and other parts of the world. I would also be more than happy to expand on the reasoning behind what I came up with and why I felt it would be a benefit to not only the people living with this disease but also their family and friends. I hope you take what I have written and use it as a guideline for what is needed and you create a model of best practices for others to use.</p>
<p>Below is a list of issues as I see them from my introduction statement on June 7th that I shared with the PA state committee.</p>
<p>In my opinion awareness is the biggest problem. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show that Alzheimer's is a disease that affects all ages; it is not just associated with getting older. I know of a 30-year-old, and a 29-year-old who have it.</p>
<p>Stigma of the disease must be eradicated.</p>
<p>Companies and communities must treat this like any other disability.</p>
<p>State laws need to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve immediately.</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is.</p>
<p>People should be fast-tracked for social security instead of being treated like crooks while they are getting deeper into hardship.</p>
<p>First responders need educating, and a system needs to be created that will help identify us without becoming a target for others.</p>
<p>We need a way to deal with our guns.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those who are no longer capable, and not to impact those that are still able to drive.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways if we are looking to make it better for those impacted.</p>
<p>Need to encourage dementia-friendly communities and businesses.</p>
<p>We must be able to live life to the fullest even though we have the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Having a diagnosis of dementia does not mean we lose our willingness or motivation to be contributing members of society. We need opportunities to engage in meaningful activities throughout the course of the disease.</p>
<p>We must encourage the research and provide funding.</p>
<p>Trials need to provide more flexibility by using communication technology.</p>
<p>Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia.</p>
<p>Patients should be made aware of the living wills which should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p>I hope you will now look at my vision and give it consideration.</p>
<p>I thank you for your new and improved plan, but we are far from being able to take a bow for any real credit. So much more must be done.</p>
<p><em>I'd like to thank the Alzheimer's Association for making it possible for me to be at NAPA.</em></p>

<p>Re: Recommendations for a National Uniform Law Regulating Elder Facilities, Court PrefilingMediation of ADRD Family Caretaker Responsibility and Compensation, Amendment to the SSA on Caretaker Disability Entitlement and the establishment of a World Alzheimer's Institute</p>
<p>I have reviewed the NAPA Plan, as updated, and thank the Alzheimer's Organization for its awareness efforts. Consolidated informal comments and recommendations from caretakers, attorneys and health care professionals follows. I thank NIH for its continuing publications on clinical trials and health related issues and the FDA for its oversight function and providing assistance to caretakers filing notices of clinical trial mismanagement. Specific recommendations fully within NAPA authority are contained at the end of this statement.</p>
<p>I am an attorney who has been in the Alzheimer's trenches for fifteen years. We had a triple dose of this insidious disease in my extended family. I handled a level 6 case 24/7 for ten years. During this period and continuing post DOD, I remain committed to interdisciplinary research from the progression of clinical efforts to find a cure to identifying ways to improve the quality of life of those afflicted with Alzheimer's in the absence thereof. I retain an ongoing interest in the welfare of the hundreds of caretakers I have met over the years and concern with the inevitable ruinous impact of this disease on the next generation.</p>
<p>The industry report on AD entitled "<strong>Alzheimer's Drugs Market, 2012 - 2017</strong> was issued in May 2013. It is a comprehensive document which the extensive outline, (including mention of NAPA) clearly demonstrates with key objective to establish the likely evolution of leading drugs, generics and launch of new drugs across the different regions in the world. I watched the NIH sponsored Alzheimer'sDisease Research Summit 2012: Path to Treatment and Prevention in real time, paid particular attention to counsel and came away with no hope of cooperation for obvious proprietary legal intellectual property and economic reasons which are without the control of the NIH. In fact, it appears that the scope of any cooperation is extremely sensitive since even the appearance of infringement could result in litigation which holds up distribution of a viable curative pharmaceutical indefinitely.</p>
<p>There is some disappointment with a few NAPA initiatives perceived as a disservice to victims of ADRD without a voice who are pleading for protection and to the caretakers who give up everything to provide support.</p>
<p>I don't see the DOJ, the FDA or the IRS and United States Patent Office on your federal agency list? I don't see the ABA Commission on Aging/NAELA charged with a NAPA mandate to address legal issues in this area. Perhaps you need a broader resource base. Everyone wants to help.</p>
<p>As to the alzheimers.gov, you have a list of drugs on your site for ADRD care. The FDA has stated that certain drugs are contraindicated with elderly with dementia and are in fact life threatening. Would you please coordinate your representations with the FDA before another elderly person is seriously hurt? Regardless of the $100 million False Claims Act charges and sanctions against J&amp;J relating to Omnicare bribery, either these drugs are approved for use by the elderly ADRD or they are not. Clarification would be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>ADRD population</strong></p>
<p>There is a concern that first, the base from which linear extrapolations have been made as to the number of ADRD is not statistically significant and existing and future service delivery needs will therefore be underestimated. We are not supporting the caretaker population, estimated at 25-30 million, directly or by providing adequate support for prevention of facility neglect and abuse so alternatives to home caretaking will be available.</p>
<p>What will the future hold for high school and college students who justifiably want to know whether and why they should invest in their future if everything is going to fall apart with 50% of the future population ADRD caretaking? At minimum, ADRD educational/training materials should be made available through the state library systems so caretakers/children will have easy and immediate access to free resources.</p>
<p>Second, taken to the extreme, without resolution of the causation issue, does the potential for prion scabie migration/replication through surgical equipment and water supply raise the potential for contagion and exponential as opposed to linear expansion of this population? There are patents available which deal with prion destruction in surgical equipment sterilization not currently accomplished with traditional techniques. Is it possible to address these concerns?</p>
<p><strong>Social Security Disability and Caretakers</strong></p>
<p>The SSA discriminates against caretakers of ADRD as a class in denial of disability benefits. The theory of liability as to the SS is unjust enrichment No one wants to see this mushroom into a class action but if this injustice is not rectified, another forum for redress will be pursed.</p>
<p>Caretakers of Alzheimer's patients, who collectively save the government billions of dollars are (1) denied Social Security disability benefits, no matter medical conditions which would otherwise justify entitlement or prior contributions to Social Security, usually spanning decades, because of the time restricted credits contribution prerequisite to qualification, (2) further penalized by reduction in future social security benefits by inability to contribute during the protracted caretaking period which often consumes what would have been the most economically significant period of their lives, and (3) denied unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>Caretakers do not receive compensation (or later assert unjust enrichment claims against the estate) because of (1) insufficient resources, (2) family dissension, (3) exhaustion, and/or (4) a general feeling of obligation toward the afflicted parent or spouse which would make taking compensation for caring personally offensive. They are usually unaware of the loss of disability benefits for failure to contribute during the caretaking period, have no idea of the potential for their physical harm and immune system collapse from the disease or are unable to do anything about it. They can lose income, savings, assets, and children's college funds during a caretaking period which can continue for ten years or more.</p>
<p>Many of us started caretaking in the 90's when we were in our 40's and continued through our late 50's. There is no way to accurately convey the absolute shock of initial ADRD diagnosis and the immediate and complete upheaval and destruction of finances, health, and professional and personal life. The unrelenting stress of the behavioral challenges of this horror of a disease, ongoing sleep deprivation occasioned bysundowning and the sporadic and unpredictable agitation/violence which can result in actual physical injury to the caretaker are not the only challenges. The caretaker must deal with non ADRD medical conditions attendant to the aging process.</p>
<p>Spouse caretakers usually predecease the AD patient since the stress of caretaking destroys the immune system. If children take on the responsibility they are similarly affected. Although ADRD manifests itself differently in each individual, the one common thread is the impact on the caretakers. They deal with the protracted trauma of losing the essence of their loved one years before the actual physical death. At best, if a personal caretaker, at the end, they are old, they have lost their professional marketability, they don't have the physical strength or emotional stamina to pick up their lives and they are usually medically in trouble.</p>
<p>The experience is not unlike PTSD and the caretaker has become the patient without a caretaker.</p>
<p>At that point, caretakers are advised that, not only is the enrichment of SS by their efforts not acknowledged, but they are penalized by SSA for the caretaking period in the denial of essential benefits. This injustice needs to be addressed and rectified through (1) amendment to SSA disability prerequisites relating to entitlement based time restricted contribution period for ADRD and other caretakers, or (2) a class action against the SSA for unjust enrichment of the fund attributable to private caretakers efforts and in the denial of benefits to caretakers who would otherwise qualify for disability.</p>
<p><strong>Court Mediation Services on Caretaker Responsibility and Compensation</strong></p>
<p>In recognition of the statistically significant percentage of the future generation who will be full time caretakers of ADRD parents, disputes as to responsibility and compensation for care whether during the life of the ADRD patient or as to unjust estate enrichment for uncompensated services provided as a post DOD claim thereafter, will impose an overwhelming burden on the courts.</p>
<p>There is an immediate need for the state courts to make available, publicize and encourage prefilingcourt mediation of any and all family/beneficiary disputes relating to care, including caretaker compensation, whether continuing during the term of the caretaking or post DOD in estate distribution, immediately on diagnosis or indication of need, and reducing same to written agreement. In the absence of such agreement and to the extent this becomes an estate issue, mediation should immediately follow the assertion of an unjust enrichment claim by the caretaker.</p>
<p>When care facilities are undesirable or financially impractical, the burden falls on the family particularly in the case of ADRD where 24/7 care is involved. In many cases, qualified at home care providers are not available or are unwilling to do AD because it is just too hard. The comment I received from an agency representative was "life is too short". Unqualified at home care providers pose a danger to the patient.</p>
<p>There is a saying in the AD community that "there is always one" (family member) who assumes primary and often sole responsibility for care. Most family disputes are based on allocation of caretaking responsibilities and compensation. Family members may refuse to participate except when their financial interests are concerned at which time they become highly active. Caretakers struggle to find time to sleep much less take on a court battle for compensation particularly when liquidity is limited, they have already lost their income and the only asset is the home.</p>
<p>Absent agreement or early court intervention, an unjust enrichment claim may be asserted against the estate post DOD. Historically these were difficult because there was a presumption that family caretaking should be gratuitous. However, recently and thanks to the Alzheimer's Organization, the nature of ADRD and the demanding nature of the care is receiving international public attention. Courts are now recognizing this claim in ADRD cases and some states have passed laws specifically providing for caretaker compensation.</p>
<p>Provision for special needs or other trusts may not be available or have been addressed in many of these cases. This goes further. Caretaking is sufficiently traumatic without family dissension. Early, expeditious and affordable recourse is essential. Mediation provides it.</p>
<p><strong>The ABA Commission on Aging/NAELA should draft a uniform national law regulating facilities and employees. License should be conditioned on compliance or relinquish entitlement to federal and state benefits/subsidies.</strong></p>
<p>There is an absolute necessity for a national uniform statute/regulations for state enactment regulating ECC, ALF's and SNF's, otherwise conditioning the provision of federal subsidies and benefits on facility compliance and providing stringent sanctions for violations, not only as to the facility, but as to participating health care professionals.</p>
<p>The ABA has successfully taken on uniform national laws in the past and it is particularly critical here. The attorneys from the ABA Commission on Law and Aging/NAELA have the talent and the experience in the trenches of facility abuse to handle this issue. If NAPA fails to give a voice to elderly ADRD through strong advocacy and protection of their interests, they will have failed their mandate.</p>
<p>The Miami Herald issued a three part investigative report in 2011entitled, "Neglected to Death" <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com">http://www.miamiherald.com/neglectedtodeath/index.html#morer</a> This is essential reading for anyone in this field. The Nursing home abuse blog and other resources provides an overview of, for example Emeritus (California - wrongful death, Florida - bed sores, medication misadministration and falsification of medical records etc. etc.) Usually the response is simply to convert to a lower classification of care (independent living) to circumvent future state oversight. The Florida legislature has twice failed to enact legislation to remedy abuse. The industry is now attempting to enact legislation in Florida which will make it more difficult to sue for abuse.</p>
<p>With advance apology to truly outstanding health care professionals delivering quality care, caretakers do not place their loved ones in facilities because the (1) the health, safety and security of the ADRD cannot be assured in substandard, understaffed facilities (2) there is excessive doping (chemical restraints) to compensate for inadequate staffing, (3) the facilities do not take high level ADRD without a 24/7 private aide making it a cost prohibitive venture, (4) Medicaid beds are not made available to ADRD unless the condition developed post initial admission, and (4) the state is lax or nonresponsive in enforcement.</p>
<p>Please understand our collective, absolute fury with your "15%" reduction in doping and demand for clarification. This is a civil rights if not a criminal battery issue. It is not subject to arbitrary and callous treatment as an administrative efficiency issue. Visit an AL or SNF and speak with families and attorneys who specialize in this field. Look at your own deficiency reports on the 620 nursing facilities in Florida alone and the court abuse claims against assisted living facilities. There are a substantial number of attorneys in the ABA Commission on Law and Aging/NAELA who would be happy to provide education.</p>
<p>When elderly are ignored or have ADRD or are otherwise doped with off label drugs for behavioral control purposes, they cannot articulate pain. It is a form of involuntary imprisonment not unlike the Argentinean prisons in the 50's which used a rudimentary form of psychotropic drugs on inmates. (In Florida, drugs are also being used on juvenile detainees to control behavior.) If elderly ADRD are doped when they act out and they act out because they have untreated cancer or undiagnosed medical condition which they are unable to communicate, they face years of pain in a semi comatose condition before their life ends strapped in a wheelchair or urine soaked bed without relief. There is an urgent need for immediate action. This conduct is criminal and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>Which 8.5% of this group are you comfortable abandoning?</p>
<p>We had three experiences with respite in ten years in two high level SNF's and one hospice, each stay under two weeks. The first resulted in a hip fracture with the elderly woman in the next bed in the same condition. (The other woman was given haldoland cried for hours.) The second stay resulted in extensive bruising, a cut on the forehead and a hematoma on both arms. The hospice, situated in a hospital, was advised preadmission that the ADRD could not call for help and, as a fall risk, did not need diapering but needed a commode next to the bed which she could utilize. They put her as far away from the nursing station as possible in a room with a woman who was incapable of any communication, put her in diapers she would not use and put the side bed rails up. Within 8 hours of admission, she had fallen attempting to get out of bed to go to the bathroom and had ripped open her leg about 10 inches. When I arrived at 5 am, she was bleeding on the bed. (My father entered a hospital without a mark on his body and was discharged with a stage 3 decubitus with MRSA on his coccyx.) All of this has to stop now.</p>
<p>To the extent doping, neglect and abuse is not rectified, elderly will continue suffering and families will forfeit their livelihood, savings, children college funds and quality of life to keep their loved ones safe at home. Please do not make it the policy of NAPA to tolerate any form of institutionalized abuse.</p>
<p>Many facilities are not capable of or are unwilling to provide essential services to insure the safety and care of their elderly residents. There are too many profiteer operators opening what are essentially extended stays with food service, mandating understaffed facilities to achieve a substantial owner benefit/ROI without regard for the quality of life of their residents.</p>
<p>There is an absolute necessity to continuously inspect and severely economically sanction those substandard facilities which harm the elderly. Take action to discipline or revoke the licenses of operators and staff that participated in or were aware of violations or falsified records and failed to report same. Similarly, federal or state trustee supervised independent contractor assumption of operational activity should be provided to bring a facility into compliance with the cost of same borne by the owner/operator. Sanctions should be automatic and not negotiable.</p>
<p>The foregoing does not overlook and in fact should aggressively pursue actions for assault, battery, criminal negligence and endangerment, pain medication theft and financial abuse as appropriate through the prosecutor, not the ombudsman, who, in turn, should immediately notify all concerned federal and state concerned authorities of the pendency of any investigation and subsequent charges. I have discussed this matter with major city police from San Francisco to Boston and they have horrifying tales.</p>
<p>This industry is unable to regulate itself. The recent ALA request for state plans was disappointing. Florida ALA declined to do its own report and adopted the Texas plan. None are particularly effective in addressing resident issues if reform would economically burden the owner.</p>
<p>The uniform national law act should set forth, with specificity, optimal minimum standards for facility operation including but not limited to</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Qualification and licensing of owners/operators (in Florida you need high school to operate an ALF),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimum facility per patient staffing,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background investigation, qualifications and training of staff,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALF classification of care, as it currently exists, should be eliminated in its entirety,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explicit verifiable protocol for the prescription and administration of medication for ADRD as to nature, duration and dosage, documentation of use of off label drugs and physician (not nurse) justification for exceeding any recommended dosage or duration of administration <strong>after seeing the patient</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Program of cognitive/sensory activities for ADRD. Identification of advanced cognitive conditions which mandate immediate facility release and transfer to a specialized facility dealing with memory care or to a SNF if attendant medical issues, (The advent of IPADS and touch screens opens new door in this area for ADRD who could not negotiate a mouse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior court approval (after family and beneficiary notice) of any gift, behest, testamentary or other property transfer to a facility or any of its employees,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provision of distance web cams to permit HSC and staff monitoring of their charges, particularly in the case of ADRD. There is ample evidence to suggest that when staff are under surveillance, abuse abates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heat sensoredmonitoring of fall risks and ADRD so movement leading to bed vacation at night can be identified by staff prior to injury or wandering and without alarms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mandatory immediate notification to HSC of injury to patient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State of the art lifting devices/equipment to prevent staff injury have to be provided in each facility. Staff has a brutal experience lifting physically challenged/obese without injuring themselves. (Robots exist to deliver medication in hospitals. Cornell has a robot to take a beer out of the refrigerator deliver and pour it. Why not a robot to help? It has to be less in cost than repeated hip fractures, rehab and OSHA damage awards.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HCS's should be able to directly access the patient's records, including medication management and nurses notes through online interactive software access between HCS's and facility. No medication or medical treatment should take place without an HCS's consent. Interactions between medications or other medical conditions and side effects should be self contained within this data base, continuously monitored and addressed. There is no need for handwritten files which can be manipulated/altered pre inspection.</p>
<p>I am an attorney who is aggressive in medication management and I quickly discovered that nurses resented any inquiry. This has to stop. We are HCS's and we need this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There needs to be strict guidelines as to the use of the ombudsman function, the obligation of the ombudsman to immediately refer elder endangerment or possible financial abuse to the appropriate authorities and to advise HSC, POA and family of their options, including referral to counsel and a NAELA contact number or availability of court mediation services. The ombudsman role should be carefully redefined and restricted in scope to matters not possibly criminal in nature. (Some issues are just not appropriate for the ombudsman.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be an absolute prohibition of facility license downgrading to avoid continuing state scrutiny and oversight when the facility is faced with closure at the higher level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DNR forms and living wills have to be uniform nationally. (Florida requires the forms to be in a particular format on yellow paper?)</p>
</li>
</ol><p><strong>The WHO has declared ADRD as an international health crisis. International cooperation requires a different approach from the NAPA plan with consolidation and dedication of international resources solely to scientific research. </strong></p>
<p>The World Health Organization calls on nations to recognize dementia as a global public health crisis. Nobel Laureate, Dr. Stanley Prusiner, immediate past Director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases at UCSF, and recently appointed Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board at the Cleveland Clinic Lou RuvoCenter for Brain Health, along with The Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation which funds the work of Nobel Laureate Dr. Paul Greengardand every other internationally prominent scientist considers Alzheimer's one of the most devastating and grossly underfunded illnesses affecting society and are staunch advocates of a significant increase in funding to make substantial breakthroughs.</p>
<p>A World Autism Center in Jerusalem is underway through the support of the International Center for Autism Research and Education, which is based in New York City. It plans to include a state of the art research facility, a "global platform" for field researchers, continuing education programs and "university level" courses on the condition. It will also have a residency program and will otherwise include advances in autism research including early detection. In other words, it plans to be the world's "largest multidisciplinary center for autism research, diagnosis, treatment and prevention."</p>
<p>A World Alzheimer's Center under the umbrella of the 78 nation Alzheimer Federation in affiliation with the WHO providing technologically advanced facilities for scientist and independent NGO research, as well as consolidation and development of available international resources and technology addressing cognitive challenges should be created. (See eg. Norway's Snoezalen rooms <a href="http://www.snoezeleninfo.com/main.asp">http://www.snoezeleninfo.com/main.asp</a>, advances made by John Hopkin'sCopper Ridge, Melabev in Israel, the Fisher Institute at NYU, the University of Florida's Smart Room, games and brain training to name a few.)</p>
<p>While seed money could be provided through NAPA, this fund is insufficient to provide national support for ADRD research demands much less international efforts. Similarly, the Alzheimer's organization has its own challenges in infrastructure support particularly given the scope of their service delivery.</p>
<p>In June and July 2013, Tampa Bay Tribune issued an expose' of charitable industry abuse, misuse and outright fraud in solicitation practices. "America's Worst Charities" is the result of collaboration with the California Center for Investigative Reporting, the nation's largest and longest serving nonprofit newsroom dedicated to watchdog journalism. CNN joined the partnership in March. Reports indicate that even the best charities may have a solicitation/public relations cost of up to 40%. After that, take away the balance for infrastructure support which may still not be sufficient if labor intensive services are involved. How much makes its way down the pike to the victims? It is just an overwhelming struggle particularly in today's economy when governments are facing their own crisis. <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page">http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page</a></p>
<p>In the absence of sufficient government appropriation and given the cost of fundraising/air time, a new vehicle to accomplish the $5-10 billion needed for ADRD research must be identified and pursued through the international community. It has been suggested (and inspired in part by Google's Razoo) that the search engines should be engaged as the only viable means of effectively coordinating, in every language, a coordinated time restricted massive campaign on the front page of the engines to elicit international financial support to expeditiously achieve essential support. Properly structured, the engines can slice through the overhead to accomplish direct benefit to scientific research in fulfillment of the intent of the donor and the international public trust through the Alzheimer's Federation of 78 nations in affiliation with the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>The current reaction to NAPA is that, despite the best intentions and through no fault, the current approach is underfinanced, piecemeal at best and holds no ascertainable hope of accomplishing an expeditious cure. You need a great deal of money and resources to save the next generation. If you want to accomplish significant goals, you have to put international firepower behind your efforts.</p>

					Dementia-Friendly Vision</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
<p>As a person living with this disease I find it a challenge these days to be able to communicate with the rest of the team. While I appear to be very normal when we have short talks, there are many issues that I struggle with. I have lost the sharpness and quick response needed to be able to interact with you all at your level. It makes it even harder when many of you have very high IQs. With time you will learn that while I may not respond immediately, answers come to me many hours later. Sometimes they never do. When I hear conversations I do not hear the entire sentence but part of it, and in my mind I fill in the blanks. It's weird to know you have many answers in your head, but cannot find a way to retrieve them.</p>
<p>Because of all this, and because we are breaking up into various teams I want to ensure I will have the opportunity to share my visions of what I would like to see. Some of these ideas come from others who have created them before me, and many are my own ideas or a combination of both ideas.</p>
<p>There is no true order and some things may even be duplicated due to my lack of recall. I did have help from others in the editing of this document. Below is my short list of issues as I see them from my introduction statement on June 7th.</p>
<p><strong>Public Awareness, Education, &amp; Engagement </strong></p>
<p>In my opinion awareness is the biggest problem. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show younger people who don't understand that Alzheimer is a disease that affects all ages; it is not just associated with getting older. I know of a 30-year-old and a 29-year-old who have it.</p>
<p>The stigma must be eradicated.</p>
<p>Companies and communities must treat this like any other disability.</p>
<p>State laws needs to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve immediately.</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is.</p>
<p>People should be fast-tracked for social security instead of being treated like crooks while they are getting deeper into hardship.</p>
<p>First responders need educating, and a system needs to be created that will help identify us without becoming a target for others.</p>
<p>We need a way to deal with our guns.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those who are no longer capable, and not to impact those that are still able to drive.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways if we are looking to make it better for those impacted.</p>
<p>Need to encourage dementia-friendly communities and business.</p>
<p>We must be able to live life to the fullest even though we have the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Create work environments in which we can still feel productive without penalty to the employer or the person living with the disease.</p>
<p>We must encourage the researcher and provide funding.</p>
<p>Trials need to provide more flexibility by using communication technology.</p>
<p>Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia.</p>
<p>Patients should be made aware of the living wills which should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Communities </strong></p>
<p>My vision of a dementia-friendly community is a bit involved, but if it's implemented it will have a huge impact in many ways. When I think of a dementia-friendly community it refers mostly to those who are in the early to mid stages of the disease. This idea was first started in the UK by my friend Norm McNamara who is living with Lewy Body Dementia.</p>
<p>This community should include first responders, health providers, local businesses, public transportation providers, airports, and the public.</p>
<p>I think the best way to achieve this is to create a system that allows individuals to register with the state, or someone of equal standing, this should include care partners as well as it's important to have emergency info on the caregiver. I would like to see something similar to MedicAlert at a state level.</p>
<p>What follows is a brief outline of the MedicAlert system.</p>
<p><strong>MedicAlert® + Alzheimer's Association Safe Return</strong>® is a 24-hour nationwide emergency response service for individuals with Alzheimer's or a related dementia who wander or have a medical emergency. We provide 24-hour assistance, no matter when or where the person is reported missing.</p>
<ul><li>If an individual with Alzheimer's or a related dementia wanders and becomes lost, caregivers can call the 24-hour emergency response line (1.800.625.3780) to report it.</li>
<li>A community support network will be activated, including local Alzheimer Association chapters and law enforcement agencies. With this service, critical medical information will be provided to emergency responders when needed.</li>
<li>If a citizen or emergency personnel finds the person with dementia, they can call the toll-free number listed on person's MedicAlert + Safe Return ID jewelry. MedicAlert + Safe Return will notify the listed contacts, making sure the person is returned home.</li>
</ul><p>Six in 10 people with dementia will wander and/or get lost. A person with Alzheimer's may not remember their name or address, and can become disoriented, even in familiar places. For people with dementia wandering is dangerous, but there are strategies and services to help prevent it.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association has developed training tools and support programs to prepare law enforcement, EMTs, fire fighters and other first responders when they encounter a person who is wandering.</p>
<p>Anyone who has memory problems and is able to walk is at risk for wandering. Even in the early stages of dementia, a person can become disoriented or confused for a period of time. It's important to plan ahead for this type of situation. Wandering and getting lost can happen during any stage of the disease.</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for the following warning signs:</p>
<ul><li>Returns from a regular walk or drive later than usual</li>
<li>Tries to fulfill former obligations, such as going to work</li>
<li>Tries or wants to "go home", even when at home</li>
<li>Is restless, paces or makes repetitive movements</li>
<li>Has difficulty locating familiar places like the bathroom, bedroom or dining room</li>
<li>Asks the whereabouts of current or past friends and family</li>
<li>Acts as if doing a hobby or chore, but nothing gets done (e.g. moves around pots and dirt without actually planting anything)</li>
<li>Appears lost in a new or changed environment</li>
</ul><p>The information on your medical alert bracelet will connect health professionals with your emergency medical information. We provide memberships and services designed to protect you and your loved ones during a medical emergency or time of need.</p>
<p>MedicAlert's medical bracelets, medical IDs, and other medical jewelry have been used to alert responders of the underlying medical conditions a patient may have - such as allergies, anaphylaxes, diabetes, and autism. First responders are trained by MedicAlert staff to recognize all forms of medical IDs, and our services ensure they get your up-to-date medical information, the moment they need it, to make informed decisions about your treatment and care. MedicAlert services and medical IDs are also used to communicate advance directives and can even help those with Alzheimer's or dementia make it home safely during wandering emergencies.</p>
<p>For more information please visit their website: <a href="http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-safety.asp">http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-safety.asp</a></p>
<p>Those who choose to register would wear a bracelet similar to the one above or some type of dog tag on a chain. By registering the people would be able to take advantage of many benefits. Family would need to register and could be set up when in the clinic for diagnosis as well as info bracelet... ordered and resources given out.</p>
<p>All those registered would be given a unique identification number that will have basic information that could be used in case of emergency. To stop the system being abused or compromised, this information should only be accessible by the relevant people, following a secure procedure and calling a special telephone number and providing the person's ID number. (This would only be accessed by calling a provided number)</p>
<p>It may include information like blood type, allergies, drug information, doctors, emergency contacts, and addresses.</p>
<p>This system needs to be linked with the 911 systems, and the yellow dot program. When a person calls the fire department the address should be flagged immediately when it comes up as a person with dementia living in the residence they are being dispatched to. This is important for many reasons.</p>
<p>A person with dementia may panic in this situation and may not know how to respond to the emergency conditions. They may be much worse than a child in some cases, and just curl up in a corner in fear and just stay there. They may not even speak out when people are calling their name. They may have even started the fire and are scared. They could be combative and the firefighters need to know how to deal with that situation. There are many other reasons why the firemen need to be aware before arriving.</p>
<p>If we ever have some kind of a natural disaster or need to evacuate for some emergency this system will be a major asset, especially for those who may be at home on their own. By being registered this will insure a much better outcome for those who may not be able to think for themselves. Many of these people would not leave with just a simple call and they may not even understand what is said in robo-call type alerts.</p>
<p>If the police are called that should also be flagged immediately. It could be the person with dementia calling in, and not able to articulate the problem. It could even be a false alarm because they are scared when there is really no threat. Sometimes people with dementia have been known to make serious accusations of being threatened by their spouse with a gun, which has led to spouses being locked up for days because the system was not aware of the person's dementia. Again, if members of the emergency services are coming to a house where a person with dementia resides, they need to treat threats in a completely different way otherwise it can escalate and even become deadly.</p>
<p><strong>Issues with Police: Weapons &amp; Driving </strong></p>
<p>While I am on the subject of issues with police there is a document which I shared with the chief of police a few years ago. While some changes are being implemented in some parts of the US, I am not sure they are being addressed in PA. I tried to reach out to my local police department and training facilities, but was just blown off. One of the biggest and most serious issues that I feel needs to be addresses is that of weapons. I came very close to taking my life, and even told a police officer on the telephone, but he refused to do anything. I just wonder how many other people pleaded for help and ended up killing themselves because nobody answered their cry for help. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Sometimes people with dementia get confused or feel threatened and may make accusations that could land someone else in jail. Be prepared to deal with cases like this. They need to be handled very differently from someone without dementia. Some would say like a mental illness. They believe what they are saying is fact.</p>
<p>We require a place to store or remove guns from a home when needed - I came up with a simple way that this could be accomplished without too much impact on the police. A gun safety device can be used to secure the guns in the person's home, and the key can be given to someone responsible. There were other suggestions made.</p>
<p>If someone with Alzheimer's is stopped for a sobriety test they may fail because they have trouble following instructions or poor gait. They may also be much slower with their responses, and may even give you a blind stare because they are confused. They may not be able to follow complex directions. Directions need to be broken down into steps.</p>
<p>I know we want to make the roads safe so we need better testing methods for Alzheimer's patients who drive.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's patients can sometimes become very aggressive and defensive during an argument, they can even become threatening. This is the wrong time to try to remove them from their home. They need to be calmed down first; otherwise it can become a disaster for that person, because many will not understand what is going on.</p>
<p>Be prepared to deal with people who may seek help when they are lost. We can get lost while driving; this does not mean we cannot drive. These two issues are often confused by many.</p>
<p>The car should also have some sort of identification mark. It could be tied-in with the yellow dot system; however, I am concerned that we may become a target because of that. We are much more gullible because of this disease and that could be a very serious issue. I was someone who always kept all those scammers at a far distance, and now I am starting to fall prey to some and think it will only get worse as time goes on and I get worse. It could be on a driver's license, like a donor or class B license. It could be a code that is not obvious to all.</p>
<p><strong>Universal Symbol: The Purple Angel </strong></p>
<p>There is a common logo that is slowly becoming the internationally known symbol for those living with dementia and I think we should use it. It is called the Purple Angel.</p>
<p><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-site-pages/163251/PurpleAngel.jpg" style="height:25px; width:27px" />To be used on all websites and dementia patients information and hospitals</p>
<p><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-site-pages/163251/PurpleAngelStamp.jpg" style="height:28px; width:30px" /> For stores and businesses to show they know and have been educated</p>
<p>This was created by Norm McNamara and is starting to get a lot of recognition. In fact it is now going to be used in some US hospitals as an indicator that the person has cognitive issues; they hang it on the door of the hospital room of the patient. I recommend that we adopt this symbol for all programs connected to dementia-friendly communities.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Hospitals </strong></p>
<p>While I am speaking about hospitals, below is a list of issues that I have been working on with a local hospital in hopes of starting the first dementia-friendly hospital in PA. I was trying to build a training program with the Alzheimer's Association along with a question and answer session with people like me who are living with the disease. Below is the list I have shared with them. Some hospitals are actually doing a quick cognitive test by asking 3 words upon registering to see if there may be a concern even if the person does not have a diagnosis. I would expect that all hospitals would educate staff on the issues, for instance we can easily get lost while trying to find a department as an outpatient.</p>
<p>At registration, identify a person that can and will be able to be involved in all decision-making, along with the patient.</p>
<p>At registration, identify a person that will be given full access to all records on behalf of the patient.</p>
<p>Patients bring in a list of current medications. If for some reason you must change the drug or dosage for any reason, the issue should be addressed with the patient and caregiver to ensure there are no issues (even if it's as simple as converting to a generic). Sometimes patients cannot take another form of the same drug-ask them.</p>
<ul><li>Example: My doctor switched me to Galantamine rather than Aricept because of side effects. In the hospital, they substituted Aricept. (My wife had Galantamine with her, but of course it is a big deal that you should not take your own meds.)</li>
</ul><p>A special ID bracelet should be placed on this type of individual so the staff is alerted that this patient has some form of dementia. This will help them if the patient is acting confused or wandering or just needs a little extra help or explanation. It may also mean that the patient isn't great at making good decisions. If you need a color, purple is perfect.</p>
<ul><li>Example: I needed a Fleet's enema pre-op. The nurse asked if she should give it to me or if I wanted to use it myself in the bathroom. Of course, I offered to do it myself. I found I had difficulty once I got in the bathroom by myself; a bad decision on my part. The nurse should have not given me the option. (We do not want to appear stupid or show our flaws so we may do something to show we are still capable when we may not be.)</li>
</ul><p>I know they always ask the patient for their full name and birthdate - that may be hard at times for us. I can become confused on a good day, in the hospital it can be worse because of pain medication or being awakened suddenly or the stress of just being out of our routine. Maybe another way can be figured out. (Before a name tag is placed on a dementia patient it may require 3 or 4 staff individuals to ask the patient for that information and each must identify the same information before the ID is placed. This will insure the wrong tag is not placed on the patient. Use the verbal ask on critical things like surgery and drugs given the first time the nurse may see the patient)</p>
<p>There are special things one needs to know about using Anesthesia. Anesthetic agents are a cause for concern in AD pathogenesis. Luckily, the field of Anesthesiology has addressed these concerns in an excellent and honest manner. I would defer to their consensus statement:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/108/5/1627.full">http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/108/5/1627.full</a><br /><a href="http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/">http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/</a></p>
<p>The bottom line seems to be to avoid isoflorane.</p>
<p>Do not always consider a patient being confused as a part of the dementia, but it could be much worse due to the drugs they are on. When I was on pain killers my wife could not even get a response from me that made much sense, and she knows what's normal for me.</p>
<p>A real concern exists on what type of drugs the patient may receive for Anesthesia. Pain killers will also have a much greater impact on this type of person.</p>
<p>While ordering food from a menu is simple, it is very overwhelming for me to keep track of things and what items may even go together, or are even needed. I will probably need help with this task.</p>
<p>Don't assume we can figure out how to use items in the room like TV, Phone, call button, and anything else. Please point them out and provide a simple explanation on their use.</p>
<p>Aides should not be the first point of contact. I am not always good at explaining what I need and the aide was not always good at interpreting what I was trying to say. Aides are okay for follow-up or to help with food menus. Again this is why training on all levels is so critical.</p>
<p>When asking a question, give them a minute or two to answer without going on to some other question. You could even ask them to think about it and come back in 5-10 minutes, no longer. This is very subjective depending on the person. We often need a few minutes to gather our thoughts. We might even answer a question right away and then realize a few minutes later that that wasn't what you asked.</p>
<p>Somehow you need to insure the patient response is really correctly given - they sometimes give an answer just to not appear stupid or show they did not understand. Maybe some visual aid or clues can be given along with the verbal depending on the stage the patient is in.</p>
<p>Try to keep items and things in the room in the same place once they determine the best location for them.</p>
<p>I personally feel these patients should be kept a bit longer than the average person, for observation. This would just be to make certain there are no issues at time of release.</p>
<p>Offer a pen and paper to keep in the room. Tell them to write down questions they want to remember to ask when the nurse comes in the room.</p>
<p>Keep in mind many patients with dementia can no longer spell correctly and may use the wrong context for words.</p>
<p>This is the wristband that will be implemented to all patients with dementia at Brooksville Regional Hospital, along with this square magnet to be place on the outside of the patient's room on the doorframe. Before any of these wristbands will be used, training seminars from the Alzheimer's Association will held for all of the hospital staff members. Training should start in about a month. This is a major step forward in maintaining the safety of all dementia patients during hospital stays.</p>
<p>The hospital loves the purple angel logo, We went through three different band designs before this. The problem being that purple is also the national color for DNR. What I love about it the most is that it's for "all dementias," which is what we truly need in the hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Businesses </strong></p>
<p>Moving on to dementia-friendly businesses; I envision that businesses take a 7 or 8 hour course provided for free by the Alzheimer's Association and others, to make them aware of the issues that people with dementia deal with, and what they may need help with. On completion of the course they will get a sticker that they can place in their place of business that says Dementia-Aware with a picture of the logo. By doing this we will be creating awareness, and educating many on how to make it easier for us to still function as members of society; something that is not always easy when you are an adult who is slowly becoming a child again.</p>
<p>Some of the issues may be</p>
<ul><li>feeling panic in a large store when becoming separated from the person they came with</li>
<li>being asked a question and not being able to respond, or even giving the wrong information</li>
<li>having trouble locating items in stores</li>
<li>no longer being able to calculate how much they have spent or can spend if they have a budget</li>
<li>getting lost, losing sense of direction, or not being able to locate the car in the parking lot</li>
<li>it would be nice to get assistance when there are similar products to choose from, because I can no longer do comparison shopping based on price, or if an item in the same category is on sale</li>
</ul><p>Not everyone will easily display, or even be willing to wear the bracelet or dog tag because of the stigma surrounding this disease. Only when this changes will people feel more comfortable about sharing their diagnosis with others.</p>
<p>Even though we are living with AD we should be encouraged to live life to the fullest. We need to keep our minds engaged. We should be able to work, and to still do high level functioning jobs, and the company not be penalized, and the person with the disease should not be impacted by SS because they are working. As volunteers I would expect that our transportation expenses be paid for, and maybe even lunch. This will have a positive impact on the people with the disease and be of great benefit to a company that can utilize the person. Some do not want jobs like pushing hospital beds around, or doing simple tasks when we have a high function skill set.</p>
<p>The state can help AD people to live life to the fullest in many ways. For those that are still driving they should be given a disabled sign for their car. It helps me in many ways such as finding my car when I park in a strange place or large lots. For those that are not driving, allow us the same opportunity as seniors. This will help us get around much easier. For suburban areas allow us access to the transportation for the disabled at the discounted rates.</p>
<p>The state can offer free access to national parks, fishing and boating for a small size water craft for the person living with the disease and a caregiver since in many cases they will need someone to take them. All of this can be centered on having the bracelet which will simplify the process and minimize any costs.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you need to make it simple for these people because they will most likely not be able to fill out many of the forms needed to qualify. I am sure there are many other things that can be made available.</p>
<p>Writing skills can be impacted hindering communicating. An idea would be to forward our unedited letters to schools to be used as a part of the English classes; the students would edit the letter and send it back so we can send it. It would also be great if we could take college courses for free with the idea that we are not getting a degree or credits.</p>
<p>When it comes to purchasing tickets for travelling on trains etc. staff need to be aware that we may need help. We may not be able to check in at the airport unaided. We should not be penalized for not being able to take advantage of online offers because we cannot use computers. We may need to be taken to a gate or to a temporary room until our flight or train is ready (this does not mean we need to be ferried about in a wheelchair!)</p>

</ul><p>I would like to see a simple pamphlet be put together for those who are living with the disease covering all the benefits available to us with AD. It must be simple to understand, short and to the point. The procedure should include all of the resources available and where one should turn. Today one has no clue and they do not know what is available. This should be handed out with a diagnosis from your doctor.</p>
<p>Laws need to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve. Let's stop burdening the social security system. Because there is no clear test for the diagnosis of YOAD, many diagnoses are delayed. Many people are terminated from jobs, and are unable to collect their long-term disability insurance, because of the two-year law. Most diagnoses occur much later, as in my case. I paid a lot of money into a long-term health disability plan in my company and I lost it all because of the law. I now get less than a third of what I would have been entitled to, and no medical coverage which I would also have had, all because of a law that does not work for individuals with this disease. Changes must be put in place until we have better tests available. If someone is terminated for non-performance and they have been diagnosed with dementia at a later time, they should have the right to go back at least six years to prove their case. Companies should not get a free pass because we all pay for this injustice. The two year law is a failure for people like me with dementia.</p>
<p>I was terminated from my job before I got a diagnosis which took another 6 years. Now I am forced to rely on government disability. Alzheimer's is a sickness. This is a disease, and the people who have it should be treated that way.</p>
<p>Companies need to treat AD like any other disability. The following comments were put together from a person who works in HR.</p>
<p>Tell your story to HR Management. What kind of company do they want to be? How will they protect their human resource that has dementia - and be good risk managers by taking appropriate action to minimize the risk of litigation for wrongful termination under ADA? What are the costs of unrecognized dementia in employees i.e., lost productivity, errors, quality, odd/unexplained behavior, a decline in management skills leading to more of the above? What are the State percentages? Give examples - If they are a company of 1,000 employees that equates to xx employees who will have early onset dementia - can they afford to be blind to the problems these individuals will cost the organization? Alzheimer's is not all about the needs of the caregiver. Little to no attention is given to the INDIVIDUAL WITH DEMENTIA. If the company has a PEP program (Personal Employee Program that typically provides 8 to 12 sessions of counseling when an employee suffers from personal problems (divorce, runaway kids, elderly care, etc.) why not have a Dementia Hotline/Exploration. Why not help people self-diagnose early and assist them to seek a medical diagnosis, so TOGETHER the employee and company can make a plan for them to ultimately exit from the company with dignity - example: an employee is still skilled, but may need to move from having the responsibility of being a manager to becoming an individual contributor. Why wait to FIRE someone for non-performance, when you could continue to employ the person until the day comes where there is no job which matches the employee's skills. A diagnosis of dementia IS protected under ADA. Why wait to be sued by an employee who was unfairly terminated because of his disability. Why not be proactive and humane, keep the person off unemployment; mitigate your exposure to litigation. Such a small cost to set up a program to assist and empower employees to work TOGETHER with them, give them dignity and determine together when it is time to go. Help them transition to retirement with disability; unemployment; assistance from the Alz Association.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Issues &amp; Necessary System Change </strong></p>
<p>Younger-onset Alzheimer's, also known as early-onset Alzheimer's, generally refers to those who are affected by the disease before the age of 65, usually in their 40s or 50s. Because of their younger age and healthy appearance, doctors often attribute symptoms of Alzheimer's to depression or stress, resulting in delayed diagnosis. These symptoms, such as challenges with short-term memory, impaired judgment and difficulty making decisions, eventually progress to a point where they affect workplace performance, and ultimately, jeopardize employment. Many individuals living with younger-onset Alzheimer's are in their prime earning years and supporting loved ones at home. The loss of income and access to employer-sponsored health benefits can be devastating.</p>
<p>This document reflects State and Federal issues that may not be working. My goal is that if the existing jurisdiction responsible is not able to enhance the process, the other will step in and fill in the gaps so people are not impacted. It is my hope that they can work together to fix the weaknesses in the system that may have been overlooked.</p>
<p>To help address their financial need, many individuals with younger-onset Alzheimer's rely on Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). In March 2010, the Social Security Administration (SSA) added early-onset Alzheimer's to its Compassionate Allowance Initiative, which expedites the disability determination process and serves as a trigger to begin the two-year wait for Medicare benefits for those under the age of 65. Family members (e.g. spouses and minor children) may also be eligible for benefits based on the applicant's work record. This addition by SSA has been a huge relief for individuals and families dealing with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Many are treated like they are crooks when they apply for Social Security Disability. It creates an added burden on the family and the patient. People say that the Compassionate Allowance act will help people, but it did not help me, and many keep saying that it works. The following story is from an ongoing case. This program may be better but the people who run the programs are clueless in many ways on what a person with AD can or cannot do. This person is not only struggling financially, but has no one to look out for them. I cannot even imagine the hell they must be going through because it would take me forever to complete the same forms.</p>
<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>It's so nice of you to think of me. I wanted to add that the reason I was turned down on the first application and reconsideration was because I filled out the RFC form myself (I lived alone at the time and it was a necessity) and not for lack of medical evidence. My son now lives with me but only minimally supervises me and does the driving. An examiner at Social Security took it upon himself to send out an investigative unit because he felt I must be faking Alz even though in the course of the application and reconsideration, I saw 5 doctors, 4 of whom thought I had Alz disease and 1 CE examiner who thought it was possible but hesitated because I still have average intelligence (my IQ was in the 140s when I was in graduate school and now around 100, which I think this is an alarming decline). This SAA evaluator then proceeded to imply that all the doctors I saw were fooled. He even sent out an investigative unit to actually <strong>videotape me without my knowledge</strong> (following me to one my CE appointment one day and sending undercover police officers to my home the following day). I don't remember the investigators coming to my home and didn't see them at the hospital (obviously quite good at the stealth part). At the hospital, the doctor walked me out to the lobby because he was afraid I would get lost said a few minutes later I "disappeared (I got my ride, of course)." They went back to the doctor looking for me, and he apparently was very concerned I had actually gotten lost in the hospital. At my house, they said I walked slow to answer the door but I didn't limp (???) and was polite and had my hair combed (implying I was not disabled based on my outward appearance and probably less than 30 seconds of conversation). The evaluator felt that anyone who could describe their symptoms on an application, write mostly coherently, (though always needing multiple edits, spell check, and entailing a lot of repetitiveness) answer the door, use a phone, live alone, or drive in the early stages had to be faking it regardless of MRI, neurological tests, etc., that clearly gave me a diagnosis of EOAD. Long-winded, I'm sorry. I'm still feeling kind of abused and outraged. As for now, my lawyer thinks he can get me a hearing OTR and I'm hoping for that and a favorable decision If not, it will be another 12-15 months before I have a hearing date, this because the SSA evaluator apparently does not understand that early-stage Alzheimer's is not immediately visible on the surface. In the meantime, I am now in the process of selling my home to live with my adult son as we can no longer afford the upkeep (this is a modest home - but now far above my means).</p>
<p>I'm very lucky that my son is living with me to help, but it means I do not qualify for Medicaid because his income is now considered my income and puts us just above the income limit. He can't put me on his insurance as I don't qualify as a dependent because of my small LTD policy, which in turn needs to be repaid to the insurance company if I do get SSDI. I've gone from a single, self-supporting middle class woman, to lower middle class, now to poverty level in the course of about 4 years. Without my son's help, I'm probably within 3 months of living on the street. At the same time, I'm suddenly placing a tremendous burden on him and fouling up his goals in life.</p>
<p>Another note: I find it ironic that my neurologist tells me to exercise vigorously, take care of my health, and socialize as much as possible in order to function longer whereas I sense the government is telling me that I'm not eligible for disability insurance (despite working since age 13 and paying into the system for years) unless I give up, lie in bed, and wait to die.</p>
<p>It would be great if the Alz Assoc could find a way to educate the SSA evaluators on what Alzheimer's disease looks like in younger people in the early stages so that other people don't go through what I'm going through now. It would also be great if they could lobby for earlier Medicare benefits (rather than the 2 year wait after SSDI) for all disabilities that are only going to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Awareness is the biggest problem.</p>
<p>Awareness of YOAD will change the public perception of who gets Alzheimer's - young people. People who are under 30 get it. Use commercials, billboards or posters in key places to get the word out. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show younger people because most don't understand that Alzheimer is a disease not just a result of aging.</p>
<p>Awareness of outcomes for AD -- Currently people who have Alzheimer's cannot be cured. There is no way to slow the progression of the disease, and most die within 4 to 8 years of diagnosis. While these two statements are strong I feel this is what it's going to take to reach younger generations and others to jump in and help. We cannot beat around the bush; the public needs to know that this is a horrific way to die. Death by Alzheimer's is slow and painful not to mention the impact it has on the family. Places like the Alzheimer's Association and others need to open with all the facts about the disease so people are prepared.</p>
<p>Remove the negative stigma associated with the disease. Too many people are ashamed to let others know that they have this disease. They act like they did something wrong to get it. Now is the time to join me, come out of the closet, hold your head up and be proud in making a difference in how we are looked upon by ourselves, and others. WE need to show that we are still capable of doing some things at our own pace.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those that are no longer capable, while not impacting those that are still able to drive. It should be based on the person's true driving experience and ability, and not on perceptions or fears. It should have nothing to do with getting lost; GPS tracking devices can help us if that is a concern. Many people have the misconception that if a person with AD is in an accident the insurance company will not pay for the claim, or may even sue them. While there are many tests available to test one's driving, many are not fair to a person living with AD. In fact if the average person was given the same test they may even fail. Better tests that deal the individual living with the disease are needed and all must be able to test this test. Some of the cognitive tests do not correlate to driving ability, but to failing and singling out people with AD. That is completely unfair. For example I fail the Trail-Making Test, Part B and I still drive very good. The testing should be free or paid by insurance. These tests can cost around $300 -$350, and provide annually. Every 2-3 months we should drive with a spouse or other person who understands us to see how well we drive. That should be a regular part of our future lives, and they should be the ones to tell us when they feel it is time to give up driving. I am not saying that people with AD should not eventually stop driving, but it should be done for the right reasons -- that they will become a danger to them or someone else. What we need to focus on are the real problems of driving, and not the side issues related to them. We must embrace new ways to deal with people with AD and find new opportunities and technologies to use to our advantage so we can enhance the lives of those suffering with this disease, and so they can continue to lead a normal life for as long as possible. Do not fall into the one-size-fits-all trap because all those living with AD are different from each other and we must figure out a way to make everyone feel safe including those living with the disease. We are still human beings.</p>
<p>My biggest fear is that one day I will have an accident and my license will be taken away. It may not have anything to do with my Alzheimer's, but it will be perceived that way. I have had 3 to 4 car accidents in my lifetime, some being my fault while most were others. We all have them. As a person living with AD I seem to notice much more. I see many people run through lights, not use turn signals or come to a complete stop at the stop sign. I see people cut others off or shift in to other's lanes without paying attention. All I can think is that if people saw me do any of these things they would want to take my driver's license away, yet all of these folks are normal and they just get a free pass. Why?</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is. One should not be impacted by other laws that were not designed or intended for those living with this type of disease. There are many state and federal programs that limit us from being able to contribute to or benefits we are not entitled to because of our age. Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia. A family should have a cap on what they must payout. Why should the surviving spouse be left penniless because their partner was sick? Is it enough that most of us have already had to deal with financial hardship we were not accustom to?</p>
<p>Pa. Caregiver Support Program (care recipient/household income must be @ 200% of poverty or below for max. reimbursement.</p>
<p>Below are just of a few of the ways this disease is costing me more money than ever. I once did most things around the house and now I have to rely on others and the cost is adding up very quickly. Many things are becoming neglected which will have a greater cost in the long run. I used to be good at comparison shopping and now I no longer do it because I cannot recall the price so I can compare. This has such a huge impact from food, gas, utilities and everyday items.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), individuals with a pre-existing condition receiving SSDI can join high-risk insurance pools3 and receive immediate health insurance coverage while they wait for Medicare benefits to become available. This has been particularly helpful for those who are unable to find affordable health insurance because of their Alzheimer's diagnosis. The program will end in 2014, at which time individuals can purchase health insurance through their state-based insurance exchange or qualify for Medicaid under its expanded criteria. Pennsylvania has yet to decide whether or not it wants to participate in the Medicaid expansion, which according to one estimate, will cost the state 1.4 percent more than current spend to reduce the number of uninsured adults by over 40%.</p>
<p>In addition to the cost of care, Alzheimer's imposes an immense burden on families. Last year, there were an estimated 664,384 unpaid caregivers in Pennsylvania, providing 756,600,213 hours of unpaid care valued at over $9 billion. Unfortunately, the physical toll of caring for Alzheimer's also resulted in over $427 million in additional healthcare costs to unpaid caregivers in your state. To assist those who care for people with Alzheimer's in Pennsylvania, the state offers the Pennsylvania Caregiver Support Program. Preference is given to caregivers of care recipients who are 60 years or older, but eligibility was recently expanded to include care recipients who are 18 years or older. All care recipients must demonstrate functional limitation and financial need.</p>
<p>Regrettably, age is still a barrier to other support programs for individuals with younger-onset Alzheimer's and their caregivers. All caregiver support programs that receive funding under Title III of the Older Americans Act require care recipients to be at least 60 years or older. Likewise, Pennsylvania's Medicaid 60+ waiver and aging block grants are only available to those who are at least 60 years old. Restricting eligibility by age, rather than diagnosis, forces many families affected by younger-onset Alzheimer's to exhaust their own resources and put their own health and financial security at risk.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways to make it better for those impacted. Physician education -- Doctors need to be better educated, and need to commit to a more timely diagnosis so that patients can collect the benefits they deserve and are entitled. Doctors should not act like our lives are over. Once a diagnosis is made it should automatically trigger a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist so the person can learn to deal with the devastating news. Many people are in denial and waste that last few years not knowing what to do. Instead they should be living life to the fullest. Make the memories. We must be encouraged to make living wills and put our financials in order quickly since our minds are going. We have no time to delay. Encourage participation in medical trails and offer frequent checkups.</p>
<p>Living wills should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p>We must encourage research and provide funding. In order to eradicate this disease we need to find more sources of funding and redistribute current government funding to bring Alzheimer's to a level comparable to other disease research. Trials need to provide more flexibility by using technology. Many are unable to participate due to lack of flexibility. Some people do not participate in clinical trials because they feel it will not help them. They need to know that it's not about them but what they do can help someone in their family should they get the disease. Since a cure may be long in coming, it would also be nice to see more funding provided to investigate treatment methods to maintain independent function longer. The drug companies have taken the stage and it's all about what increases their profit and not necessarily about what will help the patients.</p>
<p>Make government grant programs free, fair and balanced - Some researchers using government research grants are discriminating by age and minorities because of rules being set forth by both the provider and the receiving researcher. This will prevent the formation of an accurate picture of this disease. For example, black people are twice as likely to get Alzheimer's. Why?</p>
<p>Eliminate the term Caregiver - Come up with a new term for the word caregiver when used for people in the following stages Very mild decline (2), Mild decline (3) and Moderate decline(4). We find it very demeaning and do not like being treated like a child. Help us where we are weak, but don't give up on us just because we have now been labeled with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>We need away a way to break down many of the silos and built a coalition of companies and sites to work as one. Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) is a diverse and growing national coalition of 58 member organizations including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The only sad part is the Alzheimer's National has not joined due to not being able to set politics aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/">http://www.leadcoalition.org/</a></p>
<p>This is all part of the problem - a lack of willingness to work together. I am not sure what the state can do here but we need to find a way to encourage others to work in harmony for the greater good of what we all seem to claim. We are doing this for dementia. Sometimes I really wonder and I think it just a business for these folks.</p>
<p>I know I have made many recommendations around the use of the Alzheimer Association as part of this document. Because of that I want to give full disclosure. I was a past ESAG member and I am currently still an ambassador for them. For those who know me they would tell you I am not influenced by others and my dedication is to those impacted by the disease. With that being said I do feel they deserve a lot of credit for what they have accomplished in the last 30 or more years. They take a lot of heat for some issue that are out of their control due to some high level expectation of the public.</p>
<p>On the other hand I do not want you to think that they have all the answers because I and many others realize that they do not do justice for many like me who are dealing with the disease. They focus on the caregiver and not us. Part of the problem in my eyes is the lack of a business mind across the board, and lack of a CEO approach to business. Because of that scenario there is much inconsistency in the organization and much time is lost in understanding our needs and minds. That all leads to very slow response or lack of response to the very services they think are great. They have this internal mindset that everything has to be done a specific way and that is always the right way, yet the people are not given the tools. The sad truth- it is not and I have worked on changing some of that and I can assure you it's not an easy task. I encourage that we continue to work with them but at the same time we need to demand change and at a much faster pace.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I am sharing this with you in hope that, as you do your planning, you take my findings in to account when making recommendations to others. We must treat all people who are suffering from dementia, regardless of stage, with the highest level of respect all the way through to the end. While this may not apply to all, it would appear that many who are even in stage seven are still able to communicate in some way.</p>
<p><strong>Living Life with Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>Below are some articles I have written in the past, you may learn how someone with AD is dealing with this disease. These are my favorite that I feel people have been able to learn and see another side that they did not know before.</p>
<p>I have worked on this for about five months, and recently I shared the email below with many sites related to AD for feedback. Most of those who had reached out to me were able to support my findings. The bottom line is that while most of us have limited thinking capacity many are able to communicate; we just have to find a way that suits the individual. I received a lot of feedback. My biggest concern is that most people are clueless, and assume that we cannot understand what they are saying about us; many say cruel things. Just try to imagine for a minute what it would be like to hear what others may say or do to you, and you are never given an opportunity to defend or express yourself. That is what is happening to most of these folks.</p>
<p>We must find a better way to educate caregivers, health professionals, and all those working with people living with this disease. The biggest problem I see is that everything is time-based because of the costs. This view will not work for people. It will also take special training, and the need to break with our normal habits of communicating. If we are going to be able to reach out to them, we need to change. We are still human beings and we deserve to be treated in a respectful and dignified manner.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen and I have been living with AD much longer than most people who have had this devastating disease. I am in need of your help to prove a point. Let me explain.</p>
<p>I have learned that as we progress with Alzheimer's/dementia, we lose our brain functioning and can no longer think. I am starting to believe that this is not true.</p>
<p>It has now happened to me on multiple occasions where I was asked a question, and I am able to formulate the answer in my mind, yet I found myself unable to verbalize it. Sometimes my mouth may move but nothing comes out. It was the weirdest thing, and I could not understand why it was happening to me. I was aware of what was going on, but could do nothing.</p>
<p>Since that time I have asked 18 other people with some type of dementia, and of them 16 had similar experiences. Two of them said they had not. This makes me think that as this disease progresses our brain may still be functioning, yet it is unable to communicate with the rest of the body, allowing it to have less control than it would normally have. I truly believe I am on to something, and was curious as to how I can try to prove this theory.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example. About three years ago I met the daughter of a man with AD. He was no longer communicating with her because, she was sure, he could no longer commutate at all. Someone suggested she ask a question, and keep totally silent for at least two minutes after. About a minute and a half later he finally responded to her question. From that time on she realized what she had to do and was thankful for that advice.</p>
<p>I don't want you to think it's going to be that easy; it will take a lot of work, patience and persistence on your part. Here is what I would like others to try for someone who is in the late stages of Alzheimer's. First of all take the person to a very quiet room; it should not have any kind of background noise even from things like an air-conditioner blowing. Those noises are real problems for me, and would assume it will be a bigger issue for them. Such noises really have an impact on my ability to process and focus. You should also do this at a time of day that they are not tired. It becomes very challenging for us to try to focus and listen to what others say. It really becomes tiring, and we get burned out quickly.</p>
<p>When you start to speak to the person use short sentences, and pause in between them so they have time to process what you are saying. That is very important. Tell them that you think you have found a way to communicate with them. Tell them you are going to look at them closely for some sort of sign. It could be an eye movement, maybe looking to the right or left or down or up. It could be a smile. It could be a finger moving or a fist being made. It may even be them sticking their tongue out. I would start by focusing on parts of the body that may still show signs of control. You must become a detective and keep looking at various body parts for some sign. It may not happen the first time or even a second time. It may never happen and I could be wrong. But if I am right just think of the benefits that will come out of this for you and your love one.</p>
<p>Reassure them that you will continue to look for a signal and they should keep trying the best they can at their speed. Ask them a simple question like "do you love me? If yes lift your finger or lower your finger". Again you will need to keep quiet, and observe for at least two minutes. Keep doing this and try this with different parts of the body. They may not have control over certain parts, and that may be an issue. If you do see something make sure you point that out to them and ask them to do it again to insure they really are responding. If this turns out to work find a way to use that same body part to get yes or no responses from the person. Keep in mind that this may not always work and you may need to be creative. Maybe just keep the finger raised longer if they mean no, or tap it twice etc., but that may be too much to ask.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind if the person has not had any real dialog with someone for a long time this would also take more time. No matter what do not become discouraged, try this at least three different times on different days. Like I said this may never work and I have it wrong.</p>
<p>If this does work please reply to this site with your contact information so I can speak to you. If this works for a few it makes me believe that we need to treat these folks completely different to the way society treats them today. This will change so much about what people really believe is happening to our minds.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>"The Realities of Alzheimer's and Overcoming Stigma"</strong></p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect more than 35 million people worldwide today. An astonishing fact that today someone in the world develops dementia every 4 seconds. By the middle of the century more than 115 million people will be affected by the disease if we do nothing.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen, and I am living with Alzheimer's and trying to make a difference. I was previously a high-level manager in the telecommunication industry. In 2008, I was diagnosed with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD) after struggling to get a diagnosis since my first symptoms at age 39. Losing my job and not being able to work had a huge impact on my life as I was a workaholic. I am now an Alzheimer's advocate and a spokesperson for the Alzheimer's Association (U.S.) as a member of its national 2012 Early-Stage Advisory Group.</p>
<p>I am so frustrated, because no one realizes how seriously disabled I am. If I had a loss of limb or some other visual ailment, it would make people realize. I don't want them to feel sorry for me or pity me, just want to be understood. So many people say you do not seem to have Alzheimer's, and that frustrates me. Let me tell you what it's like to live with this debilitating and progressive disease.</p>
<p>Imagine for one minute that your friend, relative or family member has Alzheimer's and has to deal with the following issues. When I go shopping and look at items, most of them never really register in my mind, even though I see it clearly. I have trouble making decisions, because I question whether I am making the right one. I can no longer enjoy my favorite hobbies, because it requires processing skills that I no longer have. I went from being a gadget person, to now being threatened by technology that I no longer can use. This is what I deal with and so much more.</p>
<p>I go to a happy affair only to be tortured by the noise and surrounding conversations, because of the loudness that cannot be filtered out. If people try to speak with me in a public setting where there are many other conversations, I just don't understand what they are saying. This is because all of the people speaking come in at the same volume level. All the words run together, and it sounds like a foreign language.</p>
<p>I went from being extremely proactive to becoming much less active and motivated. I leave things around the house and don't put them away, because I don't know where they go or feel I may not know where to retrieve them again. One moment I am nice and another I may fly off the handle. I can no longer write or speak like I used to. My friends slowly become distant and usually speak to my wife. I do realize this.</p>
<p>I worry every day about the challenges ahead. Or even worse, I am losing my mind and see it happening, but I cannot do anything to change the course. People always say 'if I can do anything just let me know." If I take them up on that offer, they back out of their commitments. I have become extremely surprised by the lack of public commitment to my pleas for support of Alzheimer's disease. While some may be sympathetic in the moment, there appears to be little follow-through. This is very upsetting, because I feel as though it affects me personally as well as the millions of others living with the disease. I was always there for others when they needed it and now I feel alone.</p>
<p>While many people just coast through the day, I have to use 110% of my processing skills to do most things, which increases the stress and frustration. The worst part about this disease is knowing that I am doing all these things wrong and have no way to control or stop it, and it's only getting worse as the days go by. I used to save lots of money by doing so many things around the house. Now I lost the drive, determination and skills needed to do those things. Many times I hurt myself trying or make it worse.</p>
<p>I cannot begin to explain how it tears me up inside to see my spouse struggling to do the things that I once was capable of doing and know I cannot do a thing to help. I realize that one day I may no longer be able to drive and this devastates me. I see my wife becoming stressed, depressed and overwhelmed, but caregivers know it will only continue to get worse. Sadly, they keep telling themselves that they can do it all even when we know they will need help.</p>
<p>I, the patient, see it definitely. My wife is on the road to hell, and she does not even realize it yet, because she is so busy trying to block it all out. The worst part about all this is, I have not even reached the worst stage. That scares the hell out of me.</p>
<p>I have been so surprised by the stigma associated with this disease. It comes at you from all angles. People think they knew what Alzheimer's is, but they don't. I see this not only from people living with dementia but many media health correspondents, physicians and organizations that are geared to helping those deal with the disease. I have learned that I do not want to share my diagnosis with people I meet until they get to know me. If I was to tell them upfront, I would be treated so differently, which I have learned. I kind of see this disease like HIV use to be. The people who have it are so afraid to let others know, including family. I do not get it. We did nothing wrong to get this disease, and we need to speak up to let our voice be heard. We did nothing and no one should be ashamed of having it. I feel so much better when I share it with others than when I try to hide it.</p>
<p>Because of my frustration with existing environment for people with dementia, I realized change was need. I decided to use my few skills left to advocate. I have spent some of my last few years being on television, radio, newspapers, many blogs and working with many politicians. I also had an opportunity to speak at all of the public sessions to develop the first U.S. National Alzheimer's Plan, all this on my own. But that was not enough, because I ran into so many people who just did not want to get involved. I am now a volunteer for the national Alzheimer's Association Early-Stage Advisory Group. If there is something I want you to walk away with it's that you can make a difference, but it will take persistence. Write a letter to your public official or reach out to local support organizations to create needed programs and services. Your voice and your story are powerful tools. Please get involved.</p>
<p>The simple truth is, if you have not been touched by this devastating and debilitating disease yet, consider yourself extremely lucky. Sadly, it's just a matter of time before it touches you. It is my hope that my actions today may prevent future generations from suffering with this disease. So give yourself piece of mind and do something today. I hope that what I am doing will allow me to leave this world knowing that I did everything possible to make that next generation have a fighting chance. There are no excuses for not wanting to help. The human cost factor is too high, and we are all accountable to do something.</p>
<p>There are many organizations out there like ADI and the Alzheimer's Association that can help you. The Alzheimer's Association got me started in many ways with my new journey. It not only helped me, but it also had helped my wife as my caregiver. They have a website with many resources at www.alz.org. I encourage you to reach out today if you have not already. I would also encourage you to educate yourself.</p>
<p>Please join me and Go Purple on Friday, Sept. 21 for World Alzheimer's Month. I wear a purple Alzheimer's bracelet every day. And for those living with Alzheimer's, stop focusing on what you cannot do and join me in the battle to advocate. We still have so much to give, and we need to use our skills at our own speed. There is nothing to be ashamed of. We are counting on all of you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Over the past few years I have visited many websites that talk about Alzheimer's/dementia. The one thing that they all have in common is that not one of them encourages those of us who have the disease to continue to live and enjoy our lives. While I realize AD is a progressive and devastating disease we are still here, we are still alive, so treat us that way. Do not write us off.</p>
<p>I have always been savvy when it comes to finances and have always been a saver. One day I was speaking to a friend of mine who has AD, and I was telling her how I did not want to spend a lot of the money I had saved, because I wanted to leave it for my wife for that rainy day. My friend told me: "This is the rainy day. What are you waiting for?" She was right, and that's exactly how I started to think.</p>
<p>Just because we are living with AD, does not mean we should curl up and think our life is over before it actually is. There is so much more we can still do to enjoy life. Make wonderful memories with your loved ones before the days turn ugly.</p>
<p>One thing I had always wanted was to own a convertible, so we purchased one. I wanted to drive it down to the Keys in Florida. I have a friend out in California who also has AD. She has an RV and had planned to travel around the country before she declined and was incapable of driving anymore. One day she mentioned that she was going to the Keys and I decided to meet up with her. I also wanted to go deep-sea fishing to catch a big game fish. Don't get me wrong I am not person who goes fishing, but it was something I have always wanted to do. I had looked into it and it was very pricy, but it has always been on my bucket list. I think we all have a list if we stop and think about it.</p>
<p>I had no real plans; I just wanted to go out and drive my convertible, to feel the fresh air and admire the beautiful scenery and enjoy nice weather. I had a great time. I had a permanent smile on my face. I decided to stay with my friend in the RV for a week and visit various campgrounds along the way. That was a whole new experience, and some of the places we stayed at had fabulous views.</p>
<p>It was great to be out on our own, not having to rely on caregivers all the time. We had some difficulties, but we were able to mange on our own. It cost me a few extra dollars along the way because when I purchased something I could not remember the price in order to be able to compare, and sometimes I took the wrong road and had to take the turnpike, but these were minor issues. This road trip made me feel so much better about me. It was good for my mind; I came back stronger because of what I had achieved.</p>
<p>This disease has a way of making you feel like you are no longer cable of doing things on your own. You lose your self-esteem and your self-confidence. After this trip I felt great.</p>
<p>I did have to opportunity to go fishing. It was such a beautiful day with perfect conditions. The fish were not really biting to begin with but it didn't matter I was just happy to be on a boat again. Then I caught a fish that was about 10-12 inches long. Then I caught a barracuda that was at least 18 inches long, and then one over two feet long. Not to long after that I got the big one, a king macro that was 42 inches long! You should have seen the smile on my face. It is memories like this that we need to be making.</p>
<p>My friend in the RV has decided that she will not just use her mother's china and silverware on special occasions. Instead she took them with her in the RV. It gives her pleasure to use them every day. How many of you have a wonderful expensive hand bag or nice watch, which you only use on a special occasion?</p>
<p>Life is short; take pleasure in using those treasured items now. Start to create your own bucket list, don't just write it, DO IT! There are many wonderful memories that you can still make. Make them now before it's too late. Stop focusing on the negative. Make these last few years be the best of your life. You must do this now, before your mind no longer works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Since being diagnosed with Young Onset Alzheimer's Disease I have dedicated much of my time to its advocacy. Over the years I have worked with many people in different parts of the world, and through my experience I have come to realize that a major problem in reaching a cure is our actions. The way we treat not only those who suffer from this disease but those who care for the afflicted, the focus on funding and research and the lack of communication and collective action. Although there are many brilliant people who are involved in Alzheimer's and Dementia action and research I feel that following some simple principals and plans we could bring about real change in the world of these diseases.</p>
<p>PARTICIPATION -- Patients, caregivers, family and friends must become advocates</p>
<p>FUNDING -- Unprecedented action from government and public sector is vital</p>
<p>TEAM WORK -- Organizations dedicated to fighting the cause must work together to reach a shared goal</p>
<p>RESEARCH -- It is imperative that professional medical research personnel work hand-in-hand with patients</p>
<p>LIVE -- Those suffering from the disease must learn to live happy and fulfilling lives</p>
<p><strong>PARTICIPATION</strong> -- The government wants to hear from us! I have been doing this a long time and I am told over and over again by government officials that they need to have a clear idea of the numbers of people with Alzheimer's so they can make the appropriate changes to policy etc. In order for the government to do something they need to see people with the disease. I know people have busy lives but if we want things to change, patients, caregivers and friends need to start taking action.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? By getting involved! Write to the people who can help - government, health officials, and the press. But be mindful that you have to be persistent with these people, you have to fight. Can you imagine the impact if even a small percentage of the millions of sufferers took a little time to have their say?</p>
<p><strong>FUNDING</strong> -- We must look at other funding models for this disease. Unlike HIV and cancer, there are no survivors. Patients will continue to place a massive financial burden on the national economy; we need to be more proactive in how we fund research, care, medication and support for loved ones and caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? By writing to Congress, and the National Institute of Health. These people are responsible for prioritizing the distribution of funds to critical diseases - Alzheimer's disease is not on the list; we need it on the list.</p>
<p><strong>TEAM WORK</strong> -- There are many organizations out there hosting their individual fund raising programs, which is to be commended but the downside to this is that they still insist on operating independently on one another. These people need to see the bigger picture, they need to set aside their politics and differences, and come together as one and work together -- after all, they share the same goal don't they?</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? Well we can stop complaining about these organizations and give them solutions and guidance. Together we have the power to bring about change. Keep informed of all the latest news and action, don't listen to gossip or rumor -- check the facts; do your homework.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen. I am living with Alzheimer's disease. I spend almost every waking hour advocating for increased funding for research that will improve the treatment of this dreadful disease. In 2008, at the age of 49, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after struggling to get a diagnosis since my first symptoms began at age 39. There are more than five million Americans now suffering from this devastating disease.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds research into critical and devastating diseases such as cancer and HIV/Aids. Yet there is much neglect and discrimination regarding the allocation of funds for research into Alzheimer's and related dementias. As a person who experiences the devastating impact of Alzheimer's disease every day I hope that research will lead eventually to postponing the onset or slow the progression of this disease, if not prevention and cure.</p>
<p>Currently, Alzheimer's disease only receives about $450 million for research from NIH, compared to more than $5 billion for cancer and more than $3 billion for HIV/AIDS. I am astonished at the lack of funding dedicated to addressing the number one health epidemic. Historically, leadership from the federal government has helped lower the number of deaths from major diseases such as HIV/AIDS, heart disease, stroke and many types of cancers. This past experience provides hope that increased efforts directed at Alzheimer's disease will be met with similar success.</p>
<p>There are many more Americans living with Alzheimer's than HIV; more funding is desperately needed. If we do not act now this disease has the potential to bankrupt this country. Money allocated today will have an enormous return on investment if it leads to the kind of successes obtained for other diseases.</p>
<p>If you have not yet been touched by this devastating and debilitating disease it's just a matter of time. I hope that my advocacy will help prevent future generations having to suffer my fate and that of many others. You can help by increasing NIH funding for research on Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</p>
<p>I appeal to members of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the respective appropriations committees: Make the hard choices; increase funding for Alzheimer's disease. Do everything necessary to ensure that Alzheimer's disease gets the exposure, commitment and funding necessary to change the course of the disease before millions more Americans are affected.</p>
<p>My work as an advocate has provided opportunities to share my story on a national platform. I have provided public comment during meetings of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services in addition to having my personal essay about overcoming the stigma of the disease featured in the Alzheimer's disease World Report 2012. I have also become a member of the Alzheimer's Association National Early-Stage Advisory Group, helping to raise awareness of the disease and provide insights on the most appropriate programs and services for individuals in the early stage of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p>I hope that what I am doing now will allow me to leave this world knowing that I have done everything possible to make generations to come have a fighting chance. Do not forget these people or the future generations who will develop this disease. We face dying in the worst possible way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>As an Alzheimer's patient, I find it very difficult to perform tasks that I was once very capable of performing. Sometimes I am better than other times at doing the same task. People around me have accepted this fact and have tried to be very forgiving when I run into issues doing a task or when just trying to remember something. I really think that people around me should challenge me more at times.</p>
<p>For example, many of my doctors kept questioning me about whether or not I should still be driving. This of course was mentioned to my wife who also started wondering. I finally had a driving test a few years later. It was recommended that I no longer drive, even though I passed the test. I was almost borderline, but there was concern that I may not recognize when I become worse and could then become a danger. First of all, I have to tell you that the test they performed was not fair. I wonder how many regular people would be able to pass this test. The test also relied on me to learn new things in order to take the test. That is not fair since I have been driving the same vehicle all this time and nothing has changed. This constant talk about my driving has totally killed all of my self-esteem about driving. Every time I was in the car on the road with my wife, she constantly pointed out any mistakes I made, and her reaction time was much quicker than mine. I do realize I am a bit slower in my response time, but that is why I give myself more space between the other cars. Sometimes I am very far back or I just don't want to go around that slow car. There is nothing wrong with not feeling comfortable to go around that person. Let me do it at my speed.</p>
<p>I see many people on the road that I feel are so much worse than me and I wonder why they are still on the road, if I am supposedly so bad. I decided that I was going to drive to visit my daughter in South Carolina. I live in Jamison, PA in Bucks County. I was very scared to take this trip but I was trying to prove something to myself. It could have meant the end of my driving if I made a serious mistake along the way. I drove in one day, about 700 miles, with the help of a GPS in my car. The more I drove, the more I was starting to feel comfortable behind the wheel. A few other people on the road made serious mistakes along the way and I easily avoided a possible accident. This trip was the best thing I could have done for myself. I now have almost all of my self-confidence back and my wife no longer makes constant comments about my driving, unless I have a real issue. I have now had two close calls that required quick thinking and maneuvering to avoid an accident. In both cases, I was able to avoid the issues without my wife's comments. Again it may have taken me an extra second or two to react, but I was fine.</p>
<p><strong>Coping Strategies for Daily Challenges </strong></p>
<p>Because of this situation, I feel even stronger than ever that it is important to be challenged. I know it may be easier for you to do something for an Alzheimer's patient because it's much quicker for you to accomplish the task. But I really believe that if you take the time to coach us along the way, we may do better in the long run. Believe me, I know it's got to be very aggravating at times, but I really appreciate it. It takes a lot of patience on the part of the helper. Everyone is different and you need to know at what point in time you should not push. It's also hard to be patient and not raise your voice at the person you are trying to help, because it will only make it worse.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble remembering dates or things I need to do.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I use my computer and Microsoft Outlook to keep me straight by sending me reminders.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Getting email using regular places like Google or Yahoo is a challenge for me.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: My daughter had set up my Outlook to retrieve emails from all my accounts, and they arrive in the same format which makes it so much easier to read, and it allows me to use common folders.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I forget to reply back to people's emails.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I flag them with a reminder date so it will automatically send me a reminder.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Remembering passwords is a real challenge for me.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have created a personal system that works great, I also rely on the computer to store many of them; however, it is a real challenge when the system does not work. I also keep files with the password information.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble remembering the day, the month and the year.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have watch that displays all the information.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have an extremely complex TV, stereo and entertainment system, which requires many remotes and settings to be used.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I purchased a smart remote that allows me to put in all the steps at once, and press one button which takes care of sending all the commands to all the devices at once. It works great until it fails. Not sure how much longer I can maintain it. It's a bit involved</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Most of my lawn power tools are a struggle to use.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I do not think I have any coping method other then I keep trying different things until I get them to work. The problem is most are new, I find it easier to work with tools I am familiar with.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I drive I don't always feel as comfortable behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I sometimes need to take more precautions, and allow more distance between the car in front of me, and I may drive a little slower. I am also much more alert and focused during these times. It makes it hard because when I travel with my wife she wonders why all of sudden I drive slower, when normally I am flying. There is nothing wrong with going slower and being cautious.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I don't do much of anything anymore.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: The other day I was speaking with my neighbor who was waxing his car. This gave me some inspiration to want to do it. When people mention things to me it sometimes gives me what I need to take it to the next level.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I purchased a camera; however, no matter how many times I read the manual I still don't seem to be able to understand how to use it.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: Make sure you buy one that works completely automatic without needing to do anything. It is frustrating at times when you would like to do something on your own but just can't remember on how to do it. I have learned to accept it but I still try and fail.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Spelling and forming sentences has become a real challenge.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take advantage of using the computer to guide me in the correct spelling of a word. That is becoming harder because often it cannot figure out what I am trying to say. I also ask others to look things over for me, and to correct them for me. It's kind of frustrating for me because I am really concerned that I may not be able to do this much longer. I have seen a big decline in this over the years. I seem to notice this more than my other skills because I do it so often. While I am sometimes ashamed of sharing it with others, I still need to communicate so I try to not think about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Sometimes when I want to do certain things I need to stop and think.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: If I want to work on a project I will spend a lot of extra time trying to think of the best approach, this doesn't always help, but I tend to work at a slightly slower pace and am aware that things will go wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Finding past emails or letters</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: The computer is such a wonderful tool in so many ways. It allows me to search the entire computer as long as I can remember a word or two in the document I am looking for. While it may take a while I would not be able to survive without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I can no longer do many things</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I rely on my wife for many things nowadays. I am not sure if that is a coping strategy. When anything important needs to be considered, I ask her for her help. She does all the financials, and planning of most things. It is frustrating but I realize I cannot do it on my own.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I get lost or cannot figure out how to get from one place to another. Maps are not easy to follow anymore even the ones that you print out from Google.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: GPS! I cannot imagine what it was like for people like me before GPS and the computer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I fear that one day I will be lost or not be able to communicate with others due to a temporary stress or decline in my mental capacity.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have chosen to not be concerned about that. I have a medical tag on me all the time that has my medical condition along with important contact information. I will continue to go wherever I want to go. I realize I will need to rely on others to get there. I will need to ask others for help frequently, and to ask multiple times so others don't send me down the wrong path. It will take me longer to get there, but I cannot let that stop me. Living in fear is also no way to live. I know there are good people that will help me when the time comes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Some things I do get me very frustrated</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I no longer try to do those things so I do not get frustrated</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I write notes as reminders</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I only write a few notes as if I have too many they just become overwhelming, and I would lose track of them because there are too many.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I need more time to do things</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I leave much earlier for meetings and places so I can allow for issues along the way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: If I start to get frustrated doing something.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I move on to something else and then I try to come back and do it later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I fear I may get lost when I go to new and far places.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take a cell phone with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I go shopping and lose track of the person I am with I sometimes start to worry a little bit.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to calm myself down and look for them. If I cannot find them I will try to stay by the door we came in so I can see them at that register</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I had trouble remembering which way to turn off the water in the garage for the hose.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: My wife added masking tape with a marking pointing to off. No more issues. I have the feeling that over time I will need many reminders like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble hearing people speak in loud places.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to not go to restaurants or other places where I will be put in that situation if I can help it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I can no longer use my video recorder.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I now have TiVo which makes it so much easier to do things. I still need some help, and my wife can help when I need it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I try to communicate with much smarter people.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I believe that my reaching out to and working with people who are very smart will delay the deterioration process.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I cut the grass, or do something that requires me to be a bit more stable on my feet.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I use a good pair of shoes, or even a low cut boot. It really helps me become more stable on my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I could get hurt while doing yard work.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I do not wear lose clothes or short sleeved clothes when doing yard work so I do not get hurt. Wearing shorts has already led to a broken foot because the pants leg got caught on the shifter. I also wear safety glasses. The problem I have is I don't always remember to take these precautions, or sometimes I think it's not necessary because I feel I will be careful if I am doing something that will just take a few minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Just the other day I was thinking in my head that I had to turn a grate on my fireplace, and I was thinking it may be hot.</p>
<p><strong>No Coping Strategy</strong>: Instead of being careful and just putting one finger closely to feel for heat, I just tried to touch it with three fingers to lift -- I got burned. How do you get a copping strategy for becoming stupid? It seems that my mind is not communicating with the rest of my body.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ???</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: All the people around me know I have AD, so most of them are keeping an extra eye out on me which is nice to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to keep some type of a schedule. I get up every day at the same time and try to eat at the same time. This kind of helps to do things like taking my drugs or other things. The second I change my routine you can be sure I will forget to take my drugs or do something else.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I double and triple check myself on many things I do. Daily Challenge: ???? Coping Strategy: I try to find some humor in my issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ?????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I ask people for help and ask a lot more questions of others</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take lots of breaks</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ???</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to know my limits and will not start a task if I feel I cannot do it. Or I will have someone work with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>A few months ago one of my friends mentioned that I am always talking about things related to Alzheimer's. While I know I spend my days advocating for this disease I did not realize I was that bad. Especially with those I am not trying to convince or influence. Although I appreciate the person telling me, it has really bothered me.</p>
<p>I started to give it some thought and tried to understand why and what I could do to change that. Not too long after that my wife made a similar comment, and that really hit home because their comments to me were so close together.</p>
<p>I realized many things have contributed to this. The most important is I no longer work and I feel like I am locked in this house; I really have nothing else to do. I wish I could still be working and doing something meaningful, but unfortunately my skills required to perform those jobs are no longer there because of my Alzheimer's. I use to go to work, I used to talk with others about many different topics, not just work but everyday world issues.</p>
<p>I have tried to have similar conversations with people about issues in the news, and I don't always have the right information since I don't always understand it all, and only retain bits and pieces. While there was a time I was a news junkie, now I can rarely recall many of the topics or even can tie other stories together in my mind so I can speak intelligently. I have recently found myself starting discussions that go south because I start out with part of a subject, and when we delved into it deeper I was at loss for information. I felt stupid because I could no longer speak about something I once found very easy. I used to be great about talking about political issues which really requires you to know what you are talking about, but now I can barely defend my position, and I do worse for even bringing the subject up, and then I feel bad because I was not able to point out the real issues so the person could really make a true assessment.</p>
<p>Since I have no real job I have made it my mission to advocate for Alzheimer/dementia. I try to keep my mind as engaged as possible. I also try to focus on things that most don't, like the high hanging fruit which is probably not the best for some on like me. That involves dealing with many high-level people. While I do good at first I don't always have the answers they require, and sometimes may come across as not knowing what I am doing. It is very frustrating knowing that in my brain I have the answers, but I just do not know how to retrieve the information needed to help me do what I need to do. Especially when I need it the most, I may remember later on sometimes, but it's too late. There was a time that I could retrieve everything to my favor and keep track of everything one person would say to me.</p>
<p>Then I finally realized I listen to the weather report multiple times a day and I never seem to know what the weather is supposed to be like, which I always use to know. I just do not seem to retain it.</p>
<p>I use to like reading the paper and I no longer do that because I have trouble retaining what I read or I don't remember how the story relates to something I read a few paragraphs back in the same article.</p>
<p>I used to have hobbies that I can no longer do because of the disease. I use to love boating and tinkering with electronics. I can no longer do any of these things. I rarely do anything around the house because I am afraid I will make it worse.</p>
<p>When I have conversations with others I do not always remember what we have spoken about in the past. I always hated it when you spoke to certain people and they keep repeating the same information you had spoken about in the past. I do not want to become one of them. There are so many discussions I want to have but I just can't because the lack of my ability and more. I miss that so much. To have an intelligent conversation with someone that can reply with meaningful information, where we both walked away with some new and interesting facts would be wonderful.</p>
<p>I was never one to blow my own horn, but I do that today so others can see some of the steps I have made in hopes that they feel they are willing to take risks and help me expand my mission.</p>
<p>I have accomplished some great things and I think that is what I may share with my friends. Maybe I am repeating myself and I don't know it. I keep trying to figure out how I can change, but I struggle because I do not know what to do. It seems that Alzheimer's has taken over my life and not sure what or how to change.</p>

<p>NCCDP recommends that the health care professional, front line staff and organization have the ability to select which company, college, trade school or private trainer to provide the Alzheimer's disease and dementia education and no one should be forced to select from a pared down list of a few institutions regardless of the organization private or nonprofit status. The public should make a choice based on the reputation, experience and knowledge of the organization presenting the dementia education.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that HHS put together a comprehensive list of institutions, technical colleges, organizations, consulting companies, private trainers and companies who provide Alzheimer's disease and dementia education and companies should be allowed to add their name to the list of providers with no endorsement from HHS. HHS should not recommend nor endorse one organization, trade school, university, private trainer, etc over another.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that HHS not put any kind of stipulation on a training program nor require that a training program be evidenced based. HHS should recommend what topics a comprehensive curriculum includes.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that ADEAR be expanded to include more information and resources for health care professionals to utilize rather than develop another national repository.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that ADEAR provide a list of USA and international organizations of what they provide and products, resources, learning materials, assessments currently available and includes but not limited to state organizations, institutions, organizations, companies, etc.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that no money be put aside for HHS to develop a national Alzheimer's disease and dementia repository when ADEAR already exists.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that more organizations that are providing Alzheimer's disease and dementia training are added to the NAPA sub committees.</p>

<p>Thanks for the recent NAPA update... when reading over the minutes I came across a research milestone of research that may be of interest to our small business. Can you tell me who is in charge of the "neuropsychological assessment measure research" initiative? (see below)</p>
<p>The 2012 research summit resulted in six categories of research recommendations:</p>
<ol><li>Interdisciplinary approach to discovering and validating the next generation of therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Challenges in preclinical therapy development.</li>
<li>Whom to treat, when to treat, and what outcomes to measure.</li>
<li>Drug repurposing and combination therapy.</li>
<li>Nonpharmacologicalinterventions.</li>
<li>New models of public-private partnerships.</li>
</ol><p>Specific milestones were developed for each of these six recommendations. A chart (<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/042913/Mtg8-Handout1.shtml#milestone1">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/042913/Mtg8-Handout1.shtml#milestone1</a>) lists specific milestones and an expected time to complete them.</p>
<p>One of the milestones is to: "Launch research programs to develop and validate sensitive neuropsychological assessment measures to detect and track the earliest clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease. [Summit 3.D] Development of at least one sensitive neuropsychological assessment measure that has been validated for the detection or tracking of the earliest clinical manifestations of AD. 5 years 2014-2018"</p>
<p>Can you tell me who is in charge of the "neuropsychological assessment measure research" initiative?</p>

<p>I would like to comment on the efforts of the NAPA Advisory Council moving towards the release of the second version of the National Plan. My name is Bruce Lamb and I am a Staff Scientist at the Lerner Research Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, where my laboratory works to understand basic disease mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>I would first like to congratulate the Advisory Council and HHS for developing an ambitious initial plan with admirable overall goals. However, in order to achieve these goals, the plan must be supported by equally ambitious and transformative changes in the funding, organization and monitoring of progress in the fight against Alzheimer's disease as outlined below.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>Continued Research Investments</strong></p>
<p>The additional $50 million invested in Alzheimer's last year was certainly a great start in adding resources in an attempt to meet the goal to "Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025." Furthermore, the President has included an additional $100 million for Alzheimer's research in the coming year's budget. However, at present, due to extremely tight funding paylines (~7-11% for agencies that support Alzheimer's research) and the impact of the sequester (most agencies are imposing an across the board cut in the funding of existing grants), Alzheimer's researchers are finding funding more difficult to obtain and maintain than at any time in the past two to three decades. There are significant concerns that should this continue, we could lose some of the best researchers in the field. Furthermore, in coming years, it will be absolutely critical to add to these current investments, with the ultimate goal of supporting $2 billion of Alzheimer's research per year. If we are truly serious about the ambitious goal of having a prevention/treatment by 2025, this level of investment is required to get us there. Therefore, the recent investments in Alzheimer's research must represent only the initial investment in a series of increased investments over the next several years. Finally, while most neuroscience researchers are supportive of the President's Brain Mapping Initiative, this cannot come at the expense of or in the place of ongoing funding for Alzheimer's research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Research Infrastructure/Organization</strong></p>
<p>To achieve goal 1 of the National Plan, it will be absolutely critical to have an infrastructure and organization that can coordinate federal research efforts across all funding agencies, interact with non-profits and industry, promote awareness of the disease and the role that research will play in combating the disease as well as reporting to the Advisory Council directly as outlined in the plan. In order for this organization/infrastructure to be truly successful and transformative, it will be essential that its efforts are entirely focused on combating Alzheimer's disease. This will provide a uniquely focused organization that will have the most chance of success. A similar "disease-focused" agency was created in 1988 for HIV/AIDS entitled the "Office of AIDS Research" (OAR) within the Office of the NIH Director, that played a key role in successfully coordinating the federal response to AIDS. If we are truly serious about transforming Alzheimer's research and achieving the goals laid out in the plan, a similar type of organizational structure (perhaps an Office of Alzheimer's Research?) is required either within HHS, NIH or the White House.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring Progress</strong></p>
<p>There has been increased discussion both within NIH and on the Advisory Council about creating interim milestones for the National Plan in order to assess whether the plan is moving towards its goals in a timely manner. I highly applaud these efforts. However, most of the interim milestones for goal 1 focus on a variety of translational and clinical research milestones (i.e., accelerating drug development, performing clinical trials). While these are clearly important milestones and should definitely be included as the plan moves forward, at present, it remains completely unclear whether the current compounds in the drug pipeline will be successful in the treatment/prevention of Alzheimer's disease. Given this, it is essential that additional concrete milestones should be included to identify novel targets (thus far, pretty much only one target has been focused on), screen for compounds that will engage these targets, perform preclinical testing to examine the effectiveness of these compounds and finally moving these compounds into clinical trials in humans. It is critical to identify these additional milestones and also support the increased research funding required to meet these milestones and ultimately achieve the goals of the National Plan.</p>

<p>Although the official comment period has closed for the NAPA draft plan, I'm writing today to urge you to go bolder with the final plan to be released by HHS later this month.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is a cruel disease. It slowly steals one's intellect, ability to communicate, independence, and dignity, even control over basic bodily functions like eating and caring for personal hygiene. It also places an overwhelming burden on caregivers -- emotionally, physically, and financially.</p>
<p>The commitment to a 2025 deadline in the draft NAPA plan represents a major step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's. I am pleased that the plan recognizes the need for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, compressing the drug development process, accelerating targeted research, and better coordinating activities with other countries.</p>
<p>However, I am one of many concerned Alzheimer's advocates who believe that this first draft fails to present a strategy aggressive enough to achieve the goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's within 13 years. It lacks specificity in terms of timelines and deadlines, provides no path to providing significantly greater resources, and does not hold a single high-level office or individual accountable for the overall plan.</p>
<p>I hope that HHS will address these issues so that the next version of the plan will be bolder.</p>
<p>With the number of Alzheimer's patients expected to triple in the coming decades, we must embrace a plan that eschews a "business-as-usual" approach and tackles Alzheimer's with the urgency and aggressiveness it requires. If not, we stand to lose millions more lives -- and trillions of dollars -- to this disease.</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends you and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services for the first National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease ("the Plan") and all the public and private sector stakeholders collaborating effectively to implement strategies crucial to transformative change for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. LEAD is pleased that a number of priority recommendations previously submitted by the coalition are included in the first Plan and is optimistic that the revised Plan will be even stronger.</p>
<p>LEAD is a diverse and growing coalition of 56 member organizations including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Working collaboratively with LEAD member organizations and other stakeholders across the Alzheimer's-serving continuum, we offer the recommendations below for the revised National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Equally important, we are prepared to work with the Administration, Congress, and all other interested parties to achieve the shared goals articulated in the Plan.</p>
<p>LEAD's recommendations seek to strengthen the goals, strategies, and actions within the Plan. As noted in earlier comments, LEAD believes that some actions can be pursued at no or only low cost but that the topline goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. It is imperative that both Plan work and outcomes are LEAD Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease accomplished with the utmost public transparency and that there is an effective methodology for assessing the impact that strategies within the Plan have on progress toward the timely achievement of stated goals. To that end, LEAD recommends that immediate action be taken to develop a model in 2013 that will allow HHS to assess the impact of the action steps in the Plan and identify areas for course adjustments. We, as a nation, should pursue only implementation steps that clearly are moving toward our goals. In that regard we recommend that each goal and strategy set forth in the final Plan include a budget, clear milestones and quantifiable metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Ian Kremer, LEAD's executive director. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD relied upon three workgroups -- one each in the areas of research and drug development, clinical care, and long-term care support and services -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the entire Alzheimer's-serving community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>

</ul><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Over-arching Plan Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Adopt all 2013 recommendations from the Advisory Council </em></strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan incorporate all the recommendations adopted by the Advisory Council at its January 2013 meeting.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Until such time as the statute may expand the number of seats on the Advisory Council, invite a person with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder to participate on each Advisory Council subcommittee as on outside expert</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that a mechanism be developed to have at least one person diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and one person diagnosed with a non- Alzheimer's dementing disorder begin actively participating in Advisory Council work no later than the summer of 2013. The public comment process is not an adequate substitute for comprehensive participation. The Advisory Council members and all federal officials involved in developing and implementing the Plan have stated unambiguously and with great integrity that the Plan addresses not only Alzheimer's disease but all dementing disorders; among the most important ways to give life to that commitment is to invite voices from a diverse range of dementing disorders.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 3: <em>Create a formal mechanism for additional federal government agencies to participate in the Advisory Council process</em> </strong></p>
<p>Rightly, HHS is leading the federal effort to develop and implement the Plan; HHS has encouraged and welcomed participation by other federal agencies. LEAD recommends that such participation be more formal, consistent, and robust. While expansion of statutory membership on the Advisory Council is one option worth consideration, LEAD believes that amending the statute is not a necessary prerequisite to convincing other federal agencies to participate voluntarily. At a minimum, the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education, along with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should participate in developing and implementing the Plan alongside colleagues from HHS and the Department of Veterans Affairs who already are engaged. Consider some representative examples: Labor and Education are critical to addressing health care workforce challenges; Hurricane Katrina and super storm Sandy painfully demonstrated the need for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop preparedness strategies for when natural disasters separate people with dementia from their care providers and settings; Alzheimer's disease science rapidly has become a critical issue in global economic competitiveness requiring attention by Commerce; both the Commerce Department and the State Department likely could contribute to HHS efforts to expand collaboration with foreign governments in coordinating existing national plans and potentially developing a global Plan; OPM and OMB need to be at the table to assess the impact on both the federal workforce and the federal budget.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 4: <em>Encourage participation in the Plan process by experts on non-dementing disorders that have a high rate of co-morbidity with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder</em> </strong></p>
<p>The Plan already encourages public-private partnerships (PPPs) and breaking down any tendencies to work in silos. LEAD recommends that the Advisory Council and HHS strongly encourage both formal and informal participation in the process of developing and implementing the Plan by public and private sector stakeholders with expertise in other disorders which have a high rate of comorbidity with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. For example, many people have both Alzheimer's disease and diabetes; while it is not yet clear with there is only a high correlation or a causal relationship, it is clear that it is much more financially costly and physically injurious to have both conditions together than either condition alone. The National Institute on Aging certainly could establish dialogue with other relevant NIH institutes focused on co-morbid conditions while Alzheimer's disease patient advocacy organizations on the Advisory Council could establish similar dialogue with patient advocacy organizations focused on co-morbid conditions to advance implementation of the Plan and develop recommendations for future revisions. Working collaboratively in the public and private sectors should make more effective efforts to reduce or better manage co-morbid conditions and, potentially, accelerate pursuit of scientific interventions to reduce the incidence of such conditions.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 5: <em>Identify and define a role for individuals and family members/family caregivers in each major section of the Plan</em> </strong></p>
<p>Individuals and family members/family caregivers are capable of contributing to memory loss detection, increasing participation in clinical trials, improving clinical care, reducing stigma, and raising public awareness. LEAD recommends that the Plan clearly identify and define ways in which individuals and family members (or their identified family caregivers) can support effective implementation of each major action or strategy within the Plan.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 6: <em>Incorporate throughout the Plan clear and transformative time-based metrics with projected necessary funding levels</em> </strong></p>
<p>It is abundantly clear to LEAD and others across the Alzheimer's-serving community how remarkable the work is that the Advisory Council and federal officials have done in a very compressed time frame. The depth and variety of recommendations and actions developed thus far have been impressive. Policy experts likely are able to unpack how these elements translate to changing real people's real problems. The Plan as a whole needs language that can be much more readily identified by the general public, language that will make clear how the Plan will change their lives. This is particularly needed in the Plan's clinical care and long terms supports goals. In the research goal, the Plan has that language in the form of the 2025 goal. But the complexity of the language and the sort of inside Washington nature of what is proposed in the Advisory Council recommendations and what is already embedded in the Plan's clinical care and long term supports sections, is impenetrable for average citizens who need the Plan to work but who also need to be inspired by the Plan and have their hope sustained or restored by the Plan. There should be aspirational goals across the Plan that are tangible, transformative, and clear. Take the model of the 2025 goal and frame parallel goals in the clinical care and long term supports portions of the Plan. Much of what already exists in those sections of the Plan already point in the direction of what would be aspirational goals but those aspirational goals have not been articulated. The Plan proposes to fix the systems but does not articulate why the systems need to be fixed or what would be achieved as a result of fixing the systems.</p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan adopt time-based goals -- that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other public and private sector agencies could collaborate to implement -- for:</p>
<ul><li>increasing the percentage of people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder who are diagnosed and the diagnosis properly charted in the medical record, informed of the diagnosis, and referred by the diagnosing medical practice to community resources;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of wandering and the rate of injury or death;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of family caregiver depression;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of falls by people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder in home and community based settings as well as in residential care facilities; and</li>
<li>increasing the utilization of hospice and other palliative care services.</li>
</ul><p>LEAD recognizes that most or all of the goals, strategies and action items within the Plan entail significant federal investments designed to reduce over time costs to the public and private health care systems, the economy, and the toll of human suffering. LEAD recommends that the Plan articulate the federal investments needed to achieve the established goals and value of the budgetary, economic and social benefits that are to be accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 7: <em>Commission an independent analysis of the investment value of Alzheimer's disease spending by the federal government</em> </strong></p>
<p>Members of Congress, the Administration and tens of millions of Americans recognize the strategic irrationality and inhumanity of the enormous federal expenditures on care for people with Alzheimer's compared to the relatively miniscule federal investment on research to prevent, treat or cure this devastating disease. But that imbalance persists and worsens year after year in part because the federal government scores federal research spending as a cost rather than an investment. The scoring system therefore ignores not only the future cost-savings to social safety net programs but also the future revenue gains that would accrue from development of new products with a vast global market, increases in workplace productivity, and an expanded workforce. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for an independent body to assess the investment value of the federal government's Alzheimer's disease research funding and provide policy options to correct the current imbalance between federal funding for research and care.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD supports this bold goal, with the hope that it will be achieved more rapidly with the right plan and resource commitment. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has included a number of recommendations submitted by the coalition under Goal 1, including the recommendation for a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on "the most promising pharmacological interventions" as well as accelerating efforts to "identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease." LEAD applauds the increasing emphasis on international coordination and collaboration with commercial and nonprofit partners. However, it is imperative that any goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease must include research investments in non-pharmacological treatments. Nonpharmacological approaches can improve relevant outcomes including improved behavior and delay of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds NIH/NIA for convening the first Research Summit in May of 2012 and for its plans to reconvene every other year around specific research topics of high priority to the field. LEAD recommends that each summit provide explicit strategies and milestones to be met within defined timeframes. Furthermore, LEAD recommends that each summit have a specific session to report milestones and the progress of strategies set at previous summits.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that HHS carryout and begin implementing by the end of 2013 the action plan produced by its intended convening of representatives from across the federal government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to create an action plan for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the building of registries.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions </strong></p>
<p>Strategies to expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease should reference industry's contribution in conducting clinical trials. Strategies should build on the infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new therapeutic targets and therapies--including combination therapies--for trials and their existing working relationships with regulators to ensure that safe and effective treatments get approved. The NIH/NIA 2012 Alzheimer's disease Summit included debate on examining the current conceptual models in studying the disease as well as providing a portion of federal funding for cutting-edge proposals. Non-pharmacologic interventions should also be explored, including community-based interventions and technologies that allow people with dementia to function independently for as long as possible. Strategies should include a statement of what each federal and industry partner can contribute and where the cost and time of the clinical trial process can be reduced consistent with standards of safety and efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression </strong></p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry, and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a large-scale, open-source patient registry of subjects that can be approached for recruitment in prevention trials, including specifically under-represented ethnic and other sub-populations. Consider a broader healthy aging registry, similar to the Framingham study for cardiovascular disease, to follow asymptomatic individuals and those with correlated diseases such as diabetes (the new European Medical Information Framework -- Innovative Medicines Initiative consortium has a similar aim). Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on development of quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector </strong></p>
<p>With the levels of funding now dedicated by government, academia, and industry to Alzheimer's disease research, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of all partners and resources -- and make the best use of the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. There is a need to align government, industry and academic sponsored studies to achieve consensus on defined recommendations for advancing new drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. A precedent exists in other disease areas (e.g. STAIR recommendations for stroke). Current public-private partnerships in the Alzheimer's disease arena have not yet owned this opportunity to date. Funding would catalyze such progress. Research should be a community-wide effort for public private collaboration and HHS should consider asking the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to help coordinate this effort with them.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.1: Pursue ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments </strong></p>
<p>There are many important -- albeit underfunded -- strategies being pursued to speed treatments to patients such as disease modeling, drug repurposing, better target identification, and strategies for combination therapy. However, a major issues remains with respect to the lack of a centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB). LEAD recommends that this Action include expanded public and private support for a uniform patient consent and centralized IRB to review all multi-center Alzheimer's disease trials to decrease the time for trial start-up and protocol amendments.</p>
<p>The National Biomedical Research Ethics Council (NBREC) has been incorporated as a "neutral" home to develop a National IRB for Neurodegenerative Diseases (NIRB-ND). The NIRB-ND will closely follow the Central IRB model pioneered successfully by the National Cancer Institute, and it will be managed by a Steering Committee composed of representatives from the sponsoring organizations/foundations.</p>
<p>Given the proposed changes to the "Common Rule" on the topic of centralized IRBs (cIRBs) and the National Institutes of Health's growing interest in cIRBs, this effort will provide an innovative solution to a problem shared by many constituencies interested in therapy development. The NBREC approach features the establishment of a successful public-private partnership business model. The NIRB-ND will guarantee the protection of study volunteers, reduce needless delays in large clinical trials, decrease costs and reduce risks associated with studies. The project is exploring options for expanding reviews to include Canada and eventually countries within the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings </strong></p>
<p>There is an exponential growth in the number of public and private partnerships (PPPs) in the Alzheimer's disease arena, which is simultaneous with a concern of consortia fatigue. The sense of urgency exists to address improved understanding of the scope of activities (in scope and out of scope) for the numerous PPPs, and specifically how alignment is taking place to avoid duplication of effort. Positive examples exist of synergistic alliances between ACT-AD, C-Path and CAMD, ADNIPPSB/Alzheimer's Association, and the Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease. Defining specified resources aimed at facilitating coordinating PPPs is an unmet and urgent need. Leadership from ASPE is crucial and should be made a priority.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan include a process for developing standardized informed consent to allow participants in clinical trials to authorize their deidentified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study in order to advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. LEAD recommends pooling of individual de-identified data into larger Alzheimer's disease databases -- globally available to qualified researchers -- to allow data mining and to increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, HIPPA, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Implement Alzheimer's disease specific data standards to ensure a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data</em> </strong></p>
<p>The Plan should encourage all new and ongoing federally funded and industrysponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease specific data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Using these standards will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA and EMA. Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data, including data in failed trials, data with respect to dormant drugs, and data rich in biomarker information, should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's disease CDISC data standards and any federally funded and industry sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use. Given the FDA's preference and future requirement for submission of clinical data in CDISC unified clinical data standards, it is recommended that data be collected for current and future clinical trials in CDISC format using the AD CDISC therapeutic area specific standards. Lack of action on this recommendation will slow the time for regulatory drug review of any new therapeutic candidate.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Plan includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. The Plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis, and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans requiring care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings.</p>
<p>As the Plan has evolved from the Alzheimer's Disease Study Group (ASG), to the Advisory Council and the first Plan, we have not adequately motivated the Plan with a clear vision of what clinical care should look like in the United States. The comprehensive effort to date has been laudable and has advanced the country's goals with respect to research. But research advances will not have the impact that they should unless we begin with an equally broad and forwardlooking conceptualization of clinical care.</p>
<p>ASG recommendations related to clinical care in 2009 were limited to a focus on measurements of quality, making paid caregiving available, and educating the public about the disease. There was an implicit assumption that medical care is already uniform, executed consistently and well in diverse settings, and that it encompasses the public need. In 2011, LEAD recommended that the Plan include development of a workforce to diagnose and care for people with memory disorders; improve models for reimbursement that incentivize practitioners to diagnose early and treat persistently; support pilot and demonstration projects to improve the care that is available; develop innovative new models for care; improvement of emergency care for people with dementia; and establishment of a network of geographically accessible memory disorders centers to serve as translational sites to advance the medicine around prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of AD and related conditions. The first Plan was very strong on collaborations among agencies, advancement of neuroimaging and biological markers to aid in early diagnosis and drug development, educating the workforce and disseminating existing guidelines (albeit limited and out of date), as well as educating the public. It also mentioned the need to strengthen direct care, without describing the deficiencies; the need to survey unmet needs; to develop cost-effective models of care; to improve minority care; to protect the vulnerable; and to assess the housing needs of people with dementia. These listings may be perceived as somewhat piecemeal and secondary by people at risk for and living with memory disorders, their families, and healthcare workers.</p>
<p>Clinical care should encompass detection of risk factors, management of risk factors, early diagnosis and lifelong management, regardless of social differences, medical co-morbidities, and physical location. Citizens should be able to count on comparable approaches regardless of where they live or how they fund their healthcare. New advances in research related to risk, diagnosis, and treatment should translate easily into clinical settings, so that willing patients can help to prove or disprove their utility. And clinicians who choose to promote brain health and provide care to people with memory disorders across the stages of their lives should be able to do so without bankrupting their practices. Without some effort to develop a national, clinical focus on specialized prevention and care approaches, there will be no true expertise--and the greatest advances to date are at risk of being irrelevant because there is no coherent approach to ensuring that they shape practices in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 2 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties </strong></p>
<p>The Plan recognizes both the worsening shortage in the geriatric specialty workforce and the dire consequences that the shortage causes for the growing population of people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. LEAD recommends that the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) support training projects that provide fellowships for individuals studying to be geriatric social workers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.6: Support state and local Alzheimer's strategies </strong></p>
<p>The Plan recognizes that many states and local communities have developed dementia strategies and action plans. The Advisory Council repeatedly has discussed opportunities for the national Plan and these state or local plans to share and reinforce best practices. LEAD recommends that HHS and the Department of Labor collaboratively develop best practices for direct-care workforce development, recruitment, and retention tailored to each provider setting in the Alzheimer's disease care continuum including: home health, adult day, assisted living, skilled nursing, and hospice.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Address inconsistencies across geographic areas and subspecialties, and from provider to provider</em> </strong></p>
<p>Clinical approaches to risk management, diagnosis, and treatment are inconsistent across geographical areas and subspecialties, and also vary from care provider to care provider. Existing education of physicians regarding dementia and related disorders is also quite limited, despite the fact that the Medicare Trust Fund spends over $9 billion annually to subsidize Graduate Medical Education. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for conducting a nationwide assessment of available expertise by region of the country including expert clinicians in all relevant specialties (family practice, general internal medicine, geriatrics, neurology, psychology, psychiatry, and social work), paid caregivers, day centers, overnight respite care, and long term care options. This should include examination of current practices for risk factor management, diagnosis, longitudinal outpatient management, emergency management, and long term residential care in each area. Additionally, all residency programs should be assessed for the amount of education and training focused on dementia and related disorders.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Update reimbursement formulas to encourage brain health risk management, early diagnosis of memory disorders, persistent and multi-disciplinary treatment, and uniform levels of treatment across care settings</em> </strong></p>
<p>The current reimbursement system discourages brain health related risk management, early diagnosis of memory disorders, persistent treatment, multidisciplinary treatment, and uniform levels of treatment regardless of care setting. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for an analysis (to be completed by the end of 2013) of the actual costs and reimbursements for laboratory services and patient visits for risk factor management, diagnosis, and longitudinal outpatient management, and for diagnosis and management within long term care settings. The analysis should benchmark successful programs and practices. LEAD also recommends that the Plan call for HHS to propose (by the summer of 2014) options to correct the reimbursement formulas as needed to optimize these efforts; funding for demonstration projects for models of care across the spectrum of disease; and funding for demonstration projects to assess the impact of dementia specific medical homes. For example, reimbursement levels might be tied to whether nationally certified dementia specific services were provided.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 3: <em>Address inadequate emergency and acute hospital care for people with memory disorders, especially those with dementia</em> </strong></p>
<p>Inadequate emergency and acute hospital care imposes staggering costs on the physical and emotional well being of patients, families, and medical personnel. The economic costs to patients, providers, public and private insurers are unsustainable. The horror stories are well known, more typical than anecdotal, and all too true. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for HHS to complete (by the end of 2013) a nationwide assessment of the available inpatient and outpatient emergency care for dementia patients with acute agitation or psychosis and the quality of inpatient care for people with memory disorders hospitalized for non-dementia related conditions. LEAD further recommends that the Plan call for HHS to propose (by the summer of 2014) methods to incentivize hospitals and psychiatrists to handle dementia related emergencies and standards for emergency care for people with dementia. For example, HHS could consider proposing standards for geriatric psychiatry units, which currently are not required to have a psychiatrist or even a geriatrician.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 4: <em>Establish a network of geographically dispersed and accessible memory disorders centers, linked to sites providing integrated research and patient care, to facilitate translational medicine, and to continuously develop and improve the standard of care</em> </strong></p>
<p>Access to quality care -- and the application of medical practice to transformative research -- all too frequently is compromised by geographical happenstance. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for provision of supplemental funding to the centers for infrastructure and reporting, and ensure adequate reimbursement within the centers to support clinical infrastructure. Additionally, LEAD recommends that the Plan establish a target date of 2017 for HHS to develop a comprehensive national public health strategy for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders which includes for all Americans regardless of age or care setting early assessment of risk factors, advice about risk mitigation, access to diagnosis and disease management.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds the Plan for including goals and strategies that will improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that the Plan includes recommendations from LEAD to expand proven programs that are in place at the federal, state and local levels that provide adequate care and support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families. Moving forward it is important that the Plan provide adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 3 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials </strong></p>
<p>Stigma has diverse cultural bases and forms of expression. Reducing stigma and its consequences requires culturally appropriate interventions. LEAD recommends that stigma be identified as a specific criteria when implementing Actions 3.A.1, 3.A.2, and 2.A.3.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations </strong></p>
<p>The Plan calls for HHS to "partner with private organizations to convene a meeting of leading scientists and practitioners to review the state of the art of research and translational activities related to evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations." LEAD recommends that the Plan now call for such a meeting to be an annual occurrence.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>LEAD supports this Plan action and recommends that it be expanded to include education for court personnel, financial planners, and first responders. A number of states and local communities have extensive and evidence-based experience partnering with private organizations such as the Alzheimer's Association in educating first responders and court personnel (some have worked with financial planners) to better meet the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders and of family caregivers. At a minimum, HHS and the Department of Justice could serve as a clearinghouse for best practices in educating legal, financial, and emergency services professionals.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan call for development of training standards, for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, by government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include home care, adult day care, assisted living, and nursing home. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes among providers, family caregivers, other advocates, and people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2: <em>Develop best practices to help family caregivers remain productive in the workplace</em> </strong></p>
<p>Many family caregivers want or need to remain in the workforce but face substantial challenges that could be addressed successfully with workplace policies designed for elder care and based on the accommodations begun more than a generation ago for working parents. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for development of best practices to help family caregivers remain productive in the workplace. Best practices may include flextime; work-at-home options; jobsharing; counseling; dependent care accounts; information and referral to community services; and employer-paid services of a care manager.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3: <em>Assess the impact on and develop best practices for supporting children who are family caregivers</em> </strong></p>
<p>At the local, state, and federal levels, enormous investments are committed to advancing the academic and personal success of children. Increasingly, there is widespread -- perhaps universal -- realization that the efficacy of such investments can be enhanced or diminished by students' home environment. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for HHS and the Department of Education to collaboratively examine the consequences of Alzheimer's disease family caregiving on the academic achievement, and social-emotional well being of children and develop best practices for schools to support the needs of these students.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's is a deadly and unforgiving disease that affects 5.4 million Americans and costs hundreds of billions of dollars to our country each year. One in seven American workers is, or has been, a caregiver for a loved one with Alzheimer's or dementia. A crisis of this magnitude merits an equally serious response. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is a bold and groundbreaking effort that will help beat Alzheimer's by 2025, but it must be strengthened if we are to reach that goal.</p>
<p>The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services met in January and made recommendations to HHS. The Council emphasized the urgent need for greater federal research funding, stronger and expanded support for families and caregivers, and a detailed road map with milestones to advance us towards the ultimate goal: the prevention and effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease by 2025. These recommendations are so critical to the effectiveness of the plan that the Council unanimously approved them.</p>
<p>As the Department updates the national plan, I urge you to ensure that these recommendations are included in the 2013 version. We can beat Alzheimer's, but we need a plan that's aggressive, that ensures we have the resources we need, and that includes a detailed road map to getting to a cure.</p>
<p>My personal story is surprising for an Advance Practice RN, it was right before my eyes and I didn't recognize it for years.</p>
<p>My husband was a decorated military pilot who became an Airline Pilot and flew until September 10, 2001. He returned from Istanbul the day before 9/11 and didn't fly again since his 60th birthday was at the end of September and he was forced to retire. He completed Law School after he retired and passed the Bar Exam. It took he a couple of tries, but I attributed that to his age rather than a declining mental status. He worked as an attorney for 3 years and then it just became too much, so he retired. It was only after being evaluated for Depression, PTSD and being counseled by a wonderful VA counselor that our Primary Care Physician became worried and ordered an MRI that the diagnosis of Alzheimerscame. He now participates in a Drug Study through Summit Research and is stable on an Alzheimer's medication and he is doing as well as we can expect for early to moderate Alzheimers. He is benefiting from the Research Study because of the Medical professionals he interacts with and our lives will be disrupted again if the funding disappears. This experience gives stability to our lives and helps us cope and have hope for the future. Please employ a reasoned view and do not cut essential medical research funding, it will take us back to a place where hope is not part of so many people's lives. And hope is what keeps us going.</p>

<p>Attached are my talking points and recommendation for tomorrows NAPA meeting. I want to make sure they are also in the public record. I look forward to meeting with you and Don afterwards.</p>
</td>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>First of all, I would like to thank the Alzheimer Association, for making it possible for me to be here today, and reach another milestone.</p>
<p>As many of you know, I started reaching out to this Advisory Council when it first formed.</p>
<p>Helen Lamont, was kind enough to read my emails and comments, and I was given the opportunity to speak out and have a voice.</p>
<p>I have made a lot of progress with all of your help, but I wish I could say that a cure has been found, or even that we are close to eradicating this disease once and for all, but I can't.</p>
<p>I know your challenges are not easy, but I believe, that if we make, some hard choices, we can get to our shared goal. I truly believe, that if we redirect some of the funding, budget wisely, and fairly, we could be well on our way. While all medical causes are important, I feel that Alzheimer's and other related dementias are somewhat neglected, when it comes to funding compared to Cancer and HIV for example.</p>
<p>We have no cure; we have no way to slow its progress. There is a certain amount of discrimination, when funding is awarded, and I for one, would like to see this change.</p>
<p>Would the situation be different, if we had survivors who fought for the newly afflicted?</p>
<p>Would things be different, if we had the awareness campaigns attributed to other causes?</p>
<p>Would things be better, if more people, instead of suffering in silence, stepped up and said: 'we need help'?</p>
<p>I think the answer to those questions, is a resounding YES!!!</p>
<p>Why are people afraid to step forward? Because many of us are in denial, do you think I am looking forward to my life ending in such a devastating way?</p>
<p>Do you think I relish the fact, that my wife is going to have to take complete care of me?</p>
<p>Do you think I enjoy waking up everyday thinking: "is today the day I lose my voice or my ability to feed myself?"</p>
<p>Don't look me in the eye, and tell there is no funding, or that you can't get the support from your constituents! Please, fight for the more than 5 million Americans, living with Alzheimer', fight for me.</p>
<p>Someday, someone close to you, may be impacted by this disease. We are all paying the cost for not being proactive; we will all bear the cost if something is not done soon.</p>
<p><strong>Talking Point #1 </strong></p>
<p>Recently, the government has implemented a national plan, that addresses the growing needs of more than 5 million Americans living with Alzheimer's</p>
<p>As part of the National Plan, the government is looking at enhancing public awareness, through awareness campaigns, websites, etc. But this needs to be done on a large scale, for it to be effective.</p>
<p>The National Plan, includes a commitment to prevent, and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025. The time is now, for the government, to make a commitment to provide the funding necessary to make this goal a reality.</p>
<p>It is my hope, that this advisory council, recognizes the value voices, of people living with the disease, can bring to this process, and includes our perspective, in the development of the national plan.</p>
<p><strong>Talking Point #2 </strong></p>
<p>Let us talk about the stigma, of having Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>There are many misperceptions, surrounding Alzheimer's, to the extent, that even those of us who have the disease, often have misleading ideas about it.</p>
<p>Many caregivers, go through this journey alone, because they fear the reaction of others, to their loved ones diagnosis.</p>
<p>I have chosen to be an advocate, and share my story with others, on a national platform, as an Alzheimer's Association National Early-Stage Advisor. I do this because, I feel that the louder we shout about this problem, the more people will become aware of it. And as you know me, I do a lot of shouting.</p>
<p>This council has the opportunity, to make a significant impact, on the elimination of Alzheimer's stigma, and ensure, that individuals , and families living with dementia, do not have to experience this journey alone. Through public awareness campaigns, changing policies, implementing new policies, and prioritizing funding.</p>
<p>It is imperative, that you accept members on to the council, who are themselves are living with Alzheimer's disease. This will have a number of positive outcomes:</p>
<p>One, you will be publicly declaring, that individuals living in the early stage of Alzheimer's, are still capable of making meaningful contributions to society. Two, when you are looking at changing policies on our behalf, it would be of great benefit, to consult with individuals, living in the early stage of the disease. While some may think they know what is best for us, take advantage of our ability, to provide you with a firsthand account of the physical, mental, and emotional toll, the disease is taking on our lives, and the best way to support us. I say this, because I can assure you, that from my side of the fence, the view is very different.</p>
<p><strong>Talking Point #3 </strong></p>
<p>After receiving my diagnosis, I felt a sense a relief, knowing that I had an answer, to the cause of my symptoms. I discovered, that Alzheimer's disease is the only disease, among the top ten, that has not had, the scientific input, in terms of funding, or the legislative interest, which has resulted, in the fact, that in 2013, this disease still cannot be slowed, cured or prevented.</p>
<ul><li>Currently, Alzheimer's disease receives only $450 million for research, compared to $5.8 billion for cancer, and $3.1 billion for HIV/AIDS. I was astonished, at the lack of funding dedicated to addressing this health crisis</li>
<li>With the additional $50 million given to Alzheimer's research, and the <strong><u>proposed</u></strong> $80 million, we are headed in the right direction, but more needs to be done.</li>
<li>Historically, we know, that when the U.S. government makes a commitment to research, we have been successful, in finding disease modifying drugs. This has been the case, with HIV/AIDS, and for some cancers.</li>
<li>I appeal to this council, to do everything necessary, to ensure, that Alzheimer's disease, gets the exposure, commitment, and funding necessary, to change the course of the disease, before it impacts the lives of many more millions of Americans.</li>

<p>Although the official comment period has closed for the NAPA draft plan, I'm writing today to urge you to go bolder with the final plan to be released by HHS later this month.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is a cruel disease. It slowly steals one's intellect, ability to communicate, independence, and dignity, even control over basic bodily functions like eating and caring for personal hygiene. It also places an overwhelming burden on caregivers -- emotionally, physically, and financially.</p>
<p>The commitment to a 2025 deadline in the draft NAPA plan represents a major step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's. I am pleased that the plan recognizes the need for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, compressing the drug development process, accelerating targeted research, and better coordinating activities with other countries.</p>
<p>However, I am one of many concerned Alzheimer's advocates who believe that this first draft fails to present a strategy aggressive enough to achieve the goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's within 13 years. It lacks specificity in terms of timelines and deadlines, provides no path to providing significantly greater resources, and does not hold a single high-level office or individual accountable for the overall plan.</p>
<p>I hope that HHS will address these issues so that the next version of the plan will be bolder.</p>
<p>With the number of Alzheimer's patients expected to triple in the coming decades, we must embrace a plan that eschews a "business-as-usual" approach and tackles Alzheimer's with the urgency and aggressiveness it requires. If not, we stand to lose millions more lives -- and trillions of dollars -- to this disease.</p>

<p>Thank you for your outstanding efforts on NAPA and the May 2012 Alzheimer's Disease Summit.</p>
<p>Below you will find a brief response to a proposal on the use of NAPA funding which has disturbed me sufficiently to immediately respond to both the Alzheimer's Organization and NIH. Specifically, NIA's goal to reduce use of antipsychotics by 15% in the first year and to expand training programs on behavioral intervention.</p>
<p>This is outrageous.</p>
<p>The FDA specifically proscribes the use of antipsychotic drugs other than for their specified purpose and has issued unequivocal warnings of danger up to and including stroke or death to the elderly on misadministration. Medicare specifically proscribes the use of chemical or physical restraints.</p>
<p>The United States Attorney is handling hundreds if not thousands of False Claims Act matters with severe economic penalty against pharmaceutical firms. Local prosecutors are filing criminal complaints against nurses and doctors for the use of anti-psychotics not only in SNF's but, as to children in juvenile detention facilities.</p>
<p>37% of the AD population in Florida is on psychotropic drugs.</p>
<p>First, the act of using a pill or injection in this manner for behavioral control has been characterized by prosecutors as a criminal battery.</p>
<p>Medicare, through Plan D has intimate knowledge of the extent of use by date, duration, dosage and location. If there is extensive use of antipsychotics in a particular facility, the matter should be referred to the United States attorney's office for investigation and appropriate action. Absent referral yet with knowledge, obstruction of justice issues arise.</p>
<p>Individuals don't have the ability to do this. They can only act as to a particular patient in what is essentially a disenfranchised population. Health care surrogates, if any, may or may not be informed of the offensive conduct or attentive to the needs of AD patients who are being abused in this manner.</p>
<p>It is inevitable with an increasingly litigious baby boomer generation that such obstruction of justice charges, conspiracy, RICO and other criminal complaints will be made against the federal government employees, agencies, nursing home operators, nurses and doctors and pharmacies as well as civil actions for damages from injury or wrongful death. It has already started.</p>
<p>Treating this inhuman torture of elderly as an administrative efficiency issue is an abuse as vicious, criminal and sadistic as the act of administering the injection or forcing the pill. I don't know if you have ever sat next to a SNF frail elderly AD with a hip fracture, shaking and crying after administration of an antipsychotic. It will haunt you. One more day is too much.</p>
<p>In one Medicare 5 star facility, an attempt was made in the first week to give a new AD patient an anti seizure drug because the patient was "acting out". The surrogate declined. In this facility, AD were separated from the general population. A friend/aide covering the new patient for an afternoon was a nurse and a former nun from Ireland. She took her to a SNF music recital and was shocked because the rest of the patients were virtually comatose. The surrogate showed up at the facility the next day to find the patient's arms covered with a large hematoma and bruises from wrist to elbow as well as split skin on the forehead. No one had alerted the surrogate to the injury. No staff member would address the injury. The AD patient was pulled out of the facility.</p>
<p>The only way to stop this abuse is to aggressively act. The United States Attorney in Boston took action against J&amp;J and Omnicare under the False Claims Act. It is incumbent upon Medicare and NIH/NIA and AD advocacy organizations to treat this with the same seriousness of purpose and dispense with pharma and nursing home owner/operator handholding. If you as individuals and as a representative of your agency or organization do not have the courage, the talent, the knowledge and the integrity to immediately save these patients from needless continued suffering, don't work in this field.</p>
<p>One doctor advised me that the section of the brain controlling the creative was the last to be destroyed in AD. After months of fruitless research for activities which benefitted AD, I found myself reading the Jerusalem Post on August 5 to find a care center in Israel with a program which made their days enjoyable.</p>
<p>How embarrassing for us that I had to go so far.</p>
<p>Training of Staff</p>
<p>The recommendation to utilize NAPA money on manpower to train nurses and aides in behavioral intervention techniques is a waste of time and an inefficient, inappropriate use of manpower and resources. I don't understand the continuing tolerance of the medical profession feeding itself from subsidies. What is next? Gerontology certification training for attorneys who are not up to speed?</p>
<p>Administrators, nurses and aides are licensed by the state. Prior to licensure, they have to complete training through state approved contractors to insure that they are qualified to perform the function of the profession they have elected to join. If the state, by and through its contractors has not met its responsibility to properly set forth statutory and regulatory qualifications for certification and/or contractors have not met those guidelines in training programs (for which they are compensated), to qualify licensees to meet the needs of the population they service (AD) despite clear demonstrable need, it is incumbent upon the state and its contractors to immediately remedy any training deficiencies.</p>
<p>The professional associations or the Alzheimer's organizations can prepare AD Behavioral Intervention Training materials by disc or online/video cam for sale to state training approved contractors. The state training contractors should incorporate these materials into certification training. If the individual is already licensed, state facility and professional license renewal should be contingent on licensee completion of such continuing professional education.</p>
<p>Tapes are valuable because they can be viewed repeatedly by staff, caretakers and home health care aides at leisure. With all respect to dedicated trainers, sometimes the level of sophistication is not very high and the quality of instruction questionable. Further and often, recommended techniques which fail to address the individual do not work. For example, one newly trained MSW put a group of AD in a room overlooking the garden with peaceful music. One lady was quiet but when they moved her out, she burst out crying. She said they kept her in room next to a desk listening to that "horrible music" because the bill had not been paid and they would not let her go to the bathroom until her family showed up and paid it. She was quiet because she was embarrassed.</p>
<p>Second, agitation and "acting out" are based on inability to communicate physical distress, pain or discomfort, infection, medication side effect or misadministration, fear, frustration, or confusion. Hallucination occurs in the late stages. Behavioral intervention will not be effective if the problem is physical because the underlying cause is not abated. This should be the first step in evaluation.</p>
<p>As experienced nurses will tell you, successful behavioral intervention involves an intimate knowledge of the patient and time consuming one on one attention. Unless and until there is increased staffing in the facility so more than medication administration, dressing, bathing, changing and feeding can be accomplished, no more than lip service will be paid to training efforts. Nurses are furious that, because of budgetary staffing constraints, they may be professionally hurt and their patient's needs are not addressed. Other nurses are so beaten down they are numb and operate on autopilot. Some doctors are clueless. They defer to nurses and pharmain prescription and rarely visit the patient. Yet Medicare pays for their time.</p>
<p>The Florida legislature has declined to increase minimum staffing. Consideration should be given to a mandatory national standard.</p>
<p>Represented decline in the use of antipsychotics is not based on facility compliance with Medicare proscriptions. It is based on the fact that reputable SNF's and AL's refuse to take patients with AD. If a patient develops AD while in the facility and doping is not used, the facility demands 24/7 private care in addition to the facility charges which is paid for by the family as a condition of retention. This is why AD are taken home for private care and lives of caretakers are destroyed.</p>
<p>I have reviewed the financial representations of SNF's and AL's which are on the market throughout the nation. A substantial majority represent a net profit to owners of 35 to 50% of gross income. If a SNF or AL is doping to increase or preserve owner profit, it is time for closure with possible criminal prosecution. Alternatively, federal or state takeover or placement in a form of receivership until compliance is accomplished would be recommended.</p>
<p>I will address specific recommendations including programs and services which actually benefit AD afflicted under separate cover including sources of additional funding for the Alzheimer's Organization.</p>
<p>We had a triple dose of AD in our family. I was responsible for one highly agitated elderly with multiple physical issues for fifteen years, nine 24/7 as well as one late stage dementia. I have used the resources of your site and NIH since it was first accessible on the internet as well as every other medical information site available. I have read deficiency reports for probably 70% of SNF's in Florida, visited facilities, spoken to nurses and other caretakers on a regular and continuous basis and had a front row seat to institutional neglect of elderly AD including a few direct hits.</p>
<p>By way of my qualifications, I am attorney, with a BA University of Notre Dame in government/economics, an MPA NYU, and experience representing the legislative interests of a State Department including Aging, Local Government Services, Housing and Human Services with floor privileges in the Senate and House; in a corporate construction/development operation in a new and heavily regulated industry conforming operations and employment with statutory and regulatory directives; law firm experience including pharma product liability defense; and extensive experience as a mediator.</p>

<p>Although the official comment period has closed for the NAPA draft plan, I'm writing today to urge you to go bolder with the final plan to be released by HHS later this month.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is a cruel disease. It slowly steals one's intellect, ability to communicate, independence, and dignity, even control over basic bodily functions like eating and caring for personal hygiene. It also places an overwhelming burden on caregivers -- emotionally, physically, and financially.</p>
<p>The commitment to a 2025 deadline in the draft NAPA plan represents a major step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's. I am pleased that the plan recognizes the need for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, compressing the drug development process, accelerating targeted research, and better coordinating activities with other countries.</p>
<p>However, I am one of many concerned Alzheimer's advocates who believe that this first draft fails to present a strategy aggressive enough to achieve the goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's within 13 years. It lacks specificity in terms of timelines and deadlines, provides no path to providing significantly greater resources, and does not hold a single high-level office or individual accountable for the overall plan.</p>
<p>I hope that HHS will address these issues so that the next version of the plan will be bolder.</p>
<p>With the number of Alzheimer's patients expected to triple in the coming decades, we must embrace a plan that eschews a "business-as-usual" approach and tackles Alzheimer's with the urgency and aggressiveness it requires. If not, we stand to lose millions more lives -- and trillions of dollars -- to this disease.</p>

<p>I want to thank you for allowing me to participate in this NAPA meeting. In this document, and those attached, I write of issues I feel are important to be shared with the committee. When I have the opportunity to speak during the live meeting, I may follow this format, or I may have additional comments or suggestions.</p>
<p>Attached are a few documents that I hope will benefit many dealing with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. The first document "Hospitals Dealing with Dementia Patients (1)" is based on my experience in staying in the hospital. I would like to think that what happened to me will apply to most hospitals and they all need to be educated.</p>
<p>When I have brought this to the attention of Doylestown Hospital the people were very receptive and realized that further education was needed. They are now discussing how to best approach/ take advantage of my skills and the use of the Alzheimer's Association to better educate their personnel in this facility. My hope is that this hospital can become a model for other hospitals dealing with dementia patients.</p>
<p>Attached is also "Alzheimer's Initiatives - International Association of Chiefs of Police" document. I worked with the Alzheimer's Initiatives Project Manager for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Some of these issues are being addressed while others are not. It also seems to be open to the local police chiefs to determine if this is something they will need or benefit from. While the Project Manager feels they should all be implemented, there is no way to get all the Chiefs involved. This is all being done voluntarily. While I know the township next to mine is involved, I cannot say that for the police in my township. Multiple calls went unanswered. My suggestions and many others should become mandatory for not only the safety of the patient and the public, but also for the officer.</p>
<p>Since diagnosed with Alzheimer's, I have had the fear that I will suffer in many ways as I die slowly from this disease. How will I suffer? One way, which I recently realized, is from pain that my doctor might not recognize or treat once I am no longer able to effectively communicate my needs. Recently I found a way that makes it easy for people to do two things: To learn how people can suffer from Advanced Dementia and to then make decisions that are legal and moral. Basically, I do not want to continue any treatment that will ONLY prolong my dying and increase the chance of my suffering.</p>
<p>This tool is a set of illustrated cards. It creates a Natural Dying Living Will. The name is thus "Natural Dying Living Will Cards." Each of the four dozen cards describes a single aspect of Advanced Dementia in plain language. Each card also has a line drawing, to explain the text. What I did when I "sorted the cards" is to make a decision about what I wanted for each item: Treat and Feed, or Natural Dying? A video is being created in which I can explain my choices, which my loved ones can view when the time comes. I am glad I have the opportunity to say now what I will want later. I can have confidence that I will not have to suffer a prolonged dying with emotional or physical pain. I do not think this system covers all of my concerns, but it's the best available that I am aware of today. This should be considered for all others.</p>
<p>One of the manifestations of dementia is wandering. Patients rely upon familiarity and can get lost easily. This can create panic for the patient and their loved ones and may sometimes result in injury or death. Today there are many state-of-the-art location based products and services that offer safety and peace-of-mind to families and loved ones. People need to be educated about these products and directed to the ones that are best fit for their application. The medical field needs to embrace these products as they do drugs. These products can lead to the person safely staying at home longer. Therefore these products should be a must for all patients and should be covered by health plans and government plans. We also need to figure out how to bring down the cost so that everyone can take advantage of them.</p>
<p>As a dementia patient living in the spotlight, I am often contacted by people trying to sell or convince me to use a product they have that will either reverse or cure my disease. We all have this hope factor in us and are very willing to do some very stupid things to see if they work. There needs to be a single unbiased source of all <strong>proven</strong> technology that people can rely on. There should be information on what is known to help and what has been known to fail. Too many people are being scammed by the quacks and we need to help people understand what really works. Now I say this with caution, because we also need to remain open-minded. Some real solutions may come from non-traditional methods. As long as respectable people have done a true trial, following the stringent protocols established, that can also be backed up by the medical field, then it should be added to the list.</p>
<p>And my last and final point and question. What assurances do families have that what you are doing will get us a means of prevention and treatment by 2020 or 2025? I am already concerned by the lack of funding being appropriated for this cause.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to reach out to me should you have any questions. I welcome the opportunity to become more involved in this committee and to be able to give my viewpoints as an Alzheimer's/dementia person. I also volunteer to be utilized by this committee and HSS to be a voice for other AD patients.</p>
<p>Thanks and have a great weekend.</p>

<p>At registration, identify a person that can and will be able to be involved in all decision-making, along with the patient.</p>
<p>At registration, identify a person that will be given full access to all records on behalf of the patient.</p>
<p>Patients bring in a list of current medications. If for some reason you must change the drug or dosage for any reason, the issue should be addressed with the patient and caregiver to ensure there are no issues (even if it's as simple as converting to a generic). Sometimes patients cannot take another form of the same drug-ask them.</p>
<p>Example: My doctor switched me to Galantamine rather than Aricept because of side effects. In the hospital, they substituted Aricept. (My wife had Galantamine with her, but of course it is a big deal that you should not take your own meds.)</p>
<p>A special ID bracelet should be placed on this type of individual so the staff is alerted that this patient has some form of dementia. This will help them if the patient is acting confused or wandering or just needs a little extra help or explanation. It may also mean that the patient isn't great at making good decisions. If you need a color, purple is perfect.</p>
<p>Example: I needed a Fleet's enema pre-op. The nurse asked if she should give it to me or if I wanted to use it myself in the bathroom. Of course, I offered to do it myself. I found I had difficulty once I got in the bathroom by myself. Bad decision on my part. The nurse should have not given me the option. (We do not want to appear stupid or show our flaws so we may do something to show we are still capable when we may not be.)</p>
<p>I know they always ask the patient for their full name and birthdate -- that may be hard at times for us. I can become confused on a good day, in the hospital it can be worse because of pain medication or being awakened suddenly. Maybe another way can be figured out. (Before a name tag is placed on a dementia patient it may require 3 or 4 staff individuals to ask the patient for that information and each must identify the same information before the ID is placed. This will insure the wrong tag is not placed on the patient. Use the verbal ask on critical things like surgery and drugs given the first time the nurse may see the patient)</p>
<p>Do not always consider a patient being confused as a part of the dementia, but it could be much worse due to the drugs they are on. When I was on pain killers my wife could not even get a response from me that made much sense, and she knows what's normal for me.</p>
<p>A real concern exists on what type of drugs the patient may receive for Anesthesia. Pain killers will also have a much greater impact on this type of person.</p>
<p>While the ordering food on the menus is simple, it is very overwhelming for me and to keep track of things and what items may even go together or are even needed.</p>
<p>Don't assume we can figure out how to use items in the room, like TV, Phone, call button, and anything else. Please point them out and provide a simple explanation on their use.</p>
<p>Aides should not be the first point of contact. I am not always good at explaining what I need and the aide was not always good at interpreting what I was trying to say. Aides are okay for follow-up or to help with food menus.</p>
<p>When asking a question, give them a minute or two to answer without going on to some other question. You could even ask them to think about it and come back in 5-10 minutes, no longer. We often need a few minutes to gather our thoughts. We might even answer a question right away and then realize a few minutes later that that wasn't what you asked.</p>
<p>Somehow you need to insure the patient response is really correctly given -- they sometimes give an answer just to not appear stupid or show they did not understand. Maybe some visual aid or clues can be given along with the verbal depending on the stage the patient is in.</p>
<p>Try to keep items and things in the room in the same place once they determine the best location for them.</p>
<p>I personally feel these patients should be kept a bit longer than the average person, for observation. This would just be to make certain there are no issues at time of release.</p>
<p>Offer a pen and paper to keep in the room. Tell them to write down questions they want to remember to ask when the nurse comes in the room.</p>
<p>Keep in mind many patients with dementia can no longer spell correctly and may use the wrong context for words.</p>

<p>If someone with Alzheimer's is stopped, for a sobriety test, and they may fail due because they will have trouble following instructions or poor gate. They are also much lower in there response and may even give you a blind stair due to confusion.</p>
<p>A place to store or remove guns from a home when needed - I came up with a simple way that could be accomplished, without too much impact to the police. A gun safety device can be used to secure the guns in the person's home and the key can be given to someone responsible. There were other suggestions made.</p>
<p>Better and improved driving testing methods for Alzheimer's patients, ones that normal people would also not fail. It's very easy to find fault with someone's driving, but is it really related to Alzheimer's. Just think of the foolish things you have done? If do not have Alzheimer we treated one way, but if you do you react so much differently. I know we want to make the roads safe, but that comes at a cost to others lives.</p>
<p>When a call comes into the 911 system, they should have a way for people to register that a person in that house has Alzheimer's. This would prepare them in advance on how to deal with the person and family and eliminate confusion. This of course would be something the resident would need to register. Just think if there is a fire would that person still know what to do. Having that information could and will save lives.</p>
<p>Sometimes Alzheimer's patients get confused or feel threaten and may make accusation that could land someone else in jail. Be prepared to deal with cases like this. They need to be handled very different then the average person.</p>
<p>If an Alzheimer's patient becomes defensive, do to some argument, they can sometimes become very aggressive and even become threaten. That is the wrong time to try to remove them from a home. They need to be calmed down first, before moving on, otherwise it can become a disaster for that person, since they will not understand what is going on and may escalate even more.</p>
<p>Be prepared on how to deal with people who may seek help when they are lost driving. All because we get lost driving, does not mean they cannot drive. These two issues are very confused by many.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Of Alzheimer's, the scientific method &amp; educated guesses</strong></p>
<p>My name is Caroline Rodgers. Some of you may recall that in January, I presented my hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease is caused by dental X-rays shortening the lifespan of the brain cells that keep sustain neurons, fatally stranding them (1). The article it was based on was reviewed by scientists specializing in Alzheimer's, neurology or radiology during manuscript development and in the course of peer review before it was published in Medical Hypothesis last July (2).</p>
<p>But that's not what I am here to talk about.</p>
<p>I am here to talk about the scientific method versus expediting answers. Thomas Edison was a great one for applying scientific method. He exemplified how persistence can conquer multiple failures when he had his lab test 10,000 different filament substances before finding tungsten. That was a great feat, but he was only looking for a way to light up the world that was already aglow with candles.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is different. Darkness is descending on the minds of the elderly and the not-so-elderly with savage rapidity. Every day we fail to discover what is causing Alzheimer's and how to treat it, countless more individuals are doomed to losing their minds and ultimately, their lives in a manner that does not go gently into the night. We don't have the time to test 10,000 possibilities -- we need ask new questions and to make educated guesses that will vault us into new territory.</p>
<p>Clinical trials are the "gold standard" of evidence-based medicine. But when a treatment does not pass a clinical trial, it is not gold, it is lead. Recently one scientist involved with clinical trials of Alzheimer's drugs said that some 100 treatments were in the works, most of which targeted brain plaques. Since more than one clinical trial of a plaques-clearing treatment has been halted for doing more harm than good, it is time to consider that clearing plaques is not the answer and no alchemy can turn it into gold.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we can't afford the time and money to be as systematic as Edison -- we need educated guesses that, like leaps of faith, close the gap quickly. The answer is probably a simple one; the very speed with which Alzheimer's has become a killer argues against a complex etiology, since the more factors required for an outcome, the more difficult it is to meet all of the conditions necessary to cause it. Plus, simple answers are easily overlooked, which is why it took nearly 300 years for scientists to discover that rickets was caused by a lack of sunshine.</p>
<p>Are dental X-rays causing Alzheimer's? I can't answer that question because my hypothesis has yet to be tested. But I'm told it would take only about $20,000 to launch a pilot study that could bring us closer to the truth. We need to investigate this and other out-of-the-box ideas. While the Research Subcommittee's draft recommendations call for timelines, strict metrics and cooperation among what it terms "industry players," we need to go beyond these business models and find ways to attract and fund fresh avenues of Alzheimer's research. While scientific method is important, if it is not used to explore creative educated guesses it may be a long time before we strike gold.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I AM A DAUTHER,AN AMERICAN , A VOTER AND A CAREPARTNER FOR A PARENT WITH ALZHEIMERS DISEASE AND THESE ARE MY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NATIONAL ALZHEIMERS PLAN:</p>
<p>Goal One is of vital important-To accomplish this goal, it is imperative that a subgroup is formed to accelerate and streamline efforts to isolate and identify potentially viable drugs that can effectively cross the Blood Brain Barrier and stop and preferably regress the Alzheimersdisease process. This group should consist of a representative from all of the top federal and non-federal agencies that are involved in bringing a drug through the development process into human testing and beyond to becoming FDA approved. This subgroup should consists primarily of a representative from HHS,NIH,NIA,WHO,FDA, Doctors and Researchers , as well as Biotech and Pharmaceutical companies. Similar to the Therapeutics For Rare And Neglected Diseases (TRND) Program-this subgroup should stimulate drug development and research by providing an opportunity to partner with one another in a collaborative environment with the goal of moving promising drugs into human trials in a timely, efficient and highly effective manner. This subgroup should use an application and evaluation process to select collaborators. Selected investigators should provide each separate drug candidates starting points and ongoing biological disease expertise throughout the total project. Each drug composition should be studied individually and separately so that the best possible ones can be accurately identified and focused upon. Therefore each potentially valid treatment and or cure for the alzheimersdisease process is regarded as a separate project or entity ,within the main project; the main project's goal being to create a new and better medicine for the alzheimers disease process and or a cure.</p>
<p>The Alzheimers Disease Summit in May 2012 should be looked upon as a breeding group for potentially valid drug candidates. All and any information gathered and disseminated at the summit should be thoroughly analyzed for the absolute best possible viable candidates to be studied by the subgroup, in a supreme effort to accomplish goal one. A representative from each agency involved in the subgroup should be in attendance at the summit so that they can absorb information and use it accordingly.</p>
<p>To increase public awareness of the disease and its various components a public service announcement should be broadcast across the country on every public tv station. This announcement should show a person with the disease, throughout the various progressive stages and explain to America that alzheimersis much more than a loss of memory but instead a progressive degenerative brain disease that is fatal and desperate for public support and a new and better medicine and or a cure.</p>

<p>While I agree with some of your statements and there is a flaw. The flaw is not thought my ideas, but the system we created. Many of us think they are god and have the right to make decision for everyone else and they do not look past the religion aspect of things. The perfect world would be based on having doctors put me out based on taken a certain score on the 30 question MMI test (or whatever you call it) they always give you. I am not sure what the number would be, but probably about 15 - 20. That of course would require much more involvement from my doctors so I could truly understand what that all means. It should also be based at taking that test 3 separate times at different times of the day, with at least a week in between. That would all be based by my original request when I was still capable of making a sound decision. I would be happy to discuss it with anyone interested in speaking about it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Why physician-assisted suicide/dying cannot help patients who have dementia</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Ellenbogen brings up an important point, one that concerns many people who worry about dementia: Briefly: Is there a way for them to exit in a dignified way that is also timely?</p>
<p>Mr. Ellenbogen expressed this fear well, and I feel compassion for him. His stated problem begs for an effective solution. Yet the one he proposed is seriously flawed from several points of view: the clinical, practical, ethical, moral, and psychological, as well as legal.</p>
<p>The points of agreement and the one point of disagreement that I have with Michael Ellenbogen is within his key paragraph that I copied below and then respond to, point-by-point, by adding my specific comments:</p>
<p>Mr. Ellenbogen wrote: "You need to make plans when you are still able to think clearly. You must figure out a method so you know what to do when the time comes. The scary part for me is knowingwhen the right time may be. You do not want to go earlier then you have to, but you do not want to wait until the point where you may not be able to decide to do it, or remember how to do it. <strong>That is why I am a true believer in assisted suicide</strong>. It would be nice to let someone know my wishes far in advance, and when we get to that point they would instruct me on what I had to do. This way, my family and I could get the most out of my life without question."</p>
<p>First a general comment: Mr. Ellenbogen expresses what I have been calling the "<strong>Dementia Fear</strong>," when he writes: "You do not want to wait until the point where you may not be able to decide to do it, or remember how to do it," since by the word, "IT," he really means suicide. More typical is this blunter statement: "If I don't kill myself now (<strong>when I can</strong>), I won't be able to kill myself later (<strong>when I want to</strong>)." The consequence of acting on this fear is "premature dying," which violates the principle of the sanctity/preciousness of life. This is the problem for which Mr. Ellenbogen is searching for a solution.</p>
<p>Now, point-by-point:</p>
<p>Yes, I agree: "You need to make plans while you still have the mental capacity to make end of life treatment decision." Let me add: One way to do this is to create a clear and specific Living Will and to appoint a proxy/agent whom you trust to make sure that others will honor the wishes you previously expressed in your Living Will. The document designates your proxy/agent must give the appointed individuals sufficient power to facilitate your last wishes.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree: "You need to figure out a method so you know what to do." To respond: My personal choice, and what I advise my patients to consider is to forgo the continuation of another person's hand to assist oral feeding and drinking. This is what I have been calling "Natural Dying." Important: food and fluid are always placed near enough to reach so that if you regained the ability to eat independently, you could. Forgoing treatment that has become extraordinary or disproportionate is both legal and moral.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree: "The scary part is knowing when the right time may be." Appreciating that you will lose the ability to decide on that time later means you must make this decision while you still can. The goal of TIMELY DYING is possible if you can trust your proxy/agent and your future physician to engage in the process of "shared decision-making." Then, someday, they will compare your future condition with the decisions you expressed in your clear and specific Living Will to decide if it is time for "Natural Dying."</p>
<p>Important: Assisted suicide is not legal for patients who have dementia, even in Oregon, Washington, or Switzerland. While legal in theory, it is very rarely practiced in Holland because physicians do not feel comfortable killing a patient who cannot <em>contemporaneously</em> express the wish to die. Dutch physicians also do not feel comfortable killing a patient whose major issue is their anticipatory fear of greater suffering and burdens <em>in the future</em>; they insist that patients have unbearable suffering which cannot be relieved in any way other than by dying--which is NOT the case for patients in the early or middle stages of dementia. Even for patients who had such terminal diseases as cancer or neurological diseases (which comprise the majority of patients who used Oregon's "Death With Dignity Act"), only 600 people died this way since 1997. Compare this number to the one to two million people who currently are suffering in the advanced stage of dementia--a number that will triple by mid-century. Thus, physician-assisted dying cannot be a practical, legal, or ethical answer for a prolonged dying with much suffering for patients who reach the stage of advanced dementia.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree: "It would be nice to let someone know my wishes far in advance..." and "This way, my family and I could get the most out of my life without question." This laudable goal can be accomplished by effective Advance Care Planning.</p>
<p>But now, a resounding NO, I do NOT agree: "When we get to that point they would instruct me on what I had to do" (e.g., how to commit suicide). Your family members would risk being indicted for a serious crime with severe penalties. They are also likely to suffer from greater moral angst and grief, if they actively helped you die when they were not sure about--as you put it "when the right time... when [I] get to that point." The best way to reduce the emotional burdens on families is to create your gift of a clear, specific Living Will and to make it clear that you are responsible for the ultimate existential decision, not them.</p>
<p>Let me end with a personal note to Michael Ellenbogen: I am sorry you have the diagnosis of dementia. I am glad that you are still functioning at such a high level. Unfortunately, you cannot be sure, just because each dementia patient is different, just how long you will retain your ability to exercise good judgment about end-of-life medical decisions. Now, you do. Someday... unless you die of another disease first, the irreversible, progressive disease of dementia will likely deprive you of that good judgment. (Perhaps an exception is a very well controlled vascular dementia that remains stable.) This is the reason why it is so important that you make your decisions, memorialize them, and appoint surrogates to facilitate them NOW. It would be an enormous shame and waste of your good life, if you were to commit suicide prematurely, just because you still possessed the mental capacity to make medical decisions. I hope you live as long and as well as possible.</p>
<p>Conflict of interest statement: Stanley A. Terman, PhD, MD, has written three books on this subject and created a deck of illustrated cards that people, even those in early dementia, can use to generate a clear and specific Living Will if they want to attain the goal of a timely and peaceful dying. (The books are "The <em>BEST WAY</em> to Say Goodbye: A Legal Peaceful Choice at the End of Life," "Peaceful Transitions: Stories of Success and Compassion," and "Peaceful Transitions: Plan Now, Die Later--Ironclad Strategy"; the cards are "My Way Cards for Natural Dying" or "Natural Dying Living Will Cards." Dr. Terman is the founder and Medical Director of Caring Advocates, a non-profit organization.)</p>

<p>I am Joel S Ross MD. I have provided medical care for over 10,000 victims of Alzheimer's Disease since starting my comprehensive geriatric and Alzheimer's Disease practice in 1986. I would like to present my comments on the NAPA plan. I am a member of the advisory panel of NAPA and through my organization, The Memory Enhancement of America we provide an unprecedented level of care and treatment to all those afflicted with memory loss/mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>I would desire to discuss the urgent need to open a demonstration project in our 6th congressional district.</p>
<p>This Memory Evaluation and Treatment Center (METC) will provide complete and comprehensive management for mild, moderate and severe stages of Alzheimer's Disease. Funded in part by the a portion of the 83 million dollars signed into law by President Obama it shall include but not limit itself to providing medical/nursing/social/psychological care of AD patients as well as offer physical and occupational therapy; address the many ethical, financial and legal challenges this deadly disease poses to patients, caregivers and society in general. This METC will show cost effectiveness by reducing unnecessary hospitalization, reducing need for emergency room visits, delay nursing home if not eliminate the need for such placement as well as be a center of excellence for all other 434 Congressional districts in our wonderful nation. Pharmaceutical research of the highest caliber testing safety and efficacy of the latest medications in development will be a further extension of METC.</p>
<p>All at no cost to the patient. I propose that Medicare/Medicaid and a portion of NAPA money be used to test this METC concept and in a randomized study using a group of 200 AD patients assigned to traditional (fragmented and inefficient, standard of care) and comparing them to a similarly matched group of 200 AD patients assigned to METC care.</p>
<p>I and my many colleagues and other professional associates and organizations believe quite strongly and will prove a METC is the only place for AD patients to receive comprehensive, compassionate and welcomed care.</p>
<p>My bio is attached for your review.</p>
<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak at the April 17th meeting on behalf of the nearly 5.5 million victims of AD as well as for those who have died from this dreadful 100% fatal disorder.</p>

<p>I am writing to you out of frustration to the letter of Stanley A. Terman, PhD, MD, dated, March 26 2012. While I do not know what his credentials are, I can assure you 100% without doubt that he does not have any understanding of what Alzheimer's patients are capable of doing or not doing. While I have heard from all the smart doctors make the statement that if you know one Alzheimer's patient, you only know one as for their symptoms go.</p>
<p>While I may have trouble writing, speaking, do financing and many of the other things I so dearly miss, I am very capable of making very good judgments. In fact I still help many people who do not have dementia to help them with decisions they are unable to make.</p>
<p>Some people like to be in the public spot light for the wrong reasons, which is the case for this individual. If you are going to make statements, you should understand all sides, not just a one side point of view, maybe perhaps poor judgment on his part.</p>
<p>My wife feels that she would have no problem taking care of me all the way to the end. Since she happens to be an RN she feels she could take off for a year to become my private nurse, if and when I became bad. But I have many fears of reaching that point in my life. First of all, I do not want to be remembered as the person who could no longer talk or take care of himself. I want to leave this world with dignity and not make others feel better about themselvesbecause they kept me around to the end. I do not want to frustrate and burden their lives any more than I have. While we have had a great life, those are the thoughts I want to leave my wife with. I also hope that she finds someone new in her life so she can move on. My daughter lives in another state and I do not want her to feel obligated to move back, close to home, just to help her mother. I do not think my wife realizes what a major undertaking this is. While she may be good at what she does, she cannot handle this type of pressure.</p>
<p>Then of course, I do not want to suffer and be tortured for the rest of my life. There are many times, on a daily basis, when I am not always clear on what I need to do to make myself more comfortable or not suffer from pain. In the middle of the night, while sleeping, I become uncomfortable because I'm hot, so I flip the covers off my feet and feel so much better. A few hours go by, and now my feet are cold, so I replace the blanket. Now imagine that you are hot, and there is no way to remove that blanket. I would go crazy because I could not do that and would suffer. That is exactly what would happen if I could no longer do or think for myself.</p>
<p>My wife seems to think that those types of issues would not bother me. Who really knows? However, I do not want to be the one to find out and suffer. Sure, she can want to think it will not happen, for her peace of mind, but what about me?</p>
<p>Let me give you another example. I have major allergy problems and I constantly have a postnasal drip. Its major impact to me is at night and I frequently wake up gagging and coughing in an effort to clear my nose and throat. Sometimes I can waste 45 minutes before I finally resolve the issue. I actually suffer today and feel tortured at times. Can you imagine if that happens to me and I cannot let someone know what's bothering me and cannot do anything for myself. That frightens me to no end. My allergist has run out of options with me. This problem has really become much worse this year.</p>
<p>One last example. I am particular about how my pillow feels when I go to sleep. I like it to be very fluffed up. Usually once during the night I tend to flip it so that I get the fluffed end again, and it feels so much better when I do that.</p>
<p>People may tell you to wait until it gets worse, but they are wrong. You need to make plans when you are still able to think clearly. You must figure out a method so you know what to do when the time comes. The scary part for me is knowing when the right time may be. You do not want to go earlier then you have to, but you do not want to wait until the point where you may not be able to decide to do it, or remember how to do it. That is why I am a true believer in assisted suicide. It would be nice to let someone know my wishes far in advance, and when we get to that point they would instruct me on what I had to do. This way, my family and I could get the most out of my life without question.</p>
<p>There are many other reasons I can go into, but I need to go to a funeral for a family member who final passed away after years of torture. He finally passed from Parkinson Disease the other day. He was zombie and scared and had no life. He had living will that was over ridden because some family member was going to have a wedding and they decide to put feeding tube in when he would have probably died in another day or two. Now that is poor judgment from people like you.</p>

<p>I would like to include the following comments for discussion at the <strong>Research Subcommittee Recommendations</strong>, Points 7 and 12.</p>
<p>I'm very concern about <strong>point 7</strong>, specifically sub-points (A &amp; B), recommending HHS use existing authority to reduce drug development and taking immediate steps by HHS to go after patents and intellectual property. If the goal of this committee is to spur innovation and drug development then why attack businesses incentive to invest in the disease? If this point is passed, it may have a chilling effect for small pharmaceutical and private research organizations who's members demand a "return on investment".</p>
<p>And again for <strong>Point 12</strong>, the aspect of industry being made to share intellectual property because this committee votes on a process or mechanism to side step inventors patent rights or industries trade secrets will again send a chilling signal to the investment community by making investors think twice about investing in Alzheimer's Disease research and thereby creating the opposite effect this committee is trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>Overall, this committee needs to be pragmatic in the understanding that a cure will be discovered when a group of factors is satisfied not because of a lofty marketing idea of a cure by 2020. These factorsinclude, advancement in medical technology, better understanding of human genetics, and overall better medical training.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's News 4/11/2012</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association commends recognition of Alzheimer's and dementia as global health threat</strong></p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association strongly supports the call to action in the newly released World Health Organization (WHO) report <em>Dementia: A Public Health Priority</em>, which asks for all nations to develop and implement a national Alzheimer's plan, conduct greater efforts in early detection and diagnosis, and increase support of Alzheimer's disease research.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association is pleased that the WHO, in partnership with Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI), has released its first-ever major report on Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Alzheimer's and dementia affects more than <strong>35 million people worldwide today</strong>, and the report reveals the astonishing fact that today someone in the world <strong>develops dementia every 4 seconds</strong>; by the <strong>middle of the century more than 115 million people</strong> will be affected by the disease.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the comprehensive report will serve to elevate much-needed international attention to the grave health threat Alzheimer's and dementia pose to the global community today and in the years ahead.</p>
<p>"The World Health Organization lending its powerful voice and support to elevating awareness and understanding about Alzheimer's and dementia is very significant," said Harry Johns, Alzheimer's Association president and CEO. "It underscores the organization's recognition that Alzheimer's is a public health crisis requiring urgent global attention and action. These conditions will continue to be a major public health threat increasingly affecting the social and fiscal well-being of the global community until a concerted international effort is launched to combat it."</p>
<p>Already, the global cost of <strong>Alzheimer's and dementia consumes one percent of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</strong>, according to an ADI report. In the United States, the direct costs of Alzheimer's disease to American society will escalate from an estimated $200 billion this year to $1.1 trillion in 2050, largely due to baby boomers at increased risk for developing the disease as they age. In addition to the $200 billion dollars in care costs largely borne by government programs, Medicare and Medicaid, more than 15 million family members and friends provide unpaid care valued at $210 billion.</p>
<p>The new report urges countries to take a public health approach to addressing the Alzheimer's and dementia crisis while developing and strengthening policies that improve the quality of life for those living with Alzheimer's. Other goals included strong surveillance systems that allow for earlier detection of dementia and a stronger commitment to support scientific research that could one day lead to effective treatments that could stem the crisis.</p>
<p>The report discusses efforts in countries throughout the world to develop national plans, including highlighting the steps that the Alzheimer's Association took to mobilize advocates to urge passage and enactment of the National Alzheimer's Project Act. This legislation authorized the process currently underway in the United States to create this country's first national Alzheimer's plan. The Alzheimer's Association continues to work closely with U.S. leaders to shape a strong national plan, which will hopefully serve as a model for other countries. Fourteen countries, including France, Australia, Northern Ireland and Japan, currently have national Alzheimer's/dementia plans.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association has long recognized the international impact of Alzheimer's and other dementias and has made significant contributions globally toward the goal of a "world without Alzheimer's." As the world's leading Alzheimer's nonprofit, the Alzheimer's Association provides premier global forums for the greatest minds in Alzheimer's science to collaborate, connect across disciplines, address common challenges and share new discoveries. This is most notably demonstrated through the Alzheimer's Association International Conference, the largest gathering of Alzheimer's scientists and researchers annually. This year's conference will take place on July 14-19 in Vancouver and is expected to be attended by nearly 5,000 of the world's foremost Alzheimer's researchers.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association International Grants Program has been instrumental in advancing the scientific enterprise and shaping the ever evolving Alzheimer's landscape. The Association currently fund grants in 24 countries across the spectrum of Alzheimer's research from molecular biology to medical systems investigations and has awarded grants in excess of $292 million to more than 2,000 projects. In March, the Alzheimer's Association awarded its largest ever research grant -- nearly $4.2 million dollars over four years -- to the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network-Therapeutic Trials Unit (DIAN-TTU), based at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, to enable the program to move forward more quickly with innovative drug and biomarker trials in people with genetically-based, young-onset Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>"The Alzheimer's Association applauds the leadership of both the WHO and ADI in their efforts to elevate global attention to Alzheimer's and dementia. It signals an understanding that the knowledge, insights and resources of all nations must be leveraged to confront the daunting public health threat of Alzheimer's and dementia," said Johns. "The Association remains committed to working with these organizations, other international bodies and countries throughout the world to illuminate the human and economic toll of the disease until the vision of a world without Alzheimer's is realized."</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association </strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer care, support and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health. Our vision is a world without Alzheimer's. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.alz.org">http://www.alz.org</a>.</p>

<p>Although the official comment period has closed for the NAPA draft plan, I'm writing today to urge you to go bolder with the final plan to be released by HHS later this month.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is a cruel disease. It slowly steals one's intellect, ability to communicate, independence, and dignity, even control over basic bodily functions like eating and caring for personal hygiene. It also places an overwhelming burden on caregivers -- emotionally, physically, and financially.</p>
<p>The commitment to a 2025 deadline in the draft NAPA plan represents a major step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's. I am pleased that the plan recognizes the need for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, compressing the drug development process, accelerating targeted research, and better coordinating activities with other countries.</p>
<p>However, I am one of many concerned Alzheimer's advocates who believe that this first draft fails to present a strategy aggressive enough to achieve the goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's within 13 years. It lacks specificity in terms of timelines and deadlines, provides no path to providing significantly greater resources, and does not hold a single high-level office or individual accountable for the overall plan.</p>
<p>I hope that HHS will address these issues so that the next version of the plan will be bolder.</p>
<p>With the number of Alzheimer's patients expected to triple in the coming decades, we must embrace a plan that eschews a "business-as-usual" approach and tackles Alzheimer's with the urgency and aggressiveness it requires. If not, we stand to lose millions more lives -- and trillions of dollars -- to this disease.</p>
<p>There now appears to be evidence that Alzheimer's is related in part to silver filling i.e. mercury. Please see below reference; <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/04/07/dangers-of-mercury-contamination.aspx?e_cid=20120407_DNL_art_1">http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/04/07/dangers-of-mercury-contamination.aspx?e_cid=20120407_DNL_art_1</a></p>
<p>Story at-a-glance</p>
<p><em>Studies show that mercury is the MOST toxic heavy metal to your body; this excellent new documentary film, Mercury Undercover, exposes the dangers of mercury contamination to human health and to the environment</em></p>
<p><em>The number one source of mercury pollution is coal-fired power plants. Second position is held by dental practices due to amalgam fillings, which are 50 percent mercury</em></p>
<p><em>Dental amalgams, used for more than 150 years, continue to be used by half of the dentists in North America despite a mountain of evidence they slowly leak toxic mercury into your body, and are particularly dangerous for children and pregnant women</em></p>
<p><em>Mercury becomes a "biochemical train wreck in your body," causing your cell membranes to leak, and inhibit key enzymes your body needs for energy production and removal of toxins. Mercury toxicity can lead to major inflammation and chronic illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease</em></p>
<p><em>The FDA, in partnership with the ADA, have been successful for many years in concealing the dangers of amalgam from the public, but organizations such as the Consumers for Dental Choice are making inroads toward getting mercury banned from dentistry worldwide--but they need your help</em></p>
<p><em>By Dr. Mercola</em></p>
<p>I strongly encourage you to watch the new documentary film Mercury Undercover, which exposes just how far those in power will go to prevent you from learning the truth about mercury contamination from dental amalgam--all in the name of money.</p>
<p>Dental amalgam is a primitive, pre-Civil War product that is 50 percent mercury, still commonly used in dental fillings.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE UNDATED DRAFT<br />
					NATIONAL PLAN TO ADDRESS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>March 31, 2012</strong></p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p>The comments presented in this paper are based on my experience as the primary care giver for someone with Alzheimer's dementia and on a book that I read as part of my research on Alzheimer's dementia. The book is titled <em>The Myth of Alzheimer's Disease</em> by Dr. Peter Whitehouse, a leading researcher in Alzheimer's disease for over 30 years.</p>
<p>Eight years ago at age 60, my wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Dementia (AD). She lived at home for four and a half years, and has lived in an assisted living facility for the past three years and nine months. She has had three different kinds of brain scans (CAT, MRI, and PET), been evaluated for vitamin B-12 deficiency, been evaluated for "water on the brain", been evaluated at the University of Virginia and John Hopkins University, seen four different neurologists, and has taken both of the medications typical given to people with AD all to no avail. I concluded several years ago that the only thing left was to ensure that she is taken care of. Not only to pay for the care but to participate in it, which I do on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Dr. Whitehouse's book summarizes most of the experiences that I have been through in the last eight years and confirms my conclusion about care for my wife. In my view, everyone who has a loved one diagnosed with AD should read this book. I also believe that Dr. Whitehouse should be considered for inclusion on the Advisory Council established by the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA).</p>
<p>The last part of this paper contains a brief discussion of a grant program through which funding could be provided for the care of people with AD.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL COMMENT </strong></p>
<p>I agree with the goals in the draft plan. I do not agree, however, with the distribution of funding for the goals. Of the $156 million dollars included in the draft plan, $130 million (83 percent) are allocated for research. Only $26 million are allocated for care. In my view, the funds for research and care should be reversed. At some point, everyone with either AD or another type of dementia is going to need care. That is where most of the federal funds and private funds should be spent.</p>
<p>The final plan should include more details for each of the goals. This includes the office responsible for each strategy and the tentative completion date, funds, and expected outcomes or products for each strategy. Without the details, there is no way to tract the progress on each strategy. The plan also should indicate who will provide oversight for each strategy.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIFIC COMMENTS </strong></p>
<p>1. Care</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I concluded several years ago that the only thing that I can do for my wife is to see that she is taken care of. For this reason, I believe that the first goal on Page 6 of the national plan should address care and that care should be the major theme throughout the plan.</p>
<p>I am not recommending that no research be done on AD. Certainly, research should continue on AD, but not at the funding distribution in the draft plan (i.e., 83 percent of the total amount in the draft plan). In my view, the only way to find a cure for AD is to find a cure for the aging process. This is highly unlikely.</p>
<p>2. Use of the Word "Disease"</p>
<p>In his book, Dr. Whitehouse concludes that Alzheimer's is not disease. It is aging of the brain that can be caused by a number of factors (e.g., stroke, lifestyle, injury, or environmental exposure). Because it is not a disease, there is no cure for AD.</p>
<p>I recommend that the work "disease" no longer be used to describe Alzheimer's dementia . Use of the word stigmatizes the person with AD often resulting in depression, loss of friends, and lack of understanding on what is really occurring. Even though the end result is the same (all persons with AD and other dementias need care), calling the condition what it really is (i.e., dementia) is a better approach for dealing with the condition. In his book, Dr. Whitehouse described an approach whereby the patient and the patient's family are told that the patient has dementia and then given help through a team approach. The team consists of the doctor, a dietitian who helps the patient improve their diet, a physical therapist who works with the patient to increase their physical activity, and a social worker who emphasizes the importance of staying connected both mentally and socially. Use of the team approach is more compassionate then just telling the patient they have Alzheimer's disease, and to take Aricept and come back for another doctor's visit in six months, which is what happened to my wife. Using the word "disease" to describe AD implies there is a cure for AD. This gives the patient and the patient's family false hope because, as previously mentioned, I do not believe there is a cure for AD.</p>
<p>3. Ethnic and Racial Minority Populations</p>
<p>During the eight years that I have had direct involvement with AD, I have never read anything or had any experiences that indicate ethnic and racial minority populations have higher cases of AD than the general population. Unless there is compelling evidence that those populations do experience disproportionate cases of AD, I recommend that this issue not be emphasized in the national plan. In my view, it is more important to spend funds on the care of all people with AD.</p>
<p>4. Assisted Living Facilities</p>
<p>The draft plan fails to recognize that a viable option for people with AD is care in a secure area at an assisted living facility. My wife has been cared for in such facility for three years and nine months, and I expect her to continue to be cared for in an assisted living facility for many more years (she is very healthy except for AD).</p>
<p>An issue related to caring for a person with AD in an assisted living facility is cost. Funds are not available from either Medicare or Medicaid for people who receive care in an assisted living facility. In my view, there is no difference between care of a person with AD in a nursing home and care of such a person in a secure area of an assisted living facility. This disparity needs to be addressed. An example of the cost of care in an assisted living facility is the $75,600 annual fee for my wife plus the cost of incontinence supplies and medications. At present, my long term care insurance pays for part of these costs and I pay the remaining part. When my long term care insurance expires, I will have to pay the total costs.</p>
<p>5. Strategy 2.A</p>
<p>Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and emergency room personnel should be included in the healthcare providers who receive education in AD. In my experience, general physicians also need to be educated about AD. All too often, they just want to prescribe a medication. For example, seroquel often is prescribed for people with AD. Every article that I read on seroquel said that it is not recommended for people with dementia. When I told the doctor that, he said they give it to people with AD anyway.</p>
<p>6. Action 2.A.4</p>
<p>The training discussed in this action should be made available to all direct-care workers and not just workers in nursing homes. In particular, direct-care workers in assisted living facilities and those who provide home care should receive this training.</p>
<p>7. Action 2.B.2</p>
<p>My wife was diagnosed with AD through a process of elimination. In her first visit to a neurologist, she could not pass some simple tests. At later appointments, those same tests were given to her with worst results that the results of the earlier tests. Eventually, the neurologist concluded she had AD. In my view, this process is most likely the only way to diagnose AD.</p>
<p>8. Action 2.E.2</p>
<p>In my experience, the cost of home care for a person with AD is not that much less than the cost of care in an assisted living facility. In addition, home care is much more difficulty for the primary care giver even with the help of direct-care personnel who come to the home. In too many cases, the primary care giver is the one who suffers the most when care is provided in the home.</p>
<p>9. Strategy 2.H</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I have not seen that racial and ethnic minorities are affected disproportionally by AD. All people with AD need care no matter what their race or ethic group. The available resources should be spent on improving care for all AD patients instead of focusing on any racial or ethnic group.</p>
<p>10. Action 3.D.1</p>
<p>It is extremely important that primary care givers understand the legal documents a person with AD should have. These include a general power of attorney, a medical power of attorney, a will, and, where appropriate, a trust. Also, the primary care giver should ensure their name is on the appropriate bank accounts. The importance of these documents should be stressed in the plan.</p>
<p>11. Goal 5</p>
<p>I agree that it is important to track progress on all of the strategies in the plan. As part of that effort, oversight on all strategies and actions must be provided. Without oversight, there is no way to assess progress.</p>
<p><strong>CARE PROPOSAL </strong></p>
<p>Throughout the above comments I have emphasized the importance of care for people with AD. To provide quality care, funding is required. One way to provide that funding is through a grant program.</p>
<p>To help defray the cost of care for people with AD, a grant could be provided to nursing homes, assisted living facilities, home heath care companies, and, potentially, to individuals. Such a program could be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services or funds could be provided to a state and they could administer the program. To receive a grant, specific requirements would have to be met. In addition, oversight would have to provided to ensure that the grants funds are spent properly.</p>
<ul><li>Grant funds could be used to.</li>
<li>Develop standards of the care of AD patients.</li>
<li>Develop design standards for new facilities or modifications to existing facilities where care for people with AD is provided.</li>
<li>Construct new facilities or modifications to existing facilities where care for people with AD is provided.</li>
<li>Train direct-care workers</li>
<li>Provide funds to increase the pay of direct-care workers. . " Provide funds to defray the costs that family members have to pay for care.</li>
<li>Provide funds for the oversight of the grant requirements and to ensure quality care is provided.</li>
</ul><p>To receive a grant, an entity would have to submit an application to the agency who administers the grant program. The application would have to contain detailed information about on the facility and the care they provide.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. We at <em>FasterCures</em> have been observing with great interest the development of this agenda for some time and were significantly engaged in providing feedback on its precursor, the plan of the Alzheimer's Study Group.</p>
<p><em>FasterCures'</em> mission is to improve the medical research system irrespective of disease area, to speed up the time it takes to get important new medicines from discovery to patients. As a result, our concerns often relate to the importance of tackling problems with the research <strong>process</strong> as well as the science. While we might wish that the language in the Plan were a little bit stronger and more direct on this score, we are pleased that many of the process issues we care about and raised with the Alzheimer's Study Group are reflected in it, including:</p>
<ul><li>Promoting a more outcomes-oriented approach to research, particularly translation and drug development. (The Plan does not, however, offer specific ideas about the changes necessary for this to happen -- e.g. how might this impact the traditional investigator-initiated model of grantmaking by the NIH?)</li>
<li>Mapping the landscape of current Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, not just within federal agencies but by all players;</li>
<li>Identifying priority areas for research investment;</li>
<li>Encouraging and facilitating collaboration among sectors; and</li>
<li>Building patient awareness of and participation in research.</li>
</ul><p>There are other issues we see as critical to progress toward new treatments that we do not believe are adequately reflected in the Plan, including:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Creating shared resources available to AD researchers</strong>. There are occasional references to this subject in a number of places in the plan, but we believe it should be an important focus. Any inventory of AD research investments should explicitly include resources such as databases, electronic health records collections, and tissue banks that already exist and should be shared, and any effort to identify research priorities should explicitly include new shared resources that need to be created.</li>
<li><strong>Engaging regulators in strategizing about how to accelerate approval</strong>. Again, the plan does mention FDA on occasion, but in our view there is not enough emphasis on the importance of this. Approval of new therapies can be significantly accelerated if regulators can be involved in discussions about clinical trials at early stages, so that time is not lost at the end of the process having to go back to the drawing board. The Foundation for the NIH's Biomarker's Consortium is an excellent example of the utility of involving FDA at the earliest stages of research.</li>
<li><strong>Making sure that all existing federal efforts (not just those already specifically targeted at AD) are applying themselves to the challenges faced by AD</strong>. For example, the new National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at NIH, the FDA's focus on improving regulatory science at the agency, and the efforts of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT at HHS to accelerate the adoption of electronic health records and information exchange. These are significant efforts by the federal government that will have an impact on the research environment and should reflect the priority the federal government is placing on AD.</li>
<li><strong>Examining the pipeline of clinical researchers in AD</strong>. There is appropriate emphasis in the Plan on training of providers and caregivers, but not on the future research corps. AD already suffers from a shortage of clinicians trained in the complex care of elderly patients, and the shortage of clinical researchers in this area is probably even more dire. Attention should be paid to the recruitment and training of researchers capable of working in this field.</li>
</ul><p>Thank you once again for the opportunity to comment on what we believe is a strong draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. We are happy to discuss our views further with HHS or the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services at any time.</p>
