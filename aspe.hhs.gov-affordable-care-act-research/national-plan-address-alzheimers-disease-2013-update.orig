<h3 style="text-align:center">Vision Statement</h3>
<p>For millions of Americans, the heartbreak of watching a loved one struggle with Alzheimer's disease is a pain they know all too well. Alzheimer's disease burdens an increasing number of our Nation's elders and their families, and it is essential that we confront the challenge it poses to our public health.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in">-- President Barack Obama</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style="text-align:center">National Alzheimer's Project Act</h3>
<p>On January 4, 2011, President Barack Obama signed into law the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA), requiring the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish the National Alzheimer's Project to:</p>
<ul><li>Create and maintain an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Coordinate Alzheimer's disease research and services across all federal agencies.</li>
<li>Accelerate the development of treatments that would prevent, halt, or reverse the course of Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Improve early diagnosis and coordination of care and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Improve outcomes for ethnic and racial minority populations that are at higher risk for Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Coordinate with international bodies to fight Alzheimer's globally.
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The law also establishes the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services (Advisory Council) and requires the Secretary of HHS, in collaboration with the Advisory Council, to create and maintain a national plan to overcome Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p>
<p>NAPA offers a historic opportunity to address the many challenges facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Given the great demographic shifts that will occur over the next 30 years, including the doubling of the population of older adults, the success of this effort is of great importance to people with AD and their family members, public policy makers, and health and social service providers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Progress in the Fight Against Alzheimer's Disease</h3>
<p>The first National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease was released on May 15, 2012, following the Obama Administration's investment in Alzheimer's research, provider education, and awareness in February 2012. Some of the accomplishments since then are described below. Additional details are in the descriptions of actions that have been completed.</p>
<p>In May 2012, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and HHS convened the <em>Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit 2012: Path to Treatment and Prevention</em> to bring together national and international researchers and advocacy groups to develop recommendations on how to best advance Alzheimer's research. The Summit recommendations, which are designed to capitalize on current scientific opportunities, will inform Alzheimer's research for years to come. [<a href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/announcements/2012/05/alzheimers-research-summit-may-14-15-2012">http://www.nia.nih.gov/announcements/2012/05/alzheimers-research-summit-may-14-15-2012</a>]</p>
<p>In 2012, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) in partnership with the Alzheimer's Association launched the <strong>International Alzheimer's Disease Research Portfolio</strong> (IADRP) database. This web-based portal houses the AD research portfolios of federal and non-federal funding agencies in the United States and abroad classified using a common AD research ontology (CADRO). IADRP is a resource that will give the public a full picture of the scale of ongoing research on AD and enable funders of Alzheimer's research to coordinate planning, leverage resources, avoid duplication, and identify new opportunities for collaboration.</p>
<p>With the Administration's investment of $50 million in 2012 for Alzheimer's disease research, NIH supported five new research projects in key areas of need and opportunity:</p>
<ul><li>Whole genome sequencing to identify new genetic variants that either increase risk (risk factors) or reduce risk (protective factors) for AD.</li>
<li>A treatment trial to test the effectiveness of intranasal insulin in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer's dementia on cognition and daily functioning.</li>
<li>A trial to test the ability of an antibody called crenezumab to bind to and clear away abnormal amounts of amyloid protein in the brain and prevent cognitive decline in people with early-onset AD. Crenezumab is being tested among members of a unique and large family population in Colombia sharing a genetic mutation known to cause observable signs of AD at around age 45 along with a smaller number of participants ages 30 and older in the United States.</li>
<li>Use of new induced pluripotent stem cell methods to obtain insights into the cellular processes of Alzheimer's.</li>
<li>Support to the "Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Neurocognitive Study" (ARIC-NCS) focused on prediction of cognitive impairment from mid-life vascular risk factors and markers.
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Meanwhile, ongoing research has led to exciting discoveries. For example, a number of risk-conferring genes for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of the disorder, have been confirmed. Most recently, in November 2012, two international teams of scientists, with NIH support, identified a rare variation of the TREM2 gene as a moderate risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's. TREM2 is involved in inflammation and immune response. This finding may offer a target for interventions.</p>
<p>In addition, NIH-supported research by two groups of scientists showed that tau spreads from one brain region to the next by moving across synapses. The researchers used mouse models that express tau protein, a hallmark of the disease. As the mice aged, the mutant tau gradually spread across the connected brain regions. These findings demonstrate one mechanism by which Alzheimer's pathology can spread and offer new targets for therapies. For more information on scientific discoveries, see the <strong>2011-2012 Alzheimer's Disease Progress Report</strong> [<a href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/publication/2011-2012-alzheimers-disease-progress-report">http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/publication/2011-2012-alzheimers-disease-progress-report</a>].</p>
<p>A number of efforts have also helped improve the quality of care received by people with AD. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) issued grants totaling $2 million to its network of Geriatric Education Centers (GECs) to enhance the ability of the health care workforce to meet the needs of people with AD. Over 10,000 providers, including physicians, nurses, and direct care workers received training on topics such as dementia diagnosis and treatment and effective behavior management for persons with dementing diseases and their caregivers.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and NIH worked together to identify a set of brief tools that physicians can use to assess cognitive impairment. These tools all require 5 minutes or less to administer, are available free of charge with simple access, and have been validated within the last 12 years among the older adult population in the United States. These tools will be available for providers to use to assess cognitive impairment during the Annual Wellness Visit covered by Medicare.</p>
<p>The CMS Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center) is testing innovative payment and service delivery models relevant to people with Alzheimer's disease, including the <em>Health Care Innovation Awards</em>. In the first round, CMS awarded funds to 107 projects, several of which aim to identify how to improve care for people with AD. For example, Indiana University's "Dissemination of the Aging Brain Care Program" is working to improve care for Medicare beneficiaries with dementia or late-life depression. The model is providing individualized and integrated care through a multidisciplinary care team; developing patient-specific care plans, delivering evidence-based protocols, and responding to real-time monitoring and feedback. Another project, "UCLA Alzheimer's and Dementia Care: Comprehensive, Coordinated, Patient-Centered," is providing coordinated, comprehensive, patient and family-centered, and efficient care for approximately 1,000 Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. The model is training providers, expanding a dementia registry, conducting patient needs assessments, and creating individualized dementia care plans.</p>
<p>In May 2013, the Innovation Center announced a second round of <em>Health Care Innovation Awards</em>, specifically soliciting proposals in four specific categories of care. One of the four categories, "improve care for populations with specialized needs," designates proposals that target care for persons with AD as a priority population for funding. The Innovation Center expects to make awards for this second round by the beginning of 2014. Other relevant models may include the "Multi-payer Advanced Primary Care Practice Demonstration," the "Comprehensive Primary Care" initiative, and the "Independence at Home Demonstration." Participants in each of the models share key learning experiences during the testing or performance period with the objective of accelerating dissemination of promising practices within the model, such as improved care plans for people with AD.</p>
<p>HHS convened a Specific Populations Task Force to identify the unique challenges faced by groups unequally burdened by Alzheimer's disease: racial and ethnic minorities, people with intellectual disabilities, and people with young onset AD. The Task Force collected information from over 40 organizations and reviewed hundreds of comments. Some of the challenges identified by the Task Force are addressed by actions described in this 2013 Update.</p>
<p>NIH hosted a meeting in April 2013 to advance a research agenda aimed at developing successful interventions to address Alzheimer's disease for people with Down syndrome. Representatives from academia, industry, federal agencies and private foundations explored how current research activities and resources could create new opportunities to develop therapeutics. Recommendations and a summary of the meeting will be published online.</p>
<p>CMS has taken important steps to ensure that people with dementia are not inappropriately receiving antipsychotic medications to manage their behavior in nursing homes.CMS and public and private partners have made major presentations to national, state, and local groups, educated providers, and completed 200 nursing home case studies focused on how decisions are made to use antipsychotic medication. CMS developed two training videos for survey staff. CMS also developed two quality measures and will be analyzing data to track progress toward the goal of reducing antipsychotic drug usage by 15 percent.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2012, the Administration for Community Living/Administration on Aging (ACL/AoA) partnered with the Alliance for Aging Research, with funding from the MetLife Foundation, to review the state of the art of non-pharmacological treatments and care practices for people with Alzheimer's or other dementias and their family caregivers. A white paper was produced to summarize the review titled <strong>Translating Innovation to Impact: Evidence-Based Interventions to Support People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Caregivers at Home and in Their Communities</strong> [<a href="http://www.aoa.gov/AoARoot/AoA_Programs/HPW/Alz_Grants/index.aspx">http://www.aoa.gov/AoARoot/AoA_Programs/HPW/Alz_Grants/index.aspx</a>].</p>
<p>In partnership with the National Family Caregiver Alliance, ACL/AoA published <strong>Selected Caregiver Assessment Measures (2nd Edition): A Resource Inventory for Practitioners</strong> [<a href="http://caregiver.org/caregiver/jsp/content/pdfs/SelCGAssmtMeas_ResInv_FINAL_12.10.12.pdf">http://caregiver.org/caregiver/jsp/content/pdfs/SelCGAssmtMeas_ResInv_FINAL_12.10.12.pdf</a>]. This resource provides a compendium of caregiver assessment measures that providers can use to help identify the caregiver's needs and build upon their strengths to create a care plan that addresses the individualized needs of the care recipient and the caregiver.</p>
<p>In order to enhance public awareness of Alzheimer's disease and link caregivers and people with a diagnosis to the resources they need, HHS launched <a href="http://www.alzheimers.gov/">http://www.alzheimers.gov/</a> and fielded an awareness campaign. The campaign included a commercial shown during evening news and daytime television, print advertisements, and web advertisements. There were over 200,000 visits to Alzheimers.gov in the first 10 months. The 30-second commercial won a Silver Addy Award from the <em>2013 American Advertising Awards</em> in DC.</p>
<p>NIA joined forces with ACL to create "Connecting to Combat Alzheimer's," a series of free webinars and presentations that served to connect both the research and aging services communities. Sparked by the goals set forth by NAPA, the highly successful effort involved the ACL/AoA Aging Services Network, which annually reaches over 10 million older people and family caregivers, and researchers at the NIH-funded network of Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADCs). The program received the <em>HHSinnovates Award</em> and received a second honor as the People's Choice among projects highlighted.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collaborated with the Alzheimer's Association and many partners to develop the second in a series of Road Maps to advance cognitive health as a vital, integral component of public health. <strong>The Healthy Brain Initiative: The Public Health Road Map for State and National Partnerships, 2013-2018</strong> outlines how state and local public health agencies and their partners can promote cognitive functioning, address cognitive impairment for individuals living in the community, and help meet the needs of care partners. Over 200 stakeholders from private, non-profit and governmental agencies were involved in the development of the Road Map, which is scheduled to be released in July 2013. Leadership Committee members included representation from NIA, ACL/AoA and CDC as well as national, state and local partners.</p>
<p>HHS is committed to tracking the progress of the National Plan. A detailed timeline with steps for each of the new actions is available in <a href="#append3">Appendix 3</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style="text-align:center">2013 Update</h3>
<p>This is the 2013 Update to the National Plan. Like the original, this update includes recommendations for priority actions. The activities outlined in this plan vary in scope and impact and include: (1) immediate actions that the Federal Government will take; (2) actions toward the goals that can be initiated by the Federal Government or its public and private partners in the near term; and (3) longer-range activities that will require numerous actions to achieve. This is a National Plan and not a federal plan. Active engagement of public and private sector stakeholders are needed to achieve the goals. In the case of many of the long-range activities, the path forward will be contingent on resources, scientific progress, and focused collaborations across many partners. Over time, HHS will work with the Advisory Council and stakeholders to incorporate additional transformative actions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Alzheimer's Disease</h3>
<p>Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disease that affects as many as 5.1 million Americans.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> It slowly destroys brain function, leading to cognitive decline (e.g., memory loss, language difficulty, poor executive function), behavioral and psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression, delusions, agitation), and declines in functional status (e.g., ability to engage in activities of daily living and self-care).<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> In 1906, Dr. Alois Alzheimer first documented the disease when he identified changes in the brain tissue of a woman who had memory loss, language problems, and unpredictable behavior. Her brain tissue included abnormal clumps (amyloidal plaques) and tangled bundles of fibers (neurofibrillary tangles). Brain plaques and tangles, in addition to the loss of connections between neurons, are the main features of Alzheimer's disease.<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In this plan, the term "Alzheimer's disease," or AD, refers to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, consistent with the approach Congress used in NAPA. Related dementias include frontotemporal, Lewy body, mixed, and vascular dementia. It is often difficult to distinguish between Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in terms of clinical presentation and diagnosis. Some of the basic neurodegenerative processes have common pathways. People with dementia and their families face similar challenges in finding appropriate and necessary medical and supportive care. Unless otherwise noted, in this plan AD refers to these conditions collectively.</p>
<p>The first symptom of AD is often memory impairment. As the disease progresses, memory continues to decline, and other functions like language skills and decision making become more difficult. Personality and behavior changes may also occur. A person with the disease may no longer recognize family and friends. Eventually, the person who survives with Alzheimer's disease is completely reliant on others for assistance with even the most basic activities of daily living, such as eating.<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>In more than 90 percent of people with Alzheimer's disease, symptoms do not appear until after age 60, and the incidence of the disease increases with age. The causes of AD are not completely understood, but researchers believe they include a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.<sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup> The importance of any one of these factors in increasing or decreasing the risk of developing AD may differ from person to person. In rare cases, known as early or younger-onset AD, people develop symptoms of AD in their 30s, 40s, or 50s. A significant number of people with Down syndrome develop dementia in their 50s.</p>
<p>AD is a major public health issue and will increasingly affect the health and well-being of the population. Unless the disease can be effectively treated or prevented, the number of Americans with AD will increase significantly in the next two decades. The number of people age 65 and older in the United States is expected to grow from 40 million in 2010 to 72.1 million in 2030. The prevalence of people with AD doubles for every 5-year interval beyond age 65. The significant growth in the population over age 85 that is estimated to occur between 2010 and 2030 (from 5.5 million to 8.7 million) suggests a substantial increase in the number of people with AD.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease places enormous emotional, physical, and financial stress on individuals who have it and their family members. Informal caregivers, such as family members and friends, provide the majority of care for people with AD in the community. Informal caregivers often do not identify themselves as such; they are simply a wife, daughter, husband, son, or friend helping a person whom they care about. However, the intensive support required for a person with AD can negatively impact the caregiver's emotional and physical health and well-being. Informal caregivers often report symptoms of depression and anxiety, and have poorer health outcomes than their peers who do not provide such care.<sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Dementia care costs are significant and often a burden to families providing unpaid care. Recent estimates from one nationally representative study found that formal and informal unpaid care costs of caring for people older than age 70 with dementia in the United States in 2010 were between $159 billion and $215 billion. These costs could rise dramatically with the increase in the numbers of older adults in coming decades. Care costs per person with dementia in 2010 ranged from $41,000 to $56,000 depending on how informal care costs were estimated. These national dementia care costs are comparable to, if not greater than, those for heart disease and cancer.<sup><a href="#ref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Caring for people with Alzheimer's disease also strains health and long-term care systems. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease use a disproportionate amount of health care resources; for instance, they are hospitalized 2-3 times as often as people the same age who do not have the disease.<sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup> Similarly, while people living in nursing homes are a small percentage of the older population, nearly half (48 percent) of nursing home residents have Alzheimer's disease.<sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup> As the number of people with AD grows over the next two decades, this disease will place a major strain on these care systems as well as on Medicare and Medicaid, the major funders of this care.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style="text-align:center">The Challenges</h3>
<p>This National Plan is designed to address the major challenges presented by Alzheimer's disease:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>While research on AD has made steady progress, there are no pharmacological or other interventions to definitively prevent, treat, or cure the disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While HHS and other groups have taken steps to develop quality measures to assess Alzheimer's care and to improve the training of the health and long-term care workforce, there is room for improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family members and other informal caregivers, who take on the responsibility of caring for a loved one with AD, need support. The majority of people with AD live in the community, where their families provide most of their care. The toll of caregiving can have major implications for caregivers and families as well as population health, with about one-third of caregivers reporting symptoms of depression.<sup><a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stigmas and misconceptions associated with AD are widespread and profoundly impact the care provided to and the isolation felt by people with AD and their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public and private sector progress is significant but should be coordinated and tracked. In addition, data to track the incidence, prevalence, trajectory and costs of AD are limited.</p>
</li>
</ol><p> </p>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Framework and Guiding Principles</h3>
<p>The enactment of NAPA creates an opportunity to focus the Nation's attention on the challenges of AD. In consultation with stakeholders both inside and outside of the Federal Government, this National Plan represents the initial blueprint for achieving the vision of a Nation free of AD.</p>
<p>Central to and guiding the National Plan are the people most intimately impacted by Alzheimer's disease -- those who have the disease and their families and other caregivers. Individuals with AD and their caregivers receive assistance from both the clinical health care system and support systems such as long-term care, home care, legal services, and other social services. Both the clinical care and support environments need better tools to serve people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers. Ongoing and future research seeks to identify interventions to assist clinicians, supportive service providers, persons with AD, and caregivers. All of these efforts must occur in the context of improved awareness of the disease and its impacts and the opportunities for improvement. The National Plan aims to address these key needs. HHS is committed to tracking and coordinating the implementation of NAPA and making improvements aimed at achieving its ambitious vision.</p>
<p>The plan is also guided by three principles:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong><em>Optimize existing resources and improve and coordinate ongoing activities</em></strong>. The first step in developing the National Plan was to set up a federal interagency working group and conduct an inventory of all federal activities involving AD [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/NatlPlan.shtml#append3">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/NatlPlan.shtml#append3</a>]. In creating the plan, HHS and its partners sought to leverage these resources and activities, improve coordination, and reduce duplication of efforts to better meet the challenges of Alzheimer's disease. The activities included in the inventory comprise ongoing work and new opportunities created by the Affordable Care Act. The federal working group process has already led to improved coordination and awareness throughout the Federal Government and set in motion commitments for further collaboration. Further, this process has allowed for identification of non-AD-specific programs and resources that may be leveraged to advance AD care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Support public-private partnerships</em></strong>. The scope of the problem of Alzheimer's disease is so great that partnerships with a multitude of stakeholders will be essential to making progress. This National Plan begins the partnership process by identifying areas of need and opportunity. The plan relies on the Advisory Council in particular to identify key areas where public-private partnerships can improve outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Transform the way we approach Alzheimer's disease</em></strong>. The National Plan represents a first step in an undertaking that will require large-scale, coordinated efforts across the public and private sectors. With principles 1 and 2 above, as well as the ambitious vision that the Federal Government is committing to through this National Plan, HHS and its federal partners seek to take the first of many transformative actions that will be needed to address this disease. Through an ongoing dialogue with the Advisory Council, the Federal Government will identify the most promising areas for progress and marshal resources from both within and outside the government to act on these opportunities.</p>

<h2><a name="goal1" id="goal1">Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</a></h2>
<p>Research continues to expand our understanding of the causes of, treatments for, and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. This goal seeks to develop effective prevention and treatment modalities by 2025. Ongoing research and clinical inquiry can inform our ability to delay onset of Alzheimer's disease, minimize its symptoms, and delay its progression. Under this goal, HHS will prioritize and accelerate the pace of scientific research and ensure that as evidence-based solutions are identified they are quickly translated, put into practice, and brought to scale so that individuals with Alzheimer's disease can benefit from increases in scientific knowledge. HHS will identify interim milestones and set ambitious deadlines for achieving these milestones in order to meet this goal.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center"><a name="strategy1.A" id="strategy1.A">Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</a></h3>
<p>Research agencies undertake research planning processes on an ongoing basis, but a special effort is needed to identify the priorities and milestones to achieve <a href="#goal1">Goal 1</a>. The actions below will identify the priorities, establish milestones, and ensure that appropriate stakeholders are involved in the planning process aimed at minimizing Alzheimer's disease as a health burden by 2025. During the course of this work, NIH will develop research priorities, and a plan for implementing each phase of research in a coordinated manner. Coordination will occur across NIH Institutes and other federal research agencies and with the private sector, as appropriate.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><a name="strategy1.B" id="strategy1.B">Strategy 1.B: Expand Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease</a></h3>
<p>HHS and its federal partners will expand clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease and manage and treat its symptoms. The Federal Government will address the challenge of enrolling enough people in clinical trials who are representative of the country's population, including ethnic and racial populations that are at higher risk for AD, through new partnerships and outreach. These actions will build on ongoing research focused on the identification of genetic, molecular and cellular targets for interventions and build on recent advances in the field.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action1.B.1" id="action1.B.1">Action 1.B.1</a>: Expand research to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, and translate this information into potential targets for intervention</strong></p>
<p>Incomplete understanding of the disease mechanisms that lead to AD is a major barrier to the discovery of effective therapies. An integrated interdisciplinary basic science research agenda will continue to advance our understanding of the molecular, cellular, and tissue level mechanisms and networks involved in the AD disease process to enable the identification and selection of therapeutic targets.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action1.B.2" id="action1.B.2">Action 1.B.2</a>: Expand genetic epidemiologic research to identify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease</strong></p>
<p>NIH will undertake a new initiative to conduct whole genome sequencing to identify areas of genetic variation that correspond to increased risk (risk factors) or decreased risk (protective factors) of AD. This research is expected to yield novel targets for drug development, provide improved diagnostics for screening and disease monitoring, and ultimately help define strategies for disease prevention.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action1.B.3" id="action1.B.3">Action 1.B.3</a>: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong></p>
<p>Increased enrollment in clinical trials is crucial for the development of better treatments and ultimately a cure for AD. Participating in clinical trials and other research enables volunteers to access the latest experimental approaches available and provides them with care by clinical research staff. HHS will consult with representatives from across the Federal Government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to plan approaches and coordinate and implement action steps for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the use of existing or planned registries.</p>
<p>As part of this effort, HHS will continue to expand awareness of clinical trial opportunities among providers of long-term services and supports and health care providers so that they may inform interested people about these opportunities. NIA and ACL will create an action plan to enhance collaboration between researchers at NIA-funded ADCs and the ACL-funded aging network to improve mutual referrals and increase awareness of research opportunities among people with dementia, older adults and family caregivers receiving supportive and other services.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action1.B.4" id="action1.B.4">Action 1.B.4</a>: Monitor and identify strategies to increase enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies</strong></p>
<p>NIH will monitor enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in NIH Alzheimer's disease studies and work with other research funders to do the same. NIH will use this information to identify next steps for engaging and enhancing research participation by racial and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>NIH will continue to solicit input in a variety of forums on how to most effectively recruit and include minorities in research on Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p>HHS will inform service providers about the need to enroll more racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease research studies. NIA and ACL will collaborate to offer webinars with representatives from the aging network, service providers, ADCs, Quality Improvement Organizations, and other federal partners to raise awareness of the need for participation of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies.

<p> </p>
<h3 style="text-align:center"><a name="strategy1.C" id="strategy1.C">Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h3>
<p>Significant advances in the use of imaging and biomarkers in brain, blood, and spinal fluid have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease and track its progression, with the hope that it will be possible to monitor the effect of treatment in people with the disease. Without these advances, these neurodegenerative processes could only be evaluated in non-living tissues. Accelerated research will improve and expand the application of biomarkers in research and practice. These advances have shown that the brain changes that lead to Alzheimer's disease begin up to 10 years before symptoms.<sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup> Identifying imaging and other biomarkers in presymptomatic people will facilitate earlier diagnoses in clinical settings, as well as aid in the development of more efficient interventions to slow or delay progression.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action1.C.1" id="action1.C.1">Action 1.C.1</a>: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong></p>
<p>HHS will expand its work to identify imaging and biomarkers through the public-private "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative" (ADNI). This partnership will help identify and monitor disease progression, even in the early stages before individuals show symptoms of the disease.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action1.C.2" id="action1.C.2">Action 1.C.2</a>: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong></p>
<p>HHS will maximize the effectiveness of research findings in neuroimaging and biomarkers through partnerships, meetings, and conferences with the private sector, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and other federal agencies. These collaborations will focus on how to translate findings into treatments and clinical practice, as well as help identify promising new areas of exploration.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style="text-align:center"><a name="strategy1.D" id="strategy1.D">Strategy 1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities</a></h3>
<p>In order to facilitate communication and collaboration, build synergy, and leverage resources, it is imperative that research across nations and across funders be coordinated. The actions below will formalize the coordination process beyond HHS and the Federal Government and make research available to the public for input.</p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color:#FFA07A">(Completed)</span> <a name="action1.D.1" id="action1.D.1">Action 1.D.1</a>: Inventory Alzheimer's disease research investments</strong></p>

Developed by NIA in collaboration with the Alzheimer's Association, the IADRP will enable public and private funders of Alzheimer's research to coordinate research planning, leverage resources, avoid duplication of funding efforts, and identify new opportunities in promising areas of growth. Along with NIA, over 20 NIH Institutes and Centers, a number of other federal agencies, and private sector organizations contribute to the database. Alzheimer's Research United Kingdom is the first international entity to join the collaboration.</p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color:#FFA07A">(Updated)</span> <a name="action1.D.2" id="action1.D.2">Action 1.D.2</a>: Expand international outreach to enhance collaboration</strong></p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association and the NIA co-hosted a funders meeting at the <em>Alzheimer's Association International Conference</em> in July 2012. The Alzheimer's Association and NIA convene representatives of several funding organizations around the world for regular teleconferences. NIA is exploring collaboration with the "European Union Joint Programming Initiative on Neurodegenerative Diseases Research" (JPND). The Office of Global Affairs (OGA) is exploring with foreign Ministries of Health opportunities to include joint activities on Alzheimer's disease in bilateral initiatives.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style="text-align:center"><a name="strategy1.E" id="strategy1.E">Strategy 1.E: Facilitate Translation of Findings into Medical Practice and Public Health Programs</a></h3>
<p>Currently, promising research and interventions are published in the research literature and presented at scientific meetings. Additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, the pharmaceutical industry, and public health systems, quickly and accurately.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action1.E.1" id="action1.E.1">Action 1.E.1</a>: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong></p>
<p>HHS will convene a group to examine ways to speed up the processes for bringing pharmacological treatments to market, including: identifying and validating therapeutic targets; developing new interventions; testing efficacy and safety; and regulatory approval. The group will look at the current average time and will identify places where the timeline could be shortened. The group will include representatives from the FDA, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), and NIH who will consult with academic researchers and representatives from the private sector.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action1.E.2" id="action1.E.2">Action 1.E.2</a>: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong></p>
<p>HHS will expand its work to disseminate research findings. NIH will partner with other federal agencies to disseminate research findings to networks of providers and researchers. FDA will work with the pharmaceutical and medical device industries to clarify the types and characteristics of data needed for approval and clinical implementation. Other HHS and federal partners will form collaborations to promote the translation of evidence-based findings to community and practice settings. For example, ACL/AoA and NIH will continue their collaboration on translational research focused on helping older adults maintain their health and independence in the community. Additionally, ACL/AoA and CDC will build upon current collaborative efforts between public health and aging services networks to disseminate these findings. HHS will explore partnerships with stakeholder groups to facilitate further dissemination.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action1.E.3" id="action1.E.3">Action 1.E.3</a>: Educate the public about the latest research findings</strong></p>
<p>HHS, VA, and other federal agencies will expand their outreach efforts to more effectively inform the public about research findings, including results from clinical trials and studies regarding the non-pharmacological management of physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms. The NIA's Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral Center (ADEAR) will continue its focus in this area, and work with ACL and CDC to expand outreach to include the findings of studies that center on community and public health interventions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color:#FFA07A">(New)</span> <a name="action1.E.4" id="action1.E.4">Action 1.E.4</a>: Issue guidance about drugs for early stage Alzheimer's disease</strong></p>
<p>FDA will issue recommendations about standards for evaluating the effectiveness of treatments for early stage Alzheimer's disease. It is currently difficult to assess the impact of treatments on patients with early AD or who may be at risk of developing the disease, because they may have only minor or no clinical signs of the disease. The guidance will include recommendations about diagnostic criteria for evaluating therapeutic impact on early Alzheimer's disease, strategies for demonstrating the impact through outcome measures, and the role of biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color:#FFA07A">(New)</span> <a name="action1.E.5" id="action1.E.5">Action 1.E.5</a>: Expand and disseminate research on co-occurring conditions and dementias</strong></p>

The findings of this review will be disseminated through CDC's public health network, ACL/AoA's Aging Services Network, and the NIA research network.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="goal2" id="goal2">Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</a></h2>
<p>Providing all people with Alzheimer's disease with the highest-quality care in the most efficient manner requires a multi-tiered approach. High-quality care requires an adequate supply of culturally-competent professionals with appropriate skills, ranging from direct care workers to community health and social workers to primary care providers and specialists. High-quality care should be provided from the point of diagnosis onward in settings including doctor's offices, hospitals, people's homes and nursing homes. Care quality should be measured accurately and coupled with quality improvement tools. Further, care should address the complex care needs that persons with AD have due to the physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms of the disease and any co-occurring chronic conditions. High-quality and efficient care is dependent on smooth transitions between care settings and coordination among health care and long-term services and supports providers.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center"><a name="strategy2.A" id="strategy2.A">Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</a></h3>
<p>The workforce that cares for people with Alzheimer's disease includes health care and long-term services and supports providers such as primary care physicians; specialists such as neurologists, geriatricians, and psychiatrists; registered nurses and advanced practice nurses; community health workers; social workers; psychologists; pharmacists; dentists; allied health professionals; and direct care workers like home health aides and certified nursing assistants, who provide care across the care continuum. These providers need accurate information about caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease including the benefits of early diagnosis, how to address the physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms of the disease, and how to assist caregivers as they cope with the physical and emotional aspects of their caregiving responsibilities. Physicians and other health care providers need information on how to implement the "detection of any cognitive impairment" component of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit included in the Affordable Care Act. Major efforts by both VA and HRSA, including expanded training opportunities created in the Affordable Care Act, support geriatric training for physicians, nurses, and other health workers.<sup><a href="#ref14">14</a></sup> Enhanced specialist training is also needed to prepare these practitioners for the unique challenges faced by people with Alzheimer's disease. In addition, work is needed to expand the capacity of the primary care community to serve people with Alzheimer's disease. Dementia-specific capabilities within the direct care workforce need to be expanded and enhanced. The actions below will facilitate AD-specific training for care professionals in order to strengthen a workforce that provides high-quality care to people with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color:#FFA07A">(Updated)</span> <a name="action2.A.1" id="action2.A.1">Action 2.A.1</a>: Educate health care providers</strong></p>
<p>In 2012, HHS began a comprehensive effort to educate health care providers such as physicians, nurses, direct care workers and other professionals about Alzheimer's disease. Funded by HRSA through its GEC Program, during the first 6 months of this initiative 45 GEC grantees partnered with 248 community stakeholders to provide 178 interprofessional educational offerings to over 10,000 health professionals on topics such as tools to identify dementia, signs and symptoms of dementia, caregiver needs, managing dementia in the context of other chronic diseases, accessing long-term services in the community, managing care transitions, participation in clinical trials, and effective behavior management for persons with Alzheimer's disease. Trainings also address the unique needs of medically underserved and special populations including racial and ethnic minorities and individuals with intellectual disabilities. Some grantees have translated materials into other languages such as Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Arabic. Data for the remaining 6 months will be available in October 2013. In 2013, this effort will continue to ensure that providers receive training on the latest dementia clinical guidelines and research findings in order to provide high quality, culturally competent care for older adults and their caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action2.A.2" id="action2.A.2">Action 2.A.2</a>: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</strong></p>
<p>HHS will enhance three programs that encourage providers to focus on geriatric specialties. The "Comprehensive Geriatric Education Program," as mandated by the Affordable Care Act, provides traineeships to support students pursuing advanced degrees in geriatric nursing, long-term services and supports, and gero-psychiatric nursing. In addition, HRSA will continue to support training projects that provide fellowships for individuals studying to be geriatricians, geriatric dentists, or geriatric psychiatrists. These programs prepare professionals to address the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease through service rotations in different care settings. HRSA will also continue to support the career development of geriatric specialists in academia through the "Geriatric Academic Career Awards Program." Currently 65 percent of these awardees provide interprofessional clinical training on Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action2.A.3" id="action2.A.3">Action 2.A.3</a>: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong></p>

Much of that insecurity will be alleviated as the Affordable Care Act, with its elimination of pre-existing conditions limitations and expansion of insurance coverage, is implemented. Even with access to affordable care for individuals, the health care workforce needs tools that can help ensure timely and accurate diagnoses. Research has helped identify some assessment tools that can be used to detect cognitive impairment that may indicate the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.<sup><a href="#ref19">19</a></sup> The actions below will facilitate appropriate assessment and give health care providers tools to make timely and accurate diagnoses.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action2.B.1" id="action2.B.1">Action 2.B.1</a>: Link the public to diagnostic and clinical management services</strong></p>
<p>In the summer of 2012, ACL/AoA launched a webinar series with presentations by NIA/ADEAR Center, NIA-funded ADCs, National Alzheimer's Call Center, and Eldercare Locator. These webinars described resources and services related to Alzheimer's diagnosis and management, clinical trials, and caregiving so that aging network providers can share this information with the consumers they serve. These webinars will be ongoing.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action2.B.2" id="action2.B.2">Action 2.B.2</a>: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</strong></p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act established coverage of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. "Detection of any cognitive impairment" must be included as part of the wellness visit. HHS is using research findings to identify the most appropriate assessment tools that can be used in a variety of outpatient clinical settings to assess cognition. The recommended tools will be distributed to practitioners to aid in identification and evaluation of cognitive impairment. Once cognitive impairment has been detected, practitioners will be able to consider potential causes of cognitive impairment and determine the need for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation for AD.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><a name="strategy2.C" id="strategy2.C">Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families upon Diagnosis</a></h3>
<p>Often, even though a physician or another health care provider has identified cognitive impairment, the patient and his or her family are not told of the diagnosis.<sup><a href="#ref20">20</a></sup> Further, once a diagnosis is made and disclosed, as few as half of patients and families receive counseling, support, or information about next steps.<sup><a href="#ref21">21</a></sup> This information is important, especially for early stage patients who experience positive outcomes when they are involved in planning and receive appropriate services.<sup><a href="#ref22">22</a></sup> The actions below will address this gap by educating physicians and other health care providers, incentivizing discussions with people with AD and their families, and enhancing the ability of other networks to assist people with Alzheimer's disease and their families with addressing their needs.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action2.C.1" id="action2.C.1">Action 2.C.1</a>: Educate physicians and other health care providers about accessing long-term services and supports</strong></p>
<p>One barrier to counseling and support is that health care providers are not aware of available services or how to access them. To increase knowledge of these resources among doctors, nurses, and hospitals, HHS will work with its federal partners, public and private entities, and the health care provider community to identify steps to effectively educate physicians and other health care providers about support resources and services available to assist people with AD and their caregivers. This work will be coordinated with the provider education effort in <a href="#action2.A.1">Action 2.A.1</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of the clinical care setting, families and people with AD need specialized assistance in planning for AD-specific needs and accessing appropriate services. HHS has strengthened the ability of existing long-term services and supports systems, such as those provided by ACL/AoA's Aging Network, to meet the unique needs of people with AD and their caregivers. This occurred through strengthening the Aging Network's awareness of available family caregiver assessment tools, resource materials from across the government, and support programs designed to educate caregivers and persons with the disease.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><a name="strategy2.D" id="strategy2.D">Strategy 2.D: Identify High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</a></h3>
<p>Guidelines for delivery of high-quality care and measures of quality care are needed to ensure that people with Alzheimer's disease receive high-quality, culturally-competent care in the many different settings where they receive services. These guidelines and measures should be tailored to the stages of the disease, address the physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms of AD, and cover the myriad care settings in which care is delivered. These guidelines should also take into account how care might be modified for diverse populations and in the context of co-occurring chronic conditions in people with AD. HHS will seek expert input from public and private entities and ensure that content builds on existing, evidence-based guidelines. Quality measures should be based on such guidelines and track whether recommended care is being provided. Guidelines and measures need to be free of conflicts of interest. The actions below will advance the development of guidelines and measures of high-quality care, as well as the ability of the provider community to improve the quality of the care they provide. In the future, to facilitate the implementation of quality care guidelines and measurement, HHS will explore development and electronic sharing of clinical decision support interventions in concert with guidelines and measures to provide physicians the information they need at the point of care and ensure continuity between measurement, evaluation, and best practice.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action2.D.1" id="action2.D.1">Action 2.D.1</a>: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</strong></p>
<p>HHS will work with private partners to facilitate groups such as medical professional societies and organizations representing persons with AD, caregivers, and direct care workers working together to delineate best dementia care practices and evidence-based guidelines. This work can serve to inform clinical, behavioral health, and long-term services and supports providers, families, and people with AD, and can also serve as a foundation to guide the identification and development of metrics that promote high-quality dementia care in all settings.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><a name="strategy2.E" id="strategy2.E">Strategy 2.E: Explore the Effectiveness of New Models of Care for People with Alzheimer's Disease</a></h3>
<p>Work is underway both and CMS and the VA to identify models that provide more effective and efficient care for people with Alzheimer's disease. The Affordable Care Act established the CMS Innovation Center, which is charged with testing innovative payment and service delivery models to reduce expenditures in Medicare and Medicaid while maintaining or enhancing the quality of care received by program beneficiaries. While most Innovation Center models are not designed to focus on people with AD in particular, a number of the initiatives underway at the Innovation Center may provide information relevant to the care for people with Alzheimer's disease. The Secretary can expand the duration and scope of care models that are shown to reduce spending and improve quality, including implementing them at a national level.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action2.E.1" id="action2.E.1">Action 2.E.1</a>: Evaluate the effectiveness of relevant Innovation Center models for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong></p>
<p>The Innovation Center is currently carrying several models that can include testing payment and delivery models for improving care for Medicare beneficiaries with AD. The Innovation Center will evaluate the effectiveness of the <em>Health Care Innovation Awards</em>, including those that focus on people with AD. In addition, the "Multi-payer Advanced Primary Care Practice Demonstration" and the "Comprehensive Primary Care" initiative will measure the effectiveness of medical home models, which utilize a team approach to provide care and to improve the quality and coordination of health care services. The Innovation Center may explore the impact of these models on subgroups, such as people with AD.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><a name="strategy2.F" id="strategy2.F">Strategy 2.F: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions between Care Settings and Systems</a></h3>
<p>People with dementia have higher rates of emergency room visits and hospitalizations, two settings where they are vulnerable to stress, delirium, and unnecessary complications. A transition between providers and care settings is a complex time of care delivery for all people, but especially for frail elders or other individuals with Alzheimer's disease who often have multiple chronic conditions. Transitions include moves into acute care hospitals, from hospitals to post-acute settings such as skilled nursing facilities or the home, or from nursing facilities to hospitals. People with AD are at high risk of adverse events due to poor communication and other care process deficiencies during transitions and need support to help them determine the best timing for transition and site of care.<sup><a href="#ref23">23</a></sup></p>
<p><strong><a name="action2.F.1" id="action2.F.1">Action 2.F.1</a>: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong></p>
<p>The Partnership for Patients is a public-private partnership that helps improve the quality of care and safety in hospitals. Through this initiative, hospitals will identify best practices for reducing injuries, complications, and improving care transitions. The Innovation Center will identify practices that benefit people with complex needs including people with Alzheimer's disease. CMS will share these findings broadly.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action2.F.2" id="action2.F.2">Action 2.F.2</a>: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong></p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><a name="strategy2.H" id="strategy2.H">Strategy 2.H: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionately Affected by Alzheimer's Disease and for Populations Facing Care Challenges</a></h3>
<p>Some populations are unequally burdened by Alzheimer's disease, including racial and ethnic minorities and people with intellectual disabilities. Racial and ethnic minorities are at greater risk for developing Alzheimer's disease and face barriers to obtaining a diagnosis and services after onset. People with Down syndrome almost always develop AD as they age. In addition, because AD primarily affects older adults, the population with younger-onset AD faces unique challenges with diagnosis, care, and stigma. HHS will undertake the actions below to better understand the unique challenges faced by these groups and create a plan for improving the care that they receive, which will be integrated into the broader efforts to improve care for all people with AD.</p>

<p>The vast majority of people do not think about or plan for the long-term services and supports they will need until they experience a disability or AD. Many Americans incorrectly believe that Medicare will cover most of the costs of these supportive services.<sup><a href="#ref31">31</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a></sup> Unfortunately, by the time care is needed, it is difficult to get coverage in the private long-term care insurance market, and options are limited.<sup><a href="#ref33">33</a></sup> Educating people about their potential need for long-term services and supports and the significant advantages of planning ahead for these services encourages timely preparation. Planning ahead can help ensure that individuals with AD receive care in the setting they prefer and that their dignity is maintained.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action3.C.1" id="action3.C.1">Action 3.C.1</a>: Examine awareness of long-term care needs and barriers to planning for these needs</strong></p>
<p>HHS is working to better understand why middle-aged adults do or do not plan for long-term care needs. HHS will conduct a national survey to examine attitudes toward long-term care. It will also identify barriers to long-term care planning.</p>

<p>People with Alzheimer's disease are particularly vulnerable to financial exploitation, physical or emotional abuse, and neglect both at home and in care facilities.<sup><a href="#ref34">34</a></sup> Reports of elder abuse are handled by state Adult Protective Services (APS), which investigate allegations, provide protective services, and refer cases to law enforcement when appropriate. Not all APS programs cover residents of long-term care facilities. State survey and certification agencies receive funding from CMS to survey Medicare or Medicaid-certified nursing facilities and to investigate abuse complaints in these facilities. State licensing agencies may investigate complaints of abuse in other types of facilities, such as assisted living. State Long-Term Care Ombudsman programs advocate for residents of nursing homes and other adult care facilities, and work to resolve complaints on behalf of residents, including those related to abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The actions below will help ensure that people with AD have their dignity, safety, and rights maintained.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center"><a name="strategy3.E" id="strategy3.E">Strategy 3.E: Assess and Address the Housing Needs of People with Alzheimer's Disease</a></h3>
<p>Stable housing is essential to helping people with Alzheimer's disease remain in the community, particularly as they experience an increasing need for services and supports as the disease progresses. Housing is a crucial platform for delivering the necessary health and supportive services. Recognizing these links, HHS and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are working together to improve health outcomes and housing stability through supportive services for vulnerable populations including people with AD. Through the actions below, HHS will assess the availability of services in the settings where people with Alzheimer's disease live. This information will form the basis of future actions to further link housing with services for people with AD.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action3.E.1" id="action3.E.1">Action 3.E.1</a>: Explore affordable housing models</strong></p>
<p>HUD and HHS will explore models of affordable housing that provide coordinated housing, health and long-term services and supports for individuals as they age in the community. This work will include examining housing sites that link health and long-term services and supports. In addition, the project will link HUD and HHS data to understand the older adult population in HUD housing, including their health care utilization.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action3.E.2" id="action3.E.2">Action 3.E.2</a>: Examine patterns of housing and services</strong></p>
<p>HHS will undertake analyses of existing studies and surveys to better understand where people with Alzheimer's disease live and the availability of services in these settings. This will include an in-depth analysis of the National Survey of Residential Care Facilities to better understand the level of cognitive impairment among residents and the types of services provided in assisted living facilities. The results of these studies will be used to identify areas that the National Plan should address in future years.</p>

<h2><a name="goal4" id="goal4">Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</a></h2>
<p>Most of the public is aware of Alzheimer's disease; more than 85 percent of people surveyed can identify the disease and its symptoms. Alzheimer's disease is also one of the most feared health conditions. Yet there are widespread and significant public misperceptions about diagnosis and clinical management.<sup><a href="#ref35">35</a></sup> Misperceptions lead to delayed diagnosis and to people with the disease and their caregivers feeling isolated and stigmatized. Enhancing public awareness and engagement is an essential goal because it forms the basis for advancing the subsequent goals of the National Plan. A better understanding of Alzheimer's disease will help engage stakeholders who can help address the challenges faced by people with the disease and their families. These stakeholders include a range of groups such as health care providers who care for people with AD and their caregivers, employers whose employees request flexibility to care for a loved one with the disease, groups whose members are caregivers, and broader aging organizations. The strategies and actions under this goal are designed to educate these and other groups about the disease.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center"><a name="strategy4.A" id="strategy4.A">Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</a></h3>
<p>Greater public awareness of AD can encourage families to seek assessment, reduce isolation and misunderstanding felt by caregivers, and help link people in need to accurate information, resources and services.</p>
<p><strong><a name="action4.A.1" id="action4.A.1">Action 4.A.1</a>: Design and conduct a national education and outreach initiative</strong></p>
