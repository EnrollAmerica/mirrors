<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the  		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in conjunction with the  		Federal Employment Workgroup on Disability commissioned a review of the federal  		financing mechanisms used by state agencies to implement the evidence-based  		employment models known as Individual Placement and Support (IPS) and  		Customized Employment (CE). This review comes with the recognition that the  		federal financing of employment services for people with serious mental illness  		is a shared responsibility across multiple federal agencies, including the U.S.  		Social Security Administration (SSA), the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  		Services (CMS), the HHS Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  		Administration (SAMHSA), the U.S. Department of Education (ED) Rehabilitation  		Services Administration, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and the U.S.  		Department of Labor (DOL). It is believed that improvements in this shared  		responsibility can lead to more effective support for these evidence-based  		employment models at the state and local levels. The purpose of this report is  		to identify strategies for improved access to federal financing of IPS and CE  		services through case studies of current state and local practices. </p>
<p>The overall employment rate for the general population was 64.5% in  		2009. Among those who were working, 80% were working full-time (Bureau of Labor  		Statistics, 2010). The employment rates among people with serious mental  		illness are much lower than the general population, estimated to be 22% at any  		given time, with a little more than half of these individuals (12%) working  		full-time. While the likelihood of having a job is approximately 1 in 1.5 for  		the general population, the likelihood among individuals with a serious mental  		illness is not much better than 1 in 5. </p>
<p>Over the past two decades, substantial attention has been devoted to  		understanding the poor employment rates of people with serious mental illness  		and to improving them. However, two employment models developed independently  		during these years have demonstrated particular success in helping people with  		a serious mental illness get jobs. The IPS model of supported employment (SE)  		developed by Drake and Becker (1996) has a strong body of experimental evidence  		showing that it is effective in helping people with serious mental illness get  		jobs. CE, a more recent but conceptually convergent employment model has also  		demonstrated success in assisting people with serious mental illness obtain  		jobs. Developed and fostered by the DOL (Federal Register, 2002) over the past  		decade, CE has been less rigorously tested than has IPS. </p>
<p>The IPS and CE models both seek to assist individuals with severe mental  		illness find jobs that fit their particular needs, interests, and skills, and  		to support them in ways that enable them to succeed in the workplace. IPS is  		built on a foundation of seven core principles; including the following: (1)  		<i>Consumer choice</i>; (2) <i>Integrated services</i>; (3) <i>Competitive  		employment in regular work settings</i>; (4) <i>Place when individual feels  		ready</i>; (5) <i>Personalized follow-on support</i>; (6) <i>Person-centered  		services</i>; and (7) <i>Benefits counseling</i>. A recent empirical review of  		11 randomized controlled trials of IPS programs serving individuals a serious  		mental illness concluded that vocational outcomes are consistently  		significantly higher than the alternative control program. The 11 studies  		included a total of 1,690 individuals (812 IPS, 878 Control), all of whom had  		been diagnosed with a severe mental illness, but who varied in their receipt of  		Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance  		(SSDI). In these studies, members of the control group received either  		vocational services as usual, or a specific non-IPS vocational rehabilitation  		(VR) service.</p>
<p>In 2002, DOLs Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) put  		forward a formal definition of CE and a major grant initiative to fund programs  		around it. CE is:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>a flexible process designed to personalize the employment  		  relationship between a job candidate and an employer in a way that meets the  		  needs of both. It is based on an individualized match between the strengths,  		  conditions, and interests of a job candidate and the identified business needs  		  of an employer. Customized Employment utilizes an individualized approach to  		  employment planning and job development -- one person at a timeone  		  employer at a time</i> (ODEP, 2011). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The focus of the funding was to assist people with disabilities in  		creating an individualized competitive employment opportunity that meets the  		needs of both the job seeker and the employer (Federal Register, 2002). The CE  		model has been used to provide employment services to people with serious  		mental illness, but the strategy was not developed specifically for this  		population. CE has six core principles, including the following: (1)  		<i>Negotiation with employers</i>; (2) <i>Customized job tasks</i>; (3)  		<i>Person-centered services</i>; (4) <i>Client control</i>;  		(5)<i>Discovery</i>; and (6) <i>Jobs have the potential for  		advancement</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>Case Studies</b></i></p>
<p>Working closely with ASPE and with the Federal Employment Workgroup, the  		study team identified four states (Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, and Washington)  		that serve this population using a variety of methods to provide IPS and CE  		services through braided state general funds, VR funds, mental health block  		grants, Medicaid funds (rehabilitation option and/or through waivers). The  		objective of the case studies was to gather information and document the range  		of funding sources that each state uses to finance IPS/CE services, determine  		barriers to achieving adequate funding, and identifying how the funding sources  		are being combined to achieve what little success the state may be having.</p>
<p>Based on the review of four states experiences, it is clear that  		the coordination of state agencies including mental health, VR, and Medicaid,  		is particularly vital in organizing a viable and successful plan for funding  		IPS and CE services. The case study findings provided opportunities to clarify  		(identify) funding strategies using existing mechanisms of support. However,  		the case studies also pointed to a number of concerns about improving the flow  		of funds to local levels. These concerns include the following: </p>
<ol><li>
<p>Collaboration in most states between state mental health and VR  			 offices is less than ideal for supporting implementation of IPS and CE.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to VR services is an important challenge for people with  			 mental illness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VRs focus on case closure is not aligned with IPS/CE  			 principles. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ticket to Work (TTW) payments are not aligned with IPS/CE  			 principles. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One-Stop Career Centers do not have the expertise to serve people  			 with mental illness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stronger federal policies in conjunction with steady federal funding  			 that is based on process measures are needed to provide employment support to  			 individuals with serious mental illness.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><i><b>Funding Models</b></i></p>
<p>Based on the case studies and discussions with leading experts, two  		primary federal funding possibilities were identified: Medicaid and ED funding  		for state VR services as well as several secondary funding sources, including  		mental health block grants funded by SAMHSA, one-stop employment centers funded  		by DOL, and TTW funding from SSA. As noted throughout the report, the main  		funding source for IPS services has been Medicaid. Medicaid has its  		limitations, not the least of which is that it covers only those who are  		Medicaid eligible, leaving those who are not without these critical employment  		services. Despite some special provisions to encourage employment of people  		with disabilities, Medicaid financial eligibility rules typically require  		individuals to be low income and permit them to have almost no savings.  		Moreover, individuals with serious mental illness can seldom meet Medicaid  		financial and functional eligibility criteria until they have had more than one  		and often several acute episodes and their conditions have become chronic.  		Thus, Medicaid is extremely limited as a funding source for early interventions  		that might favorably change the long-term prognosis of individuals who have had  		a first episode of serious mental illness but for whom mental illness is not  		yet a chronic condition requiring long-term -- perhaps even lifelong -- medical  		care and social supports. The research identified four primary options for  		state level funding for SE services through the existing Medicaid  		infrastructure. These options include using: (1) the Rehabilitation option; (2)  		the Targeted Case Management option; (3) the 1915(c) Home and Community-Based  		Services Waivers; and (4) the 1915(i) Home and Community-Based Services option.  		In order to assist states with each of these options, specific details and  		procedures are further elaborated in the report. </p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">1. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Having a job remains one of the most valued roles in society. It is  		viewed as essential to community integration and is associated with greater  		independence and self worth, and a more fulfilling social life. Having a job  		adds structure to daily life, increases social contacts and support, and  		enhances opportunities for personal achievement. In 2009, the general  		population had an overall employment rate of 64.5% Amongthose who were working,  		80%were working full-time (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010). Unfortunately,  		the employment rates among people with serious mental illness are much lower  		than the general population. Researchers providing a best estimate note that at  		any given time the employment rates for these individuals are around 22% with a  		little more than half of them (12%) working full-time (Mechanic, Bilder, &amp;  		McAlpine, 2002). Thus, the likelihood of persons with serious mental illness  		having a job is a little better than 1 in 5, and the likelihood of having a  		full-time job is approximately 1 in 8.</p>
<p>In the past two decades, substantial attention has been devoted to  		understanding the poor employment rates of people with serious mental illness  		and to improving them. Two employment models developed independently during  		these years have demonstrated particular success in helping people with a  		serious mental illness get jobs. The Individual Placement and Support (IPS)  		model of supported employment (SE) developed by Drake and Becker (1996) has a  		strong body of experimental evidence showing that it is effective in helping  		people with serious mental illness get jobs. The result is greater earnings and  		job retention, improved mental health, and greater satisfaction with life when  		compared to treatment as usual. However, despite its strong body of supporting  		evidence (discussed below), the IPS model of SE is not widely available to the  		people with serious mental illness that need them (Bond, et al., 2001). The  		reason is primarily due to the difficulties in financing these services (Drake  		et al., 2009). Local mental health service providers cannot recover the costs  		associated with hiring, keeping, or training employment specialists (ES).  		Federal and state funding for these services creates significant barriers to  		the development and sustainability of evidence-based SE programs. In many  		states, Medicaid will pay for some portion of these employment services, but  		not all. Medicare will not pay for any of these services. Without a consistent  		and substantive financial base from which to draw, it is not surprising that  		community mental health centers (CMHCs) do not provide these evidence-based  		services.</p>
<p>Customized Employment (CE), a more recent but conceptually convergent  		development, has also demonstrated success in assisting people with serious  		mental illness obtain jobs. Developed and fostered by the U.S. Department of  		Labor (DOL) (Federal Register, 2002) over the past decade, CE has been less  		rigorously tested than has IPS. However, experience has also shown that it has  		been successful and, in fact, is sometimes used by IPS ESs to help in the job  		placement of individuals facing more complicated barriers to sustained  		employment. Unfortunately, CE is not readily available either. CE was  		originally funded through a grant program to One-Stop Career Centers. While the  		grants were considered very successful, the program had little sustainability  		in most centers where CE was implemented once funding stopped (Elinson, et al.,  		2008). </p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the  		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in conjunction with the  		Federal Employment Workgroup on Disability commissioned a review of the federal  		financing mechanisms used by state agencies to implement the IPS and CE  		employment models. This review comes with the recognition that the federal  		financing of employment services for people with serious mental illness is a  		shared responsibility across multiple federal agencies, including the U.S.  		Social Security Administration (SSA), the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  		Services (CMS), the HHS Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  		Administration (SAMHSA), the U.S. Department of Education (ED) Rehabilitation  		Services Administration (RSA), the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),  		and DOL. It is believed that improvements in this shared responsibility can  		lead to more effective support for these evidence-based employment models at  		the state and local levels.</p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to identify strategies for improved access  		to federal financing of IPS and CE services. While there are many issues  		associated with increasing access to evidence-based employment services for  		this underserved population, financing is the key barrier. With an adequate and  		consistent source of funds available to appropriate providers, more people with  		serious mental illness will have successful employment outcomes. However,  		moving these models of employment into the mainstream of mental health services  		will require new thinking about the policies and approaches associated with  		financing of employment services for these individuals. </p>
<p>This report is divided into three sections. <a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#intro">Section  		1</a> presents an overview of the IPS and CE employment models. We include a  		definition and a summary of the supporting evidence for each model. In  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#current">Section 2</a> we present a brief discussion of the current  		issues in financing employment services for people with serious mental illness  		including case examples. In <a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#funding">Section 3</a>, we provide more  		detailed guidance to states seeking to blend and braid several  		federal financing sources (e.g., Medicaid, mental health block grant, and  		vocational rehabilitation (VR) funds) and technical assistance in identifying  		appropriate Medicaid benefits and how to access these funding mechanisms in  		compliance with federal requirements. </p>
<p><i><b>The Individual Placement and Support and Customized Employment  		Models</b></i></p>
<p>The IPS and CE models both seek to assist individuals with serious  		mental illness find jobs that fit their particular needs, interests, and  		skills, and to support them in ways that enable them to succeed in the  		workplace. The two models share many features, but their core principles and  		approaches also differ in some important ways. This section provides a summary  		of each model, its core principles, and the evidence supporting its use. </p>
<p><i><b>Individual Placement and Support</b></i></p>
<p>The IPS model is a well-defined form of SE that has developed into an  		evidence-based practice (EBP) specifically targeting individuals with serious  		mental illness. A key feature of IPS is integrating employment services with  		mental health services. </p>
<p>IPS is built on a foundation of seven core principles (Bond, 2004).  		These principles include the following: (1) <i>Consumer choice</i> --  		individuals who are interested in work are eligible for IPS without exception;  		(2) <i>Integrated services</i> -- vocational and mental health services  		together are a part of the overall treatment approach; (3) <i>Competitive  		employment in regular work settings</i> -- no pre-employment training or  		placement in sheltered or segregated work settings; (4) <i>Place and train</i>  		-- placing individuals in competitive work settings as soon as they feel ready,  		without extensive training or a career exploration period; (5) <i>Personalized  		follow-on support</i> -- after placement individuals and their employer (if  		desired) receive ongoing support for as long as they need it; (6)  		<i>Person-centered services</i> -- clients personal preferences,  		experiences, strengths, and choices drive the job search and follow-on supports  		rather than the judgment of the ES; and (7) <i>Benefits counseling</i> -- is  		provided to clients to ensure successful navigation of any impact of employment  		on government entitlements such as Medicaid or Social Security benefits. Any  		program adopting the IPS model must demonstrate fidelity to these core  		principles if it expects to achieve the measured outcomes (Bond, 2004;  		Loveland, Driscoll, &amp; Boyle, 2007).</p>
<p>To supplement the core principles, Becker and Drake (2003) have  		identified organizational and staffing features that appear to be essential to  		the success of an IPS program. The principles already specify that vocational  		services and mental health treatment should be integrated into a single  		treatment team approach. However, it is also essential that the ES be dedicated  		to employment-related services, and should not engage in more general case  		management activities. While it is tempting for agency directors to gain  		organizational efficiencies by having the ES perform duties typically  		associated with case management, experience shows that these other duties  		dilute the focus on employment. A second essential feature is caseload of the  		ES. Again, experience shows that the ES caseload should not exceed 20-25  		clients. Both of these additional staffing requirements are intended to ensure  		that the ES has an appropriate amount of time available to devote to each  		client and potential employer. </p>
<p>The body of evidence supporting IPS effectiveness began to develop in  		the early 1990s with quasi-experimental conversion studies of day treatment  		programs to SE programs. When combined across all of the early studies,  		comparisons of people receiving SE services to the day treatment groups showed  		that the SE model was significantly more effective than the day treatment model  		at increasing competitive employment rates; while 38% of the SE group achieved  		competitive employment, the comparison group remained static at 15% competitive  		employment (Bond, 2004).</p>
<p>Subsequent research on the IPS model moved to experimental trials for  		the purpose of establishing a causal impact. A recent empirical review of 11  		randomized controlled trials of IPS programs serving individuals with a serious  		mental illness (Bond, Drake, &amp; Becker, 2008) concluded that vocational  		outcomes are consistently significantly higher than the alternative control  		program. The 11 studies included a total of 1,690 individuals (812 IPS, 878  		Control), all of whom had been diagnosed with a serious mental illness, but who  		varied in their receipt of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social  		Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). In these studies, members of the control  		group received either vocational services as usual, or a specific non-IPS VR  		service. The length of follow-up varied across the studies from 6 months to 24  		months, and thus the number of months elapsed from baseline to outcomes varied  		by study. The overall rate of competitive employment across the multiple  		studies was 61% for the IPS arm and 23% for the control arm of the studies. IPS  		programs found employment for the individuals they served more quickly than did  		the control programs (138 days versus 206 days), and individuals in the IPS  		programs were more likely than those in the control programs to be working more  		than 20 hours per week (44% versus 14%). A subsequent meta-analysis (Campbell,  		Bond, &amp; Drake, 2009) replicated these findings in a similar sample of 681  		individuals with a diagnosis of serious mental illness that varied in their  		receipt of SSI and SSDI. </p>
<p>The key rationale for the IPS model lies in its compliance with the  		ideal features of an EBP, including the following: </p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>The model is well specified</b>. IPS principles and clinical  			 details have been refined continuously as research has evolved over 20 years  			 (Bond, 2004; Swanson &amp; Becker, 2010). It is a manualized practice which  			 clearly details specific principles of the model and clinical interactions  			 (Swanson, et al., 2008; Swanson &amp; Becker, 2010). Further, an IPS fidelity  			 scale (Bond, et al., 1997) measures adherence and predicts vocational outcomes  			 (Bond, et al., in press).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The model is sensitive to client goals</b>. The majority of  			 mental health clients want competitive employment (McQuilken, et al., 2003).  			 IPS emphasizes competitive jobs and client preferences regarding the timing,  			 goals, and procedures of finding and maintaining employment. Thus, client  			 satisfaction has always been high in IPS studies (Bond, et al., 2008).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The model is consistent with societal goals</b>. American society  			 and disability laws seek to promote social inclusion, recovery, and  			 mainstreaming. IPS addresses social inclusion, lost productivity, increasing  			 disability roles, and other societal goals (Bond, et al., 2010). Thus, IPS has  			 been endorsed by federal reports (e.g., New Freedom Commission on Mental  			 Health, 2003) and numerous federal and state agencies (e.g., the Veterans  			 Healthcare Administration and SAMHSA). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The model has strong and consistent evidence of efficacy and  			 effectiveness</b>. Numerous reviews of randomized controlled trials confirm  			 that IPS is superior to other vocational programs (e.g., Crowther, et al.,  			 2001). One recent review of 11 IPS studies concluded that 61% of IPS clients  			 obtained competitive employment in one year while only 23% of those in active  			 control conditions achieved competitive employment (Bond, et al., 2008). In  			 addition to randomized controlled trials, several day treatment conversion  			 studies and correlational fidelity-outcome studies support IPS (Bond, et al.,  			 2010). The Dartmouth Community Mental Health Program funded by the Johnson and  			 Johnson Foundation has overseen successful implementation of the IPS model in  			 over 120 mental health settings in 12 states (Drake, et al., 2006).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The model has minimal negative side effects and many positive  			 effects</b>. Despite concerns regarding the potential negative effects of  			 high-expectations programs, studies of IPS have consistently failed to detect  			 negative effects (Bond, 2004). For people with mental illnesses, as for others  			 in society, unemployment appears to be more stressful than employment. In fact,  			 many longitudinal studies show that employment leads to other positive  			 outcomes, such as increases in self-esteem, social functioning, and quality of  			 life, and decreases in substance abuse and mental health service utilization  			 (Bush, et al., 2009; Bond, et al., 2001; Burns, et al., 2009; Xie, et al.,  			 2010). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The model has excellent long-term durability</b>. Two studies  			 have documented excellent long-term outcomes of IPS. The amounts of competitive  			 employment improved rather than declined over 10 years (Becker, et al., 2007;  			 Salyers, et al., 2004). Other studies of SE have also demonstrated durability  			 of employment outcomes (Bond, et al., 1995; McHugo, et al., 1998; Test,  			 1992).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The model has reasonable costs</b>. A recent cost review study  			 suggests that per unit cost figure (in 2005 dollars) for IPS is in the range of  			 $3,500-$5,000 per client (Salkever, 2010). IPS has consistently been shown to  			 be cost-effective compared to other vocational programs (Bond, et al., 2010).  			 Economic modeling suggested that IPS might reduce long-term federal costs  			 (Drake, et al., 2009).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The model is relatively easy to implement and sustain</b>. Three  			 large national demonstrations have shown that IPS is relatively easy to  			 implement with high fidelity within 6 months. These include the National  			 Evidence-Based Practices Project (Bond, et al., 2008), the Johnson and  			 Johnson-Dartmouth Community Mental Health Program (Drake, et al., 2006), and  			 the Social Security Mental Health Treatment Study (Frey, et al., 2008) with a  			 combined total of over 160 IPS implementations. One unique finding regarding  			 IPS is that the number of programs continues to expand despite the lack of  			 clear funding sources, presumably because vocational services are highly valued  			 by all stakeholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The model is adaptable to diverse client groups and  			 communities</b>. IPS has been studied in rural areas, mid-sized cities, and  			 large cities (Bond, et al., 2008); with different ethno-racial groups  			 (Campbell, Bond, &amp; Drake, 2009); with different age groups (Bond &amp;  			 Drake, 2008); and in several other countries (Bond, et al., 2008). These  			 diverse groups appear to benefit from the IPS model in approximately similar  			 degrees.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><i><b>Customized Employment</b></i></p>
<p>The CE model was introduced conceptually by Secretary of Labor Elaine  		Chao in 2001 as a future trend in employment (Inge, 2008). In 2002, DOLs  		Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) put forward a formal definition  		of CE and a major grant initiative to fund CE programs. CE is a flexible  		process designed to personalize the employment relationship between a job  		candidate and an employer in a way that meets the needs of both. It is based on  		an individualized match between the strengths, conditions, and interests of a  		job candidate and the identified business needs of an employer. CE utilizes an  		individualized approach to employment planning and job development -- one  		person at a timeone employer at a time (ODEP, 2011). The focus of the  		funding was to assist people with disabilities in creating an individualized  		competitive employment opportunity that meets the needs of both the job seeker  		and the employer (Federal Register, 2002). The CE model has been used to  		provide employment services to people with serious mental illness, but the  		strategy was not developed specifically for this population. Instead, the  		target population for CE includes any individual with a complex life that poses  		challenges for achieving competitive employment (e.g., people with disabilities  		who may be chronically homeless, have limited job skills, or face other  		barriers to employment) (ODEP, 2009). </p>
<p>CE has six core principles (ODEP, 2009). They include the following: (1)  		<i>Negotiation with employers</i>-- employers voluntarily negotiate specific  		job duties or expectations with the job seeker; (2) <i>Customized job  		tasks</i>-- the distinct job tasks are carved from existing job descriptions,  		re-structured from one or more jobs, or created so that they match the  		interests and skills of the job seeker, and so that they also meet a specific  		workplace needs of the employer; thus the resultant job descriptions are  		customized; (3) <i>Person-centered services</i> -- the job seeker  		is the primary source of information and guidance about jobs to explore in the  		job market; (4) <i>Client control</i>-- the job seeker, not the ES or  		counselor, controls the planning process; (5) <i>Discovery</i> -- is the  		process used to reveal assessment, is used to reveal the job seekers  		interests, skills, and needs (but can be supplemented -- not replaced -- by  		traditional assessment); and (6) <i>Jobs have the potential for advancement</i>  		-- identified jobs should have potential for advancement even if the job seeker  		was previously unemployed, underemployed, or never held a job.</p>
<p>No randomized controlled trials of CE programs were found in the  		published literature. However, a number of non-experimental studies were  		identified. Citron et al. (2008) describe a CE program that provided services  		to individuals with mental illness, developmental disabilities, and addictive  		disorders. The program served nearly 200 job seekers, and of those 71% achieved  		employment in a competitive employment setting (including through a  		self-employment opportunities). Wages ranged from a lowest wage of $5.15 per  		hour to a high wage of $40 per hour, and the typical number of hours worked per  		week was 15-20. Rogers, Lavin, Ran, Gantenbein, and Sharpe (2008) summarized  		findings from a CE program that targeted young people with disabilities, and  		sought to improve competitive job placement in the transition from school to  		work. The program served 475 individuals over the course of 5 years, including  		people with developmental and intellectual disabilities, serious mental  		illness, and behavioral and physical health disabilities or challenges. Unlike  		many CE programs, this program engaged in extensive coordinated services beyond  		employment, including mental and physical health services and assistance with  		housing and transportation. The program also offered substantial skills and  		vocational training if the discovery process suggested this was necessary.  		Additionally, the program paid wage subsidies to some individuals to allow  		employers to try out the customized position (a "temp-to-hire" approach), with  		the understanding that the employer would then hire the temporary employee and  		assume responsibility for full wages. Overall, 62% of these individuals  		achieved competitive employment, working an average of 27 hours per week. The  		wages per hour ranged from $5.15 to $25, with an average of $8.16.</p>
<p>Luecking, et al. (2008) also described a CE program in which a One-Stop  		Career Center was adapted to provide CE services to 66 individuals with  		intellectual disabilities, mental illness, mobility disabilities, autism, and  		other disabilities, who were not engaged in competitive employment at intake.  		As a result of CE services, 89% of the individuals served achieved employment,  		working an average of 22 hours per week. Per-hour wages ranged from $6.15 to  		$18, with an average of $9.31. The time required from program entry to  		employment ranged from 1 month to 21 months, with an average of 5.25  		months.</p>
<p>Elinson, et al. (2008) published an evaluation of outcomes across 31 of  		the ODEP demonstration programs, using a one-group pretest-posttest design.  		Vocational outcomes were examined at three time periods. The programs served a  		combined 6,555 individuals over the course of 5 years, including people with  		psychiatric disabilities, learning disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and  		physical disabilities. Across all individuals served, 44.8% obtained  		employment. Individuals who achieved employment worked approximately 24-26  		hours per week on average. Per-hour wages ranged from $5.15 to over $8.15, with  		an approximate average hourly wage between $8.60-$8.95. Only a quarter of the  		positions included fringe benefits.</p>
<p>Thus, although there are no experimental evaluations of CE, an initial  		phase of non-experimental research supports the potential of CE for  		facilitating employment in people with a variety of challenging circumstances,  		including people with a serious mental illness.</p>
<h2><a name="current" id="current">2. CURRENT FINANCING ISSUES</a></h2>
<p>Although most federal agencies recognize the IPS model of SE as an EBP,  		the federal funding mechanisms in place to support availability of these  		services are not viable at the state and local levels, and thus do not result  		in available services. At least there is no mainstream source of funds that  		adequately support the integration of SE with mental health care in CMHCs,  		One-Stop Career Centers, or anywhere else. Providers of mental health services  		must cobble together funding from a variety of sources in order to effectively  		offer state of the art IPS services. If a center director chooses to provide SE  		services through his/her center, then funding must be brokered with various  		sources, such as grants (such as Johnson and Johnson, DOL, etc.), Medicaid, VR,  		the Ticket to Work (TTW) program, or other disparate sources. In many states  		and local communities, mental health providers face challenges in obtaining the  		resources to make these services a viable option should they choose to make it  		available. Instead, they may provide other services that are less effective and  		not evidence-based.</p>
<p>The following describe financing as the main reason why people with  		mental illness do not have access to SE services across the country. The three  		areas of primary concern are: (1) fragmented funding sources; (2) the stigma  		associated with mental illness; and (3) inadequate knowledge of potential  		funding sources.</p>
<p><b>Fragmented Funding Sources</b>. SE programs are based on an approach  		that integrates evidence-based vocational services with mental health services.  		In order to accomplish integration of services, people with mental illness need  		services and support from a variety of agencies, all of which have different  		policies, cultures, values, and eligibility requirements (Bond, Becker, et al.,  		2001; SAMHSA, 2009). For example, a person with a mental illness who is seeking  		employment may need to access services from a mental health agency for clinical  		services that may be funded by Medicaid; employment assessment, counseling, and  		training that may be funded by state VR agency; and access to employers that  		may be funded by the One-Stop Career Center (a component of the workforce  		development system). However, bringing all these different funding sources  		together to fund all components of SE would require systems change and is a  		challenging task for ESs and for people with serious mental illness.</p>
<p><b>Stigma of serious mental illness and employment</b>. Individuals with  		serious mental illness are stigmatized and getting funding to receive  		employment services may be subject to how agencies perceive their prospects for  		employment (Harnois&amp; Gabriel, 2000; Cook, 2006). For example, some VR  		counselors may approve an application of a client if, in their estimation, the  		client is able to work, and since some VR staff may have lower expectations  		about the ability of people with mental illness to work, people with mental  		illness may lose out on potential funding for employment services. In addition,  		One-Stop Career Centers often provide a one-size fits all approach to  		employment services which often ends in referral to VR agencies for people with  		serious mental illness. CMHCs, which provide services to treat mental illness,  		but they may not adequately integrate employment goals into treatment plans and  		often will only pursue employment goals after the person is considered  		stable. CMHCs may actively seek funding from CMS for mental  		health services but they may not be aware of opportunities to receive funding  		for employment services from CMS.</p>
<p><b>Inadequate knowledge of existing funding opportunities</b>. The  		ability to access and use multiple funding streams requires knowledge of the  		rules and regulations relating to funding that is available from CMS, VR, SSA,  		and DOL. However, the degree of success in accessing these funds for SE varies  		substantially across states (Drake &amp; Goldman, 2003; Wehman&amp; Revell,  		2000). Often, states do not have a common understanding of how Medicaid waivers  		and state plan amendments (SPAs) may be used to provide funds for SE services.  		VR agencies (and counselors) do not necessarily have a uniform approach to SE  		funding and there is considerable variation in the interpretation of VR  		regulations across and within states, especially as these relate to employment  		supports for persons with serious mental illness.</p>
<h3>Current Federal Financing Sources</h3>
<p>There are two distinct phases involved in SE -- each of which is funded  		differently. The first phase includes job development, placement, the  		arrangement of natural supports, and initial skill acquisition and the second  		phase includes all ongoing support afterwards. While the first stage is usually  		paid for by the State Office of VR, the funding for a given SE provider is  		usually a combination of funds braided or blended from  		any number of different federal, state, and local agencies (West, et al.,  		1998).<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The most common sources for funding IPS and CE services include the  		following:<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>State Office of VRs</b> are funded by RSA. State VRs provide  			 support to local providers typically during the initial or time-limited phase  			 of SE. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Community Mental Health Services Block Grant Program</b> --  			 States often use portions of this grant program to SE services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>State Mental Health Authority</b> (MHA) can pay either with  			 ongoing services budget or with time-limited grants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Medicaid</b> -- Medicaid dollars can be used to pay for those  			 medically necessary services that support an individual to be able to attain  			 and maintain competitive employment. Medicaid is used most often by states to  			 cover the services of a case manager who assists the individual in gaining  			 access to a range of necessary services and supports including vocational  			 services, and/or to cover those clinical services such as counseling or  			 medication management that support the individual in their recovery. There are  			 also several Medicaid options and/or waivers available for the states to  			 provide vocational services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One-Stop Employment Centers -- Coordinated by DOLs Employment  			 and Training Administration, these centers are designed to provide a full range  			 of assistance to job seekers under one roof. Established under the Workforce  			 Investment Act (WIA), the centers offer training referrals, career counseling,  			 job listings, and similar employment-related services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>SSA</b> -- Provides SSI and SSDI to many people with  			 disabilities. SSA also provides a host of work incentives (e.g., Plans for  			 Achieving Self Support (PASS), Impairment Related Work Expenses, and the Trial  			 Work Period (TWP)) that can fund some employment services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>TTW and Self-Sufficiency Program</b> -- Funded by SSA and created  			 by the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Act (TWWIA) of 1999). Any VR Agency,  			 One-Stop Career Center, or provider can become an Employment Network (EN) and  			 provide SE services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>VA</b> -- Through Vocational Rehabilitation and Education  			 (VR&amp;E) program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Private donors/charitable organizations/"Micro Enterprise  			 Centers."</b></p>
</li>
</ul><p><a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#table1a">Table 1a</a> and <a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#table1b">Table 1b</a> show  		the possible funding sources and extent of coverage by IPS/CE components. The  		checkmarks indicate availability of a potential funding for a service by an  		agency (the exact nature and the extent of the service are determined by the  		agency) when all eligibility requirements are met. For example, state VR  		agencies pay for support services that would help an individual with serious  		mental illness to obtain employment. After finding employment and after VR case  		closure, VR funds cannot be used to provide job coaching and/or ongoing SE to  		maintain employment. If an individual obtains a Ticket from the SSAs TTW  		program, then there may be additional funding for the post-placement employment  		services. Veterans receive funding support for all components of the SE  		services from the VR&amp;E since the VA sees vocational services as an  		integrated part of the rehabilitation plan. However, for all other individuals,  		SE providers have to work very hard to find funding from other resources. In  		<a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#funding">Section 3</a>, we will discuss the Medicaid as a source of  		funding in greater detail.</p>

</tr></table><h3>Case Study of Four States</h3>
<p>Working closely with ASPE and with the Federal Employment Workgroup, the  		study team identified four states that serve this population using a variety of  		methods to braid state general funds, VR funds, mental health block grants,  		Medicaid funds (rehabilitation option and/or through waivers) to provide IPS  		and CE services. These states -- Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, and Washington --  		were selected for case studies due to their relative success and/or longer  		experience in efforts to fund IPS/CE services. The objective of the case  		studies is to gather information and document the range of funding sources that  		each state uses to finance IPS/CE services and how these funding sources are  		being combined.</p>
<p><i><b>Customized Employment Services</b></i></p>
<p>While states are implementing different methods and using various  		sources of funding for IPS SE, CE services have been most often funded by  		grants and cooperative agreements with the DOL. The CE Initiative, begun by  		ODEP at the DOL in 2001, provided funding support to selected local Workforce  		Investment Boards to demonstrate how the workforce development system can  		better serve persons with significant disabilities. The goal was to build the  		capacity of statewide One-Stop Career Centers to more effectively serve people  		with severe disabilities through a CE approach.</p>
<p>The study team interviewed state officials, CE providers from the States  		of Georgia and Washington, researchers and other key informants regarding CE  		financing. The providers participated in these demonstration grants view CE as  		an effective strategy within the realm of SE services. Providers also consider  		CE to be particularly beneficial in providing services to clients with more  		complex set of needs. However, both the state representatives and the providers  		state that the infrastructure and service delivery approaches for SE are  		appropriate for delivering CE services within them, and the financing  		approaches for SE would also satisfy the needs for CE services. CE  		demonstrations funded by ODEP yield findings that suggest using diversified  		funding for CE services may prove to be successful. Diversified funding  		involves establishing a flexible funding base that includes multiple sources of  		funding support and assuring that support dollars can follow and adapt to the  		employment goals and support needs of each consumer that needs CE (DOL,  		2009).</p>
<p><i><b>Individual Placement and Support Supported Employment  		Services</b></i></p>
<p>The study team interviewed key state officials and providers in four  		states. The interviews focused on an examination of the current financing  		mechanism for IPS and CE services, historical developments, challenges,  		solutions, and implications for federal level funding mechanisms. Staff from  		the state departments of VR, mental health, and Medicaid, Medicaid managed care  		organizations, Workforce Investment Board, IPS/CE providers, academic  		researchers, members of the advocacy boards and committees participated in the  		interviews as well. </p>
<p><i>Illinois</i></p>
<p>The IPS SE program was initiated in the State of Illinois through a  		braided funding model between the Division of Mental Health (DMH) and Division  		of Rehabilitation Services (DRS). Today, the IPS services are provided at 25  		sites in 18 mental health centers. IPS programs are supported by DMH contract  		awards and DRS milestone payments for 15, 45, 90-day successful employment  		outcomes. Fee-for-service (FFS) billing of vocational services through DMH is  		established in two broad categories: Vocational code billing, or V-Codes, and  		all other FFS billings to support persons with mental illness in the community  		(Medicaid funds). The State of Illinois does not have a Medicaid waiver or  		state plan option specific to persons with serious mental illnesses. However,  		Illinois uses Medicaid Rehab Option to fund certain services that are related  		to treatment and recovery goals. For other vocational services they use general  		funds and VR milestone based payment systems. The following table presents type  		of services and payment sources.</p>

<p>Funding efforts for SE for persons with mental illness in Kansas occur  		in the publicly funded agencies of Medicaid and the state MHA, with some VR  		funding to a limited extent. Medicaid covers SE in the state plan, and pays  		certified providers an enhanced rate for using the evidence-based approach. The  		MHA invests block grant dollars in training and technical assistance at the  		University of Kansas to certify providers in EBPs, and to conduct ongoing  		fidelity monitoring of providers. VR is a payer of last resort for SE services  		to individuals on Medicaid (i.e., pays for supports that are not covered by  		Medicaid) but does also cover employment supports for individuals who are not  		on Medicaid, whether insured privately or uninsured; and indicates that 36% of  		the persons it serves have a mental illness.</p>
<p>The University of Kansas developed a Medicaid billing guide for  		providers. The guide provides details about Medicaid reimbursable and  		non-reimbursable activities. The 1915(b) waiver services are provided by or  		under the supervision of a mental health professional. Providers have a  		specific SE code that is used when billing their SE-related activities. In  		addition, providers also may bill Targeted Case Management (TCM) for specific  		case management activities for individual clients (not groups of clients).  		SE-related activities that are not reimbursed include phone calls, outreach  		attempts, transportation (without the client present), and collateral contacts  		such as with VR, mental health therapist, etc. (A case consultation code is  		used in Medicaid but its use is restricted to providers of therapy services.) A  		few providers have Pay-for-Performance (P4P) contracts with VR that can offset  		some of their non-reimbursable Medicaid services. Most providers either provide  		those services without reimbursement or use a limited pool of general funds  		appropriated to each mental health center until those funds are exhausted.</p>
<p><i>Maryland</i></p>
<p>In Maryland, two state agencies, the MHA and the Division of  		Rehabilitation Services (DORS) are promoting and supporting IPS. The MHA  		manages the public mental health system (PMHS), which includes both  		Medicaid-funded mental health services and non-Medicaid supports funded by the  		states general funds. SE providers are required to become certified  		vendors for both systems if they want to access funds. Components of SE  		services and related funding source are shown in <a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#table3">Table  		3</a>.</p>
<p>The process begins when a prospective client informs a provider of their  		interest in employment. The SE provider requests prior authorization from the  		local MHA. If the person meets the criteria (is eligible for public mental  		health services), then state-funded pre-placement services (mental health  		vocational assessment, discussion with an ES, benefits counseling) start. </p>
<p>The mental health vocational assessment includes the information needed  		for DORS to determine eligibility. Individuals determined eligible for SE in  		the mental health system are <b>presumed</b> eligible for VR services. The DORS  		counselor can view the assessment and the treatment and rehabilitation plans in  		the web-based authorization system used by MHA. Then, DORS authorizes job  		development services. When a person starts a job, DORS authorizes intensive job  		coaching. To encourage job placement, MHA pays a state-funded fee when a person  		obtains a job. After the job begins, state-funded SE services remain available  		as long as the person qualifies for PMHS. The person may also receive  		Medicaid-funded psychiatric rehabilitation if the person is eligible for  		Medicaid. Maryland also has a Medicaid Buy-In Program to enable people to  		maintain coverage while working.</p>

<p>In addition to the State Plan services, Washington is able to provide  		three additional non-traditional service types defined within its waiver under  		the authority of Section 1915(b)(3): Mental Health Clubhouse, Respite, and  		Supported Employment. The Medicaid 1915(b)(3) waiver enables states to use  		savings associated with implementation of Medicaid managed care to provide  		additional services such as, SE. Managed care related savings are distributed  		to the 13 Regional Support Networks (RSNs, mostly counties, 12 of whom are  		non-profit). CMHCs contract with local RSNs to provide SE services for people  		with mental illness. The reimbursement mechanism can vary across RSNs  		(capitated, FFS, etc.). RSNs have the discretion on the nature of services  		(e.g., crisis management, respite care, or SE, and some do not cover SE) and  		how to pay for these federally funded vocational services such as those  		provided through the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR). Later, this  		requirement was further clarified to ensure that clients received services  		while awaiting DVR decision on eligibility. </p>
<p>The components of SE funded through the waiver system include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>An assessment of work history, skills, training, education, and  			 personal career goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information about how employment will affect income and benefits  			 that the consumer is receiving because of their disability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preparation skills such as resume development and interview  			 skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Involvement with consumers served in creating and revising  			 individualized job and career development plans that include: Consumer  			 strengths; Consumer abilities; Consumer preferences; and Consumers  			 desired outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assistance in locating employment opportunities that is consistent  			 with the consumer strengths abilities, preferences, and desired  			 outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrated SE, including outreach/job coaching and support in a  			 normalized or integrated work site, if required.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>VRs primary SE responsibilities are intensive training and support  		services during the first 18 months as well as stabilization of SE. DVR  		reimburses providers using outcomes-based payments where a payment is made upon  		completion of a particular task, such as the completion of a plan of employment  		or job placement. Individuals generally begin receiving services through VR,  		but are able to begin receiving services through waiver funding if VR funding  		is unavailable, the individual is ineligible for VR, or if the individual  		already has a job but needs ongoing support (beyond the time-limited support  		available through VR).</p>
<p>In addition, in Seattle, funding from a 0.1% sales tax (approved by the  		King County Council (October 2008) and authorized by the state legislature)  		provides funding for SE services for people who do not have Medicaid coverage  		or for components of services that are not funded by the (b)(3) reinvestment.  		Eight of the mental health agencies in King County provide specialty SE  		services through this mechanism.</p>
<h3>Challenges, Obstacles, Solutions, Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>Based on the review of four states experiences, it is clear that  		the coordination of state agencies including mental health, VR, and Medicaid,  		is particularly vital in organizing a viable and successful plan for funding  		IPS and CE services for people with mental illnesses. </p>
<p><i><b>Collaboration Between Mental Health and VR is Not  		Ideal.</b></i></p>
<p>In most case study states, the collaboration between mental health and  		VR is not at the level to support all components of the SE services. Leadership  		appears to affect the nature and extent of buy-in from both agencies. In all  		four states, the collaboration between mental health and Medicaid agencies has  		led to coordination of funding streams and activities to support the adoption  		and use of SE EBP among providers. While agencies do not blend their funding  		together, they have coordinated their activities leading to enhanced payment  		opportunities for providers and the use of high fidelity practices in Illinois,  		Kansas, and Maryland. However, in some states, the reimbursement rates are not  		in line with the amount of resources needed to provide SE services among people  		with serious mental illnesses. In all states, the dependence on state general  		funds for vocational services that are paid by the mental health agency does  		not promise a stable and sustainable funding stream due to shortfalls in  		states budget.</p>
<p>Maryland has a relatively mature system in place that is established on  		a long standing collaboration between mental health and VR agencies. Leadership  		at both agencies have been instrumental in the development of such  		collaboration with mental health receiving the full support of VR after  		presenting data that evidence-based SE results in better rates of case closure  		compared with VR case closures among people with mental illness. Early on, the  		state decided to promote only evidence-based SE and this resulted in increased  		level of awareness, understanding, and experience in provision of SE for people  		with mental illness. SE providers are certified vendors of both the mental  		health and VR agencies which creates a single point of entry into the system.  		Single SE providers deliver discrete and mutually exclusive services in mental  		health and VR systems. VR counselors have guest access privileges for the  		related management information systems in order to follow rehabilitation and  		treatment information. The system is built on an enhanced funding principle  		based on the process measures that are based on the fidelity to the IPS model.  		</p>
<p><i><b>Access to VR Services is an Important Challenge for People with  		Mental Illness.</b></i></p>
<p>Individuals must meet the following three conditions to be eligible for  		VR services: (1) S/he must have a physical or mental disability which  		constitutes a substantial impediment to employment; (2) S/he must be able to  		benefit from VR services in achieving an employment outcome; and (3) S/he must  		require VR services to prepare for, enter, engage in, or retain gainful  		employment. In all four case study states, providers expressed that the rules  		and regulations around eligibility for VR services are not clear, and thus, are  		open for interpretation. They suggested that due to the differences in the  		interpretation of the regulations by the VR counselors, eligibility  		determinations are not uniform across the state regional areas. The requirement  		of health assessment to determine mental health disability, which may take up  		to 8 hours of medical examination, proves to be an important deterrent for  		people with mental illness to even apply for VR benefits. In addition, the  		average length of time to determine eligibility for services may be between 30  		to 90 days after application. In some cases, individuals may not be able to  		receive Medicaid payments for vocational services (i.e., under a waiver  		program) while their application is pending with the state VR office. </p>
<p>Despite these issues affecting access to VR benefits, people with mental  		health disability constitute the largest group of clients for many state VR  		agencies. Nevertheless, there are possibly still many more potential clients  		with mental health disability who are having problems in accessing VR benefits.  		VR has been paying particular attention to tracking and reporting the  		prevalence of mental illness among persons they serve. However, this does not  		appear to be an indicator influencing how they adapt their program policies,  		rules, regulations or procedures and P4P program. While VR is emphasizing  		innovative P4P contracts, the milestones for payment create disincentives for  		providers working with persons with mental illness as persons with mental  		illness are less likely to meet the timelines in the VR P4P. </p>
<p><i><b>VRs Focus on Case Closure is not Aligned with IPS  		Principles.</b></i></p>
<p>VR has a particular focus on employment outcomes and case closures.  		However, the principles of IPS allow for rapid job search and trying a variety  		of jobs prior to maintaining stable employment. Thus, the principles of the IPS  		model can sometimes be at odds with the VR focus. In case study states,  		interviews showed that there is very limited implementation of co-location of  		VR counselors at CMHC. It is hard to build such relationships and hard to  		sustain traffic to sustain such VR resources on site. The incentives to serve  		people with mental illness should be aligned with all agencies objectives  		and strategic missions. For example, VRs focus is on outcomes and the funding  		is contingent on performance. However, outcome-focused incentives may not  		always be consistent with the evidence-based approach to SE and/or the needs of  		persons with mental illness. It may lead to cherry picking  		selection (targeted selection) effect which is inconsistent with the IPS of SE.  		Since the evidence base is already established for IPS employment services,  		process based (e.g., fidelity) reimbursement mechanisms can improve access to  		services for people with mental illness by changing incentives, thus creating a  		reliable, sustainable funding system for providers.</p>
<p><i><b>TTW Payments are not Aligned with IPS Principles.</b></i></p>
<p>The goal of the TTW program is to increase opportunities and choices for  		Social Security disability beneficiaries to obtain employment, VR, and other  		support services from public and private providers, employers, and other  		organizations. The TTW program is for people who are already awarded Social  		Security disability benefits under the adult rules and are receiving cash  		benefits. Eligibility depends on making timely progress towards  		reaching employment goals -- that includes following work plan and meeting  		deadlines specified by the program. </p>
<p>SSAs TTW pays provider for milestones and outcomes achieved after  		Ticket assignment and after a Ticket holder goes to work. Milestones are  		triggered when a beneficiarys gross earnings are above the specified  		threshold, and outcome payments are attained when the beneficiarys net  		earnings are above Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA) and the beneficiary is in  		zero cash payment status. Phase 1 Milestones may not available to an EN if,  		during the 18 months prior to the beneficiary first assigning his/her Ticket,  		the beneficiary worked and had earnings at a level equal to or above the amount  		designed as the TWP level earnings for that year. </p>
<p>Individuals with serious mental illness are usually unemployed at  		program intake, take longer to obtain employment, require extensive  		postemployment support, and may not desire full-time employment with earnings  		above SGA, which threatens cash benefits and health insurance coverage. In all  		four case study states, state representatives and providers suggested that  		provider payment system offers too little financial incentive to serve certain  		clients, including those with mental illnesses and mental retardation. Since,  		actual earnings seldom reaches levels that would triggerpayments to providers,  		it is still debatable whether the TTW program adequately compensates providers  		who serve people with psychiatric disabilities. In addition, follow-up  		employment data collection proves to be a very costly effort and due to the  		risk of not getting an adequate level of reimbursement, mental health providers  		do not want to invest in a follow-up data collection process. Efforts to  		identify providers or entities, such as Medicaid managed care organizations, to  		become ENs have not materialized due to concerns about access to data, data  		tracking and timelines before outcome based reimbursement is received. Some  		providers and VR agencies interviewed during the case studies have engaged in  		TTW but do not feel that the principles of such payment is very much aligned  		with the IPS principles and the experiences of people with serious mental  		illness in the labor market.</p>
<p><i><b>One-Stop Career Centers do not have the Expertise to Serve People  		with Mental Illness.</b></i></p>
<p>There are very limited partnerships with DOL funded One-Stop Career  		Centers. CMHCs often do not have direct relationships with the Workforce  		Development Board and have little familiarity with the potential use of WIA  		funds. One-Stop Career Centers, in general, do not have expertise to serve  		persons with serious mental illness and in most cases they refer clients to VR  		agency. It appears that most One-Stop Career Centers have been trained and  		equipped with adaptive technologies to serve persons with physical disabilities  		and, to some extent, to serve persons with developmental disabilities; however,  		there have been almost no specific trainings related to serving persons with  		serious mental illness. In addition, the performance measures for One-Stop  		Career Centers (e.g., employment rate, earnings rate, literacy rate (youth),  		and retention) may create inadvertent disincentives to invest in serving  		persons with serious mental illness. In Washington State, the Work Force  		Development Board has been actively examining ways to improve access to their  		WorkSource Centers for people with mental illness and their participation in  		program services. Some WorkSourceCenters in Washington have made attempts to  		increase access to people with mental illness through grant funds such as, CE  		and Disability Navigator Projects. However, such efforts were not sustainable  		after the grant funding ceased. Providers in Washington see CE as an innovative  		flavor of SE and see it as a valuable tool particularly for some people with  		mental illness that require a more individualized (customized) approach to  		employment. Also, in Washington State, Medicaid managed care savings go through  		RSNs -- mostly counties -- and the RSNs have a large variation in their  		approach to SE. The system may require changes in order to attain a consistent  		approach to SE service in Washington. </p>
<p><i><b>Stronger Federal Policies Coupled with Steady Federal Funding that  		is Based on Process Measures are Needed to Provide Employment Support to  		Individuals with Serious Mental Illness.</b></i></p>
<p>Stronger federal policies are needed to get states to commit to  		provision of vocational services for people with mental illnesses. Such  		policies should lead various state agencies to work together and collaborate  		effectively. These policies should be backed by a sustainable federal funding  		stream. Rules and regulations should be predictable, easy to understand, clear,  		and not left to individual interpretation. There is a need for investment in  		the data infrastructure to streamline the processes and improve interagency  		collaborations in serving individuals. Also, providers and states need  		education, training, and technical assistance related to the most effective use  		of TTW funding. Collaborations and partnerships with DOLs One-Stop Career  		Centers and use of related WIA funds should be promoted. The incentives to  		serve people with mental illness should be aligned with all agencies  		objectives and strategic missions. For example, VRs focus on outcomes and  		funding contingent on performance may be aligned with the VRs own mission  		but it may not always be consistent with the principles of IPS and/or the  		mission of DMH. Since the evidence base is already established for IPS SE  		services, process based (e.g., fidelity) reimbursement mechanisms can improve  		access to services for people with mental illness by changing incentives and  		create a reliable, sustainable funding system for providers. Attitudinal  		barriers and stigma regarding ability to work must be specifically addressed in  		federal agency policies and training. Training efforts to support individuals  		with disabilities must specifically address persons with mental illness and  		their right to work.</p>
<h2><a name="funding" id="funding">3. CURRENT STATE LEVEL MEDICAID FUNDING  		OPTIONS</a><sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#note3">3</a></font></sup></h2>
<p>States use a range of strategies to cover services needed by individuals  		with mental illness to live and work in the community. Exactly what services  		are available and how they are used by providers to assist people in accessing  		and sustaining competitive employment varies and depends in part on how States  		use available Medicaid state plan options and waivers. It is important to keep  		in mind that the Medicaid program operates under broad federal guidelines but  		is administered by the states. This means that Medicaid programs vary  		considerably from state to state in terms of who is covered, services provided,  		and how those services are delivered. While there are certain mandatory  		benefits that must be covered through each states Medicaid plan, such as  		outpatient hospital services, physician services, and emergency room care,  		states can elect to amend their Medicaid plan to include a variety of  		additional optional benefits. For example traditional behavioral  		health services such as diagnostic evaluations, individual therapy and  		medication management are often provided through the mandatory outpatient  		hospital benefit and/or the optional clinic benefit. The behavioral health  		services offered through the outpatient hospital or clinic options however, are  		limited in terms of service location and the types of providers who are  		eligible to deliver the services and under what conditions (e.g., must be  		provided under the direction of a physician). As discussed below, the  		limitations inherent in both the clinic option and the mandatory outpatient  		hospital benefit have led some states to pursue other optional benefits that  		allow for greater flexibility in service location, provider type, and benefit  		design so as to better serve individuals with mental illness in community-based  		settings. </p>
<h3>Rehabilitation Option</h3>
<p>The Rehab Option as this option is commonly referred, is  		used by states to offer services and supports to individuals with mental  		illness. 42 CFR §440.130(d) defines rehabilitation services as including,  		any medical or remedial service recommended by a physician or other  		licensed practitioner of the healing arts, within the scope of his practice  		under state law, for maximum reduction of physical or mental disability and  		restoration of a recipient to his best possible functional level. The  		advantage of using the Rehab Option as opposed to the Clinic Option is that it  		allows for greater flexibility in service location including home, work and  		other community settings, provider type, and benefit design. States have used  		the Rehab Option to cover illness management and recovery programs, peer  		specialists, ACT programs, community support programs, and mobile crisis  		intervention services. </p>
<p>The Rehab Option as it relates to SE, can be used to offer those  		services that support an individual in their mental health recovery thereby  		assisting them in attaining and sustaining employment; as opposed to providing  		direct job placement activities or coaching/training on specific job-related  		tasks. Under the Rehab Option only those services and activities that are  		considered <i>rehabilitative</i> as defined in 42 CFR §440.130(d) can be  		covered. Services that are <i>habilitative</i> in nature are not permissible  		under the Rehab Option. A State Medicaid Director Letter from June 1992  		distinguished the two by clarifying that the focus of rehabilitative services  		is to assist individuals in attaining their best possible functional levels;  		while habilitativeservices are intended to assist an individual in acquiring,  		retaining, and improving self-help and adaptive skills, but are not intended to  		remove or reduce individuals' disabilities.</p>
<p>For example, some states have elected to include services provided by  		peer specialists, someone who is a consumer of behavioral health services,  		under their Rehab Option. While a peer specialist could discuss with an  		individual how to better manage symptoms of her mental illness that interfere  		with her ability to maintain her job; using a peer specialist to teach her  		<i>how</i> to perform her specific job task(s) would <i>not</i> be acceptable  		under the Rehab Option. ACT is another example of a service covered by some  		states under their Rehab Option that includes a SE component. ACT is a  		nationally recognized EBP for treatment of individuals with serious mental  		illness. ACT teams will often include vocational specialists whose function is  		to assess for symptoms of the individuals mental illness that might  		interfere with the individuals ability to attain or sustain competitive  		employment, and plan and develop interventions that would promote that  		individuals ability to obtain or maintain a job. The vocational  		specialist may work with the individual in developing a system to help them to  		remember to take prescribed medications during the work day. It is important to  		keep in mind however that the vocational specialist on an ACT team that is  		reimbursed using Medicaid dollars under the Rehab Option can only perform those  		activities that would be considered rehabilitative not habilitative. States  		have been audited by the HHS Office of the Inspector General for delivering  		services under the Rehab Option that upon audit were found to be habilitative  		not rehabilitative in nature.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Targeted Case Management</h3>
<p>Under 1915(g) of the Social Security Act, states may elect to provide  		case management services to a defined or targeted group of Medicaid  		eligible individuals, such as individuals with serious mental illness. The TCM  		option allows states to cover case management services for Medicaid  		beneficiaries only in specific geographic areas as opposed to the entire state,  		and/or to offer a benefit, case management, only to a particular population  		defined by the state rather than having to offer case management to all  		eligible beneficiaries. States specify who is qualified to deliver case  		management services under TCM, which may include criteria specific to working  		with a particular population. In the case of states that use TCM for persons  		with mental illness, the state may further limit TCM providers to specific,  		selected entities. </p>
<p>The case management interim final rule as updated by 74 FR 31183 in June  		2009, describes the following as allowable activities under TCM:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Assessment of an eligible individual to determine service needs,  			 including those necessary to determine the need for any medical, educational,  			 social, or other services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development of a specific care plan that specifies case management  			 goals and a course of action to respond to the assessed needs of the eligible  			 individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Referral and related activities to help an individual obtain needed  			 services, including activities that help link the eligible individual with  			 medical, social, educational providers, or other programs and  			 services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring of the plan and performing follow-up activities necessary  			 to ensure that the care plan is effectively implemented and adequately  			 addresses the needs of the eligible individual.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The advantage of using TCM is that it can be used to assist the target  		population with gaining access to needed medical, social, educational, and  		other services regardless if those services are covered by Medicaid. If a state  		has defined the seriously mentally ill as a target population, then a case  		manager could work with an individual who has expressed interest in working in  		gaining access to vocational services or job placement supports as specified in  		the individuals plan of care.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that a case manager can only bill for  		those activities outlined above (e.g., assessment, plan development, referral,  		etc.) under the auspices of TCM. Other activities such as providing direct  		clinical or therapeutic services are not allowable activities under TCM. States  		must use other strategies (e.g., clinic option, services under the Rehab  		Option) to provide availability of Medicaid services that are indicated in a  		TCM plan of care.</p>
<h3>1915(c) Home and Community-Based Services Waivers</h3>
<p>States use 1915(c) waivers to offer an array of community-based services  		to: (a) persons over 65 or disabled, or both; (b) persons with intellectual or  		developmental disabilities; or (c) persons with mental illness, who might  		otherwise require costly institution-based care in a nursing facility,  		intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded (ICF-MR), or a hospital.  		States may also elect to include any optional eligibility groups that are  		included under their state plan in the waiver. This would include individuals  		covered under Medicaid Buy-In programs authorized by the Balanced  		Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 and the TWWIA of 1997. Medicaid Buy-In  		programs (discussed in detail in a later section) allow working adults with  		disabilities whose income would otherwise make them ineligible for Medicaid to  		access Medicaid services and benefits by paying a deductible or income adjusted  		premium. </p>
<p>As mentioned above, while a 1915(c) waiver affords states the option to  		cover a myriad of services that providers could utilize to help individuals  		interested in working to attain and maintain competitive employment such as SE,  		job coaching, prevocational services, psycho-social rehabilitation  		services,<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#note5">5</a></font></sup> and case  		management, few states have utilized a 1915(c) waiver to offer home and  		community-based services (HCBS) to individuals with mental illness. To date  		only, a handful of states have used a 1915(c) waiver to cover services for  		adults with mental illness due to the difficulty in calculating cost-neutrality  		for individuals with mental illness because of the institutions of mental  		disease (IMD) rule. Under 1915(c) in order to be eligible for waiver services,  		the individual must meet established criteria for institutional level of care,  		which explicitly excludes IMD for individuals who are over 21 and under 65  		years of age from the list of qualified institutions.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#note6">6</a></font></sup> Since an IMD is not considered a  		qualified institution,<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#note7">7</a></font></sup>  		this makes it difficult for states to use a 1915(c) waiver to support  		individuals with mental illness.</p>
<p>Additional issues of note when considering whether a 1915(c) waiver is  		the best approach for covering services for individuals with mental illness  		include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The 1915(c) waiver authority permits states to cap or limit the  			 number of individuals served under the waiver. This has led to long waiting  			 lists for access to waiver services in many states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For persons eligible for Medicaid through a Buy-In  			 program (if included under the states Medicaid plan), he/she must  			 <b>also</b> meet the institutional level of care criteria in order to be  			 eligible for the waiver. Currently states may only cover one target population  			 per waiver. This regulatory requirement leads to states operating more than one  			 waiver if they want to serve multiple target populations, even if those  			 populations have similar functional limitations. However, through an Advanced  			 Notice of Proposed Rule Making at 74 FR 29453, CMS has indicated this may  			 change in the future. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>1915(i) Home and Community-Based Services Option</h3>
<p>For states interested in supporting individuals with serious mental  		illness in attaining and sustaining competitive work, the 1915(i) HCBS state  		plan option presents them with a vehicle to do just that. Differences in the  		design of the 1915(i), such as using needs-based rather than institutional  		level of care eligibility criteria, make it easier for states to develop  		services for persons with serious mental illness than under 1915(c). While the  		ability to offer HCBS including SE and prevocational services via a state plan  		option as opposed to a 1915(c) waiver or 1115 demonstration program, has been  		available to states since enabling legislation as part of the Deficit Reduction  		Act (DRA) was enacted in 2005, few states have taken advantage of this option.  		This was in part due the capping of financial eligibility at 150% of the  		federal poverty level (FPL) level. Because 1915(c) waivers allow states to  		enroll individuals with incomes higher than 150% of the FPL, states could not  		use the 1915(i) for persons with incomes greater than 150% of the FPL. Also  		individuals with disabilities eligible for Medicaid under buy-in  		programs with incomes greater than 150% of FPL were not able to take advantage  		of services such as SE available under 1915(i). States were also limited to a  		more restricted range of services than was allowed under the 1915(c) waiver  		program. </p>
<p>Section 2402 of the Affordable Care Act modifies the original  		legislation and makes major changes and improvements to how states may amend  		their state plans using the 1915(i) option; including changing the issues  		described above that made the 1915(i) option less attractive to states. These  		changes became effective October 1, 2010. Modifications to the 1915(i) state  		plan option as part of the Affordable Care Act include:<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Permits states to propose additional HCBS beyond those that are  			 defined in statute in order to design benefit packages that are customized to a  			 particular population. For example, states are now able to cover non-medical  			 transportation, home accessibility adaptations, and community transition  			 services that were previously not permitted under the former regulations  			 governing 1915(i).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under 1915(i) individuals do not have to meet institutional level of  			 care in order to be eligible for the waiver; states develop criteria based on  			 need. This allows states to offer HCBS to individuals whose needs are  			 substantial, but not serious enough to meet institutional level of care.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offers states the option of expanding eligibility to 300% of the SSI  			 Federal Benefit Rate (FBR) for those individuals who would otherwise be  			 eligible for HCBS under 1915(c), (d), or (e) waiver or an 1115 demonstration  			 program. This is a significant change from the prior iteration of 1915(i) as it  			 allows States to create a new optional eligibility category, allowing them to  			 extend the services available as part 1915(i) to more individuals than  			 previously allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services offered under 1915(i) must be offered statewide. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>States are now permitted to target 1915(i) benefits to certain  			 populations (effectively waiving the comparability requirement) to allow them  			 to design different benefit packages for different target populations. For  			 example, states could design a benefit package to meet the needs of individuals  			 with serious and persistent mental illness. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>States are no longer allowed to limit the number of individuals who  			 can receive services offered as part a states 1915(i) Services State Plan  			 Option or create waiting lists. This important change to 1915(i) will allow  			 more individuals to take advantage of HCBS that can assist persons in gaining  			 and sustaining employment.</p>

</tr></table><p>If states elect to pursue the 1915(i), it is an opportunity to provide  		individuals with mental illness a more comprehensive array of HCBS that could  		support them in attaining and sustaining competitive employment. There is no  		cost-neutrality requirement in the 1915(i) state plan option nor do individuals  		have to meet institutional level of care criteria; these functional differences  		in the structure of 1915(i) reduce historical barriers to states covering HCBS  		for individuals with serious mental illness.</p>
<h3>Additional Medicaid Strategies</h3>
<p>Additional strategies that states can use alone or in combination with  		some of the strategies outlined above to offer services and supports necessary  		for individuals with mental illness to participate in competitive work  		include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>1115 Research and Demonstration Programs</b> are used by states  			 to design and test policy innovations that further the objectives of the  			 Medicaid program. States have used their 1115 authority to expand  			 eligibility to otherwise ineligible groups such as childless adults, to provide  			 for services not typically covered, and employ innovative service delivery and  			 reimbursement systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>1915(b) Managed Care/Freedom of Choice waivers</b> are used by  			 states to require the enrollment of eligible individuals in managed care  			 (including persons dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid) and/or limit the  			 number of providers. Savings under 1915(b)(3) can also be used by plans to  			 cover additional services such as SE. Many states also elect to operate 1915(b)  			 waivers concurrently with 1915(c) HCBS waivers in order to employ managed care  			 strategies in the operation of the waiver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Section 1915(a)</b> of the Social Security Act allows states to  			 contract with a managed care vendor(s) to manage services for Medicaid  			 beneficiaries who voluntarily elect to enroll in the managed care plan. It is  			 important to note that 1915(a) and the 1932 SPA authority described below are  			 managed care enrollment authorities only and must be joined with other  			 strategies in order to offer HCBS services for individuals with mental  			 illness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>1932 State Plan Amendment</b> authority allows states to enroll  			 certain allowable populations into managed care without a waiver. Enrollment in  			 managed care under this authority must be voluntary for dually eligible  			 persons, Native Americans (unless meeting certain standards), and certain  			 children with special needs. Authorized as part of the BBA and TWWIA Medicaid  			 buy-in programs have been used by many states to afford access to  			 Medicaid services and benefits for working adults with disabilities whose  			 income would otherwise make them ineligible for Medicaid. As commercial  			 employer-sponsored insurance plans do not provide the array of services that  			 are offered under Medicaid (e.g., psycho-social rehabilitative services, HCBS,  			 etc.), Medicaid buy-in programs are an important tool for those individuals  			 with mental illness who want to work but would be challenged to gain or  			 maintain employment without access to the services and supports covered under  			 Medicaid. In order to buy-in to the program individuals pay a  			 premium adjusted for their income. It is important to note that this provides  			 an opportunity for persons to obtain access to Medicaid services only and must  			 be joined with other strategies in order to offer SE for individuals with  			 mental illness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administered by the CMS the <b>Medicaid Infrastructure Grant  			 (MIG)</b> program has been used by states to remove barriers to employment for  			 individuals with disabilities. Authorized under Section 203 of the TWWIA, MIGs  			 are designed to assist states in implementing Medicaid buy-in  			 programs, developing comprehensive employment systems that promote linkage  			 between Medicaid and non-Medicaid services. 2011 is the final year for which  			 Congress has authorized funding for the MIG program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration</b> was  			 enacted by the DRA of 2005. It is part of a comprehensive, coordinated strategy  			 to assist states, in collaboration with stakeholders, to make widespread  			 changes to their long-term care support systems. The aim is to reduce their  			 reliance on institutional care, while developing community-based long-term care  			 supports, enabling the elderly and people with disabilities to fully  			 participate in their communities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Guidance to States</h3>
<p>Given the time and significant resources involved in making changes to a  		states Medicaid platform (use of state plan options and/or waivers), it  		is unlikely that a state will pursue developing a waiver or amending their  		state plan simply to add SE as a covered service. The work described above will  		likely be conducted as part of larger initiatives going on in the state that  		might include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Developing EBPs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rebalancing the long-term care system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximizing opportunities for federal match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting recovery-oriented care for individuals with serious mental  			 illness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing unemployment among individuals with disabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>SE should be introduced as an important option for meeting the goals of  		any of the initiatives outlined above. The benefit to including SE in these  		discussions is that by offering an individual with serious mental illness the  		opportunity to engage in meaningful work states can simultaneously meet broader  		goals and initiatives that benefit other stakeholders as well. States should  		undertake the following steps:</p>
<p>First, states should begin by identifying what system outcomes they want  		to achieve. States would benefit in discussions with consumers and stakeholders  		including individuals affiliated with local mental health recovery communities  		or clubhouse programs, service providers, the state National Alliance on Mental  		Illness chapter, State Mental Health Planning and Advisory Councils, and other  		advocacy organizations. These groups can provide information about necessary  		services and supports. </p>
<p>Second, states need to project the financial resources needed to achieve  		the identified goals. This includes expected cost for services based on and  		numbers of persons who may use the service.</p>
<p>Third, states need to assess how they are currently expending their  		dollars for persons with mental illness across funding streams. Are they  		attending day treatment or partial hospital programs, participating in  		sheltered workshops, living in hospitals? In many instances, these individuals  		are receiving other Medicaid or state-funded services that for many, SE could  		replace. This analysis will help identify opportunities for re-direction of  		funds from high-cost poor-outcome services to SE services.</p>
<p>Fourth, states need to examine their current Medicaid platform and  		assess their ability to use those strategies to fund SE and other services,  		such as case management, that are necessary to successfully deliver SE to  		persons with mental illness. This analysis will inform states on whether their  		existing Medicaid program can be amended to include SE and other services; or  		if they would have to seek new options or waivers for such coverage. </p>
<p>Finally, while understanding Medicaid opportunities is key, the next  		step for states involve identifying strategies to collaborate across funding  		streams such as amongst the Medicaid agency and the state mental health and VR  		authorities. Given that Medicaid has certain restrictions and limitations on  		its use, identifying possibilities where Medicaid dollars can be blended or  		braided to more fully exploit the possibilities for bringing evidence-based SE  		programs to scale in the state is crucial. This is especially true in light of  		findings that suggest that programs that integrated mental health care with  		vocational support services had the best employment outcomes.<sup><font><a href="../daltcp/reports/2011/supempFR.htm#note9">9</a></font></sup> For example it might be that  		covering the service of supported employment through a 1915(c)  		waiver or 1915(i) SPA is not necessarily what is needed (or even allowed if  		offered by the state under the Rehabilitation Act or Individuals with  		Disabilities Education Act for transition-age youth). For some states using the  		available Medicaid options to develop a more robust array of clinical supports  		for individuals with mental illness that can be integrated with vocational  		services is the most feasible option. For example including peer counselors as  		a covered service under the Rehab Option who can work as part of a team that  		might include a case manager funded under the TCM option, who coordinates a  		range of needed supports and services, and an ES paid for through VR dollars,  		might be one option for bringing SE to scale.</p>
<h3>Summary of Findings -- State Funding of Individual  		Placement and Support/Customized Employment</h3>
<p>In summary, we find that the limited implementation of IPS/CE is due in  		large measure to the difficulty states and local programs have in using the  		various mainstream funding mechanisms that could be used to finance IPS/CE.  		There are (or have been) a variety of sources to fund IPS/CE -- direct grants  		and contracts from states (e.g., from state VR and behavioral health agencies)  		and the Federal Government (e.g., from DOL and SAMHSA), various strategies for  		Medicaid reimbursement, TTW from the SSA, and partnership agreements between  		behavioral health agencies and VR agencies. States and local providers each  		describe considerable difficulty in obtaining and utilizing these resources to  		finance IPS/CE on an ongoing basis. It often takes personal relationships to  		build the partnerships required, and these can end when the individual leaders  		change positions. Some of the grant programs have disappeared. And some of the  		potential financing mechanisms are complex and difficult to implement,  		particularly Medicaid. </p>
