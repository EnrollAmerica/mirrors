</dl><h2><a name="sectionI" id="sectionI">I. BACKGROUND</a> </h2>
<p>Head Start programs provide comprehensive child development,  		educational, health, nutritional, social and other services to predominantly  		low-income preschool children and their families. In recognition of the  		important role parents play in their child's development, Head Start programs  		are required to provide for the direct participation of parents in the  		development, conduct, and direction of local programs. </p>
<p>In FY 1989, over 1900 grantees and delegate agencies provided services  		to over 450,000 children, 65 percent of whom were four-year-olds. These  		agencies operated 24,000 classrooms and employed 80,000 staff nationwide. As a  		result of Head Start's emphasis on parental involvement, 32 percent of Head  		Start staff were parents of current or former Head Start children. In FY 1989,  		Head Start programs spent over $1.2 billion, for an average annual  		cost-per-child of about $2,660. </p>
<p>The President's FY 1991 budget provides a $500 million increase for Head  		Start. This would mark the single largest funding increase for Head Start since  		it began providing full-year services in 1966. This expansion of Head Start,  		taking place in the context of many other program and policy developments, has  		led policy-makers to explore more closely the evidence of its success. </p>
<h2><a name="sectionII" id="sectionII">II. WHAT DOES THE RESEARCH SHOW?</a> </h2>
<h3>Head Start Evaluations</h3>
<h4><i>The Westinghouse study, 1969 </i></h4>
<p>In 1969, the Westinghouse Learning Corporation completed the first major  		evaluation of Head Start. <b>Summer programs were found to have no lasting  		impact. Full year programs resulted in cognitive and language gains at the  		first grade level but appeared to "fade out" by second or third grade. Gains  		were particularly noteworthy among blacks and among children attending Head  		Start in central cities and in the Southeast.</b> </p>
<p>This study has been criticized for having a faulty design, leading to  		biased results. First of all, the comparison group selected may not have been  		as disadvantaged as those in Head Start. Thus, results showing little  		difference in the outcomes between the two groups may simply reflect the higher  		initial starting point of the comparison group rather than the lower  		achievement of the Head Start group. Consequently, the impact of Head start may  		be systematically underestimated. </p>
<p>Second, the design did not control for environmental  		circumstances--either at home or at school--leading to uncertainty as to  		whether short-lived child outcomes truly reflect effects of Head Start or  		reflect subsequent effects of the home and school environments. For example,  		some have argued that since low-income children compete for slots in  		compensatory programs, Head Start children (upon entering public school) are no  		longer among the most needy. Available slots in compensatory programs are then  		targeted to those disadvantaged children who did <i>not</i> have the benefit of  		participating in Head Start. Thus, it may not be that Head Start gains  		"fade-out"; it may be that the former comparison group catches up. </p>
<p>In addition, this study did not evaluate the health and nutritional  		components of Head Start programs, nor did it assess the effects of parental  		involvement in Head Start on children's cognitive and socioemotional outcomes  		or on parent outcomes. Yet these components are as integral to the Head Start  		program as is the education component. Consequently, this study yields  		incomplete information on Head Start's effectiveness. </p>
<h4><i>Head Start Synthesis Project, 1985 </i></h4>
<p>There has not been a major evaluation of Head Start since the  		Westinghouse study. However, there have been many small evaluations of selected  		aspects of various Head Star programs across the country. Despite the wide  		array of research designs, sample sizes, and outcome measures used, a  		"meta-analysis" was conducted in 1985 to glean basic findings from these  		diverse studies. This "Head Start Synthesis Project" reviewed over 210 reports  		of research on the effects of local Head Start programs and found that Head  		Start results in <b>"significant, immediate gains in cognitive test scores,  		socioemotional test scores, and health status, (though) in the long-run,  		cognitive and socioemotional test scores of former Head Start students do not  		remain superior to those of disadvantaged children who did not attend Head  		Start." A small subset of these studies found former Head Start children were  		more likely to be promoted to the next grade and less likely to be assigned to  		special education classes (McKey, et al., 1985).</b> </p>
<p>Unlike the Westinghouse study, this synthesis project did evaluate the  		health and nutrition components, and found that <b>"Head Start is very  		successful in improving the general health of the children it serves, providing  		needed health care, and improving existing health care within communities  		(though) it appears less successful in its health education efforts and in its  		efforts to influence better home health practices."</b> </p>
<p>In addition, this synthesis explored the effectiveness of parental  		involvement and found <b>"evidence that parents who actively participate in the  		program have high levels of psychological well-being, improve their economic  		and social status, and have children with high levels of developmental  		achievement."</b> Unfortunately, the study found that it is usually the same  		small number of parents who actively participate on an on-going basis.  		<b>Furthermore, parent education programs designed to influence child-rearing  		practices in the home have had mixed results.</b> </p>
<p>Finally, the synthesis study assessed the effect of Head Start on  		communities and found <b>"Head Start has been associated with positive changes  		(which) usually result in increased and more comprehensive social and health  		services for the poor and in more responsive educational programs. Greater  		visibility and greater parent participation both increase the effectiveness of  		a local Head Start program in affecting community institutions."</b> Based on  		these findings, this study recommended more extensive collaboration with the  		public schools to bridge the "discontinuity in educational approaches between  		Head Start and public schools." </p>
<p>This synthesis has been criticized, mainly for its use of meta-analysis.  		This technique of standardizing findings across many studies of various designs  		may have the tendency of minimizing the results found in specific studies.  		Because it may "over-aggregate" results, studies using meta-analysis may  		conceal more distilled findings. But since this is likely to have the effect of  		underestimating effects, Head Start children may be doing even <i>better</i>  		than these results suggest. </p>
<h4><i>Path to the Future: Long-term Effects of Head Start In the  		Philadelphia School District </i></h4>
<p>This 1987 study used ten years of data on almost 15,000 children who  		attended Philadelphia Follow Through programs in 33 schools in the city's  		school district. (The Follow Through program serves children from kindergarten  		through third grade.) Since enrollment in Head Start is not a prerequisite for  		enrollment in Follow Through, this data included children who had and had not  		attended Head Start. </p>
<p><b>Results indicate that Head Start children more often avoided serious  		school problems, were less frequently retained in grade from kindergarten  		through sixth grade, had better attendance rates and lower attrition than  		non-Head Start children. Head Start children performed slightly (but  		non-significantly) better on achievement tests than their non-Head Start peers  		up to third grade, but there was no difference on achievement test scores from  		third to sixth grade (Copple, Cline, &amp; Smith, 1987).</b> </p>
<p>The Philadelphia data is based on a large number of children and  		schools, collected over a long period of time, and represents typical Head  		Start programs more accurately than the samples in previous large-scale  		studies. Unfortunately, the outcomes measured related only to school success  		and not to any of the more comprehensive goals of the Head Start program. In  		addition, the Philadelphia data base is--in a statistical sense--a "noisy" one:  		varied record-keeping over the ten years of data collection and policy changes  		during this period increases the variability in the data. Increased variability  		tends to depress the real magnitude of an effect size. However, this suggests  		that any findings are likely to <b>underestimate</b> the true effects of Head  		start, and the detection of statistically significant effects should be take  		seriously. </p>
<h4><i>Program Model Effects Study </i></h4>
<p>This 1987 study compared the relative effects on parents and children of  		three different Head Start delivery models (center-based, home-based, and a  		combination of center and home-based) of a grantee in rural Pennsylvania.  		Outcomes were measured from the time children were enrolled in Head Start  		through kindergarten. </p>
<p><b>No difference was found in children's cognitive development across  		the three delivery models. Parents enrolled in the home-based model  		demonstrated greater gains in academic stimulation of their children; in the  		use of toys, games, and reading material; and in encouraging their children to  		learn. Home-based parents also demonstrated greater growth in knowledge of  		child development and parent empowerment. (University of Delaware,  		1988).</b></p>
<h4><i>Oregon Longitudinal Study </i></h4>
<p>This 1989 study is assessing former Head Start children, currently in  		kindergarten through fifth grade, on academic performance and placement  		indices. <b>Results show that former Head Start children performed at grade  		level on achievement tests in reading, math, and language use in grades 3-5. In  		addition, former Head Start children were more likely to be enrolled in "gifted  		and talented" programs than their non-Head Start peers. Finally, former Head  		Start children were less likely to be enrolled in special education classes  		than the district-wide average enrollment rates (Norris, 1989).</b> </p>
<h4><i>"A Look at What Head Start Children Are Learning Now" </i></h4>
<p>A recent University of Arizona study on Head Start transition effects  		used the "Head Start Measures Battery" (consisting of language, math, nature  		and science, perception, reading, and social development scales) to assess Head  		Start children's developmental level and provided an experimental group of  		elementary school teachers with this information so they could plan  		individually-tailored activities. Comparison with a control group revealed that  		<b>significantly greater gains on achievement and cognitive tests are made when  		public schools were provided with information that enabled them to provide  		developmentally-appropriate programs to children (Bergan, Feld, &amp;  		Saladeczek, 1989).</b> </p>
<h4><i>Head Start Family Impact Study </i></h4>
<p>This 1988 study evaluated the effect of two different Head Start  		interventions on family functioning. Eighty-one children enrolled in a  		Minnesota Head Start program were divided into two groups: one group remained  		enrolled in the current Head Start program, and the other group experienced an  		"enhanced" program with intensive parental involvement. Parents in the enhanced  		program were involved in learning activities with their children 2-3 times as  		often as parents in the "regular" Head Start program. Family functioning, as  		measured by the FACES III (Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales)  		instrument, was assessed for both treatment groups and a control group, made up  		of 21 children on the Head Start waiting list. </p>
<p><b>Results indicate that family dysfunction scores diminished  		significantly for families in "enriched" programs, and diminished somewhat for  		families in the regular Head Start program, compared to control group families.  		In addition, mothers in both Head Start groups were more likely to assess their  		child as competent --and were more competent themselves--compared to control  		group mothers (Leik and Chalkey, 1989).</b> </p>
<h4><i>Other Head Start Studies </i></h4>
<p>Finally, a number of studies (Cawly and Goodstein, 1966; Bee, 1981;  		Shipman, 1976; Hebbler, 1981; Copple, 1987) revealed that <b>Head Start  		children have developed the necessary social competencies to adapt more readily  		to their school environment and experience more "real life" academic success  		than their no-treatment peers.</b> </p>
<h3>Other Preschool Program Evaluations </h3>
<p>Findings from other evaluations of preschool programs suggest the  		potential effectiveness of <b>high quality</b> early childhood programs. </p>
<h4><i>Consortium for Longitudinal Studies, 1982 </i></h4>
<p>The Consortium was formed to combine the projects of 12 researchers who  		had conducted preschool programs in the 1960s. A follow-up study using common  		measures was conducted in 1976-1977. Program design and curricula varied;  		included were both home-based and center-based programs. The 3,700 program  		participants were poor and minority families, with a heavy representation of  		black families. Children ranged from age three months to five years at the time  		of program entry. By the time of the Consortium's follow-up, they ranged in age  		from 9 years to 19 years. </p>
<p>Researchers found positive results from preschool attendance.  		<b>Children who participated in preschool programs were more likely to succeed  		in school as measured by staying on grade level with their peers and avoiding  		inappropriate placement in special education classes. Lasting gains in academic  		achievement tests (particularly mathematics) were noted. However, intelligence  		gains (as measured by IQ tests) faded three years after the program had ended.  		In addition to these cognitive impacts, there were signs of favorable impacts  		on the child's self-concept, parental aspirations for the child's education,  		and on a family's achievement orientation. Parent participation was extremely  		high (reviewed in Collins, 1989).</b> </p>
<p>These studies each employed strong research designs, many with random  		assignment. Little attrition was experienced in the follow-up study. However,  		one should be cautioned not to attribute the successes noted in this study to  		Head Start programs. First of all, these preschools had access to professional  		resources normally available only in university research projects and  		laboratory schools. In addition, teaching staff experienced intensive staff  		development and on-going support. Therefore, these programs do not demonstrate  		effectiveness of typical Head Start programs. However, results from this study  		<i>are</i> indicative of the benefits attainable from high quality,  		resource-intensive early intervention programs. </p>
<h4><i>High/Scope Perry Preschool </i></h4>
<p>One of the Consortium participants was the High/Scope Perry Preschool in  		Ypsilanti, Michigan. The program began in the early 1960s and involved 123  		black preschoolers from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Teachers visited each  		child's home for two hours every week, and a majority of the program children  		attended the half-day program for two years. The researchers at High/Scope  		continued to follow program and control children to age 19 and looked at a  		broader set of outcomes, including teenage pregnancies, arrests, and  		unemployment. </p>
<p>The study found lasting benefits of preschool education in improving  		cognitive performance during early childhood; in improving scholastic  		achievement during the school years; in decreasing delinquency and crimes and  		in increasing high school graduation rates and frequency of enrollment in  		postsecondary programs and employment (Berrueta-Clement, et al., 1984). </p>
<p>Like the other Consortia studies, this project did not evaluate Head  		Start programs; therefore, at best, it is suggestive of possible outcomes of  		high-quality and resource-intensive early childhood education programs.<font><sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup></font> On the other hand, this  		study has some design problems that have implications for the validity of the  		findings. </p>
<p>Many criticize this study for its small sample size: only 58 children  		were in the "treatment" group (65 were in the control group). Small sample size  		limits one's ability to "slice" the data in many ways and still maintain enough  		variability between the treatment and control groups to be able to detect  		differences in outcomes. </p>
<p>Furthermore, although this study employed random assignment of children,  		subsequent reassignments were made if experimentals had employed mothers or no  		access to transportation.<font><sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup></font> This reassignment effectively destroys the true experimental design by  		introducing systematic biases. It is unclear whether these biases serve to  		under- or over-estimate the study's findings. </p>
<p>Finally, the evaluation design did not take into account the subsequent  		life events and environmental circumstances--at home, school, or the  		community--that are bound to affect the likelihood of school success, criminal  		activity, pregnancy, and welfare receipt. Generally, the ability to attribute  		long-term outcomes, which may (at best) only be distally related to a  		short-term intervention many years earlier, is suspect. </p>
<h3>Program Characteristics Associated With Positive  		Outcomes </h3>
<h4><i>Hours of Contact </i></h4>
<p>A number of studies indicate that longer hours of Head Start services  		produce more and longer-lasting gains for children (McKey, et. al., 1985;  		Copple, Cline, &amp; Smith, 1987). In addition, the 1969 Westinghouse Study  		showed that summer programs (approximately 240 hours of services per year per  		child) provided insufficient contact with children and families to result in  		long-term benefits. Head Start has most recently responded to this research by  		outlining in regulation minimum annual hours of operations. </p>
<h4><i>Group Sizes </i></h4>
<p>Many studies attest to the fact that smaller class sizes effectively  		lead to more teacher attention per child, positively affecting children's  		developmental outcomes (National Day Care Study, 1980). The average group size  		in Head Start is 18 children. </p>
<p>The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC)  		recommends a group size of 14-20 for 3-year-olds and 1620 for four-year-olds.  		The Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) recommends maximum group sizes of 14  		for three-year-olds and 16 for four-year-olds. The Federal Interagency Day Care  		Requirements (FIDCR) (which were never implemented) recommended maximums of 15  		and 20, respectively. </p>
<h4><i>Child-Staff Ratios </i></h4>
<p>Related to group size, smaller child-staff ratios also enable teachers  		to spend more time with each child, positively affecting their developmental  		outcomes. Head Start classrooms contain two paid staff--a head teacher, a  		teacher's aide--and often also a volunteer for an average child-staff ratio of  		6:1 to 9:1. </p>
<p>NAEYC recommends maximum child-staff ratios of 7:1 to 10:1 for  		three-year-olds and 8:1 to 10:1 for four-year-olds. The Early Childhood  		Environment Rating Scales (ECERs) recommend ratios of 7:1 for three-year-olds  		and 8:1 for four-year-olds. CWLA recommends 5:1 for three-year-olds and 7:1 for  		four-year-olds. FIDCR recommended 4:1 to 5:1 for three-year-olds and 7:1 for  		four-year-olds. </p>
<h4><i>Teacher Qualifications </i></h4>
<p>The National Day Care Study (1980) found that children in programs with  		staff trained in early childhood education had better relationships with the  		teacher and showed significant gains in skills and knowledge. NAEYC recommends  		that caregivers be trained in early childhood education or child development,  		from professional development courses for early childhood teaching assistants  		to a bachelor's degree for early childhood teachers. CWLA recommends teachers  		have professional education and experience in early childhood education or  		child development and teaching experience. Likewise, FIDCR recommended staff be  		trained or have experience in child growth and development. </p>
<p>Head Start created the Child Development Associate (CDA) training  		program in 1985 to increase the supply of teachers who are qualified to work  		with young children. CDA training combines education in child development with  		practical experience in the classroom to prepare enrollees to teach young  		children. Currently, 80 percent of CDA-credentialed teachers work in Head  		Start. </p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of having well-qualified teachers, Head Start  		recently promulgated regulations that would require all head teachers to obtain  		at least a CDA credential before beginning teaching and encourages teachers'  		aides to seek the credentialing. Currently, 41 percent of classroom staff have  		degrees in early childhood education or a CDA. </p>
<p>Consistency of teaching staff is also related to positive outcomes for  		children; therefore, minimizing turnover of qualified staff is important to  		Head Start's effectiveness. Unfortunately, average turnover in Head Start  		programs is about 20 percent annually. Low teachers' salaries are a major  		contributing factor to this high turnover rate. A 1988 study of Head Start  		salaries reveals that Head Start teachers work about the same number of hours  		per year as public school kindergarten teachers but earn substantially less.  		Head Start teachers with a bachelor's degree in early childhood education earn,  		on average, 63 percent of the beginning salaries for public school kindergarten  		teachers ($11,518 versus $18,350, respectively). The 1987 Head Start  		Recruitment and Enrollment Study reported the median annual wage of a Head  		Start teacher was $5,682, with few teaching' staff receive any fringe  		benefits.<font><sup><a href="#note3">3</a></sup></font> </p>
<h2><a name="sectionIII" id="sectionIII">III. WHAT RESEARCH IS NEEDED</a> </h2>
<p>Despite the diversity in evaluations of Head Start programs, most  		available research shows that a Head Start experience results in positive  		effects on cognitive and socioemotional development for children. However,  		there remain many questions about what gains in child and family outcomes Head  		Start can realistically expect to produce, how to maintain these gains over  		time, and what specific program features contribute to Head Start's  		effectiveness. </p>
<p><b>What outcomes can Head Start expect to affect?</b> The original  		intent of Head Start was to improve poor children's learning and social skills,  		as well as their health and nutrition, so that they would be better equipped to  		learn in elementary school. Improving "school readiness" would better the  		chances for breaking the cycle of poverty. </p>
<p>Despite the intentionally comprehensive nature of Head Start, most  		evaluations of Head Start have concentrated on using educational performance as  		the measure of effectiveness, often ignoring other outcomes measures such as:  		</p>
<ul><li>health and nutrition benefits to children and families, </li>
<li>increased self-esteem of children and families, and </li>
<li>improved child-rearing practices. </li>
</ul><p>Failure to measure the effects of Head Start on these dimensions  		prevents researchers from testing Head Start's full impact. (Though many  		practitioners confirm that improved health and social skills are among the more  		immediate benefits to Head Start children.) Moreover, this bias in evaluations  		severely skews the perception of Head Start's effectiveness and may effectively  		redirect the goal away from comprehensiveness toward only school-related  		measures of success. </p>
<p>Results from subsequent evaluations of preschool programs suggest that  		an intensive preschool experience is associated with a reduction in teen  		pregnancies, crime, and welfare receipt (see Perry Preschool). Early childhood  		education advocates have used these results to support their call for more  		investment in early childhood education, including Head Start. However, should  		a short-term intervention, of varied quality, at age three or four be expected  		to reduce teen pregnancies, crime, and welfare receipt before it is termed a  		success? Citing these results may amount to over-promising the benefits of Head  		Start, especially when affecting these distal outcomes is not the primary goal  		of Head Start. Longitudinal evaluations may indeed try to capture longer-term  		effects, but research designs must take into account the likely impact of  		subsequent events and environments in which previously-enrolled Head Start  		children find themselves. </p>
<p><b>How can gains achieved by Head Start children be maintained beyond  		the first few years of elementary school?</b> There is little research on why  		cognitive effects of Head Start appear to "fade out" by second grade. Some  		researchers hypothesize that competition for scarce compensatory resources,  		coupled with the fact that Head Start children (upon entering elementary  		school) are no longer the most needy and therefore do not continue to receive  		compensatory services, results in non-Head Start children "catching up" to Head  		Start children. </p>
<p>Moreover, practitioners admit that teachers often teach to the average  		abilities of students in the classroom. Therefore, there is a natural "tendency  		toward the mean," where the gap between children's achievement levels narrows  		over time as "below average" students catch up and "above average" students  		plateau. Since research indicates that Head Start children begin elementary  		school more advanced than their non-Head Start peers, apparent "fade out" of  		effects may really be the convergence of students' achievement levels. </p>
<p>Finally, gains achieved by Head Start can only be maintained if there is  		an effective transition of Head Start children and families to schools. The  		term "transition" has been defined as the strategies and procedures that are  		planned and implemented to ensure the effective placement and adjustment of the  		child as s/he moves from Head Start into kindergarten or elementary school. A  		1974 survey of 144 Head Start grantees revealed that: </p>
<ul><li>70 percent of the grantees implemented a variety of transition  		  activities; </li>
<li>Most Head Start programs provided parents with information about the  		  school their child would be attending; </li>
<li>About 50 percent of programs arranged for visits to the schools or  		  meetings with the kindergarten teacher; and </li>
<li>Generally, parents rated Head Start programs highly on preparing them  		  for transition, but some wanted more information, more academic preparation,  		  and more visits to the schools. </li>
</ul><p>Effective transition is important for the continuity and progress of the  		children's and families' development. But it is important to recognize that  		Head Start (as a Federal program to local grantees) and the public schools  		(state- and locally-administered) have no common administrative linkage, making  		efforts to coordinate transition activities inherently difficult. Therefore, a  		key question is: <b>What mechanisms are appropriate to facilitate effective  		transition?</b> </p>
<h3>Follow Through</h3>
<p>The Follow Through program--administered by the Department of  		Education--was initiated in 1967 to provide comprehensive educational, health,  		nutritional, social, and other services primarily to children from low-income  		families in kindergarten and the primary grades who were previously enrolled in  		Head Start or other preschool programs of a compensatory nature. The intent was  		to aid in the continued development of these children to their full  		potential.<font><sup><a href="#note4">4</a></sup></font> <b>Studies  		of Follow Through indicate this programs effectiveness for maintaining gains.  		one study revealed that Follow Through students demonstrated a significant  		superiority in three of five academic measures by the end of fifth grade  		(Zigler, 1976).</b> </p>
<h3>Project Developmental Continuity</h3>
<p>In 1974, ACYF funded 15 Head Start grantees to participate in "Project  		Developmental Continuity." The purpose of the program was to stimulate the  		development of programs that coordinated educational and other services to  		children and families from Head Start through children's third grade. By  		specifying institutional features of the program,<font><sup><a href="#note5">5</a></sup></font> ACYF hoped to cause systematic changes in the  		behaviors of teachers and parents toward children, changes that would increase  		developmental continuity and enhance children's social competence. </p>
<p><b>This study yielded very little evidence that local PDC programs  		enhanced children's social competence or that PDC affected the behavior of  		former Head Start parents. PDC and non-PDC teachers and classrooms did differ;  		however, PDC classrooms had no detectable influence on measured child outcomes.  		Finally, PDC schools were found to differ from non-PDC schools in only three of  		the seven required institutional features (administration, parent involvement,  		and development support services).</b> </p>
<p>The degree to which this evaluation adequately assessed the impact of  		the PDC is debatable for many reasons. First, the research design was not an  		experimental one; pre-treatment differences existed between PDC and non-PDC  		children that were not possible to control for statistically in the analysis.  		Moreover, post-treatment variables (such as the non-PDC schools implementing  		some of the seven institutional, changes, and implementation of  		P.L.94-142--Education of the Handicapped Act) may have further blurred any  		difference between the PDC and non-PDC children. In addition, small sample  		sizes and attrition may have damaged whatever rigorous design had previously  		existed. Finally, measures of children's social competence were inadequate (and  		sometimes non-existent) in some programs. </p>
<h3>Current Initiatives</h3>
<p>The Head Start Bureau is launching new initiatives addressing effective  		transition. They plan to convene a task force to explore ways of encouraging  		and supporting Head Start programs in developing linkages with community  		agencies and school systems. The Bureau is also funding 10 grants to states to  		hire one fulltime staff person in the Governor's office to coordinate state  		preschool, Head Start, and transition-to-elementary-school initiatives. </p>
<p>While coordination at the federal and state levels is desirable, the  		transition of children and families from Head Start to elementary schools  		occurs, by nature, at the local level. In an effort to encourage grantees to  		plan for transition, ACYF funded 15 grantees in 1986 to develop and test  		different ways of implementing transition programs. </p>
<p><b>An evaluation of these practices indicates that almost all the  		grantees engaged in joint planning with the school system and its staff. A  		majority of the grantees developed written agreements with the school system,  		most grantees provided some of the children's records to the schools. In some  		programs, parents were given information on how to deal with the school their  		children would be attending, were scheduled for visits to the public school to  		meet the kindergarten teacher, and were given information on how to help their  		children practice skills needed for elementary school and were given  		suggestions for summer activities.</b> </p>
<p><b>In addition, current research indicates that transferring information  		on the developmental levels of Head Start children is also an effective  		transition practice that facilitates child-centered teaching and reduces  		inappropriate placements in special education classes by 20:1 (Bergan, Feld,  		and Saladeczek, 1987).</b> </p>
<p>Head Start needs to continue to explore and evaluate new approaches to  		effective transitioning, including the approaches used by currently-operating  		Follow Through programs and including employing a mentoring or case management  		approach, to provide the continuity and the personal attention needed to assure  		effective transitions. </p>
<p><b>What are the additional benefits of two versus one year in Head  		Start?</b> There is little evidence on the additional benefits to the child and  		family of two--as opposed to only one--year of Head Start. In the Perry  		Preschool Program, "one year of preschool produced the same effects as two."  		Research on this subject could explore potentially varying effects of Head  		Start for different populations of Head Start children. Results could inform  		programs' decision on when to enroll three-year-olds for whom an additional  		year of Head Start would prove beneficial. </p>
<p><b>What program components are effective?</b> There is a lack of  		information on which programmatic features of Head Start (curriculum, home- vs.  		center-based program models, level and type of parental participation,  		involvement of community readers and organizations) contribute to successes,  		for which children, and under what conditions. Of particular importance is the  		relative effectiveness of the various forms of parental involvement in leading  		to positive child and family outcomes. Research in this area will allow  		encouragement of the most effective program designs for certain populations of  		Head Start children. </p>
<h2><a name="sectionIV" id="sectionIV">IV. CURRENT AND PLANNED RESEARCH EFFORTS</a> </h2>
<h3>Head Start Evaluation Design Study</h3>
<p>Recognizing a deficiency in information, the Head Start Bureau is  		exploring alternatives for designing a comprehensive, (possibly longitudinal)  		evaluation to answer the following questions: </p>
<ul><li><b>"Which Head Start practices or factors maximize benefits to which  		  children and families?" and</b> </li>
<li><b>"How can Head Start effects be maintained?"</b></li>
</ul><p><b>Head Start has assembled an advisory group with expertise in child  		development, early childhood education, psychology, pediatrics, Head Start,  		social policy, the testing of young children, and in designing evaluations of  		programs for disadvantaged children. The advisory group will recommend to ACYF  		a design for the study or set of studies to explore the relative short-term and  		long-term effects of various program features on an array of child and family  		outcomes. The recommended design will be presented in a final report by the  		fall of 1990.</b> </p>
<h3>Long-Term Benefits and Cost-Effectiveness of Head  		Start</h3>
<p>High/Scope Educational-Research Foundation, with funding from OHDS, is  		conducting a follow-up study in three sites on former Head Start children who  		are now 20-22 years old. High/Scope plans to compare these former Head Start  		children to a control group for educational attainment, employment, criminal  		records, and other long-term outcomes. A cost-benefit analysis (similar to that  		employed in the Perry Preschool Project) will be conducted, and the final  		report delivered to OHDS by June 1990. </p>
<h2><a name="sectionV" id="sectionV">V. ADDITIONAL TOPICS RELATED TO HEAD START'S  		EFFECTIVENESS</a> </h2>
<p>Factors that determine the effectiveness of the Head Start program need  		to be assessed on a continuing basis in the determination of future policy and  		funding allocations. These factors include: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Children served</b> - What groups of children should be targeted  			 for participation in Head Start? How many and which children should be served  			 by Head Start as opposed to other pre-school programs? What degree and types of  			 coordination is most appropriate between Head Start and other preschool  			 programs, including State programs, in ensuring all disadvantaged children have  			 access to preschool? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Program quality</b> - What is the appropriate policy and funding  			 allocations for staff salaries and benefits, training and technical assistance,  			 etc.? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Program oversight</b> - What is the appropriate level of  			 monitoring and oversight necessary to ensure program quality, and how can we  			 ensure availability of resources sufficient to meet these oversight needs?  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Many of these factors are currently being addressed through the  		implementation of the $151 million appropriation increase in FY 1990. Of this  		increase, approximately $100 million is being used to expand enrollment by  		37,500 children. Current Head Start policy is to serve eligible children for at  		least one year in the year before he or she enters public kindergarten. For  		most children, this will be when they are four years old. Thus, grantees have  		been encouraged to expand enrollment to four-year-olds currently unserved. The  		remainder of the FY 1990 increase will be used to improve program quality: $49  		million will increase staff salaries by 5.4% on average, and $2 million will be  		used to improve training and technical efforts. </p>
<p>In addition, the FY 1991 Budget and Legislative program submitted to the  		Congress in January 1990 further implements policies to increase Head Start's  		effectiveness. The Administration has requested $500 million to increase  		enrollment by up to 180,000 children. Again, this increase will be targeted to  		reaching unserved children primarily in the year before they enter public  		school. In FY 1991, $90 million of the amount available to the Secretary to  		conduct discretionary activities will be used to encourage States to provide  		funds to further expand enrollment in Head Start programs. Finally, the  		Administration's Head Start Reauthorization bill includes provisions to ensure  		timely reviews of grantees, and improved coordination with other programs  		serving disadvantaged preschool-aged children. </p>
<p>Beyond 1991, there are several specific realities that need to be  		considered in determining policy and funding strategies to make Head Start as  		effective as possible. </p>
<h3>Coordination with State Preschool Programs </h3>
<p>States are becoming more involved in preschool: in FY 1988, 28 states  		had initiatives in early childhood education, 23 of which targeted  		disadvantaged or at-risk children between the ages of three and five. Nine  		states supplement funding of Head Start to increase the number of eligible  		children able to be served. </p>
<p>Given increased state activity in this area, Head Start expansion  		strategies should not ignore this reality. In an effort to provide a Head  		Start-like experience to all Head Start-eligible four-year-olds, strategies  		should explore: </p>
<ul><li>What existing state programs already offer the comprehensive services  		  required by Head Start? How many Head Start-eligible children do they already  		  serve? </li>
<li>What opportunities exist to expand remaining state preschool programs  		  to offer the full range of Head Start services? How many Head Start-eligible  		  children could these programs serve?</li>
</ul><h3>Coordination with the Family Support Act </h3>
<p>Drafters of the Family Support Act recognized that moving families to  		self-sufficiency requires appropriate support services--like child care--in  		addition to training, education, and employment services. They acknowledge that  		the families participating in the JOBS program are also likely to be eligible  		for, and could benefit from, Head Start. Accordingly, the Family Support Act  		requires that agencies implementing the Act coordinate with Head Start  		programs. Similarly, a current HDS legislative proposal mandates that Head  		Start coordinate with agencies implementing the Family Support Act. </p>
<p>Examples of coordination include referring Head Start families to the  		JOBS program, referring JOBS participants to the Head Start program, and  		exploring alternatives for "wrapping around" the standard half-day of Head  		Start with full-day child care services to meet the employment needs of JOBS  		participants. The new realities of the JOBS program and increasing maternal  		employment will also require experimenting with, evaluating, and encouraging  		new and innovative forms of parental involvement. </p>
<h3>Allocating Expansion Funds for Quality, Enrollment, and  		Management </h3>
<p>While the name "Head Start" connotes a high quality preschool program  		for disadvantaged children, the fact is that there is a range of quality in the  		1900 Head Start programs. For example, while the average group size is well  		within recommended limits (18), group sizes range from 12 to 22. Moreover,  		while 41 percent of classroom staff have degrees in early childhood education  		or a CDA, this implies that a majority of classroom staff do not have even  		minimal training in child development. Programs with well-qualified staff, with  		lower turnover rates, with appropriate child-staff ratios and group sizes, and  		that actively involve parents and the community are likely to be more effective  		than programs that do not. </p>
<p>Simply increasing enrollment of current programs will not ensure that  		all children are receiving a quality experience that will m make them ready to  		enter school. Therefore, considering what we currently know about what  		constitutes an effective Head Start program, how should funding increases for  		Head Start beyond FY 1991 be allocated among the objectives of increasing  		enrollment, improving quality, and ensuring the effective management of Head  		Start programs? </p>
<ul><li>Strategies for increasing enrollment:
<ul><li>developing systematic, standard procedures for targeting,  				recruiting, and enrolling children most in need of services; </li>
<li>
<p>developing guidelines or policy concerning when to enroll only  				  four-year-olds and when enrolling three-year-olds is allowable or even  				  advisable.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strategies for improving quality:
<ul><li>increasing wages, salaries, and benefits of Head Start staff;  				</li>
<li>
<p>improving training and technical assistance;</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ensuring effective management of this ever-growing program requires:
<ul><li>having sufficient resources to monitor grantees' programs once  				every three years (as proposed in the President's Head Start bill). </li>
