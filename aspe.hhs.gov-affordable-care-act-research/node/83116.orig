    <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act was signed into law in March of 2010.  Millions of Americans have already benefitted from many of the law’s provisions including coverage for preventive health services, ban on lifetime limits, and insurance coverage for young adults.  The expansion of Medicaid coverage and launch of Affordable Insurance Exchanges will help millions more in 2014.  ASPE created this series of research and issue briefs to analyze the impact of the Affordable Care Act.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/pdf-report/evidence-indicates-range-challenges-puerto-rico-health-care-system">Evidence Indicates a Range of Challenges for Puerto Rico  Health Care System</a></strong><br />
			The 3.5 million Americans living in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico do not have access to a health care system considered standard in the rest of the nation. News reports in recent years describe hospitals laying off employees and closing wings, medical centers suspending or limiting health care services such as operating room hours, and air ambulance suppliers suspending services.  Concerns about the public health infrastructure in Puerto Rico were heightened this year after outbreaks of Zika virus in the area. To better understand the state of health care in Puerto Rico, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) supported an environmental scan  and site visit,  conducted an analysis of available data, and synthesized information and observations across U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) operating and staff divisions that work most closely with the Commonwealth. Despite limited data availability, we found trends that raise concerns about the Puerto Rico health care system infrastructure and workforce, prevalence of certain chronic diseases, and metrics of access to services and quality of care. The system shows some indications of stability, but evidence regarding a declining physician workforce, overcrowded hospitals with emergency department patients waiting nearly 13 hours from arrival to admission, and higher rates of self-reported fair or poor health suggest a need for attention.</p>

			Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program is projected to exhaust the last of the $6.4 billion additional funds allocated it for Federal Fiscal Years (FY) 2011-2019 as early as the first quarter of FY 2018. As many as 900,000 American citizens covered by Medicaid in Puerto Rico could lose coverage as a result of the depletion of these funds.</p>

			The United States is experiencing an unprecedented epidemic of opioid use disorder and overdose.  Our nation’s best shot at reversing the opioid epidemic and providing needed care for opioid use disorders, others substance use disorders, and mental illness depends on the continued success of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).</p>

			This analysis updates a 2011 analysis of the impact of the ACA’s pre-existing conditions protections.  It finds that a large fraction of non-elderly Americans have pre-existing health conditions, tens of millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions experience spells of uninsurance, but the share of Americans with pre-existing conditions who went without health insurance all year fell by 22 percent (3.6 million people) between 2010 and 2014.</p>

<p><a href="/health-plan-choice-and-premiums-2017-health-insurance-marketplace"><strong>Health Plan Choice and Premiums in the 2017 Health Insurance Marketplace</strong></a><br />
			This issue brief presents analysis of Qualified Health Plan (QHP) data in the individual market Marketplace for states that use the HealthCare.gov Marketplace platform and State-Based Marketplaces where data is available.  It examines plan affordability in 2017 after taking into account premium tax credits and also examines the plan choices that new and returning consumers will have for 2017.  This brief shows that the Affordable Care Act is continuing to promote affordability and choice in the Marketplace for plan year 2017.  </p>

<p><a href="/pdf-report/marketplace-enrollment-projections-2017"><strong>Health Insurance Marketplace Enrollment Projections for 2017</strong></a><br />
			This brief looks ahead to estimate how many individuals nationwide might select a Marketplace plan during the upcoming Open Enrollment period and how many – on average throughout 2017 – might have Marketplace coverage. By the end of open enrollment for 2017, we expect 13.8 million people to have selected a plan and we estimate that 11.4 million individuals will effectuate their enrollment on an average monthly basis over the course of 2017.  </p>

			There are distinct challenges and opportunities for delivery system reform initiatives in rural hospitals. This report examines what is currently known about rural health and health care, in particular the hospital sector; examines the participation and performance of rural hospitals in delivery system reform efforts; and provides a discussion of potential enabling factors for and barriers to rural hospitals’ successful participation and performance in delivery system reform.  </p>

<p><a href="/pdf-report/people-who-currently-buy-individual-market-coverage-could-be-eligible-aca-subsidies"><strong>People Who Currently Buy Individual Market Coverage Could Be Eligible for ACA Subsidies</strong></a><br />
			This Data Point provides ASPE’s national and state-by-state estimates of the share of consumers with off-Marketplace coverage who may qualify for Marketplace subsidies. We estimate that about 2.5 million people enrolled in off-Marketplace individual market coverage have incomes that may qualify them for tax credits. In six states (California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Illinois, and Pennsylvania) more than 100,000 individuals enrolled in off-Marketplace individual market coverage have incomes that may qualify them for Marketplace subsidies.  </p>

<p><a href="/affordable-care-act-has-led-historic-widespread-increase-health-insurance-coverage"><strong>Affordable Care Act Has Led to Historic, Widespread Increase in Health Insurance Coverage</strong></a><br />
			Historic gains in health insurance coverage have been achieved since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In this brief, we use new and previously published estimates from the National Health Interview Survey to examine gains in health insurance coverage for non-elderly adults from 2010 to 2015. We provide estimates of the uninsured rate over time by income, race, state Medicaid expansion status, age, and urban and rural residence. </p>

<p><a href="/pdf-report/effect-medicaid-expansion-marketplace-premiums"><strong>The Effect of Medicaid Expansion on Marketplace Premiums</strong></a><br />
			This issue brief examines and measures the effect Medicaid expansion has on premiums for Marketplace enrollees. Controlling for differences across states in demographic characteristics, pre-ACA uninsured rates, health care costs, and state policy decisions other than Medicaid expansion (e.g., allowing transitional policies, rating area design), and limiting the analysis to neighboring counties, which might be expected to have similar populations, we estimate that Marketplace premiums are about 7 percent lower in expansion states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="/pdf-report/effect-shopping-and-premium-tax-credits-affordability-marketplace-coverage">The Effect of Shopping and Premium Tax Credits on the Affordability of Marketplace Coverage</a></strong><br />
			In this brief, we examine how the combination of tax credits and the opportunity to shop around for coverage through the Marketplace would protect consumers in a hypothetical scenario with much higher premium increases in the Marketplace than occurred last year. Our analyses (and impacts of hypothetical rate increases) are restricted to consumers who purchase insurance through the Marketplaces, with a particular focus on the majority of these consumers who receive APTC. Focusing on a hypothetical scenario of a 25 percent increase in premiums for all Marketplace qualified health plans (QHPs) in HealthCare.gov states from 2016 to 2017, we show that the overwhelming majority of Marketplace consumers would be able to purchase coverage for less than $75 per month, just as they could in 2016.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/affordable-care-act-promoting-better-health-women">The Affordable Care Act: Promoting Better Health for Women​</a></strong><br />
			The Affordable Care Act promotes better health for women through the law’s core tenets of access, affordability, and quality. The law’s provisions have expanded coverage through the Marketplace and Medicaid expansions; made coverage more affordable through premium tax credits and by eliminating gender differences in premiums in the individual and small-group insurance markets; and improved quality of coverage by eliminating lifetime and annual dollar limits on Essential Health Benefits and requiring coverage of recommended preventive services and maternity care.  </p>

<p><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/impact-affordable-care-act-coverage-expansion-rural-and-urban-populations"><strong>Impact of the Affordable Care Act Coverage Expansion on Rural and Urban Populations</strong></a><br />
			This brief examines health insurance coverage gains, Marketplace coverage and premium tax credits, and access to health care with a special focus on individuals living in rural areas. Rural individuals, like those living in urban and suburban areas, have seen large coverage gains under the ACA – about an 8 percentage point increase from before the first open enrollment period through early 2015. Among the 88 percent of rural HealthCare.gov consumers with premium tax credits, the average net monthly premium increased by $5, or 4 percent, between 2015 and 2016. Individuals in rural areas have seen improvements in access to care; the share who report being unable to afford needed care declined by nearly 6 percentage points from before the first open enrollment period through early 2015.</p>

			This testimony before the U.S. Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee highlights how the ACA has helped small businesses and their employees, by expanding coverage, improving quality and addressing health care cost growth. These high level milestones, along with the small employer tax credit and the creation of the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) have helped address the health care needs of both small employers and their employees.</p>

<p><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/marketplace-premiums-after-shopping-switching-and-premium-tax-credits-2015-2016"><strong>Marketplace Premiums after Shopping, Switching, and Premium Tax Credits, 2015-2016</strong></a><br />
			Health insurance rate information becomes available each spring as issuers file proposed rates with federal and state regulators. Rates then undergo review before being finalized in the fall, prior to the annual Health Insurance Marketplace Open Enrollment Period. Neither the proposed nor final rates offered by any individual issuer provide a reliable basis for predicting what typical Marketplace consumers will pay in the following year. Consumers’ actual health insurance premiums will be lower because public rate review can bring down proposed increases, shopping gives all consumers a chance to find the best deal, and tax credits reduce the cost of coverage for the vast majority of Marketplace consumers. Among the roughly 85 percent of HealthCare.gov consumers with premium tax credits, the average monthly net premium increased just $4, or 4%, from 2015 to 2016.</p>

			This issue brief reviews the most recent survey and administrative information available about gains in health insurance coverage since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010. We estimate that the provisions of the ACA have resulted in gains in health insurance coverage for 20.0 million adults through early 2016 (through February 22, 2016), a 2.4 million increase since our previous estimate in September 2015.  These estimated health insurance coverage gains are shared broadly across population groups. Our estimate of a net reduction of 20.0 million uninsured adults is based on data from the National Health Interview Survey and from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index. Other federal and non-governmental surveys of health insurance status show similar trends over this time period.</p>

			This intramural research brief presents qualitative information on selected community action agencies’ (CAA) Affordable Care Act-related outreach and enrollment activities and identifies themes that emerged across the sites. The goals of the brief are to (1) provide examples of a range of activity levels and promising practices that can serve as examples to other CAAs interested in doing more to help their communities increase rates of health insurance, and (2) provide information to federal program officials who may be interested in encouraging CAAs’ ACA-related work and addressing the barriers that may be limiting such efforts.</p>

			ASPE has developed estimates of the number of uninsured who are likely to qualify for coverage for 2016 through Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) in the Health Insurance Marketplace (“QHP-eligible uninsured”) for select designated market areas (DMA) in the United States. A DMA is a geographic area that represents a specific television market defined by the Nielsen Company. Some DMAs span multiple states. The first list consists of the top 60 DMAs based on the largest number of QHP-eligible uninsured, and the second list consists of the top 20 DMAs by the number of QHP-eligible uninsured as a percent of the DMA’s total nonelderly population.</p>

			The Affordable Care Act continues to promote access to affordable Marketplace health insurance plans in 2016 by creating a transparent Marketplace where consumers can chose among the health insurance products to find one that best meet their needs and budget.  More than 8 in 10 returning Marketplace consumers could save an average of $610 annually in premiums for a plan in the same level of coverage by returning to shop.  More than 7 in 10 (72 percent) current Marketplace enrollees can get coverage for $75 in premiums or less, after any applicable tax credits in 2016.  Nearly 6 in 10 (57 percent) can get coverage for $75 in premiums or less within their metal level.  Like in 2015, 9 out of 10 consumers returning to the Marketplace will be able to choose from 3 or more issuers for 2016 coverage.</p>

			This report examines consumer plan choices during the second year of open enrollment (the 2015 plan year) for those consumers who had selected a Marketplace plan at any time in 2014 in states using the HealthCare.gov platform. This issue brief specifically focuses on when consumers selected a 2015 plan, how they responded to premium differences among health plans in their area, net of any premium tax credits they might have received.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/pdf-report/how-many-individuals-might-have-marketplace-coverage-at-the-end-of-2016">How Many Individuals Might Have Marketplace Coverage at the End of 2016?</a></strong>, ASPE Issue Brief, October 2015<br />
			In preparation for OE3, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) developed a projection for potential 2016 enrollment through the Marketplaces, taking into account both short-run and long-run factors that affect the level of enrollment.  ASPE’s projection uses a “bottom up” approach that builds a national estimate up from state-level information on previous enrollment periods and analysis of the broader insurance market. This method yielded an estimated range of 9.4 to 11.4 million effectuated enrollees in the Marketplace at the end of 2016. The range is based on assumptions about the effectuated enrollment at the end of 2015, the starting point for OE3, rates of re-enrollment, take-up by new enrollees, and attrition of those who initially select a plan but do not maintain coverage for the entire year.</p>

			Data from the first quarter of 2015 from the NHIS and findings from private surveys provide insight into the demographic characteristics, financial circumstances, and attitudes towards health insurance among those who do not have coverage. We estimate that nearly half of the uninsured population that is QHP-eligible has family incomes between 100% and 250% FPL, making them likely eligible for APTC and CSR. Almost half of the uninsured who qualify for Marketplace plans are between the ages of 18 and 34. More than 30 percent are people of color: 19 percent are Hispanic, 14 percent are African- American, and about 2 percent are Asian American. Private surveys suggest that the uninsured value insurance but have financial circumstances, perceptions of affordability, and knowledge gaps that are barriers to enrolling in coverage.</p>

			Five years after the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans have gained health insurance coverage. This factsheet highlights the changes in health insurance coverage after the ACA's enactment in March 2010, for young adults who were able to gain coverage through their parents' health insurance plan, as well as adults who gained coverage after the start of open enrollment for the Health Insurance Marketplaces in October 2013 through September, 2015. Details on people who gained health insurance coverage include race and ethnicity, state Medicaid expansion status, gender, and young adults.</p>

			This brief examines how the supply of Marketplace issuers changed from 2014 to 2015 in states that used the federal HealthCare.gov platform and how changes in the number of issuers affected premium growth between these two years. We find that a majority of counties in these states gained issuers from 2014 to 2015, and only a small percent of counties experienced a net loss of issuers. Premium growth for counties that that experienced a net gain in issuers was significantly lower than for other counties.</p>

			This ASPE research sought to understand the tailored outreach and enrollment activities in support of LGBT individuals and families within the Marketplaces. Through guided discussions with Marketplace consumer coordinators, outreach managers, and enrollment staff, a set of promising practices were identified to help enroll LGBT individuals. These promising practices encompassed five major themes: outreach, partnerships, engagement, staffing, and a focus on the transgender community. Two cross-cutting challenges also emerged, centering on data collection and materials and messaging.</p>

			Expanding Medicaid has positive economic effects. These two factsheets highlight information on the economic impact of Medicaid expansion on individuals' financial circumstances, uncompensated care costs and state Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Research confirms that expanding Medicaid will benefit states both directly and indirectly by generating additional federal revenue, increasing jobs and earnings, increasing Gross State Product (GSP), increasing state and local revenues (via provider taxes and fees and increased prescription drug rebates), and reducing uncompensated care and hospital costs.</p>

This factsheet highlights the changes in health insurance coverage after the ACA's enactment in March 2010, for young adults who were able to gain coverage through their parents' health insurance plan, as well as adults who gained coverage after the start of open enrollment for the Health Insurance Marketplaces in October 2013 through March 4, 2015. Details on people who gained health insurance coverage include race and ethnicity, household income and state Medicaid expansion status, and young adults.</p>

			This brief describes many ways the Affordable Care Act provisions support women's and children's health. The Affordable Care Act provides new coverage options through health insurance marketplaces and Medicaid, and also ensures that most insurance plans (so-called 'non-grandfathered' plans) provide coverage for certain preventive health services without cost sharing. Other benefits of the law include ending gender discrimination in coverage and prohibiting pre-existing conditions exclusions. The Affordable Care Act also enhances Medicare coverage for preventive care and prescription drug coverage. In addition, the Affordable Care Act improves access to maternity coverage, maternity-related preventive services, and pediatric benefits; created the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program; requires employers to allow break time for nursing mothers; and funds Childhood Obesity Demonstration Project grants and School-Based Health Centers.</p>

			The Affordable Care Act is working to improve competition and choice among affordable Marketplace health insurance plans in 2015. Based on analysis of 35 states, there are over 25 percent more issuers participating in the Marketplace in 2015. Premiums for the benchmark (second-lowest cost) silver plan will increase modestly, by 2 percent on average this year before tax credits, while premiums for the lowest-cost silver plan will increase on average by 5 percent. More than 7 in 10 current Marketplace enrollees can find a lower premium plan in the same metal level before tax credits by returning to shop.</p>

			The Affordable Care Act is achieving its central aim: millions of Americans who were uninsured before now have access to affordable, high-quality health care. By the end of the first open enrollment period, over 8 million people selected policies and, of those, as of September 2014, 7.1 million people enrolled and were paying for insurance coverage (“effectuated” enrollees) through the Marketplace. As the second annual Open Enrollment Period (from November 15, 2014 through February 15, 2015) approaches, many analysts are projecting the number of people expected to enroll. Projections vary depending on the underlying assumptions and the analytical methods used. Analysts in the Department of Health and Human Services project a range for 2015 of 9.0 – 9.9 million total enrollees, which is consistent with the growth rate of 25 – 30% seen in other new insurance products.</p>

			As of June 2014, 10.3 million nonelderly adults (ages 18-64) gained health insurance coverage since the start of the Affordable Care Act initial open enrollment period in October 2013. Government and private surveys offer a consistent picture of expansions in insurance coverage.</p>

			United States hospitals provide roughly $50 billion in uncompensated care to uninsured and underinsured patients annually. Under the Affordable Care Act, a major insurance coverage expansion is taking place; this expansion is anticipated to reduce uncompensated care as more and more Americans gain insurance coverage. First, this brief examines earnings reports from major for-profit U.S. hospital chains and finds that volumes of uninsured admissions have fallen by 50-70% in states that have expanded Medicaid, and by 2-14% in states that have not expanded Medicaid. Next, the brief uses cost report data to estimate the change in hospital uncompensated care costs as a result of insurance expansion, and finds that U.S. hospitals are projected to save $5.7 billion in uncompensated care costs in 2014. About three-quarters of these savings ($4.2 billion) will accrue to states that have elected to expand Medicaid, and about a quarter ($1.5 billion) to states that have chosen not to expand Medicaid.</p>

			A central feature of the Affordable Care Act is the establishment of the Health Insurance Marketplace, which offers consumers a transparent and competitive platform to shop for health insurance coverage. Based on preliminary data available for 44 states, there will be 77 new issuers offering Qualified Health Plans through the Marketplace in 2015, and 36 of the 44 states will have at least one new Marketplace entrant. In the 44 states, there will be 63 more issuers in 2015 than there were in 2014, representing a 25 percent increase in the total number of issuers.</p>

			This brief estimates the number of people newly eligible for preventive services coverage with no cost sharing, including contraception, because of the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act ensures that most insurance plans (so-called ‘non-grandfathered’ plans) provide coverage for certain preventive health services without cost sharing. Based in part on recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, this includes colonoscopy screening for colon cancer, Pap smears and mammograms for women, contraception, well-child visits, flu shots for all children and adults, and many more services. Estimates of people affected by these provisions are available by age, gender, race and ethnicity, and at the state-level. In addition, the brief reports findings from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics of the change in the number of prescriptions for oral contraceptives with no co-pay between 2012 and 2013 and the reduction in out-of-pocket costs to women associated with this change.</p>

			This brief provides an overview of health insurance plan premiums available in the 2014 Marketplace and the important role of the advanced premium tax credit (“tax credit”) in helping families afford coverage. It contains information on the change in the premium cost associated with the tax credit for individuals who made Marketplace plan selections through the Federally-facilitated Marketplace (FFM) during the initial open enrollment period. Also, it analyzes over 19,000 Marketplace plans for 2014, within four metal levels (bronze, silver, gold, and platinum) for each of the 501 rating areas across 50 states and the District of Columbia. Tax credits reduced premiums by approximately 76 percent, on average, for individuals who selected plans in the FFM with tax credits. Competition, as measured by the number of issuers in a rating area, was associated with more affordable benchmark plans (the second-lowest cost silver plan).</p>

			This study builds upon the research and methods of the “Trends in Premiums in the Small Group and Individual Insurance Markets, 2008-2011” study. It completes data collection for the 2011 insurance rate filing year and adds some data for 2012. It finds that premium increases have slowed since 2011, the same year ACA rate review regulations went into effect. In the individual market, the average premium increase declined from 11.7 percent in 2010 to 7.0 percent in 2011 and 7.1 percent in 2012. In the small group market, premium increases declined significantly from 8.8 percent in 2010 to 6.1 percent in 2011 to 4.8 percent in 2012. In addition, regulators reduced rate requests of insurers more extensively after ACA rate review provisions went into effect.</p>

			Data on premium increases were collected from 2008-2011 hard copy rate filings submitted by insurance carriers and from rate filings or rate summaries available on state insurance websites for the small group and individual insurance markets. In the individual market, the average premium increase (weighted by member months) was 9.9 percent in 2008, 10.8 percent in 2009, and 11.7 percent in 2010, and then declined to 8.6 percent in 2011. In the small group market, average premium increases declined throughout the study period, from 11.2 percent in 2008 and 2009 to 8.8 percent in 2010 and 6.7 percent in 2011. There was substantial variability across states in the average rate of increase. In addition to having their rate requests accepted or rejected, carriers could reach some compromise with the state for a modified rate. The percentage of requests modified by states increased between 2008 and 2011 in both markets. The Affordable Care Act provides states with rate review grants to help states implement or improve their review rate process. These improvements also resulted in increased transparency with 23 states initiating public websites in 2010 and 2011 displaying rate filing information.</p>

These injuries range from minor sprains and strains to more serious injuries such as broken bones and concussions. The direct medical bills resulting from sports injuries are substantial. The costs could be a heavy burden for individuals without health insurance coverage, who would not only lack protection against out-of-pocket costs but could also be forced to pay providers’ full stated charges, rather than the discounted prices generally offered to those with insurance.

			Young adults are the age group most likely to be without health insurance coverage and, therefore, are a key target for outreach and enrollment activities. Nearly 5 in 10 (46 percent, or 1.3 million) uninsured young adults in single-person households who are eligible for the Health Insurance Marketplace may be able to purchase a bronze plan for $50 per month or less after tax credits, based on analysis of data in 34 states. In these states, a total 1.9 million young adults, representing nearly 7 in 10 (66 percent) of the Marketplace-eligible uninsured ages 18 to 34, may be able to pay $100 or less for coverage in 2014.</p>

			This report summarizes the health plan choices and premiums that will be available in the Health Insurance Marketplace. It contains new information, current as of September 18, 2013, on qualified health plans in the 36 states in which the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will support or fully run the Health Insurance Marketplace in 2014. Plan data is in final stages but is still under review as of September 18 and may be revised in HHS systems before being displayed for consumers, so this information is subject to change. This analysis also includes similar information that is publicly available from 11 states and the District of Columbia that are implementing their own Marketplace. This report focuses on the plans with the lowest premiums in each state, as consumers are expected to shop for low-cost plans. Nearly all consumers (about 95%) will have a choice of 2 or more health insurance issuers (often many more) and nearly all consumers (about 95%) live in states with average premiums below earlier estimates.</p>

			Estimates from Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC) data for calendar year 2012, released on September 17, show that 3 million more Americans had health insurance coverage than in 2011. This ASPE Issue Brief includes estimates of the uninsured by age, race and ethnicity, employment status, and household income.

			Under the Affordable Care Act, advanced premium tax credits will be available to help individuals and families afford insurance coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace, and states will be able to expand Medicaid eligibility for low-income adults. Of the estimated 18.6 million uninsured Americans eligible for Marketplace tax credits, 10.8 million Americans, nearly half (49 percent) of the uninsured eligible for the Marketplace, may be able to pay $100 or less per person for coverage in 2014. In addition, 12.4 million uninsured Americans will be eligible for Medicaid or CHIP and pay no premium or only a nominal premium in 2014 to date. Nationwide, 23.2 million or 56% of the 41.3 million eligible uninsured may qualify for Medicaid, CHIP, or tax credits to purchase coverage for $100 or less.</p>

			A goal of the Affordable Care Act is to increase competition and transparency in the markets for individual and small group insurance, leading to higher quality, more affordable products. As of August 2013, sixteen states have released information on proposed or final premiums for the Marketplaces in 2014. This research brief analyzes those proposed and final rates and compares them to those estimated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Overall, silver premiums in the 2014 individual market are substantially lower than expected.</p>

			A goal of the Affordable Care Act is to increase competition and transparency in the markets for individual and small group insurance, leading to higher quality, more affordable products.

			The Affordable Care Act ensures that most insurance plans (so-called ‘non-grandfathered’ plans) provide coverage for and eliminate cost-sharing on certain recommended preventive health services, beginning on or after September 23, 2010. This includes services such as colonoscopy screening for colon cancer, Pap smears and mammograms for women, well-child visits, flu shots for all children and adults, and many more.</p>

			The Affordable Care Act brings an unprecedented level of scrutiny and transparency to health insurance rate increases. Evidence suggests that the Affordable Care Act contributed to a reduction in the rate of increase in premiums in the individual market since 2010. The proportion of rate filings in which the requested increase was 10 percent or more declined from 75 percent in 2010 to 34 percent in 2012, consistent with the increased scrutiny that such requests now receive.</p>

			The Affordable Care Act builds on the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 to extend federal parity protections to 62 million Americans. The parity law aims to ensure that when coverage for mental health and substance use conditions is provided, it is generally comparable to coverage for medical and surgical care.</p>

			Medicare spending per beneficiary grew just 0.4% per capita in fiscal year 2012, continuing a pattern of very low growth in 2010 and 2011. Together with historically low projections of per capita growth from both the Congressional Budget Office and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of the Actuary, these statistics show that the Affordable Care Act has helped to set Medicare on a more sustainable path to keep its commitment to seniors and persons with disabilities today and well into the future.</p>

			The Affordable Care Act requires many insurance plans to provide coverage for and eliminate cost-sharing on certain recommended preventive health services. In August 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services published guidelines on women's preventive services that require non-grandfathered health insurance plans to cover certain recommended preventive services specifically for women without charging a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible beginning in plan years starting on or after August 1, 2012.</p>
