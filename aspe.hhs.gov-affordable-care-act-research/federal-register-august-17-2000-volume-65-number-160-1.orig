<p>Health Insurance Reform: Standards for Electronic Transactions</p>
<p>AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, HHS.</p>
<p>ACTION: Final rule.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>SUMMARY: This rule adopts standards for eight electronic transactions<br />
	and for code sets to be used in those transactions. It also contains<br />
	requirements concerning the use of these standards by health plans,<br />
	health care clearinghouses, and certain health care providers.<br />
	    The use of these standard transactions and code sets will improve<br />
	the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other Federal health programs<br />
	and private health programs, and the effectiveness and efficiency of<br />
	the health care industry in general, by simplifying the administration<br />
	of the system and enabling the efficient electronic transmission of<br />
	certain health information. It implements some of the requirements of<br />
	the Administrative Simplification subtitle of the Health Insurance<br />
	Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.</p>
<p>DATES: The effective date of this rule is October 16, 2000. The<br />
	incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in this rule<br />
	is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of October 16,<br />
	2000.</p>

	su--docs/aces/aces140.html</a>; http://aspe.hhs.gov/admnsimp/.</p>
<p>I. Background</p>
<p>A. Electronic Data Interchange</p>
<p>    Electronic data interchange (EDI) is the electronic transfer of<br />
	information, such as electronic media health claims, in a standard<br />
	format between trading partners. EDI allows entities within the health<br />
	care system to exchange medical, billing, and other information and to<br />
	process transactions in a manner which is fast and cost effective. With<br />
	EDI there is a substantial reduction in handling and processing time<br />
	compared to paper, and the risk of lost paper documents is eliminated.<br />
	EDI can eliminate the inefficiencies of handling paper documents, which<br />
	will significantly reduce administrative burden, lower operating costs,<br />
	and improve overall data quality.<br />
	    The health care industry recognizes the benefits of EDI and many<br />
	entities in that industry have developed proprietary EDI formats.<br />
	Currently, there are about 400 formats for electronic health claims<br />
	being used in the United States. The lack of standardization makes it<br />
	difficult and expensive to develop and maintain software. Moreover, the<br />
	lack of standardization minimizes the ability of health care providers<br />
	and health plans to achieve efficiency and savings.</p>
<p>B. Statutory Background</p>
<p>    The Congress included provisions to address the need for standards<br />
	for electronic transactions and other administrative simplification<br />
	issues in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of<br />
	1996 (HIPAA), Public Law 104-191, which was enacted on August 21, 1996.<br />
	Through subtitle F of title II of that law, the Congress added to title<br />
	XI of the Social Security Act a new part C, entitled ``Administrative<br />
	Simplification.'' (Public Law 104-191 affects several titles in the<br />
	United States Code. Hereafter, we refer to the Social Security Act as<br />
	the Act; we refer to the other laws cited in this document by their<br />
	names.) The purpose of this part is to improve the Medicare program<br />
	under title XVIII of the Social Security Act and the Medicaid program<br />
	under title XIX of the Act, and the efficiency and effectiveness of the<br />
	health care system, by encouraging the development of a health<br />
	information system through the establishment of standards and<br />
	requirements to enable the electronic exchange of certain health<br />
	information.<br />
	    Part C of title XI consists of sections 1171 through 1179 of the<br />
	Act. These sections define various terms and impose several<br />
	requirements on HHS, health plans, health care clearinghouses, and<br />
	certain health care providers.<br />
	    The first section, section 1171 of the Act, establishes definitions<br />
	for purposes of part C of title XI for the following terms: code set,<br />
	health care clearinghouse, health care provider, health information,<br />
	health plan, indiyvidually identifiable health information, standard,<br />
	and standard setting organization (SSO).<br />
	    Section 1172 of the Act makes any standard adopted under part C<br />
	applicable to (1) all health plans, (2) all health care clearinghouses,<br />
	and (3) any health care provider who transmits any health information<br />
	in electronic form in connection with transactions referred to in<br />
	section 1173(a)(1) of the Act.<br />
	    This section also contains requirements concerning standard<br />
	setting.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; The Secretary may adopt a standard developed, adopted, or<br />
	modified by a standard setting organization (that is, an organization<br />
	accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)) that<br />
	has consulted with the National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC), the<br />
	National Uniform Claim Committee (NUCC), the Workgroup for Electronic<br />
	Data Interchange (WEDI), and the American Dental Association (ADA).<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; The Secretary may also adopt a standard other than one<br />
	established by a standard setting organization, if the different<br />
	standard will reduce costs for health care providers and health plans,<br />
	the different standard is promulgated through negotiated rulemaking<br />
	procedures, and the Secretary consults with each of the above-named<br />
	groups.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; If no standard has been adopted by any standard setting<br />
	organization, the Secretary is to rely on the recommendations of the<br />
	National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) and consult<br />
	with the above-named groups before adopting a standard.</p>
<p>[[Page 50313]]</p>
<p>    &lt;bullet&gt; In complying with the requirements of part C of title XI,<br />
	the Secretary must rely on the recommendations of the NCVHS, consult<br />
	with appropriate State and Federal agencies and private organizations,<br />
	and publish the recommendations of the NCVHS regarding the adoption of<br />
	a standard under this part in the Federal Register.<br />
	    Paragraph (a) of section 1173 of the Act requires that the<br />
	Secretary adopt standards for financial and administrative<br />
	transactions, and data elements for those transactions, to enable<br />
	health information to be exchanged electronically. Standards are<br />
	required for the following transactions: health care claims or<br />
	equivalent encounter information, health claims attachments, health<br />
	plan enrollments and disenrollments, health plan eligibility, health<br />
	care payment and remittance advice, health plan premium payments, first<br />
	report of injury, health care claim status, and referral certification<br />
	and authorization. Section 1173(a)(1)(B) authorizes the Secretary to<br />
	adopt standards for any other financial and administrative transactions<br />
	as she determines appropriate.<br />
	    Paragraph (b) of section 1173 of the Act requires the Secretary to<br />
	adopt standards for unique health identifiers for each individual,<br />
	employer, health plan, and health care provider. It also requires that<br />
	the adopted standards specify for what purposes unique health<br />
	identifiers may be used.<br />
	    Paragraphs (c) through (f) of section 1173 of the Act require the<br />
	Secretary to adopt standards for code sets for each data element for<br />
	each health care transaction listed above, security standards to<br />
	protect health care information, standards for electronic signatures<br />
	(established together with the Secretary of Commerce), and standards<br />
	for the transmission of data elements needed for the coordination of<br />
	benefits and sequential processing of claims. Compliance with<br />
	electronic signature standards will be deemed to satisfy both State and<br />
	Federal statutory requirements for written signatures with respect to<br />
	the transactions listed in paragraph (a) of section 1173 of the Act.<br />
	    In section 1174 of the Act, the Secretary is required to adopt<br />
	standards for all of the above transactions, except claims attachments,<br />
	within 18 months after enactment. The standards for claims attachments<br />
	must be adopted within 30 months after enactment. Modifications to any<br />
	established standard may be made after the first year, but not more<br />
	frequently than once every 12 months. The Secretary may, however,<br />
	modify an initial standard at any time during the first year of<br />
	adoption, if she determines that the modification is necessary to<br />
	permit compliance with the standard. The Secretary must also ensure<br />
	that procedures exist for the routine maintenance, testing,<br />
	enhancement, and expansion of code sets and that there are crosswalks<br />
	from prior versions. Any modification to a code set must be implemented<br />
	in a manner that minimizes the disruption and the cost of compliance.<br />
	    Section 1175 of the Act prohibits health plans from refusing to<br />
	conduct a transaction as a standard transaction. It also prohibits<br />
	health plans from delaying the processing of, or adversely affecting or<br />
	attempting to adversely affect, a person submitting a standard<br />
	transaction or the transaction itself on the grounds that the<br />
	transaction is in standard format. It establishes a timetable for<br />
	compliance: each person to whom a standard or implementation<br />
	specification applies is required to comply with the standard no later<br />
	than 24 months (or 36 months for small health plans) following its<br />
	adoption. With respect to modifications to standards or implementation<br />
	specifications made after initial adoption, compliance must be<br />
	accomplished by a date designated by the Secretary. This date may not<br />
	be earlier than 180 days after the modification is adopted by the<br />
	Secretary.<br />
	    Section 1176 of the Act establishes civil monetary penalties for<br />
	violation of the provisions in part C of title XI of the Act, subject<br />
	to several limitations. Penalties may not be more than $100 per person<br />
	per violation of a provision, and not more than $25,000 per person per<br />
	violation of an identical requirement or prohibition for a calendar<br />
	year. With certain exceptions, the procedural provisions in section<br />
	1128A of the Act, ``Civil Monetary Penalties,'' are applicable to<br />
	imposition of these penalties.<br />
	    Section 1177 of the Act established penalties for any person that<br />
	knowingly misuses a unique health identifier, or obtains or discloses<br />
	individually identifiable health information in violation of this part.<br />
	The penalties include: (1) A fine of not more than $50,000 and/or<br />
	imprisonment of not more than 1 year; (2) if the offense is ``under<br />
	false pretenses,'' a fine of not more than $100,000 and/or imprisonment<br />
	of not more than 5 years; and (3) if the offense is with intent to<br />
	sell, transfer, or use individually identifiable health information for<br />
	commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm, a fine of not<br />
	more than $250,000 and/or imprisonment of not more than 10 years. We<br />
	note that these penalties do not affect any other penalties that may be<br />
	imposed by other federal programs.<br />
	    Under section 1178 of the Act, the provisions of part C of title XI<br />
	of the Act, as well as any standards or implementation specifications<br />
	adopted under them, generally supersede contrary provisions of State<br />
	law. However, the Secretary may make exceptions to this general rule if<br />
	she determines that the provision of State law is necessary to prevent<br />
	fraud and abuse, ensure appropriate State regulation of insurance and<br />
	health plans, or for State reporting on health care delivery or costs,<br />
	among other things. In addition, contrary State laws relating to the<br />
	privacy of individually identifiable health information are not<br />
	preempted if more stringent than the related federal requirements.<br />
	Finally, contrary State laws relating to certain activities with<br />
	respect to public health and regulation of health plans are not<br />
	preempted by the standards adopted under Part C or section 264 of<br />
	Public Law 104-191.<br />
	    Finally, section 1179 of the Act makes the above provisions<br />
	inapplicable to financial institutions or anyone acting on behalf of a<br />
	financial institution when ``authorizing, processing, clearing,<br />
	settling, billing, transferring, reconciling, or collecting payments<br />
	for a financial institution.''</p>
<p>II. General Overview of the Provisions of the Proposed Rule</p>
<p>    On May 7, 1998, we proposed standards for eight transactions (we<br />
	did not propose a standard for either health claims attachments or<br />
	first report of injury) and for code sets to be used in the<br />
	transactions (63 FR 25272). In addition, we proposed requirements<br />
	concerning the implementation of these standards. This proposed rule<br />
	set forth requirements that health plans, health care clearinghouses,<br />
	and certain health care providers would have to meet concerning the use<br />
	of these standards.<br />
	    We proposed to add a new part 142 to title 45 of the Code of<br />
	Federal Regulations to include requirements for health plans, certain<br />
	health care providers, and health care clearinghouses to implement<br />
	HIPAA administrative simplification provisions. This material has been<br />
	restructured to accommodate HIPAA privacy and security provisions, and<br />
	is now contained in parts 160 and 162 of title 45. Subpart A of part<br />
	160 contains the general provisions for all parts. Subpart I of part<br />
	162 contains the general provisions for the standards proposed in the<br />
	Standards for Electronic</p>
<p>[[Page 50314]]</p>
<p>Transactions proposed rule. Subparts J through R contain the provisions<br />
	specific to each of the standards proposed in the Standards for<br />
	Electronic Transactions proposed rule.</p>
<p>III. Analysis of, and Responses to, Public Comments on the Proposed<br />
	Rule</p>
<p>    In response to the publication in the Federal Register of the<br />
	proposed rule on May 7, 1998, we received approximately 17,000 timely<br />
	public comments. The comments came from a wide variety of<br />
	correspondents including professional associations and societies,<br />
	health care workers, law firms, third party health insurers, hospitals,<br />
	and private individuals. We reviewed each commenter's letter and<br />
	grouped like or related comments. Some comments were identical,<br />
	indicating that the commenters had submitted form letters. After<br />
	associating like comments, we placed them in categories based on<br />
	subject matter or based on the section(s) of the regulations affected<br />
	and then reviewed the comments. All comments relating to general<br />
	subjects, such as the format of the regulations were similarly<br />
	reviewed.<br />
	    This process identified areas of the proposed regulation that<br />
	required review in terms of their effect on policy, consistency, or<br />
	clarity of the rules.<br />
	    We present comments and responses generally in the order in which<br />
	the issues appeared in the May 1998 proposed rule.</p>
<p>General--Comment Period</p>
<p>    Comment: We received several comments that stated the 60-day<br />
	comment period was too short. It was stated that the period did not<br />
	take into account the highly detailed, technical review of the<br />
	thousands of pages in the implementation specifications that was<br />
	required in order to comment in a meaningful way.<br />
	    Response: We disagree. We understand the difficulty in reviewing a<br />
	rule of this complexity. However, we met our notice requirements for<br />
	the length of the comment period and made every effort to ensure that<br />
	the proposed rule was readily accessible to the public (for example,<br />
	the proposed rule was published in the Federal Register and available<br />
	over the Internet). In addition, we received many comments requesting<br />
	changes to the implementation specifications, which indicates that the<br />
	majority of interested parties were able to review all implementation<br />
	specifications in the 60-day period. If additional changes are<br />
	necessary, revisions may be made to the standards on an annual basis.</p>
<p>A. Applicability</p>
<p>    In subpart A Sec. 142.102 we listed the entities that would be<br />
	subject to the provisions and we discussed under what circumstances<br />
	they would apply.<br />
	    Below we discuss the comments concerning applicability.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on the Applicability of the Regulations</p>
<p>1. Electronically Transmitting Transactions<br />
	    Proposal Summary: Our proposed rules apply to health plans and<br />
	health care clearinghouses, as well as any health care provider when<br />
	transmitting an electronic transaction defined in Subpart A of 45 CFR<br />
	Part 142.<br />
	    Comment: Several commenters requested clarification on the<br />
	applicability provisions. For example, several commenters questioned<br />
	whether a health plan would be required to accept or send a standard<br />
	that it does not currently support electronically. Some commenters<br />
	believe the language allows any entity to submit a standard transaction<br />
	and expect it to be processed by the receiver even though they do not<br />
	have a business relationship with each other.<br />
	    Response: Under the terms of section 1172(a) of the Act, these<br />
	regulations apply to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and<br />
	health care providers who transmit any health information in electronic<br />
	form in connection with a transaction referred to in section 1173(a) of<br />
	the Act (in other words, ``covered entities''). We interpret this<br />
	provision to mean that by the applicable compliance dates of the<br />
	regulation, all covered entities must comply with the standards adopted<br />
	by this regulation. (Covered entities, of course, may comply before the<br />
	applicable compliance dates.) We do not have the authority to apply<br />
	these standards to any entity that is not a covered entity. However, we<br />
	require covered entities to apply many of the provisions of the rule to<br />
	the entities with whom they contract for administrative and other<br />
	services related to the transactions, as it would be inconsistent with<br />
	the underlying statutory purpose to permit covered entities to avoid<br />
	the Act's requirements by the simple act of contracting out certain<br />
	otherwise covered functions.<br />
	    With respect to health plans, a health plan is required to have the<br />
	capacity to accept and/or send (either itself, or by hiring a health<br />
	care clearinghouse to accept and/or send on its behalf) a standard<br />
	transaction that it otherwise conducts but does not currently support<br />
	electronically. For example, if a health plan pays claims<br />
	electronically but historically performed enrollment and disenrollment<br />
	functions in paper, the health plan must have the capacity to<br />
	electronically perform enrollment and disenrollment as well as claims<br />
	payment as standard transactions by the applicable compliance date of<br />
	the regulation.<br />
	    Also, in response to the public's need for clarification of the<br />
	applicability of the HIPAA administrative simplification provisions (45<br />
	CFR subtitle A, subchapter C) to covered entities, we revisited the<br />
	applicability provision with respect to health care providers. In the<br />
	proposed rule, we proposed that the administrative simplification<br />
	provisions would apply to a health care provider when transmitting an<br />
	electronic transaction (63 FR 25305). (We note that this language<br />
	differed somewhat from the statute, which states that the HIPAA<br />
	administrative simplification provisions apply to ``a health care<br />
	provider who transmits any health information in electronic form in<br />
	connection with a transaction'' referred to in subchapter C.)<br />
	    We phrased the applicability section in the proposed rule as we did<br />
	in an effort to convey the message that these regulations do not<br />
	require a health care provider to transmit transactions electronically;<br />
	thus, a health care provider remains free to use paper media. These<br />
	regulations do require, however, that a health care provider who uses<br />
	electronic media to transmit any health information in connection with<br />
	a transaction referred to in 45 CFR subtitle A, subchapter C, must do<br />
	so in compliance with the regulations. We do not believe that the<br />
	proposed applicability language as it applied to health care providers<br />
	adequately communicated this message. Thus, after reevaluating the<br />
	proposed approach, we believe that the best approach is to have the<br />
	applicability text mirror the statute and use Sec. 162.923<br />
	(Requirements for Covered Entities) as the vehicle to detail the<br />
	specific requirements for covered health care providers.<br />
	    In addition, we provide the following as examples of types of<br />
	health care provider behavior that are permissible under the<br />
	regulations. For instance, a health care provider may send an<br />
	electronic health care claim or equivalent encounter information<br />
	standard transaction for Patient A to health plan Z, and may send a<br />
	paper claim for Patient B to health plan Z. A health care provider may<br />
	also send an electronic health care claim or equivalent encounter<br />
	information standard transaction to health plan S</p>
<p>[[Page 50315]]</p>
<p>and then send paper claims to health plan T.<br />
	    In regard to the second comment, while we interpret HIPAA to mean<br />
	that a health plan cannot refuse to conduct a transaction because it is<br />
	a standard transaction, we do not believe that use of standard<br />
	transactions can create a relationship or liability that does not<br />
	exist. For example, a health plan cannot refuse to accept a claim from<br />
	a health care provider because the health care provider electronically<br />
	submits the standard transaction. However, the health plan is not<br />
	required to pay the claim merely because the health care provider<br />
	submitted it in standard format, if other business reasons exist for<br />
	denying the claim (for example, the service for which the claim is<br />
	being submitted is not covered). This rule does not require a health<br />
	care provider to send or accept an electronic transaction.<br />
	2. Various Technologies<br />
	    Proposal Summary: Entities that offer on-line interactive<br />
	transmission of the transactions described in section 1173(a)(2) of the<br />
	Act, would have to comply with the standards (63 FR 25276). For<br />
	example, the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) interaction between a<br />
	server and a browser by which the data elements of a transaction are<br />
	solicited from a user would not have to use the standards, although the<br />
	data content must be equal to that required for the standard. Once the<br />
	data elements are assembled into a transaction by the server, the<br />
	transmitted transaction would have to comply with the standards.<br />
	    a. Comment: Several comments recommended that electronic<br />
	transmissions should be classified as ``computer to computer without<br />
	human interaction'' (i.e., batch and fast batch transmissions) and be<br />
	subject to the national standards. They also recommended that<br />
	transmissions involving browser to server (Internet, Extranet, HTML,<br />
	Java, ActiveX, etc.), direct data entry terminals (dumb terminals), PC<br />
	terminal emulators, point of service terminals (devices similar in<br />
	function to credit card terminals), telephone voice response systems,<br />
	``faxback'' systems, and any real-time transactions where data elements<br />
	are directly solicited from a human user, be classified as ``person to<br />
	computer'' transmissions. Moreover, ``person to computer''<br />
	transmissions should be supplemental to the national standards, but the<br />
	data content of these transmissions should comply with the HIPAA<br />
	electronic standards as they apply to data content.<br />
	    Several commenters questioned whether HIPAA requires a health plan<br />
	to support ``person to computer'' methods. Several commenters suggested<br />
	that we should only except HTML web sites from the transaction<br />
	standards if the web browser is used in HTML passive mode without plug-<br />
	ins or programmable extensions and that the response times must be the<br />
	same or faster than that of the HIPAA electronic standards.<br />
	    Commenters also recommended that we permit the use of a proprietary<br />
	format for web-based transactions if the transactions are sent to an<br />
	entity's in-house system for processing, and the entity's web browser<br />
	is under the control of a back-end processor, as well as part of the<br />
	same corporate entity, and does not serve other back-end processors.<br />
	They recommended that the HIPAA standards be used if the transactions<br />
	are sent externally (outside of that entity's system) for processing,<br />
	and the entity's web browser is under a contract with a back-end<br />
	processor that is not under the same corporate control, and that serves<br />
	more than one back-end processor.<br />
	    Response: We are pleased that commenters support the use of the<br />
	national standards for electronic transactions since this outcome is<br />
	required by section 1173 of the Act. For each designated transaction,<br />
	these standards specify the format, the data elements required or<br />
	permitted to structure the format, and the data content permitted for<br />
	each of the data elements, including designated code sets where<br />
	applicable.<br />
	    Certain technologies present a special case for the use of standard<br />
	transactions. We proposed that telephone voice response, ``faxback'',<br />
	and Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) interactions would not be<br />
	required to follow the standard. We have since reevaluated this<br />
	position in light of the many comments on this position and on<br />
	developments in the EDI industry which continue to expand the options<br />
	in this area. We have decided that, instead of creating an exception<br />
	for these transmissions, we will recognize that there are certain<br />
	transmission modes in which use of the format portion of the standard<br />
	is inappropriate. However, the transaction must conform to the data<br />
	content portion of the standard. The ``direct data entry'' process,<br />
	using dumb terminals or computer browser screens, where the data is<br />
	directly keyed by a health care provider into a health plan's computer,<br />
	would not have to use the format portion of the standard, but the data<br />
	content must conform. If the data is directly entered into a system<br />
	that is outside of the health plan's system, to be transmitted later to<br />
	the health plan, the transaction must be sent using the full standard<br />
	(format and content). We have included this clarification in<br />
	Sec. 162.923 (Requirements for Covered Entities).<br />
	3. Atypical Services<br />
	    Proposal Summary: Transactions for certain services that are not<br />
	normally considered health care services, but which may be covered by<br />
	some health plans, would not be subject to the standards (63 FR 25276).<br />
	These services would include, but not be limited to: nonemergency<br />
	transportation, physical alterations to living quarters for the purpose<br />
	of accommodating disabilities, and case management. Other services may<br />
	be added to this list at the discretion of the Secretary.<br />
	    Comment: We received comments both for and against subjecting<br />
	transactions for certain services to the transaction standards. Some<br />
	commenters recommended that any service that could be billed to a<br />
	health plan be required to comply with the standards in order to avoid<br />
	the need to maintain alternate systems. However, other commenters<br />
	argued that certain Medicaid services are not insured by any other<br />
	program, thus, use of the standard is unnecessary.<br />
	    Several commenters supported not subjecting these services to the<br />
	standard, except for case management, arguing that a more precise<br />
	definition of case management needs to be developed. Other commenters<br />
	stated that case management is considered a health care service by many<br />
	health plans and health care providers, and reported using standard<br />
	codes.<br />
	    We received suggestions for additional services that should not be<br />
	subject to the standards. Suggestions included home and community based<br />
	waiver services provided under the Medicaid program and abbreviated<br />
	transactions between State agencies, for example, claims between a<br />
	State health service and a State Medicaid agency.<br />
	    Response: We agree with commenters that case management is a health<br />
	care service since it is directly related to the health of an<br />
	individual and is furnished by health care providers. Case management<br />
	will, therefore, be subject to the standards.<br />
	    We recognize that the health care claim and equivalent encounter<br />
	information standard, with its supporting implementation specification,<br />
	is capable of supporting claims for atypical services. However,<br />
	requiring all services potentially paid for by health plans to be<br />
	billed using the</p>
<p>[[Page 50316]]</p>
<p>standards would lead to taxi drivers, auto mechanics and carpenters to<br />
	be regulated as health care providers. Instead, we will use our<br />
	definition of ``health care'' found at 160.103 to determine whether a<br />
	particular service is a ``health care'' service or not. Services that<br />
	are not health care services or supplies under this definition are not<br />
	required to be claimed using the standard transactions. Thus, claims<br />
	for non-emergency transportation or carpentry services for housing<br />
	modifications, if submitted electronically, would not be required to be<br />
	conducted as standard transactions. As noted above, the standards do<br />
	support such claims and a health plan may choose to require its<br />
	atypical service providers to use the standards for its own business<br />
	purposes.<br />
	    Those atypical services that meet the definition of health care,<br />
	however, must be billed using the standard if they are submitted<br />
	electronically. If there are no specific codes for billing a particular<br />
	service (for example, there is not yet an approved code set for billing<br />
	for alternative therapies), or if the standard transactions do not<br />
	readily support a particular method of presenting an atypical service<br />
	(for example, roster billing for providing immunizations for an entire<br />
	school or nursing facility), the health care service providers are<br />
	urged to work with the appropriate Designated Standard Maintenance<br />
	Organizations (DSMOs) to develop modifications to the standard and<br />
	implementation specifications. (See ``I. New and Revised Standards'' in<br />
	this section of the preamble for a discussion of the DSMOs.)<br />
	    We disagree with the proposal that home and community based waiver<br />
	services should have a blanket exemption from the administrative<br />
	simplification standards. First, Congress explicitly included the<br />
	Medicaid programs as health plans that are subject to the<br />
	administrative simplification standards. Second, these waiver programs<br />
	commonly pay for a mix of health care and non-health care services.<br />
	State Medicaid agencies with home and community based waivers are not<br />
	exempt from these standards for transactions relating to health care<br />
	services or supplies.<br />
	4. Conducting the Transactions<br />
	    Proposal Summary: If a person conducts a transaction (as defined in<br />
	Sec. 160.103) with a health plan as a standard transaction, the<br />
	following apply:<br />
	    (1) The health plan may not refuse to conduct the transaction as a<br />
	standard transaction.<br />
	    (2) The health plan may not delay the transaction or otherwise<br />
	adversely affect, or attempt to adversely affect, the person or the<br />
	transaction on the ground that the transaction is a standard<br />
	transaction.<br />
	    Comment: Some commenters questioned what was meant by ``delay'' of<br />
	a standard transaction. They questioned what methods (i.e., batch,<br />
	online, etc.) a health plan must provide to support receipt and<br />
	submission of standard transactions. The proposed rule did not define<br />
	the term ``delay'' nor specify the time frame within which a health<br />
	plan is required to act when it receives a standard transaction.<br />
	    Several commenters recommended the rule encompass all entities that<br />
	might be conducting an electronic transaction with a health plan and<br />
	that there be further clarification of what an unreasonable delay would<br />
	be. It was also recommended that the regulation should apply to a<br />
	health care provider, not a person that conducts an ``electronic''<br />
	transaction.<br />
	    Response: Section 1175 of the Act prohibits a health plan from<br />
	delaying a standard transaction, or otherwise adversely affecting, or<br />
	attempting to adversely affect any person desiring to conduct a<br />
	transaction referred to in Sec. 1173 (a)(1) of the Social Security Act<br />
	or the transaction on the ground that the transaction is a standard<br />
	transaction. We interpret this provision to mean that there should be<br />
	no degradation in the transmission of, receipt of, processing of, and<br />
	response to a standard transaction solely because the transaction is a<br />
	standard transaction. Thus, health plans must process standard<br />
	transactions from any person, including, but not limited to, covered<br />
	entities, in the same time frame in which they processed transactions<br />
	prior to implementation of HIPAA. They also may not provide incentives<br />
	that will discourage (i.e., adversely affect) the use of standard<br />
	transactions.<br />
	    In Sec. 162.923 we have included requirements for all covered<br />
	entities and in Sec. 162.925 we have provided additional requirements<br />
	for health plans.<br />
	5. Role of Health Care Clearinghouses<br />
	    Proposal Summary: Health care clearinghouses would be able to<br />
	accept nonstandard transactions for the sole purpose of translating<br />
	them into standard transactions for sending customers and would be able<br />
	to accept standard transactions and translate them into nonstandard<br />
	formats for receiving customers (63 FR 25276).<br />
	    Comment: Several commenters believe health care clearinghouses are<br />
	excepted from accepting the standards. Other commenters believe that<br />
	allowing health care providers to use a health care clearinghouse will<br />
	negate administrative simplification. There was also concern that<br />
	entities may designate themselves as a health care clearinghouse to<br />
	avoid compliance.<br />
	    Several commenters also requested that we clarify who is<br />
	responsible for health care clearinghouse costs and state that<br />
	contracts cannot require health care providers to use nonstandard<br />
	formats.<br />
	    Response: First, we clarify that a health care clearinghouse is a<br />
	covered entity and must comply with these rules. Accordingly, all<br />
	transactions covered by this part between health care clearinghouses<br />
	must be conducted as standard transactions. However, the statute<br />
	permits a covered entity to submit nonstandard communications to a<br />
	health care clearinghouse for processing into standard transactions and<br />
	transmission by the health care clearinghouse as well as receive<br />
	standard transactions through the health care clearinghouse.<br />
	    If a covered entity (for example, a health care provider) uses a<br />
	health care clearinghouse to submit and receive nonstandard/standard<br />
	transactions, the health care clearinghouse is the covered entity's<br />
	business associate. If a health plan operates as a health care<br />
	clearinghouse, or requires the use of a health care clearinghouse, a<br />
	health care provider may submit standard transactions to that health<br />
	plan through the health care clearinghouse. However, the health care<br />
	provider must not be adversely affected, financially or otherwise, by<br />
	doing so. (For example, the costs of submitting a standard transaction<br />
	to a health plan's health care clearinghouse must not be in excess of<br />
	the costs of submitting a standard transaction directly to the health<br />
	plan.)<br />
	    In Sec. 162.915, we clarify what a trading partner agreement that a<br />
	covered entity enters into may not do. Section 162.923 specifies that a<br />
	covered entity conducting a transaction covered under this rule with<br />
	another covered entity (or within the same covered entity) using<br />
	electronic media must conduct the transaction as standard transaction,<br />
	with an exception for direct data entry. Section 162.925 makes it clear<br />
	that a health plan may not offer an incentive for a health care<br />
	provider to conduct a transaction covered by this part under the direct<br />
	data entry exception.<br />
	6. Exception for Transmissions within Corporate Entities<br />
	    Proposal Summary: Transmissions within a corporate entity would not<br />
	be</p>
<p>[[Page 50317]]</p>
<p>required to comply with the standards (63 FR 25276).<br />
	    Comment: We received many comments regarding excepting<br />
	transmissions within corporate boundaries and the examples we provided.<br />
	The comments can be summarized by three questions: (1) What constitutes<br />
	a ``corporate entity'' and ``internal'' communications; (2) can the<br />
	``internal umbrella'' cover the transactions among ``corporate''<br />
	entities; and (3) why should Government agencies be excepted from<br />
	meeting the standards?<br />
	    Some commenters attempted to determine the circumstances under<br />
	which compliance with the standards can be avoided. Generally, these<br />
	commenters indicated a desire for a very broad definition of<br />
	``corporate entity.'' Some commenters reflected a desire to severely<br />
	restrict the boundaries or eliminate them altogether. Other commenters<br />
	asked if particular kinds of data or transactions are required in<br />
	particular situations.<br />
	    Response: We proposed to create an exception for transactions<br />
	within a corporate entity to minimize burden. However, after<br />
	considering public comment, and further analyzing the implications of<br />
	the proposed exception, we have decided not to create an exception for<br />
	standard transactions within a ``corporate entity.'' First, we have not<br />
	been able to define ``corporate entity'' so that the exception would<br />
	not defeat the rule. The rapid pace of mergers, acquisitions, and<br />
	dissolutions in the corporate health care world would make such an<br />
	exception extremely difficult to implement. Equally important, the<br />
	proposed exception would not have promoted the use of the standard<br />
	transactions at the health care provider and health plan level. Each<br />
	health care provider that is owned by or under contract to one or more<br />
	health plans could be required to use the ``in-house'' or ``non-<br />
	standard'' transactions favored by each health plan, thus negating the<br />
	benefits of the use of the standards. Finally, our decision to not<br />
	adopt a corporate entity exception does not impose an additional burden<br />
	on health plans, because health plans already are required to have the<br />
	capacity to accept standard transactions from any person. Thus, the<br />
	fundamental policy is that covered entities must use a standard<br />
	transaction when transmitting a transaction covered by this part with<br />
	another covered entity (or within the same covered entity)<br />
	electronically, regardless of whether the transmission is inside or<br />
	outside the entity.<br />
	    We have decided to clarify the description of each transaction to<br />
	help covered entities determine when the standards must be used. A<br />
	transaction is now defined in Sec. 160.103 as the exchange of data for<br />
	one of the enumerated specific purposes. In subparts K through R of<br />
	part 162, we describe each transaction in specific, functional terms.<br />
	For example, one type of health care claims or equivalent encounter<br />
	information transaction is the exchange of information between a health<br />
	care provider and a health plan about services provided to a patient to<br />
	obtain payment; one type of eligibility for a health plan transaction<br />
	is the exchange of information between a health provider and a health<br />
	plan to determine whether a patient is eligible for services under that<br />
	health plan. Data submissions or exchanges for purposes other than<br />
	those designated in this regulation are not transactions and therefore<br />
	do not require use of the standards.<br />
	    Transactions may be used by both covered entities and other<br />
	entities. For example, the enrollment and disenrollment in a health<br />
	plan transaction is most commonly sent by employers or unions, which<br />
	are not covered entities, to health plans, which are covered entities.<br />
	The employer may choose to send the transaction electronically in<br />
	either standard or non-standard format. The health plan, however, must<br />
	conduct the transaction as a standard transaction when conducting the<br />
	transaction electronically with another covered entity, with another<br />
	part of itself, or when requested to do so by any other entity.<br />
	Moreover, if an employer or other non-covered entity desires to send a<br />
	transaction as a standard transaction, the health plan may not delay or<br />
	adversely affect either the sender or the transaction. It is expected<br />
	that this provision will encourage non-covered entities that conduct<br />
	the designated transactions with more than one health plan to conduct<br />
	these transactions as standard transactions.<br />
	    In general, if a covered entity conducts, using electronic media, a<br />
	transaction adopted under this part with another covered entity (or<br />
	within the same covered entity), it must conduct the transaction as a<br />
	standard transaction. If any entity (covered or not covered) requests a<br />
	health plan to conduct a transaction as a standard transaction, the<br />
	health plan must comply. We have provided examples below to assist in<br />
	determining when a transaction must be conducted as a standard<br />
	transaction.</p>
<p>    Example 1:  Corporation K operates a health plan that is a<br />
	covered entity under these rules. Corporation K owns a hospital<br />
	which provides care to patients with coverage under Corporation K's<br />
	health plan and also provides care to patients with coverage under<br />
	other health plans. Corporate rules require the hospital to send<br />
	encounter information electronically to Corporation K identifying<br />
	the patients covered by the corporate plan and served by the<br />
	hospital.<br />
	    (A) Must the transmission of encounter data comply with the<br />
	standards? Both the health plan and the hospital are covered<br />
	entities. The hospital is a covered entity because it is conducting<br />
	covered transactions electronically in compliance with its corporate<br />
	rules. The electronic submission of encounter data satisfies the<br />
	definition of the health care claims or equivalent encounter<br />
	information transaction designated as a standard transaction (see<br />
	Sec. 162.1101(b)). Therefore, the submission of this encounter data<br />
	therefore must be a standard transaction.<br />
	    (B) Must the payments and remittance advices sent from<br />
	Corporation K's health plan to the hospital be conducted as standard<br />
	transactions? Corporation K's health plan is covered by the<br />
	definition of ``health plan,'' the hospital is a covered entity, and<br />
	the transmission of health care payments and remittance advices is<br />
	within the scope of the designated transactions (see Sec. 162.1601).<br />
	The health care payments and remittance advices must be sent as<br />
	standard transactions.<br />
	    Example 2:  A large multi-state employer provides health<br />
	benefits on a self-insured basis, thereby establishing a health<br />
	plan. The health plan contracts with insurance companies in seven<br />
	states to function as third party administrators to process its<br />
	employees' health claims in each of those states. The employer's<br />
	health plan contracts with a data service company to hold the health<br />
	eligibility information on all its employees. Each of the insurance<br />
	companies sends eligibility inquiries to the data service company to<br />
	verify the eligibility of specific employees upon receipt of claims<br />
	for services provided to those employees or their dependents.<br />
	    (A) Are these eligibility inquiries activities that must be<br />
	conducted as standard transactions? In this case, each insurance<br />
	company is not a covered entity in its own right because it is<br />
	functioning as a third party administrator, which is not a covered<br />
	entity. However, as a third party administrator (TPA), it is the<br />
	business associate of a covered entity (the health plan) performing<br />
	a function for that entity; therefore, assuming that the covered<br />
	entity is in compliance, the TPA would be required to follow the<br />
	same rules that are applicable to the covered entity if the covered<br />
	entity performed the functions itself. The definition for the<br />
	eligibility for a health plan transaction is an inquiry from a<br />
	health care provider to a health plan, or from one health plan to<br />
	another health plan, to determine the eligibility, coverage, or<br />
	benefits associated with a health plan for a subscriber. In this<br />
	case, the inquiry is from one business associate of that health plan<br />
	to another business associate of that same health plan. Therefore,<br />
	the inquiry does not meet the definition of an eligibility for a</p>
<p>[[Page 50318]]</p>
<p>health plan transaction, and is not required to be conducted as a<br />
	standard transaction.<br />
	    (B) Is an electronic eligibility inquiry from a health care<br />
	provider to the data service company, to determine whether an<br />
	employee-patient may receive a particular service, required to be a<br />
	standard transaction? The health care provider is a covered entity,<br />
	because it conducts covered electronic transactions. The data<br />
	service company is the business associate of the employer health<br />
	plan performing a plan function. Therefore, the activity meets the<br />
	definition of the eligibility for a health plan transaction, and<br />
	both the inquiry and the response must be standard transactions.<br />
	    Example 3: A pharmacy (a health care provider) contracts with a<br />
	pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) to forward its claims electronically<br />
	to health plan Z. Under the contract, the PBM also receives health<br />
	care payment and remittance advice from health plan Z and forwards<br />
	them to the pharmacy.<br />
	    (A) Must the submission of claims be standard transactions? The<br />
	pharmacy is a covered entity electronically submitting, to covered<br />
	entity health plan Z, health care claims or equivalent encounter<br />
	information, which are designated transactions (see Sec. 162.1101),<br />
	through a business associate, the PBM. The claims must be submitted<br />
	as standard transactions.<br />
	    (B) Must the explanation of benefits and remittance advice<br />
	information be sent as a standard transaction? Health plan Z and the<br />
	health care provider are covered entities conducting one of the<br />
	designated transactions (see Sec. 162.1601). This transaction,<br />
	therefore, must be conducted as a standard transaction.</p>
<p>    Example 4: A State Medicaid plan enters into a contract with a<br />
	managed care organization (MCO) to provide services to Medicaid<br />
	recipients. That organization in turn contracts with different<br />
	health care providers to render the services.<br />
	    (A) When a health care provider submits a claim or encounter<br />
	information electronically to the MCO, is this activity required to<br />
	be a standard transaction? The entity submitting the information is<br />
	a health care provider, covered by this rule, and the MCO meets our<br />
	definition of health plan. The activity is a health care claims or<br />
	equivalent encounter information transaction designated in this<br />
	regulation. The transaction must be a standard transaction.<br />
	    (B) The managed care organization then submits a bill to the<br />
	State Medicaid agency for payment for all the care given to all the<br />
	persons covered by that MCO for that month under a capitation<br />
	agreement. Is this a standard transaction? The MCO is a health plan<br />
	under the definition of ``health plan'' in Sec. 160.103. The State<br />
	Medicaid agency is also a covered entity as a health plan. The<br />
	activity, however, does not meet the definition of a health care<br />
	claims or equivalent encounter information transaction. It does not<br />
	need to be a standard transaction.<br />
	    However, note that the health plan premium payment transaction<br />
	from the State Medicaid agency to the health plan would have to be<br />
	conducted as a standard transaction because the State Medicaid<br />
	agency is a covered entity sending the transaction to another<br />
	covered entity (the health plan), and the transaction meets the<br />
	definition of health plan premium payment.<br />
	7. Applicability to Paper Transactions and Other Entities<br />
	    Proposal Summary: Although there are situations in which the use of<br />
	the standards is not required (for example, health care providers may<br />
	continue to submit paper claims and employers and other noncovered<br />
	entities are not required to use any of the standard transactions), we<br />
	stressed that a standard may be used voluntarily in any situation in<br />
	which it is not required (63 FR 25276).<br />
	    a. Comment: The majority of commenters suggested that the<br />
	transaction standards and their codes sets, in some manner, apply to<br />
	paper transactions. They suggested that the required data elements in<br />
	the standard transactions also be required for paper transactions and<br />
	that any required identifiers also be required for use on paper<br />
	transactions.<br />
	    The commenters stated that there could be two consequences if the<br />
	same data were not required on paper and electronic transactions.<br />
	First, health plans would have to maintain two systems: one for the<br />
	processing of electronic claims; and one for the processing of paper<br />
	claims. The same argument was also applied to identifiers--it was<br />
	argued that health plans would need to maintain two sets of<br />
	identifiers: one for paper claims; and one for electronic claims.<br />
	Second, many health care providers would revert to paper claims if the<br />
	data requirements were less restrictive than those for electronic<br />
	claims.<br />
	    Response: These are powerful arguments from a cost benefit<br />
	standpoint. While the HIPAA statute provides the Secretary with the<br />
	authority to declare these standards applicable to all transactions,<br />
	including those on paper, we chose at this point to focus on standards<br />
	for electronic transactions. Most of the paper forms currently in use<br />
	today cannot accommodate all of the data content included in the<br />
	standard transactions. This does not prevent health plans from<br />
	requiring the same data, including identifiers for paper transactions<br />
	as is required by the HIPAA regulations with respect to electronic<br />
	transactions.<br />
	    b. Comment: Several commenters recommended that employers/sponsors<br />
	who perform EDI should be required to use the standards because they<br />
	play a critical role in the overall administration of health care.<br />
	These entities are the major users of the enrollment and disenrollment<br />
	in a health plan transactions, and are often major payers of health<br />
	premiums.<br />
	    Response: The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA do<br />
	not require noncovered entities to use the standards, but noncovered<br />
	entities are encouraged to do so in order to achieve the benefits<br />
	available from such use. For example, employers and sponsors play a key<br />
	role in the administrative functions of health care, e.g. the<br />
	enrollment and disenrollment of individuals in health plans. But<br />
	because the legislation does not specifically require employers /<br />
	sponsors to use the transaction standards, we are not extending the<br />
	requirement to them in the regulation. Health plans are, however, free<br />
	to negotiate trading partner agreements with employers and sponsors<br />
	that require the use of standard transactions.<br />
	8. Exceptions for State Law (Section 1178)<br />
	    Proposal Summary: The proposed rule did not propose preemption<br />
	requirements in the regulation text and did not directly request<br />
	comments on the preemption issue. However, it did set forth a summary<br />
	of the preemption provision of the Act, section 1178, and, therefore,<br />
	raised the issue for public comment (63 FR 25274). In response, we<br />
	received a number of comments regarding the preemption issue, and<br />
	requesting guidance on how preemption questions will be resolved.<br />
	    Comment: Many commenters recommended the exception for State law<br />
	process be delineated or clarified in the final rule. Many commenters<br />
	stated that exceptions in general should not be granted, saying that<br />
	this is contrary to the idea of national standards. Other commenters<br />
	stated exceptions should be discouraged.<br />
	    Response: The statute clearly states that the Secretary may grant<br />
	exceptions in certain circumstances. The proposed rule regarding<br />
	Standards for Privacy for Individually Identifiable Health Information,<br />
	published in the Federal Register on November 3, 1999 (64 FR 59967),<br />
	specifically raised the preemption issue. Comments received in response<br />
	to that proposed rule are being analyzed. We will issue conforming<br />
	amendments to Part 160 Subpart B when the preemption issues have been<br />
	resolved in the context of the Standards for Privacy for Individually<br />
	Identifiable Health Information final rule.</p>
<p>[[Page 50319]]</p>
<p>B. Definitions</p>
<p>Comments and Responses Concerning the Definitions</p>
<p>    Several definitions in this rule have also been proposed in other<br />
	HIPAA proposed rules. They may be revised as these other rules are<br />
	published in final.<br />
	1. Code set<br />
	    Comment: One commenter stated that the definition of code set<br />
	should be expanded to include factors such as functional status, in<br />
	order to clarify that a code set is not limited to ``medical'' terms.<br />
	    Response: We have defined ``code set'' very broadly to encompass<br />
	any set of codes used to encode data elements. Many code sets (such as<br />
	revenue codes) are nonmedical in nature and are designated within the<br />
	transaction standards. We are separately designating standards for<br />
	medical data code sets used in the transaction.<br />
	2. Health Care Clearinghouse<br />
	    Comment: Several commenters requested that the definition of a<br />
	health care clearinghouse be reworded. Of particular concern was the<br />
	reference to other entities, such as billing services, repricing<br />
	companies, etc. Commenters stated the definition would preclude these<br />
	other entities from using a health care clearinghouse for format<br />
	translation and data conversion. Several commenters stated health care<br />
	clearinghouses play roles other than data and format conversion as<br />
	described in the proposed rule.<br />
	    Response: If an entity does not perform the functions of format<br />
	translation and data conversion, it is not considered a health care<br />
	clearinghouse under our definition. Billing services, for example, are<br />
	often extensions of a health care provider's office, primarily<br />
	performing data entry of health care claims and reconciling the<br />
	payments received from a health plan. Health care providers may use<br />
	health care clearinghouses for format translation and other services a<br />
	health care clearinghouse provides. We agree the definition should be<br />
	reworded and have revised the definition in Sec. 160.103.<br />
	3. Health care provider<br />
	    Comment: We received several comments requesting clarification on<br />
	the distinction between billing health care providers and a billing<br />
	service, as well as clarification on the difference between<br />
	housekeeping staff and home health aides. Several commenters<br />
	recommended removal of the word ``bills'' in the definition. They want<br />
	the definition to be based on the direct provision of health care and<br />
	not financial arrangements.<br />
	    Response: The proposed rule regarding Standard Health Care Provider<br />
	Identifiers, published in the Federal Register on May 7, 1998 (63 FR<br />
	25320) also included the definition of health care provider. Comments<br />
	received in response to that proposed rule regarding the definition of<br />
	a health care provider included the comments above, as well as<br />
	additional comments, and are being analyzed. We believe it is<br />
	appropriate to address all comments regarding the definition of a<br />
	health care provider in the final rule for Standard Health Care<br />
	Provider Identifiers.<br />
	4. Health plan<br />
	    We interpret section 1171(5)(G) of the Act to mean that issuers of<br />
	long-term care policies are considered health plans for purposes of<br />
	administrative simplification. We also believe that this provision of<br />
	the statute gives the Secretary the discretionary authority to include<br />
	or exclude nursing home fixed-indemnity policies from the definition of<br />
	a health plan. We specifically requested comments on the impact of<br />
	HIPAA on the long-term care segment of the health care industry.<br />
	    a. Comment: The majority who commented on long-term care policies<br />
	recommended we exclude these policies from the definition of a health<br />
	plan. Several commenters stated the standard transaction implementation<br />
	specifications do not meet long term care administrative requirements.<br />
	The commenters noted that there are fundamental differences between the<br />
	nature and type of transactions and information required by health<br />
	plans that pay for long-term care services and those that pay for<br />
	hospital or physician care. The commenters pointed out that not all<br />
	long-term care insurance policies pay directly for specific long-term<br />
	care services. They also stated that the code sets included in the<br />
	proposed regulation do not adequately meet the needs of long-term care<br />
	insurance because most documents sent to these companies are narrative<br />
	``activities of daily living'' (ADLs) evaluations, adult ``day care''<br />
	invoices and physician notes.<br />
	    Moreover, including long-term care only policies within the<br />
	definition of a health plan would be contrary to the purposes of<br />
	section 1171 of the Act. It was also stated that for the most part, the<br />
	long-term care industry is not automated and the costs of developing<br />
	systems to implement these requirements will be dramatic with little,<br />
	if any, return. It would increase consumer premiums. Most long-term<br />
	care claim submissions and payment transactions are between the insured<br />
	(or a family member) and their insurance companies, without health care<br />
	providers submitting claims.<br />
	    One commenter that supported including long-term care policies in<br />
	the definition of a health plan stated that there have been great<br />
	strides in the automation of health information in the long-term care<br />
	industry and it should not be excepted from the standards. Another<br />
	commenter stated the proposed standards offer the opportunity for all<br />
	segments of the health care industry to adopt automation and to benefit<br />
	from such adoption. The standards provide long-term care health care<br />
	providers with a single method that can be exchanged with all health<br />
	plans. The commenter stated it would be an unfortunate precedent to<br />
	except segments of the health care industry from these rules.<br />
	    Response: The arguments both for and against inclusion of long-term<br />
	care policies have merit. Since some long term care health care<br />
	providers bill Medicaid using the UB92, it appears that standard<br />
	transactions and code sets could be used by long-term care health care<br />
	providers to bill health plans. In addition, we agree that movement by<br />
	the industry to these electronic standards would create long term<br />
	benefits including decreased administrative costs.<br />
	    We interpret the statute as authorizing the Secretary to exclude<br />
	nursing home fixed-indemnity policies, not all long-term care policies,<br />
	from the definition of ``health plan,'' if she determines that these<br />
	policies do not provide ``sufficiently comprehensive coverage of a<br />
	benefit'' to be treated as a health plan (see section 1171 of the Act).<br />
	We interpret the term ``comprehensive'' to refer to the breadth or<br />
	scope of coverage of a policy. ``Comprehensive'' policies would be<br />
	those that cover a range of possible service options. Since nursing<br />
	home fixed indemnity policies are, by their own terms, limited to<br />
	payments made solely for nursing facility care, we have determined that<br />
	they should not be included as health plans for the purposes of this<br />
	regulation. The Secretary has, therefore, determined that only nursing<br />
	home fixed-indemnity policies should be excluded from the definition of<br />
	``health plan.'' Issuers of all other long-term care policies are<br />
	considered to be health plans under this rule.<br />
	    b. Comment: Several commenters recommended that property and<br />
	casualty insurance health plans and workers' compensation health plans<br />
	be included in the definition of a health plan. It was stated that we<br />
	should not</p>
<p>[[Page 50320]]</p>
<p>arbitrarily exclude certain health plans. It was also stated that<br />
	exclusion will cause undue hardship on health care providers of those<br />
	specialities that most frequently deal with these health plans, such as<br />
	orthopedic specialists. It was questioned whether the Bureau of Prisons<br />
	or state correctional facilities are included in this definition, since<br />
	they provide or pay for the cost of medical care.<br />
	    Another commenter stated that if State Workers' Compensation<br />
	Programs are allowed to operate with different rules (as they do now)<br />
	health care providers will be required to maintain multiple systems to<br />
	accommodate the many variations. Consequently, administrative<br />
	simplification will not achieve the desired cost savings.<br />
	    Response: We recognize that non-HIPAA entities such as workers'<br />
	compensation programs and property casualty insurance accept electronic<br />
	transactions from health care providers, however, the Congress did not<br />
	include these programs in the definition of a health plan under section<br />
	1171 of the Act.<br />
	    The statutory definition of a health plan does not specifically<br />
	include workers' compensation programs, property and casualty programs,<br />
	or disability insurance programs, and, consequently, we are not<br />
	requiring them to comply with the standards. However, to the extent<br />
	that these programs perform health care claims processing activities<br />
	using an electronic standard, it would benefit these programs and their<br />
	health care providers to use the standard we adopt.<br />
	    We believe that prisons do not fall within this definition of<br />
	health plan, as prisons are not ``individual or group plans''<br />
	established for the purpose of paying the cost of health care.<br />
	    c. Comment: We received two requests to clarify that limited scope<br />
	dental and vision health plans are not subject to the rule. It was<br />
	stated that the proposed rule did not specifically indicate that the<br />
	standards are applicable to these health plans. The limited scope<br />
	dental health plans provide for annual maximum benefits generally in<br />
	the $1000-$2000 range and annual benefit payments under limited scope<br />
	vision health plans rarely exceed a few hundred dollars. The commenters<br />
	noted that consumers can afford presently to pay for the cost of the<br />
	annual benefit payments, but if health plans must implement these<br />
	standards, they will most likely pass on the costs associated with this<br />
	burden to their enrollees, causing many consumers to drop their<br />
	coverage.<br />
	    Response: We believe limited scope dental health plans and limited<br />
	scope vision health plans meet the definition of health plan and, thus,<br />
	they are subject to the requirements of this rule. The Congress did not<br />
	give the Secretary the discretion to treat these health plans<br />
	differently than other health plans. If a health plan believes it would<br />
	be cost prohibitive to implement the standards, it has the option of<br />
	using a health care clearinghouse to transmit and receive the standard<br />
	transactions.<br />
	5. Small Health Plan<br />
	    Comment: One commenter requested we clarify how the figure for the<br />
	number of participants for a small health plan was determined. For<br />
	instance, is an individual insured in a health plan for one month<br />
	considered a participant for that year? Would twelve different people<br />
	insured for one month each in a single year be considered a<br />
	participant? Another commenter questioned why small health plans are<br />
	being given an extra 12 months to implement the standards.<br />
	    Response: In the proposed rule, we stated that a small health plan<br />
	means a group health plan or individual health plan with fewer than 50<br />
	participants. It has come to our attention that the Small Business<br />
	Administration (SBA) promulgates size standards that indicates the<br />
	maximum number of employees or annual receipts allowed for a concern<br />
	(13 CFR 121.105) and its affiliates to be considered ``small.'' The<br />
	size standards themselves are expressed either in number of employees<br />
	or annual receipts (13 CFR 121.201). The size standards for compliance<br />
	with programs of other agencies are those for SBA programs which are<br />
	most comparable to the programs of such other agencies, unless<br />
	otherwise agreed by the agency and the SBA (13 CFR 121.902). With<br />
	respect to the insurance industry, the SBA has specified that annual<br />
	receipts of $5 million is the maximum allowed for a concern and its<br />
	affiliates to be considered small (13 CFR 121.201). Consequently, the<br />
	definition of small health plan has been amended to be consistent with<br />
	SBA requirements. As such, we need not address the definition of<br />
	participants for purposes of small health plans.<br />
	    Small health plans must implement the standards no later than 36<br />
	months after adoption under section 1175 of the Act.<br />
	6. Standard<br />
	    Comment: One commenter stated the proposed rule dramatically<br />
	changed the definition of standard. The commenter stated the new<br />
	definition implies that any and all standards promulgated by an ANSI<br />
	SSO or HHS automatically become a standard, whereas under the Act, only<br />
	the Secretary can specify, establish, or adopt standards. The commenter<br />
	recommended the definition under the Act stay the same.<br />
	    Response: We agree that only the Secretary may adopt a standard<br />
	under the Act. Because the statutory definition of the term<br />
	``standard'' is ambiguous, we are adopting a broader definition to<br />
	accommodate the varying functions of the specific standards proposed in<br />
	the other HIPAA regulations. We have revised the definition in<br />
	Sec. 160.103 to clarify this, and have also added a definition for<br />
	standard transaction in Sec. 162.103 for further clarification.<br />
	7. Transaction<br />
	    Comment: Several commenters recommended we amend the transaction<br />
	definition to clarify each transaction.<br />
	    Response: We have provided clarification in the definitions of each<br />
	transaction in subparts K through R.</p>
<p>Additional Definitions</p>
<p>    Comment: We received comments requesting that we define the terms<br />
	``sponsor,'' ``third party administrator,'' ``trading partner<br />
	agreement,'' and ``health claims attachments.''<br />
	    Response: We have included a definition for trading partner<br />
	agreement in Sec. 160.103. In this final rule, we are defining only<br />
	terms used in the regulations text, therefore, we are not providing<br />
	definitions for ``sponsor'' or ``third party administrator.'' In the<br />
	future, we intend to publish a proposed rule that defines health claims<br />
	attachment.<br />
	    We have added definitions to parts 160 and 162 that were not part<br />
	of the proposed rule. In order to clarify the applicability and scope<br />
	of this rule, we have added definitions for ``covered entity,''<br />
	``trading partner agreement,'' and ``workforce'' to part 160, and<br />
	definitions for ``direct data entry'' and ``electronic media'' to part<br />
	162.<br />
	    We have added a definition for ``business associate'' to part 160<br />
	in order to distinguish those functions a covered entity chooses other<br />
	entities to perform on its behalf (making the other entity a business<br />
	associate of the covered entity) from the functions of other types of<br />
	agents. These other types may have differing meanings in different<br />
	situations (for example, insurance agent).<br />
	    To aid in the articulation of the process by which standards are<br />
	adopted and changed, we have added definitions for ``compliance date,''<br />
	``implementation specification,'' ``modify'' and ``standard</p>
<p>[[Page 50321]]</p>
<p>setting organization'' to part 160, and definitions for ``code set<br />
	maintaining organization,'' ``designated standard maintenance<br />
	organization (DSMO),'' and ``maintenance'' to part 162.<br />
	    We added a definition for ``standard transaction'' to part 162 to<br />
	complement the definitions of ``standard'' and ``transaction,'' which<br />
	were proposed and, in the case of standard, revised as discussed<br />
	earlier in this preamble. And, in order to enumerate as many facets of<br />
	a standard transaction as possible, we have added definitions for<br />
	``data condition,'' ``data content,'' ``data element,'' ``data set,''<br />
	``descriptor,'' ``format,'' ``maximum defined data set,'' and<br />
	``segment'' to part 162. These definitions should help to make clear<br />
	the components of a standard transaction.<br />
	    We also made several clarifications with respect to the definition<br />
	of ``health plan'' (Sec. 160.103). For purposes of defining the various<br />
	health plans that are considered health plans for purposes of the<br />
	regulation, we added the word ``issuer'' to Medicare supplemental<br />
	policy, and long-term care policy. We included the word ``issuer'' when<br />
	referring to long-term care policies, because policies themselves are<br />
	not entities subject to the statute. Rather, it is the issuers of long-<br />
	term care policies that are subject to the statute. We also added the<br />
	SCHIP program, because it is a health plan under section 4901 of the<br />
	Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-33) and meets the statutory<br />
	criteria for a health plan.<br />
	    We are adding a definition of ``state'' to Sec. 160.103 to clarify<br />
	its meaning with regard to the Federal programs included in the<br />
	definition of ``health plan,'' which contain this term.<br />
	    Several terms were in the proposed rule but are not included in the<br />
	final rule. We have reconsidered the inclusion of the definition of<br />
	``medical care.'' It has come to our attention that the term ``medical<br />
	care'' is easily confused with the term ``health care.'' Since the term<br />
	medical care is used in the regulation only in the context of the<br />
	definition of health plan and its inclusion in the regulation text may<br />
	cause confusion, we have decided to remove the definition of ``medical<br />
	care'' from the final regulation. We note, however, that ``medical<br />
	care'' is a statutorily defined term and its use is critical in making<br />
	a determination as to whether a health plan is considered a ``health<br />
	plan'' for purposes of Administrative Simplification. Thus, we do<br />
	include the statutory cite for ``medical care'' in the definitions of<br />
	``group health plan'' and ``health plan.''<br />
	    Similarly, we removed the definition of ``participant'' because it<br />
	appears only in the context of the definitions of the various types of<br />
	health plans. As in the case of ``medical care,'' we embed the<br />
	statutory cite for the definition of ``participant'' in the definition<br />
	of ``group health plan.''<br />
	    Also, the definitions for ``ASC X12,'' ``ASC X12N'' were removed<br />
	because we decided their presence in the regulation did not add to the<br />
	functionality of the text. We did not receive any comments on the<br />
	definitions that were removed.</p>
<p>C. Effective Dates and Compliance Dates</p>
<p>1. Effective Dates and Compliance Dates for Specified Standards<br />
	    The effective date for this final rule is the date that it amends<br />
	the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The current CFR consists of the<br />
	rules published in the latest CFR volume and any effective amendments<br />
	published in the Federal Register since the revision of the latest CFR<br />
	volume. Since the impact is expected to be in excess of $100 million<br />
	per year, Congress will have 60 days after the date of publication in<br />
	the Federal Register to revise the rule before it becomes effective.<br />
	Standards are adopted and implementation specifications are established<br />
	as of the effective date of this rule.<br />
	    The compliance dates of this final rule are the dates that covered<br />
	entities must be in compliance with the rule. The compliance date of<br />
	this final rule for most covered entities is no later than 24 months<br />
	after the effective date of this final rule. The compliance date of<br />
	this final rule for small health plans, however, is no later than 36<br />
	months after the effective date of this final rule.<br />
	    In our proposed rule, we stated that we would include the specific<br />
	compliance dates in the subpart for each standard (63 FR 25279). The<br />
	compliance dates in this final rule have been consolidated in<br />
	Sec. 162.900.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on Effective Dates and Compliance Dates for<br />
	Specific Standards</p>
<p>    Comment: The majority of commenters cited that Y2K initiatives will<br />
	clash with implementing the HIPAA standards. It was recommended that<br />
	the implementation date should be delayed until after the year 2000.<br />
	    Several commenters stated that a 2-year implementation time frame<br />
	may be inadequate to coordinate new system designs with other health<br />
	plans and to modify existing systems and contracts. There was concern<br />
	that the industry cannot convert to the new standards within 2 years.<br />
	    Several commenters recommended that all health plans have the same<br />
	time frame with which to comply with the standards of this rule. They<br />
	noted that a health care provider has no knowledge of whether a health<br />
	plan is a small or large health plan. It would be very inefficient for<br />
	a health care provider to maintain two systems for an additional year.<br />
	    The majority of those who commented on the publication of the final<br />
	rule recommended that the rules be published in a staggered fashion,<br />
	specifically the identifiers first, then the transactions. Some also<br />
	wanted the attachment and security regulations published at the same<br />
	time the transaction regulation is published. Some commenters also<br />
	wanted the effective dates for each standard transaction to be<br />
	staggered. Several commenters recommended publishing an interim final<br />
	rule allowing for additional comments.<br />
	    Several commenters generally supported the WEDI recommendation that<br />
	health care providers not be required by health plans to use any of the<br />
	standards during the first year after adoption of the standards, and<br />
	that willing trading partners could implement any or all of the<br />
	standards by mutual agreement at any time during the 2 year<br />
	implementation phase (3 years for small health plans). WEDI also<br />
	recommended that health care providers be given at least 6 months'<br />
	notice by a health plan before requiring health care providers to<br />
	implement the standards.<br />
	    Response: Section 1175 of the Act dictates that the standards are<br />
	to be implemented no later than 24 months after adoption (36 months for<br />
	small health plans).<br />
	    In the interest of a smooth transition, we encourage health plans<br />
	not to require health care providers to use the standards specified in<br />
	subparts K through R during the first year after the effective date of<br />
	the transactions final rule, although willing trading partners could do<br />
	so by mutual agreement during that time. We also encourage health plans<br />
	to give health care providers at least 6 months notice before requiring<br />
	health care providers to implement a standard transaction. For example,<br />
	if the effective date of the rule is 8/1/2000 and trading partners have<br />
	agreed not to implement during the first year, the first implementation<br />
	date could be 8/1/2001 and health care providers should be notified by<br />
	2/1/2001.<br />
	2. Effective Dates and Compliance Dates of Modifications<br />
	    Proposal Summary: In Sec. 142.106 (now Sec. 160.104), we proposed<br />
	that if the</p>
<p>[[Page 50322]]</p>
<p>Secretary adopts a modification to an implementation specification or a<br />
	standard, the implementation date of the modification (the date by<br />
	which covered entities must comply with the modification) would be no<br />
	earlier than the 180th day following the adoption of the modification<br />
	(the effective date of the final rule in the Federal Register which<br />
	adopts the modification). The Secretary would determine the actual<br />
	date, taking into account the time needed to comply due to the nature<br />
	and extent of the modification. The Secretary would be able to extend<br />
	the time for compliance for small health plans.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on Effective Dates and Compliance Dates of<br />
	Modifications</p>
<p>    Comment: Some commenters believed 180 days may not always be enough<br />
	time to implement a revised standard.<br />
	    Response: The statute states that the Secretary must permit no<br />
	``fewer'' than 180 days for implementation after adopting a revised<br />
	standard (i.e., a modification). Depending on the nature of the<br />
	revision, the minimum time frame of 180 days could be longer. This time<br />
	frame does not apply to the maintenance of medical code sets and<br />
	external code sets. The compliance date will be specified by the code<br />
	set maintaining organization responsible for maintenance changes to<br />
	that code set.<br />
	    We will clarify the terms modification and maintenance. In the<br />
	transactions context, when a change is substantial enough to justify<br />
	publication of a new version of an implementation specification, this<br />
	change will be considered to be a modification. Such a change must be<br />
	adopted by the Secretary through regulation. Maintenance is the<br />
	activities necessary to support the use of a standard, including<br />
	technical corrections to an implementation specification, and<br />
	enhancements, additions, or deletions to a data code set. These changes<br />
	could be non-substantive or error correction. Public comment and<br />
	notification is required as part of the normal, ANSI-accredited<br />
	standards development process, but regulatory action would not be<br />
	required for maintenance as we have defined it. For example, this final<br />
	rule adopts the ASC X12N 278--Health Care Services Review--Request for<br />
	Review and Response, Version 4010, May 2000 as the standard for the<br />
	referral certification and authorization transaction. Error corrections<br />
	or addendums to Version 4010, May 2000, would constitute maintenance to<br />
	this standard and there would be no regulatory action. Changes<br />
	requiring a new version, or an updated edition of Version 4010 (for<br />
	example, moving from Version 4010, May 2000 to Version 4010, October<br />
	2001) would constitute a modification to this standard and would be<br />
	adopted through regulatory action.</p>
<p>D. Data Content</p>
<p>    Proposal Summary: We proposed standard data content for each<br />
	adopted standard. Information that would facilitate data content<br />
	standardization, while also facilitating identical implementations,<br />
	would consist of implementation specifications, data conditions, data<br />
	dictionaries, and the standard code sets for medical data that are part<br />
	of this rule. Data conditions are rules that define the situations when<br />
	a particular data element or segment can or must be used.<br />
	    It is important to note that all data elements would be governed by<br />
	the principle of a maximum defined data set. No one would be able to<br />
	exceed the maximum defined data set in this rule. This principle<br />
	applies to the data elements of all transactions.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on Data Content</p>
<p>    Comment: The majority of commenters supported the concept of a<br />
	maximum defined data set; however, there was some confusion on what we<br />
	were proposing.<br />
	    Several commenters believed we were requiring health care providers<br />
	to always send the transaction with the maximum data possible. They<br />
	stated that health care providers and health plans will pay excessively<br />
	for unused data that is transmitted. Concern was also expressed that<br />
	health plans would have to store coordination of benefits (COB)<br />
	information if it is submitted, even though they do not perform COB.<br />
	Several commenters suggested that health plans be allowed to reject a<br />
	transaction because it contains information they do not want.<br />
	    One commenter recommended that the maximum defined data set be the<br />
	full set of data available in the implementation specifications, not<br />
	the addendum in the proposed rule.<br />
	    A few commenters wanted to expand the concept of a maximum defined<br />
	data set to include code sets, modifiers, narrative descriptions,<br />
	guidelines and instructions applicable to codes sets, as well as an<br />
	additional category for ``usage'' in the implementation specifications,<br />
	``not required unless specified by a contractual agreement.'' Several<br />
	commenters wanted trading partners to be able to agree on which non-<br />
	required data will be used between them.<br />
	    One commenter suggested a ``minimum'' data set principle be<br />
	applied. If a submitter sends a minimum data set, the receiver cannot<br />
	reject it as incomplete. Again, the commenter believed we were implying<br />
	that a submitter must send the maximum every time, in order to assure<br />
	acceptance of the transaction.<br />
	    Response: We wish to clarify the maximum defined data set concept.<br />
	A maximum defined data set contains all of the required and situational<br />
	data elements possible in a standard transaction. For each standard<br />
	transaction there are situational data elements that are both relevant<br />
	to the particular transaction and necessary to process it; there are<br />
	also situational data elements that an entity may include in a<br />
	transaction, but does not need to include, in order for the transaction<br />
	to be processed. A required data element is always required in a<br />
	transaction. A situational data element is dependent on the written<br />
	condition in the implementation specification that describes under<br />
	which circumstances it is to be provided. The maximum defined data set<br />
	is based on the implementation guides and not the addendum in the<br />
	proposed rule. The maximum defined data set also includes the<br />
	applicable medical and nonmedical code sets for that transaction. Some<br />
	code sets, e.g., HCPCS and CPT-4, include special codes referred to as<br />
	``modifiers.'' Modifiers are included in the concept of maximum defined<br />
	data set. The maximum defined data set does not include operational<br />
	guidelines or instructions for every code set.<br />
	    We note that if an entity follows the implementation specification<br />
	and the conditions in the implementation specification for each<br />
	transaction, the entity will only be supplying the minimum amount of<br />
	data elements necessary to process a transaction (required data<br />
	elements and relevant situational data elements); the entity will not<br />
	be supplying possible but unnecessary situational data elements.<br />
	    In addition, we note that the intent behind the maximum defined<br />
	data set was to set a ceiling on the nature and number of data elements<br />
	inherent to each standard transaction and to ensure that health plans<br />
	did not reject a transaction because it contained information they did<br />
	not want. For example, if an implementation specification defines a<br />
	health care claim or equivalent encounter information transaction as<br />
	having at most 50 specific data elements, a health plan could not<br />
	require a health care provider to submit a health care claim or<br />
	encounter transaction containing more than the 50</p>
<p>[[Page 50323]]</p>
<p>specific data elements as stipulated in the implementation guide. (A<br />
	health plan may, however, request additional information through<br />
	attachments.)<br />
	    While operational guidelines or instructions are not included in<br />
	the concept of a maximum defined data set, we agree that<br />
	standardization of these code set guidelines is highly desirable and<br />
	beneficial. We reviewed the available guidelines to determine which<br />
	should be adopted as implementation specifications and have found that<br />
	there are also many current practical barriers to achieving such<br />
	standardization. For example, we recognize that the operational<br />
	guidelines for some code sets required for use in the designated<br />
	transactions are more complete than others. Also, objective,<br />
	operational definitions for most codes are not available and the level<br />
	of detail varies widely from code to code. In addition, the processes<br />
	for developing guidelines and instructions are typically not open and<br />
	include limited participation compared to the code development<br />
	processes. However, where such guidelines exist and are universally<br />
	accepted, we name them as part of the standard. Therefore, we adopt the<br />
	Official ICD-9-CM Guidelines for Coding and Reporting as maintained and<br />
	distributed by the Department of Health and Human Services<br />
	(Sec. 162.1002). Additionally, we received many public comments in<br />
	support of this action. We do not name guidelines for other code sets.<br />
	    With respect to COB, if a health plan electronically performs COB<br />
	exchange with another health plan or other payer, then it must store<br />
	the COB data necessary to forward the transaction to that health plan<br />
	or other payer.<br />
	    In addition, we disagree with commenters that we should add a new<br />
	``usage'' statement, ``not required unless specified by a contractual<br />
	agreement,'' in the implementation guide. We believe that the usage<br />
	statement would have the same effect as allowing trading partners to<br />
	negotiate which conditional data elements will be used in a standard<br />
	transaction. Each health plan could then include different data<br />
	requirements in their contracts with their health care providers.<br />
	Health care providers would then be required to use a variety of<br />
	guidelines to submit transactions to different health plans. This would<br />
	defeat the purpose of standardization.</p>
<p>E. Availability of Implementation Specifications</p>
<p>    Proposal Summary: We provided the addresses and telephone numbers<br />
	for a person to obtain the implementation specifications for the<br />
	proposed standards.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on Implementation Specifications and Their<br />
	Availability</p>
<p>    1. Comment: One commenter suggested that the X12N (the ASC X12<br />
	subcommittee chartered to develop electronic standards specific to the<br />
	insurance industry) implementation specifications under HIPAA must be<br />
	flexible to permit businesses to customize their EDI process. It was<br />
	stated the implementation specifications do not allow flexibility<br />
	between trading partners.<br />
	    Response: We disagree. Allowing flexibility would result in non-<br />
	standard implementation of the transactions. The X12N implementation<br />
	specifications under HIPAA, adopted in this final rule, are all version<br />
	4010. If businesses customize implementations of 4010, the health care<br />
	industry would have hundreds of different implementations of the same<br />
	transaction.<br />
	    2. Comment: One commenter recommended we include the following<br />
	language: ``In addition, a set of NCPDP standards contains all of the<br />
	approved standards and implementation specifications. For an additional<br />
	fee, the data dictionaries are available.''<br />
	    Response: We are aware that data dictionaries are available and<br />
	that there is a charge separate from the membership fee for them. We do<br />
	not believe this needs to be included in the final rule, since this<br />
	information is available through the NCPDP web site.</p>
<p>F. Proposed Requirements Stated in Each Subpart</p>
<p>    In each subpart setting forth a standard or standards, we stated<br />
	which entities had to use the standard(s), the effective dates for<br />
	implementation, and that we are incorporating implementation<br />
	specifications (where applicable) by reference.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on Provisions Appearing in Each Subpart</p>
<p>1. Code Set Standards<br />
	    Proposal Summary: We proposed in subpart J the following: In<br />
	Sec. 142.1002 (now Sec. 162.1000), we stated that health plans, health<br />
	care clearinghouses, and certain health care providers would have to<br />
	use the diagnosis and procedure code sets as prescribed by the<br />
	Secretary for electronic transactions. The proposed standard medical<br />
	code sets of these diagnosis and procedure code sets were identified in<br />
	the preamble, and the implementation specifications for the transaction<br />
	standards in part 142 (now part 162), Subparts K through R, specified<br />
	which of the standard medical data code sets should be used in<br />
	individual data elements within those transaction standards.<br />
	    In Sec. 142.1004, we specified that the code sets in the<br />
	implementation specification for each transaction standard in part 142,<br />
	subparts K through R, would be the standard for the coded nonmedical<br />
	data elements present in that transaction standard.<br />
	    In Sec. 142.1010, the requirements sections of part 142, subparts K<br />
	through R, specified that those who transmit electronic transactions<br />
	covered by the transaction standards must use the appropriate<br />
	transaction standard, including the code sets that are required by that<br />
	standard. These sections would further specify that those who receive<br />
	electronic transactions covered by the transaction standards must be<br />
	able to receive and process all standard codes.<br />
	    We proposed code sets for various types of services and diagnoses.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on Proposed Standards for Code Sets and<br />
	Requirements for Their Use</p>
<p>Proposed Code Sets<br />
	    a. Version Control. Comment: The majority of commenters stated that<br />
	we should have a clearer requirement for version control, that is, we<br />
	should require an electronic transaction to use the version of each<br />
	applicable code set that is valid at the time the transaction is<br />
	initiated. A common schedule should be established (for example,<br />
	calendar year) for conversion to new versions of all standard code<br />
	sets. A few commenters indicated that there should be an overlap period<br />
	in which both last year's and this year's codes are accepted to<br />
	accommodate resubmission or subsequent transfer of claims initiated in<br />
	the prior year.<br />
	    Many commenters said that HHS should maintain a consolidated list<br />
	of the current accepted versions of standard code sets and make this<br />
	list available to the public, e.g., on the Web. Several commenters<br />
	indicated that all of the code sets themselves should be available from<br />
	a single HHS website.<br />
	    Response: We have included in Sec. 162.1000 a clearer statement<br />
	that the version of the medical data code sets specified in the<br />
	implementation specifications must be the version that is valid at the<br />
	time the health care is furnished. Since transactions may have to be<br />
	resubmitted long after the time health care was provided, health plans<br />
	must be able to process earlier versions of code sets. The version of<br />
	the nonmedical data code sets specified in</p>
<p>[[Page 50324]]</p>
<p>the implementation specifications must be the version that is valid at<br />
	the time the transaction is initiated.<br />
	    At this time we are not establishing a common schedule for<br />
	implementing new versions of all HIPAA medical data code sets, since<br />
	some of the code sets are updated annually (for example, ICD-9-CM, CPT)<br />
	and some are updated more frequently. The organizations that maintain<br />
	medical data code sets will continue to specify their update schedule.<br />
	Different Federal laws mandate the implementation of annual updates to<br />
	ICD-9-CM on October 1 and annual updates to the CPT on January 1 of the<br />
	following year for their use in the Medicare program. Changing either<br />
	of these dates would require legislative action and would also<br />
	represent a major change in current practice for many elements of the<br />
	health care industry.<br />
	    We agree that a common web site is a viable solution, but it is<br />
	unclear what the Federal role would be in the development of one. We<br />
	expect to work with the medical data code set maintainers to explore<br />
	this option.<br />
	    6. Proprietary coding systems. Two of the code sets proposed as<br />
	HIPAA standards, CPT and The Code on Dental Procedures and Nomenclature<br />
	(referred to as ``The Code'' and published as CDT), are proprietary<br />
	products.<br />
	    Comment: Many commenters stated that the Secretary should not<br />
	recommend proprietary systems as national standards. They believed that<br />
	the proposed rule lacked a definitive method to guarantee public access<br />
	to the proposed standards at low cost, and recommended that the<br />
	government should develop or maintain the national standards or acquire<br />
	the rights to the standards of choice. Without ownership and control,<br />
	the government places itself and the remainder of the health industry<br />
	at noteworthy risk. One commenter indicated that implementation of the<br />
	standards should be delayed until proprietary code sets have been moved<br />
	into the public domain. One commenter said it was illegal for the<br />
	Secretary to establish the CPT as a national standard. Another argued<br />
	that the ``The Code'' should not be named a national standard.<br />
	    Response: Under HIPAA, the Secretary has the authority to select<br />
	existing code sets developed by either private or public entities and<br />
	is not precluded from selecting proprietary code sets. The Secretary is<br />
	required to ensure that all standard code sets are updated as needed<br />
	and that there are efficient, low cost mechanisms for distribution<br />
	(including electronic distribution) of the code sets and their updates.<br />
	Free distribution of standard code sets is not required by the statute.<br />
	    The comments we received regarding code sets were overwhelmingly in<br />
	favor of the selection of currently used code sets as the initial<br />
	standards. Some of the code sets that are currently used in<br />
	administrative transactions are proprietary code sets. We have obtained<br />
	some clarification from the developers of these code sets about the<br />
	pricing structure and mechanisms for publishing the pricing structure<br />
	that will be in place when the initial standards are implemented. The<br />
	existence of efficient, low-cost distribution mechanisms will affect<br />
	future decisions regarding changes or additions to the code sets<br />
	designated as standards.<br />
	    A health care provider who submits X12N transactions can download<br />
	the implementation specifications free of charge from the Washington<br />
	Publishing Company website. However, two of the medical codes sets, CPT<br />
	and the Dental Code require a fee. Royalties for electronic use of the<br />
	CPT are based on a $10.00 per user standard. Royalties for electronic<br />
	use of the Dental Code in practice management systems are based on<br />
	$10.00 per user site. These royalty fees are normally included in the<br />
	purchase and maintenance costs of the electronic systems that such<br />
	providers use. The other medical codes sets, HCPCS and ICD-9 CM, may be<br />
	downloaded free of charge.<br />
	    For paper manuals, to which most providers that use these code sets<br />
	already subscribe, the CPT manual is $49.95 and the Dental Code manual<br />
	is $39.95. In fact, the need for such paper manuals may decrease as<br />
	more electronic systems are implemented.<br />
	    A health care provider who submits retail pharmacy transactions who<br />
	wants a copy of the NCPDP standards can pay an annual fee of $550 for<br />
	membership in the NCPDP organization, which includes copies of the<br />
	implementation specifications for the retail pharmacy standard and the<br />
	data dictionary as well as technical assistance in implementation. As a<br />
	non-member, the implementations specifications and data dictionary may<br />
	be purchased separately for $250 each.<br />
	    Although nothing in this final rule, including the Secretary's<br />
	designation of standards, implementation specifications, or code sets<br />
	is intended to divest any copyright holders of their copyrights in any<br />
	work referenced in this final rule, future decisions regarding changes<br />
	or additions to the code sets designated as standards may be affected<br />
	by the existence of efficient, low-cost distribution mechanisms.<br />
	    c. Code Sets Proposed. The following code sets were proposed as<br />
	initial standards:<br />
	    (a) Diseases, injuries, impairments, other health related problems,<br />
	their manifestations, and causes of injury, disease, impairment, or<br />
	other health-related problems.<br />
	    The standard code set for these conditions is the International<br />
	Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, Clinical Modification, (ICD-9-<br />
	CM), Volumes 1 and 2, as maintained and distributed by the U.S.<br />
	Department of Health and Human Services. The specific data elements for<br />
	which the ICD-9-CM is the required code set are enumerated in the<br />
	implementation specifications for the transaction standards that<br />
	require its use.<br />
	    (b) Procedures or other actions taken to prevent, diagnose, treat,<br />
	or manage diseases, injuries and impairments.<br />
	    (1) Physician Services. The standard code set for these services is<br />
	the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT-4) maintained and distributed<br />
	by the AMA. The specific data elements for which the CPT-4 (including<br />
	codes and modifiers) is a required code set are enumerated in the<br />
	implementation specifications for the transaction standards that<br />
	require its use.<br />
	    (2) Dental Services. The standard code set for these services is<br />
	The Code on Dental Procedures and Nomenclature, printed as ``The Code''<br />
	and published as CDT, maintained and distributed by the ADA for a<br />
	charge. The specific data elements for which the Dental Code is a<br />
	required code set are enumerated in the implementation specifications<br />
	for the transaction standards that require its use.<br />
	    (3) Inpatient Hospital Services. The standard code set for these<br />
	services is the International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition,<br />
	Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), Volume 3 procedures, maintained and<br />
	distributed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The<br />
	specific data elements for which ICD-9-CM, Volume 3 procedures, is a<br />
	required code set are enumerated in the implementation specifications<br />
	for the transaction standards that require its use.<br />
	    (c) Other Health-Related Services. The standard code set for other<br />
	health-related services is the Health Care Financing Administration<br />
	Common Procedure Coding System (Level II of HCPCS) maintained and<br />
	distributed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.<br />
	    (d) Drugs. The proposed standard code set for these entities is the<br />
	National Drug Codes maintained and distributed by the U.S. Department<br />
	of Health and</p>
<p>[[Page 50325]]</p>
<p>Human Services, in collaboration with drug manufacturers. The specific<br />
	data elements for which the NDC is a required code set are enumerated<br />
	in the implementation specifications for the transaction standards that<br />
	require its use.<br />
	    (e) Other Substances, Equipment, Supplies, or Other Items Used in<br />
	Health Care Services. The proposed standard code set for these entities<br />
	is the Health Care Financing Administration Common Procedure Coding<br />
	System (Level II of HCPCS) as maintained and distributed by the U.S.<br />
	Department of Health and Human Services.<br />
	    a. Comment: The great majority of commenters supported the<br />
	selection of the code sets proposed on the basis that these code sets<br />
	were already in wide use among hospitals, physician offices, other<br />
	ambulatory facilities, pharmacies, and similar health care locations.<br />
	Commenters mentioned that replacement systems could have different<br />
	formats and number of digits. This could complicate the initial<br />
	conversion. They also pointed out that replacement systems for the ICD-<br />
	9-CM are still under development and testing. Many commenters stated<br />
	that it would be premature to make a decision on replacements for the<br />
	ICD-9-CM prior to their completion and testing.<br />
	    Response: We agree that the continued use of the proposed coding<br />
	systems will be the least disruptive for many entities required to<br />
	implement HIPAA standards. The fact that replacement systems are still<br />
	under development and testing further supports this decision.<br />
	    b. Comment: Two commenters stated that the proposal did not reflect<br />
	current uses of some code sets. One commenter stated that in addition<br />
	to being used for inpatient procedural coding, the ICD-9-CM procedure<br />
	codes are also required by many health plans for the reporting of<br />
	facility-based outpatient procedures. The second commenter pointed out<br />
	that in addition to being used by physicians and other health care<br />
	professionals, the combination of HCPCS level I and CPT-4 is required<br />
	for reporting ancillary services such as radiology and laboratory<br />
	services and by some health plans for reporting facility-based<br />
	procedures. Further, Medicare currently requires HCPCS level II codes<br />
	for reporting services in skilled nursing facilities.<br />
	    Response: Health plans must conform to the requirements for code<br />
	set use set out in this final rule. Therefore, if a health plan<br />
	currently requires health care providers to use CPT-4 to report<br />
	inpatient facility-based procedures, they both would be required to<br />
	convert to ICD-9.<br />
	    We agree that the proposal did not reflect all current uses of some<br />
	code sets. For example, we agree that CPT-4 is commonly used to code<br />
	laboratory tests, yet laboratory tests are not necessarily considered<br />
	to be physician services. Moreover, the proposed rule implied that<br />
	laboratory tests are a type of other health care service which are<br />
	encoded using HCPCS. We believe that the architecture of both coding<br />
	sets, HCPCS and CPT-4, is such that they are both frequently used for<br />
	coding physician and other health care services. Both of these medical<br />
	data code sets are standard medical data code sets and may be used in<br />
	standard transactions (see Sec. 162.1002(e)). Therefore, a health plan<br />
	using CPT-4 to report outpatient facility-based procedures would not be<br />
	required to change that practice.<br />
	    In addition, the proposed rule did not itemize the types of<br />
	services included in other health care services. These other health<br />
	care services include the ancillary services, radiology and laboratory<br />
	which are mentioned in the comment, as well as other medical diagnostic<br />
	procedures, physical and occupational therapy, hearing and vision<br />
	services, and transportation services including ambulance. Similarly,<br />
	other substances, equipment, supplies, or other items used in health<br />
	care services includes medical supplies, orthotic and prosthetic<br />
	devices, and durable medical equipment.<br />
	    In the final rule, we clarify the description of physician and<br />
	other health care services and we recognize that two code sets (CPT-4<br />
	and HCPCS) are used to specify these services. In the proposed rule, we<br />
	used the term ``health-related services'' to help describe these<br />
	services. We believe that use of the term ``health-related services''<br />
	might suggest that these services are not health care. In an effort to<br />
	prevent this confusion, and because the codes in this category are used<br />
	to enumerate services meeting the definition of health care, we are<br />
	using what we believe is the more appropriate term (``health care<br />
	services'') to describe these services. We note that the substance of<br />
	the category remains the same. The final rule has been revised to<br />
	indicate that the combination of HCPCS and CPT-4 will be used for<br />
	physician services and other health care services. The use of ICD-9-CM<br />
	procedure codes is restricted to the reporting of inpatient procedures<br />
	by hospitals.<br />
	    In Sec. 162.1002 we clarify the use of medical code sets. The<br />
	standard code sets are the following:<br />
	    (a) ICD-9-CM, Volumes 1 and 2 (including The Official ICD-9-CM<br />
	Guidelines for Coding and Reporting), is the required code set for<br />
	diseases, injuries, impairments, other health problems and their<br />
	manifestations, and causes of injury, disease, impairment, or other<br />
	health problems.<br />
	    (b) ICD-9-CM Volume 3 Procedures (including The Official ICD-9-CM<br />
	Guidelines for Coding and Reporting) is the required code set for the<br />
	following procedures or other actions taken for diseases, injuries, and<br />
	impairments on hospital inpatients reported by hospitals: prevention,<br />
	diagnosis, treatment, and management.<br />
	    (c) NDC is the required code set for drugs and biologics.<br />
	    (d) Code on Dental Procedures and Nomenclature is the code set for<br />
	dental services.<br />
	    (e) The combination of HCPCS and CPT-4 is the required code set for<br />
	physician services and other health care services.<br />
	    (f) HCPCS is the required code set for other substances, equipment,<br />
	supplies, and other items used in health care services.<br />
	    c. Comment: Although there was wide support for the code sets that<br />
	were proposed, a number of commenters pointed out that additional code<br />
	sets were needed to cover some health services recorded in<br />
	administrative health transactions. One commenter mentioned that the<br />
	code sets proposed as standards lacked coverage of alternative health<br />
	care procedures and recommended that the Alternative Link coding system<br />
	also be designated as a standard code set. Commenters also indicated<br />
	that none of the proposed standard code sets covered home infusion<br />
	procedures; they recommended that the Home Infusion EDI Coalition<br />
	Coding System (HIEC) be selected as a HIPAA standard. HIEC is currently<br />
	used by some non-governmental health plans. One commenter recommended<br />
	that dental diagnostic codes (SNODENT) developed by the ADA be used as<br />
	a national standard. This commenter stated that the ICD-9-CM codes were<br />
	inadequate for dentistry.<br />
	    Response: No single code set in use today meets all of the business<br />
	requirements related to the full range of health care services and<br />
	conditions. Adopting multiple standards is a way to address code set<br />
	inadequacies, but can also introduce complexities due to code set<br />
	overlaps. We acknowledge that the coding systems proposed as initial<br />
	standards may not address all business needs, especially in the areas<br />
	of alternative health care procedures, home infusion procedures, and<br />
	dental</p>
<p>[[Page 50326]]</p>
<p>diagnoses. Specific shortcomings should be brought to the attention of<br />
	the code set maintainers. The adoption of additional standards may be<br />
	an appropriate way to fill gaps in coding coverage in these areas.<br />
	Additional code sets must be analyzed by the DSMOs that will make<br />
	recommendations to the National Committee on Vital and Health<br />
	Statistics. In order to request changes, we recommend working through<br />
	the processes described in Secs. 162.910 and 162.940. In the interim,<br />
	segments exist in the standard transactions which allow for manual<br />
	processing of services for which codes have not been adopted.<br />
	    d. Comment: While agreeing in general with the code sets proposed<br />
	as standards, some commenters indicated that they lacked sufficient<br />
	specificity to code data elements in several areas: functional status<br />
	and other data elements necessary for studying persons with mental<br />
	illness; behavioral health; chronic conditions and functional<br />
	assessments covered by long term care insurance; and mental health<br />
	services.<br />
	    Response: We agree the code sets proposed as HIPAA standards may<br />
	not cover functional status, mental and behavioral health, chronic<br />
	conditions, and mental health services to the extent required by the<br />
	legitimate business needs of some health care providers and health<br />
	plans. We are unaware of any viable alternative code sets which cover<br />
	these areas more completely. Maintainers of code sets seeking to be<br />
	named as standards must pursue recognition through the processes set<br />
	out at Secs. 162.910 and 162.940.<br />
	    e. Comment: One commenter, who supported the proposed code sets for<br />
	their intended purposes, felt that they lacked the detail necessary to<br />
	document a complete clinical encounter. The commenter stated that a<br />
	comprehensive health information system requires the use of a<br />
	controlled reference terminology to document care, retrieve data to<br />
	perform studies, and assess patient outcomes. The commenter stated that<br />
	as the implementation of HIPAA progresses towards the adoption of<br />
	standards for a complete computer based patient record, the current<br />
	coding systems will be inadequate. The commenter stated that the system<br />
	developed by Systematized Nomenclature of Human and Veterinary Medicine<br />
	International (SNOMED) could be used as a future standard.<br />
	    Response: We agree that more detailed clinical terminologies are<br />
	likely to be needed in complete computer-based patient records. SNOMED<br />
	is one of the clinical terminologies being examined by the Work Group<br />
	on Computer-Based Patient Records of the National Committee on Vital<br />
	and Health Statistics' Subcommittee on Standards and Security. The Work<br />
	Group is responsible for studying the issues related to the adoption of<br />
	uniform data standards for patient medical record information and the<br />
	electronic exchange of such information.<br />
	    f. Comment: One commenter expressed problems with the use of the<br />
	ICD-9-CM and the ICD-10-CM for the collection of both reimbursement and<br />
	research related data. It was stated that the data collected in claims'<br />
	transactions clog up the reimbursement data system with a large amount<br />
	of extraneous material. The commenter also felt that the data were of<br />
	dubious quality. The commenter estimated that as much as 50% of the<br />
	information gathered within the transactions' systems was for research<br />
	purposes only. The commenter felt it was unfair to force the private<br />
	sector to subsidize research costs through subterfuge. The commenter<br />
	suggested that the issue be resolved by limiting the initial scope of<br />
	the ICD-10-CM to collecting only information used or needed for<br />
	reimbursement.<br />
	    Response: The adopted coding systems support the collection of a<br />
	wide variety of data that can be used for many purposes. However, we<br />
	disagree with the commenter that standard health care claims or<br />
	equivalent encounter information transactions collect data primarily<br />
	for research purposes. The content of the health care claims or<br />
	equivalent encounter information transaction was developed on a<br />
	consensus basis by health care providers, health plans, and other<br />
	industry representatives as necessary for the conduct of administrative<br />
	transactions.<br />
	    d. Coordination among Code Sets. Comment: Several commenters<br />
	recommend that a very tight process be put in place to control overlap<br />
	of HCPCS Level II ``D'' codes (The Code on Dental Procedures and<br />
	Nomenclature, printed as ``The Code'' and published as CDT) and the<br />
	CPT-4 codes. It was questioned whether there will be a review process<br />
	in place for dental codes. Since there is some duplication of dental<br />
	codes and the CPT-4 codes presently, a review process is needed to<br />
	avoid duplication. One commenter stated that to attain and maintain<br />
	coding consistency and avoid duplicate codes, the American Dental<br />
	Association should be a member of a federal HCPCS committee.<br />
	    Response: We agree that a mutual exchange of information is<br />
	necessary to attain and maintain coding consistency. Panel member(s)<br />
	from HCPCS Level II ``D'' Codes (The Code on Dental Procedures and<br />
	Nomenclature), CPT-4, and Alpha-Numeric HCPCS will participate or act<br />
	as consultants on the other coding panels in order to attain and<br />
	maintain coding consistency and avoid duplicate codes.<br />
	    e. Proposed changes to Dental Codes. Proposal: In HCPCS, the first<br />
	digit ``0'' in the American Dental Association's The Code on Dental<br />
	Procedures and Nomenclature is replaced by a ``D'' to eliminate<br />
	confusion and overlap with certain CPT-4 codes. The ADA has agreed to<br />
	make this change an official part of the dental codes they distribute<br />
	and to replace their first digit ``0'' with a ``D.'' Consequently,<br />
	dental codes will no longer be issued within HCPCS as of the year 2000.<br />
	The ADA will be the sole source of the authoritative version of ``The<br />
	Code.''<br />
	    Comment: There were several specific comments about the proposal to<br />
	change the initial digit in the ADA's version of The Code on Dental<br />
	Procedures and Nomenclature from ``0'' to ``D.'' Comments in favor of<br />
	the change agreed that it would avoid potential overlap and confusion.<br />
	One commenter indicated that this was particularly true for those<br />
	claims that would continue to be submitted manually since the ASC X12N<br />
	837 and 835 transactions contain a code qualifier that clearly<br />
	indicates which procedure code is being used. One commenter stated that<br />
	as the ADA replaces the leading ``0'' with the letter ``D,'' some of<br />
	the resulting codes will coincide with existing HCPCS Level II ``D''<br />
	codes, but will have totally different meanings. This could create<br />
	great confusion at adjudication time. Dealing with a coding system that<br />
	contains an alphabetic character would also cause problems for many<br />
	systems. One commenter believed that it is the responsibility of both<br />
	the ADA and the Department to specify clear and unambiguous rules that<br />
	will affect this transition between coding systems, so the resulting<br />
	confusion is minimized. The commenter suggested the following options:<br />
	(1) Replace the codes nationwide on a certain date; (2) choose a letter<br />
	other than ``D'' for ``The Code,'' so there is no overlap; or (3)<br />
	retain the leading zero in ``The Code'' and assure that there continues<br />
	to be no conflict or overlap with the CPT-4 anesthesia codes, as<br />
	currently they do not overlap.<br />
	    There were no comments about the proposal that ``The Code'' be<br />
	removed from HCPCS and that the ADA become the sole source of the<br />
	definitive version of these codes.<br />
	    Response: The ADA will change the leading ``0'' to a ``D'' as<br />
	proposed. Many organizations are already using the ``D''</p>
<p>[[Page 50327]]</p>
<p>Codes, which contains the leading ``D,'' without difficulty, and we<br />
	expect others to make this transition without difficulty. Although we<br />
	did not receive comments that specifically addressed the removal of the<br />
	dental codes from the HCPCS, general comments about the desirability of<br />
	more consolidated access to all HIPAA code sets have led us to revise<br />
	our position on the inclusion of ``The Code'' in the HCPCS. Thus, the<br />
	dental codes will be available from two sources: the ADA, and through a<br />
	licensing agreement between HCFA and the ADA.<br />
	    f. Other Dental Code Issues. a. Comment: One commenter (a major<br />
	health plan) emphasized the critical importance of federal oversight<br />
	and monitoring of dental coding maintenance and revision to ensure that<br />
	dental data sets do not incorporate fragmented or unbundled procedures<br />
	that are integral parts of a single dental service. For example, in<br />
	``The Code-1,'' the procedure code 04910, periodontal prophylaxis/<br />
	periodontal recall, included the examination as part of this single<br />
	dental service; in ``The Code-2,'' the examination is unbundled and is<br />
	listed as a separate procedure. The import of this unbundling is the<br />
	potential for increasing cost of care, without otherwise increasing the<br />
	services provided. At the very least, to control the impact that<br />
	unbundling might potentially have on the cost of care, it was<br />
	recommended that once a particular standard code is established, it may<br />
	not be deleted and any changes or modifications to the code or<br />
	descriptor be included as a new code.<br />
	    Response: The American Dental Association (ADA) will be responsible<br />
	for maintaining an appropriate open process for updating ``The Code.''<br />
	Interested public and private sector organizations and groups will have<br />
	the opportunity for substantive input, as they will for all HIPAA<br />
	standards. The Department will continue to review the process of code<br />
	modification to ensure that the code sets continue to meet the business<br />
	needs of the industry.<br />
	    b. Comment: One commenter questioned whether the addition of a<br />
	specific procedure to the dental codes adopted as a HIPAA standard<br />
	meant that a health plan had to cover the procedure or whether it meant<br />
	the health plan only had to be able to receive and process the standard<br />
	code for the procedure.<br />
	    Response: The establishment of a code in any of the code sets<br />
	adopted as HIPAA standards does not require that a health plan cover<br />
	the coded procedure. However, health plans must be able to receive and<br />
	process all codes in HIPAA standard code sets. In other words,<br />
	transactions containing standard codes may be returned with a message<br />
	that the procedure is not covered by the health plan to whom they have<br />
	been submitted. Transactions may not be rejected because the health<br />
	plan's system does not recognize valid standard codes.<br />
	    g. Future Consideration of ICD-10 Code Sets. Proposal Summary:<br />
	Although the exact timing and precise nature of changes in the code<br />
	sets designated as standards for medical data are not yet known, it is<br />
	inevitable that there will be changes to coding and classification<br />
	standards after the year 2000. For example, the ICD-10-CM for diagnosis<br />
	may replace the ICD-9-CM as the standard for diagnosis data. When any<br />
	of the standard code sets proposed in this rule are replaced by wholly<br />
	new or substantially revised systems, the new standards may have<br />
	different code lengths and formats.<br />
	    a. Comment: Several commenters felt that the ICD-10-CM should be<br />
	considered as a future national standard after the year 2000. The<br />
	commenters stated that the proposed initial standard, ICD-9-CM, should<br />
	be selected since it was currently in use. They pointed out that the<br />
	ICD-10-CM was still under development. Several commenters suggested<br />
	that the system be tested and evaluated as a future national standard<br />
	when the final draft is completed. One commenter was supportive of the<br />
	system and suggested that factors such as code length be considered as<br />
	part of the testing and evaluation of the ICD-10-CM system. Several<br />
	commenters felt that the current draft of the ICD-10-CM showed<br />
	significant improvements over the ICD-9-CM. Another commenter stated<br />
	that the system would allow for more accurate reporting by health care<br />
	providers. One commenter stated that the use of the ICD-10-CM will<br />
	require considerable training.<br />
	    Response: We agree with the commenters that the ICD-10-CM has great<br />
	potential as a replacement for the ICD-9-CM. We also agree that a final<br />
	evaluation of the system should await the completion of the final draft<br />
	and testing.<br />
	    b. Comment: Several commenters stated the ICD-10-PCS (which is<br />
	under development for use in the United States as a replacement for the<br />
	procedure coding section of ICD-9-CM) should be considered as a future<br />
	national standard. Most commenters recommended that the decision to use<br />
	or not use the ICD-10-PCS should await final development and testing.<br />
	The majority of commenters stated that future systems, such as the ICD-<br />
	10-PCS, should not be implemented until after the year 2000. However,<br />
	several commenters supported the future migration to the ICD-10-PCS<br />
	because it was felt to offer significant improvements over the ICD-9-<br />
	CM. One commenter stated that the ICD-10-PCS development project has<br />
	made valuable contributions to many issues relating to coding and<br />
	terminology. Another commenter expressed concern about the level of<br />
	detail in the ICD-10-PCS and recommended that further studies and<br />
	trials should be performed in order to establish the relative costs and<br />
	benefits of the system. This commenter was particularly concerned about<br />
	the pathology section and felt it needed more work. Others praised the<br />
	increased level of detail in the system and felt the added clinical<br />
	information would be useful.<br />
	    Response: We believe the ICD-10-PCS has great promise as a future<br />
	replacement of the ICD-9-CM, volume 3. However, we also believe the<br />
	system needs additional testing and revision prior to making a decision<br />
	about its use as a national standard. The system is dramatically<br />
	different from the ICD-9-CM containing more digits, greater detail, and<br />
	a more organized approach. With any new system, many factors must be<br />
	weighed prior to making a recommendation about national use. Changing a<br />
	coding system will have a great impact on national data and would be<br />
	evaluated carefully by the Designated Standard Maintenance<br />
	Organizations and the NCVHS, with opportunity for public input.<br />
	    h. Universal Product Number (UPN). Proposal: The Universal Product<br />
	Number (UPN) identifies medical equipment and supplies. It was not<br />
	recommended as an initial standard for the following reasons: the<br />
	existence of two different sets of UPN codes; incomplete coverage--<br />
	approximately 30 percent of the health care products do not have a UPN<br />
	assigned to them; and lack of experience with UPNs for reimbursement.<br />
	However, the proposal asked for comments regarding UPNs and when it<br />
	might be appropriate to designate one or more UPN systems as HIPAA<br />
	standards.<br />
	    a. Comment: Several commenters stated that the HCPCS level II codes<br />
	that we recommended to identify medical equipment and supplies are<br />
	currently not specific enough for accurate claims processing, proper<br />
	financial controls, or proper tracking of utilization. Health care<br />
	providers use many different kinds of supplies and equipment not found<br />
	in the HCPCS level II codes. It was argued that establishing UPNs as a<br />
	national coding system for identifying health</p>
<p>[[Page 50328]]</p>
<p>care supplies and equipment will provide the following advantages over<br />
	the HCPCS level II codes:<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; The UPN system would allow for more accurate billing and<br />
	better fraud and abuse detection than the use of a non-specific coding<br />
	system such as the HCPCS level II.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; UPNs would improve administrative efficiency and<br />
	effectiveness.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; The product specificity that UPNs provide in identifying<br />
	the actual specifications of manufacturer's products and packaging<br />
	sizes is essential to managing health industry transactions and<br />
	determining accurate payment amounts.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; The UPN mechanism is already in place and has been proven<br />
	in use.<br />
	    Several commenters agreed that we should not include the UPNs in<br />
	the initial list of standards. A cautious approach and considerable<br />
	further study is necessary to determine if the objectives of<br />
	administrative simplification and reduced costs within the health care<br />
	system will be achieved by using the UPNs as a national coding system<br />
	for health care products.<br />
	    Response: We agree that additional information regarding the<br />
	utility of the UPNs for claims processing needs to be obtained before a<br />
	decision is made to require their use. Specifically, more information<br />
	is needed concerning the costs and benefits that can be expected from<br />
	using the UPNs and the extent to which their use would promote<br />
	administrative simplification. Also, information is needed regarding<br />
	the standards that would have to be established to ensure that the UPNs<br />
	could be used effectively by third party payers. Another issue that<br />
	needs to be studied is the amount and type of information that an<br />
	insurer would have to obtain from manufacturers in order to adequately<br />
	identify the products represented by approximately three to five<br />
	million UPNs. Only detailed information concerning the products that<br />
	are represented by the UPNs, provided in a consistent manner, will<br />
	allow comparisons to determine if products from different manufacturers<br />
	are functionally equivalent.<br />
	    b. Comment: Several commenters expressed concern that the health<br />
	care industry may continue to use two different types of UPN systems<br />
	rather than a single system. They asserted that this is the best time<br />
	to choose between the two coding councils, the Health Care Uniform Code<br />
	Council (UCC) and the Health Industry Business Communications Council<br />
	(HIBCC), because there has not been a substantial investment in either<br />
	system.<br />
	    Response: We believe that neither UPN system should be selected at<br />
	this time, based on the reasons outlined above. We look to the industry<br />
	to resolve the issue of whether the two systems should continue.<br />
	    Before requiring the use of UPNs, we need to obtain more<br />
	information regarding the costs and benefits of implementing the UPN,<br />
	the adaptability of the UPN system for making coverage and payment<br />
	determinations, and for combating fraud and abuse. We will be<br />
	monitoring demonstrations being conducted by California Medicaid to<br />
	determine the cost and feasibility of using UPNs in the health care<br />
	industry. The entity proposing such a demonstration must request an<br />
	exception from the standards following the procedures in Sec. 162.940.<br />
	    i. NDC. a. Comment: Commenters generally agreed with our<br />
	recommendation to eliminate Level II HCPCS codes for drugs by the year<br />
	2000 and to use NDC for all drugs. However, some commenters disagreed<br />
	with applying this requirement to non-pharmacy claims and recommended<br />
	that the NDC be used only for retail pharmacy claims until sufficient<br />
	benefits and overhead costs of exclusively implementing the NDC codes<br />
	can be further researched. It was mentioned that the NDC numbers notate<br />
	a vial size and physician injections often results in a single vial<br />
	being used for multiple patients. They alleged that current Level II<br />
	HCPCS codes allow for this identification. Several commenters also<br />
	recommended that those durable medical equipment (DME) that do not have<br />
	Level II HCPCS codes should use NDC codes.<br />
	    It was noted that Medicaid agencies must reimburse health care<br />
	providers for supplying the drug products of any company in the Federal<br />
	Rebate Program as long as the drug reimbursement rates are within the<br />
	Federal Upper Payment Limit. Because many companies produce the same<br />
	drug, there are often many NDCs that correspond to the same drug with<br />
	the same Level II HCPCS code. It was stated that Medicaid uses the<br />
	Level II HCPCS codes to indicate which of these many products is<br />
	reimbursable for health care provider submitted drug transactions.<br />
	    One commenter suggested moving the NDC codes to the HCPCS codes.<br />
	The commenter stated using two different coding systems (NDC and HCPCS)<br />
	is counter to the overall goal of administrative simplification.<br />
	    Response: We continue to believe that use of NDC to identify drugs<br />
	is the most appropriate and efficient coding system available. While<br />
	commenters gave various reasons in support of their objection to<br />
	requiring use of NDC for non-pharmacy claims, most of these reasons<br />
	were based upon a misunderstanding of the proposal. For example,<br />
	contrary to one comment, the Medicaid drug rebate program requires the<br />
	NDC, not the generalized Level II HCPCS code for the rebate program.<br />
	    In response to the commenter who stated that the NDC does not<br />
	always allow identification of partial vials (that is, when a single<br />
	vial is used among multiple patients), we note that although this may<br />
	be true with certain NDC codes, the transaction standards allow the<br />
	reporting of dosage units for the NDC. In addition, although certain<br />
	commenters requested a crossover period during which both nonstandard<br />
	and standard codes may be used for processing, we believe that it is<br />
	more reasonable to require all of the systems' changes that we can at<br />
	one time, rather than addressing the changes in a piecemeal fashion.<br />
	The two years after the effective date allowed before compliance is<br />
	required will allow for a smooth transition period. Both non-standard<br />
	electronic formats and the new standard transactions may be used during<br />
	this transition period.<br />
	    With respect to DME claims, HCPCS Level II is the proposed standard<br />
	for DME. DME do not receive NDC as NDC are national drug codes. We are<br />
	not moving the NDC codes to the HCPCS since each are separate coding<br />
	systems for different purposes. Commenters generally supported this<br />
	recommendation.<br />
	    b. Comment: One commenter recommended to either revise the existing<br />
	NDC or create a new coding system so the codes are distinctive in their<br />
	format. The commenter stated that the coding system should serve the<br />
	inventory and distribution industries as well as assist with the<br />
	billing and inventory management of outpatient and hospital settings.<br />
	Moreover, the commenter wanted the system to have the capacity to last<br />
	50 to 100 years or longer.<br />
	    One commenter stated the NDC system was designed for health care<br />
	providers who manufacture drug products or pay for drug therapy. The<br />
	commenter said the design is completely inappropriate for the needs of<br />
	most health care providers who prescribe drug therapies, dispense drug<br />
	products, or administer medications to patients. The NDC identifies<br />
	drug products at a level of detail (the package) that is much too<br />
	granular to be of any practical use for most health care providers. The<br />
	commenter recommended to select either</p>
<p>[[Page 50329]]</p>
<p>MediSource Lexicon or the HL7 Vocabulary Special Interest Group Drug<br />
	Model and Listing as the standard code set for drugs.<br />
	    Response: In general, the Act requires the Secretary to adopt<br />
	existing code sets developed by private or public entities, unless code<br />
	sets for the data elements have not been developed by such entities.<br />
	When new code sets are developed or existing ones revised, they need to<br />
	be evaluated. Demonstrations need to be performed in order to determine<br />
	the cost and feasibility of such codes sets in the health care<br />
	industry. MediSource and HL7 are not currently used within the<br />
	transaction system for administrative and reimbursement purposes for<br />
	retail pharmacy claims. The majority of commenters supported the<br />
	adoption of the NDC coding system for pharmacy claims and did not<br />
	support one commenter's opinion regarding difficulties perceived. The<br />
	NDC was originally developed as a 10-digit identifier made up of three<br />
	subcodes: the manufacturer code, the product code, and the package size<br />
	code. Each subcode is variable in length. Some subcodes are reported<br />
	with leading zeroes and some truncate the leading zero. This leads to<br />
	variable sizes, such as: 5-4-1, 5-3-2, and 4-4-2. Originally, the<br />
	subcodes were separated by hyphens. However, when used in computer<br />
	systems, it is customary to display each subcode using its largest<br />
	valid size, yielding an 11-digit number: 5-4-2. We are adopting the 11-<br />
	digit NDC in order that the format is distinctive and will be in place<br />
	until the Secretary decides to adopt a new code system. Since it will<br />
	be in a standard format, inventory systems, as well as other systems,<br />
	should realize benefits. As the nation moves beyond the adoption of<br />
	initial standards, there may be a need to evaluate other coding systems<br />
	that have the potential of being adopted as a standard in the future.<br />
	    c. Comment: Several commenters said the FDA needs to improve its<br />
	oversight of NDC before adoption. It was stated that the FDA shifted<br />
	responsibilities for the maintenance of the system to manufacturers and<br />
	drug packagers who assigned their own codes. As a result, the FDA does<br />
	not possess a current, accurate, or complete NDC list. It was stated<br />
	that the 11-digit NDC code identifies drugs, and these codes are<br />
	assigned on a continuous basis throughout the year as new drug products<br />
	are issued.<br />
	    Response: The Food and Drug Administration's Center for Drug<br />
	Evaluation and Research provides daily updates to the New and Generic<br />
	Prescription Drug Approval List. They provide weekly updates to the FDA<br />
	Drug Approval List. This list includes additions and deletions to<br />
	prescription and over the counter (OTC) drug products. This list must<br />
	be used in conjunction with the most current publication of the<br />
	Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (a.k.a.<br />
	Orange Book) which is updated on a monthly basis. The NDC Directory is<br />
	updated on a quarterly basis. These lists are available via the<br />
	Internet at: <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.fda.gov/cder">http://www.fda.gov/cder</a>.<br />
	    j. Training Requirements. Comment: A medical association stated<br />
	that there will be a significant increase in the workload required in<br />
	order to adequately comply with the standardized transaction code sets.<br />
	There is a tremendous need for training for health care providers as<br />
	well as information systems modifications. For example, the code sets<br />
	for anesthesia, dental, and procedure codes will require a large amount<br />
	of time and effort for State Medicaid Management Information Systems<br />
	(MMIS) to comply with using the standardized code sets.<br />
	    Response: We agree that educational activities must occur. Health<br />
	plans should inform their health care providers of the impending<br />
	changes as soon as possible and arrange for appropriate educational<br />
	opportunities in 2000. It is also anticipated that health care<br />
	clearinghouses and other commercial entities will offer training.<br />
	    k. Local Codes. Proposal Summary: The Health Care Financing<br />
	Administration Procedural Coding System (HCPCS) contains three levels.<br />
	Level I (CPT-4), is developed and maintained by the AMA and captures<br />
	physician services. Level II of HCPCS contains codes for products,<br />
	supplies, and services not included in CPT-4. Level III, local codes,<br />
	include codes established by insurers and agencies to fulfill local<br />
	claim processing needs. One of the intentions of this rule is to<br />
	eliminate local codes.<br />
	    Comment: We received comments from a diverse group of<br />
	organizations, ranging from data management corporations, health<br />
	insurance organizations, State agencies, etc. A little less than half<br />
	of the commenters did not favor the elimination of local codes. There<br />
	was a general concern expressed by both public and private insurers<br />
	that very specific and unique codes are necessary for processing and<br />
	paying claims efficiently. Many commenters, particularly ones from<br />
	State Medicaid agencies and from other insurance health plans,<br />
	commented on the need for local codes to describe a wide variety of<br />
	health care services. For example, several commenters described<br />
	specific needs for local codes for physician services, such as digital<br />
	rectal exam, that are not delineated in CPT-4 or HCPCS. Other<br />
	commenters opposed the elimination of local codes because they argued<br />
	that it would be difficult to get a national code approved in a timely<br />
	fashion to process claims for new technologies that come onto the<br />
	market and are coverable. The main concern of these commenters was that<br />
	the needs of some health plans' programs are so specific that a more<br />
	general code would not meet their needs. Furthermore, eliminating both<br />
	local codes and the process to standardize codes would take away some<br />
	of a State's authority to administer its programs. There was great<br />
	concern that if the translation of local codes to national codes is not<br />
	done expeditiously it would create a high number of ``not otherwise<br />
	classified codes,'' which in turn create processing delays. There was a<br />
	great deal of concern expressed by health plans that eliminating local<br />
	codes would disrupt data reporting, claims payment, and data systems<br />
	design for a considerable amount of time and would be very expensive.<br />
	    Many commenters said that the proposed process was not well defined<br />
	in the proposed rule. They felt that given the timetable specified in<br />
	the proposed rule there would not be enough time to develop and<br />
	implement an effective standardization process.<br />
	    Commenters made a number of recommendations regarding the<br />
	standardization process. Included among them were the following:<br />
	conduct monthly meetings of the HCPCS panel; have each State establish<br />
	its own HCPCS committee with health plan and health care provider<br />
	representatives deciding which local codes to eliminate and which to<br />
	submit to the national panel for standardization; open the HCPCS panel<br />
	meetings to the public and include participation of stakeholders such<br />
	as state beneficiary representatives and data maintenance<br />
	organizations; add the AMA, ADA and BC/BS Association as voting<br />
	members; and establish both state and regional level committees to make<br />
	decisions on standardization of codes.<br />
	    The main concern was that the proposed elimination of local codes<br />
	would create an enormous backlog of codes for the HCPCS panel to review<br />
	and this would result in the delay of the implementation of national<br />
	codes. There was a general recommendation that any process that is<br />
	established to standardize local codes should also have a mechanism in<br />
	place to assign</p>
<p>[[Page 50330]]</p>
<p>national codes for use within a very short time frame.<br />
	    Several commenters stated they were unclear about whether all local<br />
	codes could be translated into equivalent national codes within the<br />
	next two years. They considered the timetable presented as difficult to<br />
	achieve, and suggested that all codes developed and approved by HCFA<br />
	should have a standard publication timetable. They said that any<br />
	process for standardizing local codes must have the ability to assign<br />
	codes within a very short time frame to assure that claims can be<br />
	processed timely. Some commenters proposed that local codes should be<br />
	eliminated when the ICD-10 codes sets and transactions are implemented.<br />
	Others suggested delaying the elimination of local codes to allow for<br />
	an orderly transition.<br />
	    Response: We understand commenters' concern about eliminating local<br />
	codes and moving to a national process for reviewing and approving<br />
	codes that are needed by public and private insurers. We remain<br />
	committed in our effort to work with the industry to facilitate the<br />
	standardization process. We will be monitoring the process of code<br />
	revision to ensure that the code sets continue to meet the needs of the<br />
	industry. Moreover, although the standardization of local codes will be<br />
	challenging, we believe it is an achievable undertaking as health plans<br />
	and health care providers have two years to eliminate local codes and<br />
	transition to national codes (small health plans have three years<br />
	before they are required by statute to be compliant with the HIPAA<br />
	standards).<br />
	    We would like to clarify that covered entities may not use local<br />
	codes in standard transactions after compliance with this regulation is<br />
	required. Nor may a covered entity require the use of local codes in<br />
	standard transactions after compliance with this regulation is<br />
	required.<br />
	    We believe that the prohibition on the use of local codes in<br />
	standard transactions will likely require health insurers to review<br />
	their local codes and eliminate those codes that duplicate elements in<br />
	the national codes. During this review process, we expect that covered<br />
	entities will find that there are instances when they use a particular<br />
	local code in fewer than 50 claims submissions per year. In those<br />
	instances when a covered entity discovers that it uses a local code in<br />
	fewer than 50 claims submissions per year, the covered entity should<br />
	not make a modification request to the maintainer of the relevant<br />
	medical code set for a unique national code for the item or service.<br />
	Rather than having the maintainer of the relevant code set issue a<br />
	unique national code for a service or item for which there are fewer<br />
	than 50 claim submissions per year, a covered entity should use the<br />
	national Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) code (use of the NOS code is<br />
	voluntary before the compliance date of this regulation, but use of the<br />
	NOS code becomes mandatory after the compliance date of the<br />
	regulation). We believe that not only will NOS codes continue to serve<br />
	as the national code for claim submissions for an item or service that<br />
	are submitted fewer than 50 times per year, they will continue to serve<br />
	as the national code for new services or items that have not yet been<br />
	assigned a unique national code by the maintainer of the relevant<br />
	medical code set.<br />
	    Also, we anticipate that insurers will need to work with other<br />
	similarly situated health plans to review local codes used for<br />
	professional services, procedures, health care products and supplies<br />
	which are not described by the current code sets. Finally, in<br />
	situations where, after careful review, no national code currently<br />
	exists to replace a local code, health plans may request the<br />
	establishment of a national code. Health plans should bear in mind the<br />
	criteria for the establishment of a national code. Specifically,<br />
	national codes are only designed to identify an item or service;<br />
	additional codes are not established to carry health plan specific<br />
	information such as units or health care provider identification for<br />
	products or procedures which have been given a national code. Such<br />
	information must be used elsewhere and cannot be imbedded in the<br />
	national codes.<br />
	    Health plans should submit individual code requests for the<br />
	establishment of national codes, along with supporting documentation,<br />
	to the appropriate standard code set maintenance group. For example, in<br />
	order to provide a better understanding of the HCPCS process, a Web<br />
	site has been set up to provide public access to the list of items<br />
	submitted for the HCPCS National Panel for review. An e-mail link is<br />
	available for questions and comments related to the HCPCS process. The<br />
	Internet site is <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.hcfa.gov/medicare/hcpcs.htm">http://www.hcfa.gov/medicare/hcpcs.htm</a>.<br />

	    In addition, some commenters have stated that they use codes within<br />
	their operating systems that are internally generated. These internal<br />
	operating codes are used solely within the organization for<br />
	administrative purposes. We understand that these codes are sometimes<br />
	called local codes. Furthermore, commenters are concerned that this<br />
	regulation will require the elimination of those internal operating<br />
	codes. We clarify that this regulation will not require the elimination<br />
	of the use of these internal operating codes when not part of a<br />
	transaction for which a standard has been adopted under this part.<br />
	2. Transaction Standards<br />
	    We received numerous comments on the specific transaction standards<br />
	and implementation specifications which we proposed to adopt. Some of<br />
	these concerned the choice of the particular standard itself, a matter<br />
	clearly within the Secretary's purview. Many of the other comments,<br />
	however, concerned specific issues raised by the electronic formats,<br />
	data conditions, and/or data content of the proposed standards and/or<br />
	implementation specifications themselves. As these are all standards<br />
	that are developed and maintained by external organizations (SSOs), the<br />
	concerns raised by this latter group of comments could not be directly<br />
	addressed by the Secretary.<br />
	    Thus, we initially analyzed the public comments received to<br />
	determine which comments fell into this latter group. The comments<br />
	directed at the implementation specification for the X12N standards<br />
	were turned over to the ASC X12N Subcommittee for review and action by<br />
	the appropriate work</p>
<p>[[Page 50331]]</p>
<p>group(s). They classified the comments into two categories: business<br />
	needs, and technical or editorial errors. A listing of issues reviewed<br />
	by X12N and the X12N response to those issues can be viewed on the<br />
	Internet at <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.wpc-edi.com/hipaa/nprm_issues">http://www.wpc-edi.com/hipaa/nprm_issues</a>. Those workgroups<br />
	in turn reviewed the various comments and concluded that the existing<br />
	standard and/or implementation specification: (1) Needed to be changed<br />
	and made the appropriate changes, (2) already addressed the concerns<br />
	raised, so that no change was needed, (3) were correct, so that no<br />
	change was needed, or (4) needed to be changed, but that the changes<br />
	needed could not be made in the time available.<br />
	    Thus, the discussion of the particular X12N standards in the<br />
	preamble below generally reflects this approach. The first four<br />
	paragraphs of the discussion of the agency's response to each standard<br />
	follows the following general format:</p>
<p>    Of those comments we referred to ASC X12N, the work groups<br />
	determined that [#] comments identified areas where the<br />
	implementation specification could be improved, and the appropriate<br />
	changes were made. [#] comments identified business needs that ASC<br />
	X12N judged could already be met within the current standard<br />
	implementation specification. Detailed information on how the<br />
	current implementation specifications can be used to meet these<br />
	business needs has been provided by ASC X12N at the Internet site in<br />
	Sec. 162.920. [#] comments alleged technical or editorial errors in<br />
	the standard implementation specification. A technical review of<br />
	these issues was conducted by work groups within ASC X12N. The work<br />
	groups determined that [#] comments identified areas where the<br />
	implementation specifications were in fact correct and that no<br />
	changes were needed. Changes to the implementation specification<br />
	were not required. There were another [#] comments which identified<br />
	business needs that ASC X12N judged could not be met directly within<br />
	the current standard implementation specification. The<br />
	implementation specifications could not be changed prior to the<br />
	issuance of the final regulation because the X12 standards<br />
	development process for modifying standards could not be completed<br />
	in time. However, a review of the issues by the ASC X12N work groups<br />
	has identified a means of meeting the business needs within the<br />
	existing implementation specification as an interim measure.<br />
	Organizations and individuals who submitted such comments are<br />
	encouraged to work with the DSMOs to submit a request to modify the<br />
	national standard.</p>
<p>    We set out below the number of comments that fell into each<br />
	category with respect to each of the standards. The particular<br />
	groupings above appear, where applicable, as paragraphs (i), (ii),<br />
	(iii), and (iv), respectively, of the responses to the comments on each<br />
	X12N standard.<br />
	    a. Transaction Standard for Health Care Claims or Equivalent<br />
	Encounter Information. We proposed in subpart K that:<br />
	    For pharmacy claims, the NCPDP Telecommunications Standard Format<br />
	Version 3.2 and equivalent Standard Claims Billing Tape Format batch<br />
	implementation, version 2.0, would be the standard.<br />
	    For dental claims, the ASC X12N 837--Health Care Claim: Dental,<br />
	Version 4010, Washington Publishing Company, 004010X097, would be the<br />
	standard.<br />
	    For professional claims, the ASC X12N 837--Health Care Claim:<br />
	Professional, Version 4010, Washington Publishing Company, 004010X098,<br />
	would be the standard.<br />
	    For institutional claims, the ASC X12N 837--Health Care Claim:<br />
	Institutional, Version 4010, Washington Publishing Company, 004010X096,<br />
	would be the standard.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on the Transaction Standard for Health Care<br />
	Claims and Equivalent Encounter Information: Pharmacy</p>
<p>    i. Comment: One commenter suggested that the final rule contain the<br />
	correct version of the NCPDP Batch Standard Version. The correct<br />
	version is 1.0, not version 2.0 as originally proposed.<br />
	    Response: We agree to make the recommended change. The correct name<br />
	of the standard may be found in Sec. 162.1102.<br />
	    ii. Comment: Several commenters recommended that we reword this<br />
	section to state ``version 3.2 or higher.'' This change would allow any<br />
	approved version of the standard to be used. Currently, there are<br />
	health plans and health care providers who have implemented a higher<br />
	version of the standard.<br />
	    Response: This final rule adopts NCPDP Telecommunications Standard<br />
	Format, Version 5.1 in place of version 3.2. We do not believe that the<br />
	term ``or higher'' is appropriate in that it will allow for variations<br />
	in the standard used for pharmacy transactions. This is the most<br />
	recently approved version of the NCPDP standard. This version contains<br />
	revisions that address comments made to the proposed rule. There are<br />
	numerous other benefits and advantages to naming Version 5.1. Some of<br />
	these benefits and advantages are the following:<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Expanded dollar fields.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; HIPAA supported fields including Employer ID, Plan ID,<br />
	and Prescriber (Provider) ID.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; New clinical fields including expanded Diagnosis Code,<br />
	Patient Height, and Patient Body Surface Area.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Service transactions for expanded professional pharmacy<br />
	service support.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Expanded coordination of benefits (COB) support.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Support of intermediary processing.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Coupon fields.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Expanded response messaging including preferred product<br />
	support and approved message codes.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Flexibility with qualifiers that allows for addition of<br />
	qualifier type codes instead of adding new fields.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Pricing uniformity.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Controlled Substance reporting support including<br />
	Alternate ID and Scheduled Rx ID.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Consistency within the NCPDP telecommunication<br />
	standard.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Correction of issues from previous versions.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Variable length transactions that allow for trading<br />
	partners to transmit only the data required for doing business (i.e.<br />
	A v5.1 claim can be very small when necessary. Refer to the v5.1<br />
	implementation specifications for examples).<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Supports partial fill indicators.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Additional code values for Drug Utilization Review<br />
	(DUR).<br />
	    iii. Comment: One commenter recommended that the word ``retail'' be<br />
	removed when mentioning the NCPDP standard since the NCPDP<br />
	Telecommunications Standard Format Version 3.2 and equivalent NCPDP<br />
	Batch Standards Version 1.0 may be used to bill professional pharmacy<br />
	services as well as retail pharmacy services.<br />
	    Response: We are adopting the NCPDP standard for retail pharmacy<br />
	only. We are adopting the ASC X12N 837 for professional pharmacy<br />
	claims. Professional pharmacy claims use both the National Drug Code<br />
	(NDC) and HCPCS j-codes to identify the pharmacy procedure or service.<br />
	The NCPDP standard is designed to accommodate the NDC only and does not<br />
	allow for billing of professional pharmacy claims using HCPCS. The<br />
	NCPDP standard would require major modifications in order to<br />
	accommodate the HCPCS codes.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on the Transaction Standard for Health Care<br />
	Claims or Equivalent Encounter Information: Dental</p>
<p>    The majority of commenters expressed support of the selected<br />
	standard.<br />
	    i. Of those comments we referred to ASC X12N, the work groups<br />
	determined that 246 comments identified areas where the implementation<br />
	specification could be improved, and the appropriate changes were made.<br />
	    ii. One individual comment identified a business need that ASC X12N<br />
	judged</p>
<p>[[Page 50332]]</p>
<p>could already be met within the current standard implementation<br />
	specification. Detailed information on how the current implementation<br />
	specifications can be used to meet these business needs has been<br />
	provided by ASC X12N at the Internet site in Sec. 162.920.<br />
	    iii. Thirty-one individual comments alleged technical or editorial<br />
	errors in the standard implementation specification. A technical review<br />
	of these issues was conducted by work groups within ASC X12N. The work<br />
	groups determined that the 31 comments identified areas where the<br />
	implementation specifications were in fact correct and that no changes<br />
	were needed. Changes to the implementation specification were not<br />
	required.<br />
	    iv. There were another 4 individual comments which identified<br />
	business needs that ASC X12N judged could not be met directly within<br />
	the current standard implementation specification. The implementation<br />
	specifications could not be changed prior to the issuance of the final<br />
	regulation because the X12 standards development process for modifying<br />
	standards could not be completed in time. However, a review of the<br />
	issues by the ASC X12N work groups has identified a means of meeting<br />
	the business needs within the existing implementation specification as<br />
	an interim measure. Organizations and individuals who submitted such<br />
	comments are encouraged to work with the DSMOs to submit a request to<br />
	modify the national standard.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on the Transaction Standard for Health Care<br />
	Claims or Equivalent Encounter Information: Professional</p>
<p>    i. Of those comments we referred to ASC X12N, the work groups<br />
	determined that 356 comments identified areas where the implementation<br />
	specification could be improved, and the appropriate changes were made.<br />
	    ii. Thirty-five comments identified business needs that ASC X12N<br />
	judged could already be met within the current standard implementation<br />
	specification. Detailed information on how the current implementation<br />
	specifications can be used to meet these business needs has been<br />
	provided by ASC X12N at the Internet site in Sec. 162.920.<br />
	    iii. 267 comments alleged technical or editorial errors in the<br />
	standard implementation specification. A technical review of these<br />
	issues was conducted by work groups within ASC X12N. The work groups<br />
	determined that the 276 comments identified areas where the<br />
	implementation specifications were in fact correct and that no changes<br />
	were needed. Changes to the implementation specification were not<br />
	required.<br />
	    iv. There were another 9 comments which identified business needs<br />
	that ASC X12N judged could not be met directly within the current<br />
	standard implementation specification. The implementation<br />
	specifications could not be changed prior to the issuance of the final<br />
	regulation because the X12 standards development process for modifying<br />
	standards could not be completed in time. However, a review of the<br />
	issues by the ASC X12N work groups has identified a means of meeting<br />
	the business needs within the existing implementation specification as<br />
	an interim measure. Organizations and individuals who submitted such<br />
	comments are encouraged to work with the DSMOs to submit a request to<br />
	modify the national standard.<br />
	    v. Comment: The majority of commenters expressed support for the<br />
	selected standard. However, there was concern that the X12N 837 neither<br />
	meets Medicaid's needs nor supports behavioral health services. One<br />
	commenter stated that representatives of the alcoholism and substance<br />
	abuse treatment fields were not adequately represented in the<br />
	development of the standards.<br />
	    Response: The X12N standards are developed and maintained in an<br />
	open atmosphere. We strongly encourage all industry stakeholders to<br />
	assist in this process to ensure that their business needs are met. If<br />
	Medicaid Agencies or other entities believe their business needs will<br />
	not be met through the selected standard, we encourage them to submit<br />
	any new data requests to the DSMOs. We will be monitoring the DSMOs'<br />
	process for the revision of standards to ensure that they are revised<br />
	appropriately.<br />
	    vi. Comment: Several commenters stated that the adoption of the<br />
	claim standard without the attachment standard will create processing<br />
	problems. They stated there is a potential that certain claims that<br />
	require an attachment will need to be adjudicated manually.<br />
	    Response: The health care claims or equivalent encounter<br />
	information standard currently contains many justification requirements<br />
	for certain services, including oxygen, chiropractic, ambulance, and<br />
	durable medical equipment services. Therefore, these claims will not<br />
	have to be adjudicated manually. Once the attachment standard is<br />
	adopted, we expect that the justification requirements for the services<br />
	listed above will be met by the attachment standards and, therefore,<br />
	will be removed from the health care claims or equivalent encounter<br />
	information standard. All other attachments that are not in this<br />
	transaction or are not met by the attachment standard will need to be<br />
	adjudicated manually.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on the Transaction Standard for Health Care<br />
	Claims or Equivalent Encounter Information: Institutional</p>
<p>    i. Of those comments we referred to ASC X12N, the work groups<br />
	determined that 169 comments identified areas where the implementation<br />
	specification could be improved, and the appropriate changes were made.<br />
	    ii. Three comments identified business needs that ASC X12N judged<br />
	could already be met within the current standard implementation<br />
	specification. Detailed information on how the current implementation<br />
	specifications can be used to meet these business needs has been<br />
	provided by ASC X12N at the Internet site in Sec. 162.920.<br />
	    iii. 54 comments alleged technical or editorial errors in the<br />
	standard implementation specification. A technical review of these<br />
	issues was conducted by work groups within ASC X12N. The work groups<br />
	determined that the 54 comments identified areas where the<br />
	implementation specifications were in fact correct and that no changes<br />
	were needed. Changes to the implementation specification were not<br />
	required.<br />
	    iv. There were another 6 comments which identified business needs<br />
	that ASC X12N judged could not be met directly within the current<br />
	standard implementation specification. The implementation<br />
	specifications could not be changed prior to the issuance of the final<br />
	regulation because the X12 standards development process for modifying<br />
	standards could not be completed in time. However, a review of the<br />
	issues by the ASC X12N work groups has identified a means of meeting<br />
	the business needs within the existing implementation specification as<br />
	an interim measure. Organizations and individuals who submitted such<br />
	comments are encouraged to work with the DSMOs to submit a request to<br />
	modify the national standard.<br />
	    v. Comment: The majority of commenters expressed support of the<br />
	selected standard.<br />
	    Several commenters stated that they wanted the UB92 to be selected<br />
	as the institutional claim standard since it is widely used. Several<br />
	commenters disagreed that the X12N 837 met all of the guiding<br />
	principles. The guiding principles are:</p>
<p>    (1) Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care<br />
	system by leading to cost</p>

<p>reductions for, or improvements in benefits from, electronic health<br />
	care transactions.<br />
	    (2) Meet the needs of the health data standards user community,<br />
	particularly health care providers, health plans, and health care<br />
	clearinghouses.<br />
	    (3) Be consistent and uniform with the other standards required<br />
	under this part--their data element names, definitions, and codes<br />
	and the privacy and security requirements--and with other private<br />
	and public sector health data standards, to the extent possible.<br />
	    (4) Have low additional development and implementation costs<br />
	relative to the benefits of using the standard.<br />
	    (5) Be supported by an ANSI-accredited standard setting<br />
	organization or other private or public organization that will<br />
	ensure continuity and efficient updating of the standard over time.<br />
	    (6) Have timely development, testing, implementation, and<br />
	updating procedures to achieve administrative simplification<br />
	benefits faster.<br />
	    (7) Be technologically independent of the computer platforms and<br />
	transmission protocols used in electronic health transactions,<br />
	except when they are explicitly part of the standard.<br />
	    (8) Be precise and unambiguous, but as simple as possible.<br />
	    (9) Keep data collection and paperwork burdens on users as low<br />
	as is feasible.<br />
	    (10) Incorporate flexibility to adapt more easily to changes in<br />
	the health care infrastructure (such as new services, organizations,<br />
	and provider types) and information technology.</p>
<p>    The principles in question were 1, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 10.<br />
	    There was also concern that the X12N 837 does not meet the needs of<br />
	many State Medicaid agencies. Different agencies require codes and data<br />
	elements that are not in the transaction standard.<br />
	    Response: While the UB92 is supported by many institutions, it is<br />
	not used in a standard manner. To undergo a national UB92<br />
	standardization effort is not practical since the X12N 837 meets<br />
	institutional needs and the majority of commenters support the<br />
	selection of all X12N transactions.<br />
	    We believe the X12N 837 meets all of the guiding principles in<br />
	question. Implementation of the X12N 837 using the specifications<br />
	defined in the implementation specification for version 4010 will lead<br />
	to administrative simplification and cost savings for both health plans<br />
	and health care providers. One nationally accepted standard will exist,<br />
	rather than a variety of national and local formats (#1). We believe<br />
	that the long-term savings that will accrue from the adoption of the<br />
	standard will offset the short-term implementation costs (#4) (see<br />
	section VI. Final Impact Analysis). The DSMOs have a process for the<br />
	development and maintenance of transactions and implementation<br />
	specifications that include many quality and technical assurance<br />
	checkpoints prior to the approval of X12 standards and X12N industry<br />
	implementation specifications (#6). Uniform implementation of the<br />
	standards is critical. The implementation specifications provide for<br />
	standard as well as unambiguous data content requirements for all users<br />
	of each transaction (#8). Exchange of the X12N 837 standard transaction<br />
	does not require increased data collection or paperwork burden (#9).<br />
	The X12N 837 standard and syntax allow for the easy addition of new<br />
	business functions. For example, instead of listing all CPT codes, the<br />
	implementation specification refers to the code source. The standard<br />
	uses qualifiers to aggregate general data content into unambiguous<br />
	business transactions (#10). If an external code set is updated, the<br />
	standard transaction would not have to be updated since the codes are<br />
	external to the implementation specification. Qualifiers allow for the<br />
	precise definition of generic fields, such as dates.<br />
	    As part of the proposed rule comment process, commenters were<br />
	encouraged to review the implementation specifications. Many commenters<br />
	submitted requests for data needs or changes to the implementation<br />
	specifications and, thus, we believe there has been ample time to<br />
	review and submit these requests. If Medicaid agencies or other<br />
	entities did not identify all of their business needs, they will need<br />
	to submit new data requests to the DSMOs.<br />
	    We note that health plans and covered health care providers that do<br />
	business with Medicaid agencies will be required to use the standards<br />
	within the 24 month implementation period (36 months for small health<br />
	plans). We believe it would be inconsistent with the statutory intent<br />
	to require these entities to support non-standard requirements solely<br />
	for individual State Medicaid agencies, especially where those health<br />
	plans and health care providers operate in more than one State. HCFA<br />
	and the DSMOs stand ready to assist the State agencies with their<br />
	transitions to the standards.<br />
	    b. Transaction Standard for Health Care Payment and Remittance<br />
	Advice. In subpart L, redesignated as subpart P, we proposed ASC X12N<br />
	835--Health Care Claim Payment/Advice, Version 4010, Washington<br />
	Publishing Company, 004010X091 as the standard for health care payment<br />
	and remittance advice.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on the Transaction Standard for Health Care<br />
	Payment and Remittance Advice</p>
<p>    The majority of commenters expressed support of the selected<br />
	standard.<br />
	    i. Of those comments we referred to ASC X12N, the work groups<br />
	determined that 209 comments identified areas where the implementation<br />
	specification could be improved, and the appropriate changes were made.<br />
	    ii. Seven comments identified business needs that ASC X12N judged<br />
	could already be met within the current standard implementation<br />
	specification. Detailed information on how the current implementation<br />
	specifications can be used to meet these business needs has been<br />
	provided by ASC X12N at the Internet site in Sec. 162.920.<br />
	    iii. Fifteen comments alleged technical or editorial errors in the<br />
	standard implementation specification. A technical review of these<br />
	issues was conducted by work groups within ASC X12N. The work groups<br />
	determined that the 15 comments identified areas where the<br />
	implementation specifications were in fact correct and that no changes<br />
	were needed. Changes to the implementation specification were not<br />
	required.<br />
	    iv. Comment: A number of commenters asked that they be allowed to<br />
	continue to use proprietary codes, narrative information, and their<br />
	current alternate uses of selected ASC X12N 835 segments.<br />
	    Response: We disagree. Permitting the combined use of nonstandard<br />
	data content would not comply with the intent of the statute. The ASC<br />
	X12N 835 format is intended to be fully machine readable, so that there<br />
	can be totally automated posting of transactions to patient and health<br />
	care provider accounts wherever used, regardless of the health plan.<br />
	    We encourage health care providers and health plans who have a<br />
	business need for additional information in the ASC X12N 835 format to<br />
	provide background to the DSMOs on the need so the ASC X12N 835<br />
	implementation specification can be modified for a future version, or<br />
	so that the DSMOs can advise commenters how their business needs can be<br />
	met within the current implementation specification. ASC X12N made a<br />
	number of changes in the 4010 implementation specification as a result<br />
	of such comments on the proposed rule. In most cases, however,<br />
	commenters who indicated that current code sets were inadequate did not<br />
	submit any specific suggestions or requests with respect to the changes<br />
	they needed. The DSMOs cannot</p>
<p>[[Page 50334]]</p>
<p>consider an implementation specification modification to meet a need if<br />
	the need has not been defined. We strongly encourage health plans and<br />
	health care providers to participate in this process so that their<br />
	needs are met.<br />
	    v. Comment: Some commenters questioned why the ASC X12N 835 did not<br />
	explain the basis for the payment issued.<br />
	    Response: The ASC X12N 835 is not intended to explain how the<br />
	amount of payment for a service is determined. A health care payment<br />
	and remittance advice, as embodied in the ASC X12N 835 format,<br />
	primarily exists to notify the health care provider of the amount being<br />
	paid for a set of bills and, if that payment does not equal the amount<br />
	billed, to briefly explain every adjustment applied to those bills by<br />
	the health plan. A health care payment and remittance advice is not a<br />
	vehicle for instructing health care providers on coverage policy,<br />
	except to briefly refer to that policy when it is the reason for denial<br />
	or reduction of a billed service. Information on policy type and<br />
	coverage rules is more appropriately included on a health plan's<br />
	membership card and the coverage information shared with the subscriber<br />
	and/or a health care provider at enrollment or in subsequent<br />
	newsletters.<br />
	    vi. Comment: A number of health plans requested that the ASC X12N<br />
	835 format be rearranged to more closely parallel the internal flat<br />
	file they use for their claims systems in order to minimize the<br />
	programming changes they would need to make in order to comply with<br />
	version 4010 of the ASC X12N 835. They argued that they did not<br />
	consider it administratively simpler if they had to make extensive<br />
	programming changes.<br />
	    Response: We considered these comments. In some cases, the<br />
	implementation specification was changed, but for the most part, such<br />
	requests could not be accommodated. HIPAA requires that United States<br />
	health plans and certain health care providers, or their<br />
	clearinghouses, use national health care transaction standards. Health<br />
	care providers and health plans have flexibility in how they will<br />
	implement the standards. They may choose to utilize a health care<br />
	clearinghouse to process their transactions. By definition, a health<br />
	care clearinghouse is used to translate non-standard format into a<br />
	standard format, or vice-versa. When a health plan or health care<br />
	provider uses a health care clearinghouse for those functions, they may<br />
	be able to minimize programming changes. There are also a wide variety<br />
	of software vendors from whom they may choose to purchase translation<br />
	software.<br />
	    vii. Comment: Some commenters asked for more generic codes in the<br />
	ASC X12N 835 version 4010 implementation specification so that a health<br />
	plan can simply report a service as denied or reduced, without the need<br />
	to furnish more explanation on the reason for the denial or reduction.<br />
	    Response: Health care providers need to have adequate details on<br />
	the ASC X12N 835 transaction that they receive in order to enable them<br />
	to not only post accounts, but to decide whether an appeal should be<br />
	filed, or further action taken in response to the health plan's<br />
	decision on a claim. A failure to supply adequate reasons for denial or<br />
	reduction would undermine the effectiveness of an ASC X12N 835<br />
	transaction.<br />
	    viii. Comment: A few commenters asked for a code to indicate that a<br />
	health plan was knowingly issuing an ASC X12N 835 transaction that did<br />
	not balance. It was reasoned that not all health plans might be able to<br />
	issue an ASC X12N 835 transaction that balances when the transaction<br />
	becomes effective as a national health care standard.<br />
	    Response: This request can not be accommodated. As explained in the<br />
	implementation specification, an ASC X12N 835 transaction must balance<br />
	at the line, claim and provider levels. To be in balance, the amount<br />
	billed, less the amount of any adjustments, must equal the amount paid.<br />
	An out of balance ASC X12N 835 would not be in compliance with the<br />
	version 4010 implementation specification. Health plans are responsible<br />
	for making all changes as needed to issue complete and compliant ASC<br />
	X12N 835 version 4010 transactions. An out of balance ASC X12N 835 is<br />
	of little to no value to a health care provider, raises more questions<br />
	than it settles, and consumes the resources of health care providers<br />
	and health plans who must explain why it does not balance.<br />
	    ix. Comment: A health care clearinghouse asked if it would share<br />
	any liability for non-compliance if it forwarded out of balance<br />
	remittance data from a health plan to a health care provider.<br />
	    Response: Liability issues will be discussed in a later enforcement<br />
	regulation.<br />
	    x. Comment: One commenter asked that all new codes or changes to<br />
	codes considered for inclusion in an ASC X12N 835 implementation<br />
	specification be circulated to all health plans for review and comment<br />
	prior to inclusion.<br />
	    Response: This is not practical at this time. There is not yet a<br />
	central registry of health plans and, even if there were, the cost of<br />
	such distribution and analysis of responses would be a significant<br />
	financial burden on the code set maintainers. Such a process would also<br />
	greatly extend the clearance time for such changes, preventing<br />
	maintainers from meeting immediate business needs. Affected health<br />
	plans can comment on code additions and changes included in or referred<br />
	to in a later implementation specification through the maintenance and<br />
	modification process set out at Sec. 162.910. Affected health plans are<br />
	also encouraged to increase their involvement with the organizations<br />
	responsible for code set maintenance. Health plans are encouraged to<br />
	submit any new data requests to the DSMOs.<br />
	    xi. Comment: A few State Medicaid agencies requested that they be<br />
	permitted to use the ASC X12N 835 format, rather than the ASC X12N 820,<br />
	to pay premiums to managed care companies under contract to provide<br />
	care to Medicaid beneficiaries.<br />
	    Response: Although the ASC X12N 835 can accommodate claims and<br />
	capitation payments to health care providers, including managed care<br />
	companies, the payments described in these comments are considered<br />
	health plan premium payments, rather than payment for direct patient<br />
	care. As discussed below under ``Comments and Responses on the<br />
	Transaction Standard for Health Plan Premium Payments,'' all health<br />
	plan premium payments must be transmitted with the ASC X12N 820<br />
	standard for consistency. Also, the ASC X12N 820 Payroll Deducted and<br />
	Other Group Premium Payment for Insurance Products implementation<br />
	specification includes some data elements not contained in the ASC X12N<br />
	835, because it was designed specifically for premium payment, rather<br />
	than claim payment.<br />
	    xii. Comment: A number of commenters questioned whether they would<br />
	be prohibited from use of the automated clearinghouse (ACH) transaction<br />
	for electronic funds transfer (EFT) of health care payments once the<br />
	ASC X12N 835 is effective as a HIPAA transaction standard.<br />
	    Response: The ACH is an acceptable mode of EFT under both the ASC<br />
	X12N 835 and 820 transactions. The implementation specifications for<br />
	the ASC X12N 835 and 820 transactions contain two parts, a mechanism<br />
	for the transfer of dollars and one for the transfer of information<br />
	about the payment, and allow these two parts to be transmitted<br />
	separately. Consistent with the implementation specifications, actual<br />
	payment may be sent in a number of different, equally acceptable ways,</p>
<p>[[Page 50335]]</p>
<p>including check and several varieties of electronic funds transfer.<br />
	When the transfer of funds is part of paying a health care premium or a<br />
	health care claim, the ACH transaction may continue to be used as a<br />
	valid part of an ASC X12N 835 or 820 transaction where the other part<br />
	of the transaction is sent to the health plan or health care provider,<br />
	directly or indirectly (through a clearinghouse or financial<br />
	institution). Although these standard transactions allow transmission<br />
	of one or both parts through a financial institution, they do not<br />
	require both parts to be sent to the financial institution and the<br />
	financial institution is not required by this regulation to accept or<br />
	forward such transactions.<br />
	    Health plans may continue to use the ACH transaction alone to<br />
	authorize the transfer of funds (electronic funds transfer) when such<br />
	transfer is not part of paying a health care premium or a health care<br />
	claim for an individual, because such a transaction would not be a<br />
	transaction covered under this part. The Department of the Treasury has<br />
	confirmed that this standard does not conflict with their requirements<br />
	for disbursements.<br />
	    xiii. Comment: One commenter criticized the ASC X12N 835 format as<br />
	inadequate to explain benefit payments to subscribers. The commenter<br />
	was under the impression that ASC X12N 835 transactions would be issued<br />
	electronically to patients as well as health care providers or their<br />
	clearinghouses.<br />
	    Response: We clarify that the ASC X12N 835 will be sent from a<br />
	health plan to health care providers and/or health care clearinghouses.<br />
	We are not regulating the explanations of benefits (EOBs) that health<br />
	plans send to their subscribers. We believe subscribers will still<br />
	receive an adequate explanation of benefits.<br />
	    xiv. Comment: A health plan asked if it would be prohibited from<br />
	sending paper EOBs to a health care provider who was sent an ASC X12N<br />
	835 transaction for the same claims. The health plan currently issues<br />
	electronic remittance advice but includes appeal information only on<br />
	the corresponding paper remittance advice. The health plan was<br />
	concerned about how it could distribute appeal information for denied<br />
	or reduced claims.<br />
	    Response: A health plan can choose to continue to send paper<br />
	remittance advice notices to health care providers that are issued ASC<br />
	X12N 835 transactions. However, all information in the paper notice<br />
	that could have been expressed in the X12N 835 must be included in the<br />
	X12N 835 transaction. If a health plan has a need to send data that is<br />
	not on the X12N 835, it needs to work with the DSMOs to submit a<br />
	request to modify the standard. It is anticipated, however, that with<br />
	expanded acceptance of electronic transactions by health care<br />
	providers, and increases in automated coordination of benefits among<br />
	health plans, there may be less of a need for paper remittance advice<br />
	notices. At some point, health plans may be able to reduce or eliminate<br />
	most paper remittance notices to health care providers capable of<br />
	receiving of the electronic notices.<br />
	    Also, the ASC X12N 835 transaction may be used to notify a health<br />
	care provider of appeal rights by using the ``remark codes'' segment.<br />
	Please see the remark code menu item at www.wpc-edi.com for a listing<br />
	of currently approved remark codes and instructions on how to request<br />
	additional remark codes to meet your business needs.<br />
	    xv. Comment: One commenter was confused as to whether the NCPDP<br />
	standard for real time remittance information could continue to be used<br />
	once version 4010 of the ASC X12N 835 became the national Health Care<br />
	Payment and Remittance Advice standard.<br />
	    Response: Yes, the NCPDP Telecommunications Standard Format may<br />
	continue to be used for real time pharmacy transactions because it is<br />
	designed to apply to such transactions. The ASC X12N 835 is the<br />
	standard transaction for dental, professional, and institutional health<br />
	care payment and remittance advice. The NCPDP standard was not<br />
	originally proposed due to an oversight on our part regarding the<br />
	functionality of the standard. The NCPDP standard is used for both<br />
	claim and health care payment and remittance advice and is being<br />
	adopted as the standard transaction for retail pharmacy.<br />
	    xvi. Comment: A few commenters asked for guidance as to when<br />
	version 4010 of the ASC X12N 835 might sunset in favor of a later<br />
	version or a replacement format. They also asked whether version 4010<br />
	and a replacement version/format could be operated concurrently for 90<br />
	days or more to allow for an orderly conversion of health plans and<br />
	health care providers between versions/formats.<br />
	    Response: These issues will be addressed when the Secretary<br />
	announces any successor version/format to version 4010 of the ASC X12N<br />
	835. Under HIPAA, however, as a general rule, new versions or formats<br />
	cannot be required more than once every 12 months and health care<br />
	providers must be allowed a minimum of 180 days advance notice to<br />
	enable them to comply with the change. We do anticipate a need for a<br />
	crossover period of at least 90 days to convert between versions/<br />
	formats during which both the old and new versions/formats will need to<br />
	be supported.<br />
	    xvii. Comment: It was suggested that the ASC X12N 997 format be<br />
	expanded or new format developed and recognized as a HIPAA standard to<br />
	allow health care providers or health care clearinghouses to notify a<br />
	health plan of some problem with the format or content of an ASC X12N<br />
	835 transaction.<br />
	    Response: This issue has been referred to X12N. There is no<br />
	implementation specification for a transaction of this type at present,<br />
	but such a transaction can be considered for addition to the published<br />
	HIPAA standards if and when it is developed, and the implementation<br />
	specification is written.<br />
	    xviii. Comment: One commenter was concerned that patient privacy<br />
	could be violated if a full ASC X12N 835 transaction is sent to a<br />
	health care provider's bank. The commenter asked what will be done to<br />
	secure that data.<br />
	    Response: A separate enforcement rule will address the penalties<br />
	for violating the HIPAA rules. Separate privacy and security<br />
	regulations are being prepared that will address privacy and security<br />
	restrictions for health information.<br />
	    xix. Comment: Several commenters recommended that we include the<br />
	NCPDP telecommunications Standard 3.2 for the submission of remittance<br />
	advice for the pharmacy service sector. Another commenter said that<br />
	they use the NCPDP telecommunications Standard 3.2 for the claim and<br />
	remittance transactions. Several commenters said the NCPDP meets their<br />
	business needs and there is no business need to move to the ASC X12N<br />
	835 transaction for remittance advice inquiries.<br />
	    Response: We agree with the commenter that remittance information<br />
	is integral to the NCPDP Telecommunications Standard named in the<br />
	proposed rule for retail pharmacy claims. As discussed previously, we<br />
	are naming the NCPDP Telecommunications Standard 5.1 and NCPDP Batch<br />
	Standard as the standard for health care payment and remittance advice<br />
	within the retail pharmacy sector. We have added this requirement to<br />
	Sec. 162.1602.<br />
	    c. Transaction Standard for Coordination of Benefits. In subpart M,<br />
	redesignated in this rule as subpart R,</p>
<p>[[Page 50336]]</p>
<p>we proposed as the standards for coordination of benefits the<br />
	following:<br />
	    For pharmacy claims, the NCPDP Telecommunications Standard Format<br />
	Version 3.2 and equivalent Standard Claims Billing Tape Format batch<br />
	implementation, version 2.0.<br />
	    For dental claims, the ASC X12N 837--Health Care Claim: Dental,<br />
	Version 4010, Washington Publishing Company, 004010X097.<br />
	    For professional claims, the ASC X12N 837--Health Care Claim:<br />
	Professional, Version 4010, Washington Publishing Company, 004010X098.<br />
	    For institutional claims, the ASC X12N 837--Health Care Claim:<br />
	Institutional, Version 4010, Washington Publishing Company, 004010X096.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on the Transaction Standard for Coordination of<br />
	Benefits: Pharmacy</p>
<p>    Comment: One commenter suggested that the final rule contain the<br />
	correct version of the NCPDP Batch Standard Version. The correct<br />
	version is 1.0, not version 2.0 as originally proposed.<br />
	    Response: We agree to make the recommended change for the batch<br />
	standard. The proposed version 2.0 was incorrect. The correct name of<br />
	the standard may be found in Sec. 162.1802. We are also changing the<br />
	version to the NCPDP Telecommunications Standard Format Version for<br />
	COB. The version is 5.1 as previously discussed.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on the Transaction Standard for Coordination of<br />
	Benefits: Dental, Professional, Institutional</p>
<p>    i. Comment: One commenter recommended that claim/encounter data<br />
	items should be distinguished from those data items that are part of<br />
	the COB transaction process.<br />
	    Response: One implementation specification is used for claims and<br />
	coordination of benefits. The implementation specification clearly<br />
	distinguishes between coordination of benefits data and claim data. For<br />
	example, each coordination of benefits data element contains notes<br />
	specifying when a particular data element is used.<br />
	    ii. Comment: The majority of commenters supported the selection of<br />
	the ASC X12N 837 for the coordination of benefits exchange standard.<br />
	Some commenters believe that the decision to conduct COB in a certain<br />
	manner is a business decision and not within the scope of HIPAA. Others<br />
	would like all health plans to be required to participate in COB<br />
	exchange using the plan to plan model in which the health care provider<br />
	supplies the primary insurer with information needed for the primary<br />
	insurer to then submit the claim directly to the secondary insurer.<br />
	Several commenters stated that the plan to plan model would be quite<br />
	costly and should be closely evaluated before being adopted at a<br />
	national level.<br />
	    Concern was expressed that if the standard COB transaction were<br />
	sent to a health plan that does not conduct COB transactions, the<br />
	health plan would reject the standard COB transaction because it<br />
	contained COB information.<br />
	    Response: Coordination of Benefits can be accomplished in two ways,<br />
	either between health plans and other payers (for example, an auto<br />
	insurance company), or from a health care provider to a health plan or<br />
	other payer. The choice of model is up to the health plan.<br />
	    Under this rule health plans are only required to accept COB<br />
	transactions from other entities, including those that are not covered<br />
	entities, with which they have trading partner agreements to conduct<br />
	COB. Once such an agreement is in place, a health plan may not refuse<br />
	to accept and process a COB transaction on the basis that it is a<br />
	standard transaction. For example, a health plan receives a standard<br />
	ASC X12N 837 transaction from a health care provider with which it has<br />
	a COB trading partner agreement. If the health plan is not the primary<br />
	payer, it must accept and process the COB information to adjudicate the<br />
	claim. If the health plan has decided to conduct COB transactions with<br />
	another payer, it must accept and store the COB information to use in a<br />
	COB transaction with the other payer. If the health plan is the primary<br />
	payer and does not have a trading partner agreement with the secondary<br />
	payer, then it may simply dispose of the COB information and leave the<br />
	COB activity up to the health care provider.<br />
	    If a health plan electronically conducts COB with another health<br />
	plan it must do so using the standard transaction. A health care<br />
	provider that chooses to conduct COB electronically with a health plan<br />
	must do so using the standard transaction. A COB transmission between a<br />
	health care provider and a payer that is not a health plan would not be<br />
	subject to the requirements of this rule; nor would the transmission of<br />
	a COB transaction from a health plan to another payer that is not<br />
	another health plan.<br />
	    d. Transaction Standard for Health Care Claim Status. In subpart N,<br />
	we proposed the ASC X12N 276/277 Health Care Claim Status Request and<br />
	Response, Version 4010, Washington Publishing Company, 004010X093 as<br />
	the standard for health care claim status.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on the Transaction Standard for Health Care<br />
	Claim Status</p>
<p>    The majority of commenters expressed support for the selected<br />
	standard.<br />
	    i. Of those comments we referred to ASC X12N, the work groups<br />
	determined that all 94 comments identified areas where the<br />
	implementation specification could be improved, and the appropriate<br />
	changes were made.<br />
	    ii. Comment: We received several comments questioning whether the<br />
	ASC X12N 277 ``Unsolicited Claims Status Request'' transaction will be<br />
	included as a HIPAA standard transaction.<br />
	    Response: The HIPAA transaction requirements do not include the ASC<br />
	X12N 277 ``Unsolicited Claims Status Request.'' We expect to consider<br />
	this transaction for adoption in a future regulation.<br />
	    iii. Comment: Several commenters questioned whether a health care<br />
	provider is mandated to use the ASC X12N 276 Health Care Claim Status<br />
	Request transaction.<br />
	    Response: A health care provider must use the ASC X12N 276 Health<br />
	Care Claim Status Request transaction when transmitting the transaction<br />
	electronically to a health plan. The health care provider has the<br />
	option to submit nonstandard transactions to a health care<br />
	clearinghouse for processing into the standard transaction and may of<br />
	course choose to submit transactions in paper form.<br />
	    iv. Comment: Several commenters questioned whether a health plan<br />
	will be required to respond to an ASC X12N 276 request from a health<br />
	care provider who did not have a business arrangement with the health<br />
	plan.<br />
	    Response: A health plan may not refuse to process a transaction<br />
	simply because it is a standard transaction. Whether a health plan may<br />
	refuse to process a transaction on other grounds may depend upon the<br />
	particular business agreements the health plan has with the sender.<br />
	Health plans may have contracts that require them to process out of<br />
	service area transactions. Use of a standard transaction does not<br />
	create a relationship or liability that does not otherwise exist. A<br />
	health plan would not be required by these rules to respond to such a<br />
	request from a health care provider with whom it does not have a<br />
	business arrangement.<br />
	    v. Comment: We received several comments relating to whether a<br />
	State or health plan will be required to support the ASC X12N 276/277<br />
	transactions if they are currently using another application to provide<br />
	this information.</p>
<p>[[Page 50337]]</p>
<p>    Response: All health plans, including state Medicaid plans, must<br />
	have the capability to accept, process, and send the ASC X12N 276/277<br />
	transactions.<br />
	    e. Transaction Standard for Enrollment and Disenrollment in a<br />
	Health Plan. In subpart O, we proposed the ASC X12N 834--Benefit<br />
	Enrollment and Maintenance, Version 4010, Washington Publishing<br />
	Company, (004010X095) as the standard for enrollment and disenrollment<br />
	in a health plan.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on the Transaction Standard for Enrollment and<br />
	Disenrollment in a Health Plan</p>
<p>    The majority of commenters expressed support for the selected<br />
	standard.<br />
	    i. Of those comments we referred to ASC X12N, the work groups<br />
	determined that 124 comments identified areas where the implementation<br />
	specification could be improved, and the appropriate changes were made.<br />
	    ii. Ten comments identified business needs that ASC X12N judged<br />
	could already be met within the current standard implementation<br />
	specification. Detailed information on how the current implementation<br />
	specifications can be used to meet these business needs has been<br />
	provided by ASC X12N at the Internet site in Sec. 162.920.<br />
	    iii. Twenty comments alleged technical or editorial errors in the<br />
	standard implementation specification. A technical review of these<br />
	issues was conducted by work groups within ASC X12N. The work groups<br />
	determined that the 20 comments identified areas where the<br />
	implementation specifications were in fact correct and that no changes<br />
	were needed. Changes to the implementation specification were not<br />
	required.<br />
	    iv. There was one comment which identified a business need that ASC<br />
	X12N judged could not be met directly within the current standard<br />
	implementation specification. The implementation specifications could<br />
	not be changed prior to the issuance of the final regulation because<br />
	the X12 standards development process for modifying standards could not<br />
	be completed in time. However, a review of the issue by the ASC X12N<br />
	work groups has identified a means of meeting the business need within<br />
	the existing implementation specification as an interim measure.<br />
	Organizations and individuals who submitted such comments are<br />
	encouraged to work with the DSMOs to submit a request to modify the<br />
	national standard.<br />
	    v. Comment: Several commenters said that health plans must be free<br />
	to accept enrollment data in non-standard formats if that option is<br />
	chosen by a sponsor. In the proposed rule we stated, we would require<br />
	health plans to use only the standard specified in Sec. 142.1502 (63 FR<br />
	25293). Commenters suggested that we not include the word ``only'' in<br />
	the final rule under health plan requirements. One commenter suggested<br />
	the addition of the following language to the rule: ``However, health<br />
	plans may require trading partners to use the standard transaction to<br />
	conduct business.''<br />
	    Response: We recognize that entities that are not covered under<br />
	HIPAA, such as sponsors of health plans, including employee welfare<br />
	benefit plans, are not required to use the HIPAA standards to perform<br />
	EDI with health plans. The proposed rule stated that health plans are<br />
	required to use only the standard specified in Sec. 142.1502 for<br />
	electronic enrollment and disenrollment in a health plan transactions.<br />
	Sponsors, one of the primary trading partners with whom the health<br />
	plans exchange enrollment and disenrollment in a health plan<br />
	transactions, were proposed to be excluded from the requirements. Our<br />
	reference to the requirements for health plans to accept ``only'' the<br />
	standard specified was intended to preclude health plans from using<br />
	data in formats other than the standard transaction when exchanging<br />
	transactions with entities named in the law. It was not intended to<br />
	impose requirements on sponsors. Thus, sponsors remain free to send<br />
	enrollment data in nonstandard format if they choose, and health plans<br />
	are free to accept the data.<br />
	    We expect that sponsors may voluntarily accommodate a health plan's<br />
	request to use the ASC X12N 834 by directly submitting the transaction<br />
	in standard format or by using a health care clearinghouse to translate<br />
	non-standard data into the standard transaction.<br />
	    vi. Comment: Several commenters said that the ASC X12N 834 should<br />
	not be used to collect demographic data for public health and health<br />
	data research. A number of other commenters said that the ASC X12N 834<br />
	should be used for this purpose. These commenters also recognized that<br />
	the demographic data collected by the ASC X12N 834, such as address,<br />
	could change frequently. Commenters noted that the data collected in<br />
	the ASC X12N 834 is needed by the enrolling entity so that it can<br />
	perform certain functions, such as determining the eligibility of a<br />
	person for enrollment into their offered health plan.<br />
	    Response: The ASC X12N 834 is used to enroll and disenroll<br />
	subscribers in a particular health plan, and demographic data are<br />
	included in the data content. The decision to include demographic data<br />
	as required data content was made through the ASC X12N 834 work group<br />
	following the usual standards development process. We support the<br />
	inclusion of such data in the implementation standard. The collection<br />
	of demographic data is a means of monitoring progress towards<br />
	eliminating disparities in health care for populations that<br />
	historically have experienced discrimination and differential treatment<br />
	based on factors such as race and national origin. We recognize the ASC<br />
	X12N 834 Benefit Enrollment and Maintenance transaction set as the most<br />
	favorable vehicle for collecting these data due to the mostly static<br />
	nature of demographic information. While the public health and health<br />
	research community does not currently have access to the enrollment<br />
	data, we support a secondary use of the ASC X12N 834 for public health<br />
	and health research. We see this as a mechanism for opening the lines<br />
	of communication between the health data research community and the<br />
	holders of the data.<br />
	    Current Departmental policy supports increasing the use of<br />
	demographic data for researching disparities in health care among<br />
	demographic groups. However, the research community generally does not<br />
	have access to the data collected by sponsors on the ASC X12N 834.<br />
	While the research community is not opposed to collecting demographic<br />
	data on the ASC X12N 834, they have requested that this data also be<br />
	collected on the ASC X12N 837. This request would make no change to the<br />
	ASC X12N 834 implementation specification. Most of the demographic data<br />
	in the ASC X12N 837 implementation specification is marked as not used.<br />
	As stated above, most of the demographic data in the ASC X12N 834 is<br />
	currently not available to the research community. The business needs<br />
	of the research community must be presented to the X12N 837 work group<br />
	for consideration in a future version of the implementation<br />
	specification.<br />
	    We recognize that the enrollment and disenrollment in a health plan<br />
	transaction was designed for use mainly by sponsors, but sponsors are<br />
	not required by HIPAA to use the standard. Additionally, the conditions<br />
	for use of the demographic data are stringent, as follows: ``This data<br />
	should only be transmitted when such transmission is required under the<br />
	insurance contract between the sponsor and payer and allowed by federal<br />
	and state regulations.'' Therefore, we would not expect to see a<br />
	widespread increase in</p>
<p>[[Page 50338]]</p>
<p>the collection of demographic data when these standards are implemented<br />
	for the first time. Nor would we expect that this arrangement would<br />
	provide public health and researchers with increased access to<br />
	demographic information because of the difficulty creating dependable<br />
	linkages between enrollment and encounter data.<br />
	    If demographic data were collected routinely, facilities would more<br />
	easily demonstrate compliance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of<br />
	1964, the nondiscrimination provisions of health and social services<br />
	block grant programs, and other program statutes and regulations which<br />
	prohibit discrimination on the basis of race or national origin.<br />
	    Therefore, the Department intends to work with the industry to<br />
	support efforts to revise future versions of the Health Care Claims or<br />
	Equivalent Encounter Information (ASC X12N 837) implementation<br />
	specification to allow collection of demographic data. We also support<br />
	conditions for collection of these data that are less stringent than<br />
	specified in the enrollment and disenrollment in a health plan<br />
	transaction implementation specification. Many claim transactions<br />
	cannot be linked to their respective enrollment data. Allowing<br />
	transmission of racial and ethnic data in both the enrollment and<br />
	disenrollment in a health plan and the claim transaction sets will<br />
	increase the probability that this important information is available<br />
	for utilization review, quality of care initiatives, disparity and<br />
	nondiscrimination monitoring, and research. The Secretary believes it<br />
	is critical to collect these data for the following reasons, all of<br />
	which are high priorities for the Department:</p>
<p>    &lt;bullet&gt; The need to measure racial and ethnic disparities in<br />
	type, volume and appropriateness of care received.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; The need to focus efforts in areas/populations/health<br />
	plans where there is evidence of disparities based on race and<br />
	national origin.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; The need to monitor progress towards eliminating<br />
	disparities in health and health care.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; The need to monitor and enforce statutes and<br />
	regulations that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race and<br />
	national origin.</p>
<p>    We strongly recommend that the health care industry, including the<br />
	public health and research community, work with the appropriate content<br />
	committees and standard setting organizations to come to consensus on<br />
	an approach that will enhance the collection of demographic data as<br />
	well as be acceptable to the entire health care community. Departmental<br />
	representatives to these committees and organizations will participate<br />
	actively in this process, including articulation of the essential<br />
	business needs. A solution that has met the test of the consensus<br />
	process may be adopted as a national standard under HIPAA. The solution<br />
	should promote uniformity, comparability, and the increased<br />
	availability of demographic data for entities that depend upon this<br />
	data to monitor progress towards eliminating disparities in health<br />
	care. As we work with the data content committees and standard setting<br />
	organizations to reach consensus on an approach that will enhance the<br />
	collection of demographic data, the Department plans to explore<br />
	approaches, including demonstration projects, for promoting and<br />
	facilitating the voluntary collection of high quality demographic data<br />
	in the health care environment.<br />
	    vii. Comment: We received several comments regarding the role and<br />
	responsibility of State agencies' use of the ASC X12N 834. One<br />
	commenter stated we need to make it clear that if a State Health Agency<br />
	does not participate in the enrollment function, it is not required to<br />
	use the standard.<br />
	    Response: Health plans, including State health agencies, are not<br />
	required to conduct a standard transaction based solely on the fact<br />
	that it is a standard transaction.<br />
	    viii. Comment: Other commenters also asked what we recommend as a<br />
	process and structure for the submission of monthly capitation claims<br />
	from a managed care health plan to a State Medicaid agency.<br />
	    Response: We interpret ``process and structure'' to mean<br />
	implementation specification and standard transaction. Monthly<br />
	capitation claims from a managed care organization (MCO) to a State<br />
	Medicaid Agency do not fall within the rules we have established for<br />
	transactions between health plans. The transaction does not meet the<br />
	definition of a health care claim or equivalent encounter information<br />
	transaction. It does not need to be conducted as a standard<br />
	transaction.<br />
	    ix. Comment: Another commenter said that an interface between a<br />
	State and the State's processing associate, specifically for data<br />
	entry, should not be required to be in standard format.<br />
	    Response: We agree. In this scenario, data entry does not fall<br />
	within any of the definitions for standard transactions. Consequently,<br />
	the communication for data entry purposes does not need to be in<br />
	standard format.<br />
	    x. Comment: Several commenters said that a State Medicaid program<br />
	is excepted from using the ASC X12N 834 when contracting with a managed<br />
	care health plan because it is functioning as a sponsor.<br />
	    Response: A State Medicaid program is acting as a sponsor and is<br />
	excepted from the HIPAA standard requirements only when purchasing<br />
	coverage for its employees. The State Medicaid program is not acting as<br />
	a sponsor when enrolling Medicaid recipients in contracted managed care<br />
	health plans, and thus is not excepted from the law.<br />
	    xi. Comment: Several commenters said that the ASC X12N 834 should<br />
	not apply to the State ``buy-in'' process.<br />
	    Response: The transmission between a State Medicaid Agency and HCFA<br />
	for the purpose of buy-in is outside of the scope of this requirement.<br />
	State buy-in, the process by which State Medicaid programs pay only the<br />
	Medicare premium for certain categories of dually eligible individuals,<br />
	is essentially a Medicaid subsidy, required under Federal law, of<br />
	Medicare insurance. This transaction is neither an enrollment and<br />
	disenrollment in a health plan nor a health plan premium payment<br />
	transaction. It is a unique transaction created solely for the purpose<br />
	of the buy-in program. States use a unique flat-file and coding<br />
	structure for transmitting to HCFA a list of Medicaid beneficiaries who<br />
	are already enrolled in Medicare whose income level entitles them to<br />
	participate in the buy-in program for that month. HCFA then creates an<br />
	internal billing file with accretions and deletions for each state. A<br />
	paper billing notice, reflecting the total amount of premiums owed by<br />
	the state for that month, is mailed to the state. The Medicaid agency<br />
	sends premium payment to HCFA via Federal Wire to Treasury. No<br />
	electronic health plan premium payment transaction occurs between HCFA<br />
	and the Medicaid agency.<br />
	    f. Transaction Standard for Eligibility for a Health Plan. In<br />
	subpart P, redesignated in this rule as subpart L, we proposed the ASC<br />
	X12N 270--Health Care Eligibility/Benefit Inquiry and ASC X12N 271--<br />
	Health Care Eligibility/Benefit Response, Version 4010, Washington<br />
	Publishing Company, (004010X092) as the standard for eligibility for a<br />
	health plan.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on the Transaction Standard for Eligibility for<br />
	a Health Plan</p>
<p>    The majority of commenters expressed support for the selected<br />
	standard.<br />
	    i. Of those comments we referred to ASC X12N, the work groups<br />
	determined that 224 comments identified areas where the implementation<br />
	specification</p>
<p>[[Page 50339]]</p>
<p>could be improved, and the appropriate changes were made.<br />
	    ii. Eleven comments identified business needs that ASC X12N judged<br />
	could already be met within the current standard implementation<br />
	specification. Detailed information on how the current implementation<br />
	specifications can be used to meet these business needs has been<br />
	provided by ASC X12N at the Internet site in Sec. 162.920.<br />
	    iii. Seven comments alleged technical or editorial errors in the<br />
	standard implementation specification. A technical review of these<br />
	issues was conducted by work groups within ASC X12N. The work groups<br />
	determined that the 7 comments identified areas where the<br />
	implementation specifications were in fact correct and that no changes<br />
	were needed. Changes to the implementation specification were not<br />
	required.<br />
	    iv. There were another 10 comments which identified business needs<br />
	that ASC X12N judged could not be met directly within the current<br />
	standard implementation specification. The implementation<br />
	specifications could not be changed prior to the issuance of the final<br />
	regulation because the X12 standards development process for modifying<br />
	standards could not be completed in time. However, a review of the<br />
	issues by the ASC X12N work groups has identified a means of meeting<br />
	the business needs within the existing implementation specification as<br />
	an interim measure. Organizations and individuals who submitted such<br />
	comments are encouraged to work with the DSMOs to submit a request to<br />
	modify the national standard.<br />
	    v. Comment: We received one individual comment requesting changes<br />
	to a set of codes which were not maintained by X12 or by a Federal<br />
	agency, but were maintained by an external code source maintaining<br />
	body.<br />
	    Response: All code sources external to the X12 standard are listed<br />
	in section C of the implementation specifications. All of these code<br />
	sources have a mechanism for modifying their codes. The contact listed<br />
	in the X12 code source list can provide detailed information regarding<br />
	the process for updating their codes. The X12N subcommittee can also<br />
	assist entities in determining how to contact an external code source<br />
	maintenance body in order to request changes to the codes. Code sets<br />
	not listed in the external code set appendices in the implementation<br />
	specifications fall within X12N jurisdiction and are maintained through<br />
	that organization's data maintenance procedures, in conjunction with<br />
	the DSMOs.<br />
	    vi. Comment: Several commenters recommended that we include the<br />
	NCPDP telecommunications Standard 3.2 for the pharmacy service sector<br />
	eligibility inquiries. One commenter said that this is the only<br />
	automated eligibility inquiry allowed for use by pharmacy providers. A<br />
	commenter said that it uses the transaction (the NCPDP<br />
	telecommunications Standard 3.2) for the pharmacy service sector for<br />
	both claim and eligibility transactions. Finally, additional commenters<br />
	suggested that there is no business need that should force health care<br />
	providers to move to the ASC X12N 270/271 transaction for the pharmacy<br />
	service sector for eligibility inquiries. It was stated that thousands<br />
	of eligibility transactions are performed each month by pharmacies and<br />
	health plans using the NCPDP telecommunications Standard 3.2.<br />
	Furthermore, there is no benefit in moving to the ASC X12N 270/271 for<br />
	pharmacy eligibility inquiries since the NCPDP telecommunications<br />
	Standard 3.2 is already fully supported.<br />
	    Response: We agree with the commenter that eligibility and<br />
	enrollment are integral to the NCPDP Telecommunications Standard named<br />
	in the proposed rule for retail pharmacy claims. We name the NCPDP<br />
	Telecommunications Standard 5.1 and the NCPDP Batch Standard as the<br />
	standard for patient eligibility and coverage information within the<br />
	retail pharmacy sector since the eligibility information is part of the<br />
	NCPDP standard. We have added this requirement to Sec. 162.1202.<br />
	    vii. Comments: Several commenters suggested that the ASC X12N 270/<br />
	271 Eligibility Roster implementation specification for eligibility for<br />
	a health plan should be adopted as a HIPAA standard. One commenter<br />
	suggested that the description of the roster implementation is<br />
	incorrect in that it states that the roster is a separate part of the<br />
	270/271. The commenter went on to explain that the roster is<br />
	essentially the same transaction as that being recommended for response<br />
	to an X12N 270 inquiry, but the implementation specification has<br />
	different values in some of the segments so that the X12N 271 response<br />
	can be sent without an associated inquiry, and so that the hierarchy of<br />
	benefits can be more fully described. It was also suggested that the<br />
	example of a health plan sending the X12N 270/271 roster to alert a<br />
	hospital about forthcoming admissions was not representative of the<br />
	functionality of the roster. The commenter also stated that there are<br />
	health care providers who currently use the X12N 270/271 electronic<br />
	roster implementation, and it was misleading to use the term ``not<br />
	recommended'' in connection with the roster implementation<br />
	specification. Additionally, the commenter stated that it is incorrect<br />
	to say that the roster implementation specification is not millennium<br />
	compliant and that the standards development process for the<br />
	implementation specification is not completed.<br />
	    Response: We agree that a more precise description of the roster<br />
	functionality would be to refer to it as another implementation rather<br />
	than another part of the standard. Although the current version of this<br />
	implementation specification is millennium compliant and complete, this<br />
	was not true at the time the proposed rule was written. Thus, we did<br />
	not recommend the use of the ASC X12N 270/271 to provide requests for<br />
	eligibility. Another implementation of the ASC X12N 271 is designed to<br />
	handle requests for eligibility ``rosters,'' which are essentially<br />
	lists of entities--subscribers and dependents, health care providers,<br />
	employer groups, health plans--and their relationships to each other.<br />
	For example, this transaction might be used by a health plan to submit<br />
	a roster of patients to a health care provider in order to designate a<br />
	primary care physician.<br />
	    The eligibility inquiry and response is the only implementation<br />
	proposed under HIPAA for eligibility for a health plan. The<br />
	implementation of the HIPAA standards will be a great undertaking and<br />
	at this time we are limiting the transactions to those identified in<br />
	the proposed rule. In addition, entities who move eligibility<br />
	information in a roster format may do so using any available format,<br />
	including the ASC X12N 270/271 roster implementation. After the<br />
	implementation specification for the roster function is complete and<br />
	approved by an accredited standard setting organization, we recommend<br />
	that a request for adopting the new standard be submitted to the DSMOs.<br />
	See Sec. 162.910 for the process to request new standards.<br />
	    viii. Comment: Several commenters recommended that the Interactive<br />
	Health Care Eligibility/Benefit Inquiry (IHCEBI) transaction set and<br />
	its companion, the Interactive Health Care Eligibility/Benefit Response<br />
	(IHCEBR) transaction set, should also be adopted.<br />
	    Response: The IHCEBI/IHCEBR is based on UNEDIFACT syntax, not ASC<br />
	X12N syntax. At the time of the development of the proposed rule, the<br />
	syntax used was a version subsequently modified by UNEDIFACT, resulting<br />
	in the need to reformat the messages into the modified syntax before<br />
	they could</p>
<p>[[Page 50340]]</p>
<p>be adopted by the UNEDIFACT body. Therefore, there was no uniform<br />
	implementation specification developed for these standards. After<br />
	consideration, we decided that, where possible, the transactions to be<br />
	named in the proposed rule should have a uniform syntax structure. This<br />
	was possible for all transactions; ASC X12N transactions were chosen<br />
	because they met the criteria of having implementation specifications<br />
	and having the same basic syntax structure. The NCPDP standards also<br />
	met the criteria, and each transaction is designed using the same<br />
	syntax structure. If, in the future, a millennium compliant interactive<br />
	eligibility for a health plan transaction standard is approved by an<br />
	ANSI accredited standards setting organization and an implementation<br />
	specification exists, we shall consider it for adoption as a HIPAA<br />
	standard.<br />
	    ix. Comment: We received one comment that suggested we clarify that<br />
	the eligibility response sent by a health plan is not the equivalent of<br />
	a prior authorization of services, and does not guarantee coverage of a<br />
	rendered service.<br />
	    Response: We believe that the purpose and scope of the ASC X12N<br />
	270/271 is clearly defined in the ASC X12N 270/271 Health Care<br />
	Eligibility Benefit Inquiry and Response implementation specification.<br />
	An eligibility response sent by a health plan is not the equivalent of<br />
	a prior authorization of services and does not guarantee coverage of a<br />
	rendered service. Furthermore, the function of prior authorization of<br />
	services is explicitly defined in the ASC X12N 278, Health Care<br />
	Services Review--Request for Review and Response implementation<br />
	specification, which is the recommended standard for this transaction.<br />
	    x. Comment: One commenter suggested that we clarify the<br />
	requirements to clearly state that while health plans must implement<br />
	the ASC X12N 270/271 Eligibility Request/Response, they are not<br />
	required to respond to all requests sent in the ASC X12N 270.<br />
	    Response: We do not agree. A health plan may not reject a standard<br />
	transaction because it contains information the health plan does not<br />
	want. This principle applies to the data elements of all transactions<br />
	in this rule. Health plans must accept a complete ASC X12N 270 and must<br />
	respond with all applicable responses that are included in the ASC X12N<br />
	271. If health plans can arbitrarily respond or not respond to a<br />
	standard transaction, then the cost saving effect of using the<br />
	standards will be blunted by a requirement to negotiate aspects of<br />
	every transaction with every trading partner.<br />
	    xi. Comment: One commenter said that the ASC X12N 270 transaction<br />
	requires an ASC X12N 271 response to every record, a one-to-one<br />
	correspondence. The commenter recommended that the one-to-one response<br />
	be negotiable between the parties that have a contract to exchange<br />
	information.<br />
	    Response: A one-to-one correspondence to every record is not<br />
	required. The ASC X12N 270/271 transaction sets were built so that<br />
	trading partners could use them in real time or batch mode. We agree<br />
	that negotiation must occur between trading partners (including<br />
	clearinghouses/switches) regarding the processing limits (i.e., file<br />
	size, transmission speeds).<br />
	    g. Transaction Standard for Health Plan Premium Payments. In<br />
	subpart Q, we proposed the ASC X12N 820--Payment Order/Remittance<br />
	Advice, Version 4010, Washington Publishing Company, (004010X061) as<br />
	the standard for health plan premium payments.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on the Transaction Standard for Health Plan<br />
	Premium Payments</p>
<p>    The majority of commenters expressed support for the selected<br />
	standard.<br />
	    i. Of those comments we referred to ASC X12N, the work groups<br />
	determined that 53 comments identified areas where the implementation<br />
	specification could be improved, and the appropriate changes were made.<br />
	    ii. One comment identified a business need that ASC X12N judged<br />
	could already be met within the current standard implementation<br />
	specification. Detailed information on how the current implementation<br />
	specifications can be used to meet these business needs has been<br />
	provided by ASC X12N at the Internet site in Sec. 162.920.<br />
	    iii. Six comments alleged technical or editorial errors in the<br />
	standard implementation specification. A technical review of these<br />
	issues was conducted by work groups within ASC X12N. The work groups<br />
	determined that the 6 comments identified areas where the<br />
	implementation specifications were in fact correct and that no changes<br />
	were needed. Changes to the implementation specification were not<br />
	required.<br />
	    iv. Comment: Several commenters said that health plans must be free<br />
	to accept premium payment data in non-standard formats if that option<br />
	is chosen by a sponsor. In the preamble to the proposed rule, we stated<br />
	that health plans must ``accept only the standard specified in<br />
	Sec. 142.1704.'' (63 FR 25295). Commenters suggested that we not<br />
	include the word ``only'' in the final rule under the health plan<br />
	requirements. One commenter suggested that we add language in the rule<br />
	to state: ``However, health plans may require trading partners to use<br />
	the standard transaction to conduct business.''<br />
	    Response: We recognize that entities such as sponsors perform EDI<br />
	with health plans. The proposed rule stated that health plans are<br />
	required to use only the standard specified in Sec. 142.1702 for<br />
	electronic health plan premium payments. Sponsors, one of the primary<br />
	trading partners with whom the health plans exchange health plan<br />
	premium payment transactions, were proposed to be excluded. Our<br />
	reference to the requirements for health plans to accept ``only'' the<br />
	standard specified was intended to preclude health plans from using<br />
	data in formats other than standard when conducting transactions that<br />
	are standard transactions. It was not intended to impose requirements<br />
	on sponsors. Thus, sponsors remain free to send health plan premium<br />
	payments in nonstandard format if they choose, and health plans are<br />
	free to accept the data.<br />
	    We expect that sponsors may voluntarily accommodate a health plan's<br />
	request to use the ASC X12N 820 by directly submitting the transaction<br />
	in standard format, or by using a health care clearinghouse to<br />
	translate non-standard data into the standard format.<br />
	    v. Comment: One commenter said that Version 3040 is the most widely<br />
	accepted version of the ASC X12N 820 in the financial community and,<br />
	therefore, recommended its adoption. The commenter reasoned that by<br />
	setting the minimum version at 3040, The Secretary would greatly<br />
	increase the likelihood of successful implementation since it is<br />
	currently in use for transmitting premium payments.<br />
	    Response: We did not recommend version 3040 because it was not<br />
	millennium ready.<br />
	    vi. Comment: Several commenters, including the Department of the<br />
	Treasury, said that the ASC X12N 820 should not be named as a payment<br />
	order format for use by Treasury-disbursed Federal agencies since they<br />
	use Federal implementation conventions and Treasury payment formats<br />
	that may not be compatible with this standard. All Federal payment<br />
	formats disbursed by these agencies must go through a commercial<br />
	financial institution prior to delivery of the payment to the<br />
	recipient. It was stated a distinction needs to be made in regard to<br />
	the function of the</p>
<p>[[Page 50341]]</p>
<p>X12N 820. It is used as a ``payment order'' and a ``remittance advice''<br />
	delivery.<br />
	    Response: The ASC X12N 820 is an appropriate format for use by all<br />
	covered entities and is designed to provide the information needed to<br />
	process a payment of health insurance premiums from an employer or<br />
	other sponsor of health insurance to a health plan. If a Federal agency<br />
	is a covered entity and conducts a transaction adopted under this part<br />
	with another covered entity electronically, the transaction must be<br />
	conducted as a standard transaction. If the other entity is not a<br />
	covered entity, of course, the standard transaction need not be used<br />
	unless the Federal agency is a health plan and the other entity<br />
	requests the standard transaction.<br />
	    This standard is quite flexible with respect to transfers of funds.<br />
	The implementation specification for the ASC X12N 820 contains two<br />
	parts, a mechanism for the transfer of dollars and one for the transfer<br />
	of information about the payment. It allows these two parts to be<br />
	transmitted separately. Consistent with the implementation guide,<br />
	actual payment may be sent in a number of different, equally acceptable<br />
	ways, including check and several varieties of electronic funds<br />
	transfer, as long as the detailed information describing the payment is<br />
	transmitted to the health plan using the ASC X12N 820 directly or<br />
	indirectly (through a health care clearinghouse or financial<br />
	institution). When the transfer of funds is part of paying a health<br />
	care premium the ACH transaction may continue to be used as a valid<br />
	part of an ASC X12N 820 transaction where the other part of the<br />
	transaction is sent to the health plan. Although these standard<br />
	transactions allow transmission of one or both parts through a<br />
	financial institution, they do not require both parts to be sent to the<br />
	financial institution, and the financial institution is not required by<br />
	this regulation to accept or forward such transactions. The Department<br />
	of the Treasury has confirmed that this standard does not conflict with<br />
	their requirements for disbursements.<br />
	    vii. Comment: One commenter asked whether a sponsor must use the<br />
	4010 version of the ASC X12N 820.<br />
	    Response: Section 1172 of the Act identifies the entities required<br />
	to comply with the HIPAA standards. Sponsors are not included in this<br />
	provision. If sponsors choose to use the ASC X12N 820, we strongly<br />
	encourage that they use the version of the standard named in this rule.<br />
	    h. Transaction Standard for Referral Certification and<br />
	Authorization. In subpart R, redesignated as subpart M, we proposed the<br />
	ASC X12N 278--Health Care Services Review--Request for Review and<br />
	Response, Version 4010, Washington Publishing Company, (004010X094) as<br />
	the standard for referral certifications and authorizations.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on the Transaction Standard for Referral<br />
	Certification and Authorization</p>
<p>    The majority of commenters expressed support for the selected<br />
	standard.<br />
	    i. Of those comments we referred to ASC X12N, the work groups<br />
	determined that 146 comments identified areas where the implementation<br />
	specification could be improved, and the appropriate changes were made.<br />
	    ii. Thirteen comments identified business needs that ASC X12N<br />
	judged could already be met within the current standard implementation<br />
	specification. Detailed information on how the current implementation<br />
	specifications can be used to meet these business needs has been<br />
	provided by ASC X12N at the Internet site in Sec. 162.920.<br />
	    iii. Three comments alleged technical or editorial errors in the<br />
	standard implementation specification. A technical review of these<br />
	issues was conducted by work groups within ASC X12N. The work groups<br />
	determined that the 3 comments identified areas where the<br />
	implementation specifications were in fact correct and that no changes<br />
	were needed. Changes to the implementation specification were not<br />
	required.<br />
	    iv. There were another 76 comments which identified business needs<br />
	that ASC X12N judged could not be met directly within the current<br />
	standard implementation specification. The implementation<br />
	specifications could not be changed prior to the issuance of the final<br />
	regulation because the X12 standards development process for modifying<br />
	standards could not be completed in time. However, a review of the<br />
	issues by the ASC X12N work groups has identified a means of meeting<br />
	the business needs within the existing implementation specification as<br />
	an interim measure. Organizations and individuals who submitted such<br />
	comments are encouraged to work with the DSMOs to submit a request to<br />
	modify the national standard.<br />
	    v. Comment: Several commenters requested that we need to make clear<br />
	that if a state health agency does not authorize referrals it is not<br />
	required to use the standard.<br />
	    Response: If a state health agency does not conduct referral<br />
	certification and authorization, then the health plan is not required<br />
	to support this transaction based solely on the fact that the<br />
	transaction is one named as a HIPAA transaction. However, we note that<br />
	most commercially available software packages are designed to support a<br />
	suite of transactions. We anticipate that vendors will offer suites for<br />
	all HIPAA transactions, which may encourage health plans to support<br />
	this specific transaction.<br />
	    vi. Comment: Several commenters recommended that we include the<br />
	Inquiry and Response and Notification implementations of the ASC X12N<br />
	278.<br />
	    Response: The Request for Review and Response is the only<br />
	implementation proposed under HIPAA for referral certification and<br />
	authorization. We are not accommodating this request, because at the<br />
	time of the development of the proposed rule, the standards development<br />
	process for the ASC X12N Inquiry and Response and Notification<br />
	implementation specifications was incomplete and not supported by an<br />
	accredited standard setting organization. The implementation of the<br />
	HIPAA standards will be a great undertaking and at this time we are<br />
	limiting the transactions to those identified in the proposed rule.<br />
	Entities who use Inquiry and Response and Notification implementations<br />
	may do so using any available format, including the ASC X12N 278<br />
	implementations until such time as we may adopt a standard for Inquiry<br />
	and Response and Notification through regulation. After the<br />
	implementation specification for these functions is complete and<br />
	approved by an accredited standard setting organization, we encourage a<br />
	request to test a proposed revision to the standard be submitted to the<br />
	Secretary (see Sec. 162.940).</p>
<p>G. Compliance Testing</p>
<p>    Proposal Summary: We identified three levels of testing that are<br />
	typically performed in connection with the adoption and implementation<br />
	of the proposed standards and their required code sets:</p>
<p>    &lt;bullet&gt; Level 1--developmental testing, the testing done by the<br />
	standards setting organization during the development process<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Level 2--validation testing, the testing of sample<br />
	transactions to see whether they are written correctly.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Level 3--production testing, the testing of a<br />
	transaction from a sender through the receiver's system.</p>
<p>    Pilot production--Because of the billions of dollars that change<br />
	hands each year as a result of health care claims processing, we stated<br />
	that we believe the industry should sponsor</p>
<p>[[Page 50342]]</p>
<p>pilot production projects to test transaction standards that are not in<br />
	full production prior to the effective date for adoption of the initial<br />
	HIPAA standard formats.<br />
	    We also stated that it would be useful to all participants if pilot<br />
	production projects and the results of pilot projects were posted on a<br />
	web site for all transactions. For the health care claims or equivalent<br />
	encounter information transactions, we believe that posting pilot<br />
	production projects and the results of pilot projects on a web site<br />
	must be mandatory.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on Compliance Testing</p>
<p>    Comment: The majority of commenters recommended that the posting of<br />
	pilot production results should be voluntary, not mandatory.<br />
	    Several commenters suggested that all HIPAA standards projects be<br />
	posted and that the government should provide funding or at least<br />
	publicly advertise the results of all compliance testing projects. It<br />
	was suggested that the Electronic Healthcare Network Accreditation<br />
	Commission (EHNAC) could host a bulletin board or web site in which<br />
	tests results could be published.<br />
	    Several commenters asked whether entities providing validation<br />
	testing will need to be certified. They stated that validation testing<br />
	is only useful if certification is obtained. Several commenters<br />
	recommended that the Secretary endorse the Standard Transaction Format<br />
	Compliance System (STFCS) process established by EHNAC for validation<br />
	testing, suggesting that EHNAC certification lends credibility and<br />
	reliability to the process. However, other commenters wanted<br />
	certification for compliance to be voluntary.<br />
	    Several commenters recommended that WEDI, X12, or some other group<br />
	further develop the various types of testing situations which might<br />
	occur as well as tentative protocols for handling such tests.<br />
	    Several commenters wanted the testing processes thoroughly defined<br />
	prior to the implementation of the standards. For example, commenters<br />
	wanted costs defined, and testing time frames, scheduling, and turn<br />
	around times established. Others wanted to gain experience using the<br />
	transactions first and allow testing to be done on a good faith effort<br />
	basis.<br />
	    The majority of commenters recommended that all of the transactions<br />
	should be tested and any necessary modifications made prior to the<br />
	publication of the final rule and as early as possible.<br />
	    Response: We agree that posting of results for any HIPAA standard<br />
	should be voluntary. As long as the transactions are successfully<br />
	implemented in production, posting of the results is more of a<br />
	marketing, advertising, and sales issue than a technical concern.<br />
	    Since the HIPAA provisions do not require the Secretary to certify<br />
	compliance with HIPAA standards, the Secretary is not conducting<br />
	certification reviews or recognizing private organizations that have<br />
	decided to conduct such reviews. Therefore, any certification of<br />
	commercial entities performing validation testing will remain in the<br />
	private domain and be voluntary. While receivers of transactions are<br />
	likely to test whether a vendor that claims to be HIPAA compliant is,<br />
	in fact, producing compliant transactions, this is a matter of business<br />
	practice, and such tests are not being mandated in this rule.<br />
	    The HIPAA provisions require the Secretary to adopt standards<br />
	developed by standards setting organizations (SSOs) whenever possible.<br />
	With this approach, the standards developed by a consensus of the<br />
	health care industry will be implemented by the health care industry at<br />
	large. Consistent with this approach, the Secretary is relying on those<br />
	in the health care arena to come forward and test the designated<br />
	standards. All of the standards have completed levels 1 and 2 of<br />
	testing. Some of the standards have completed all three levels of<br />
	testing and are in full production (for example, the NCPDP standard and<br />
	many of the data code sets). We urge the health care industry to work<br />
	in concert with the DSMOs. Health plans and vendors currently define<br />
	their own test plans and conduct their own tests. We urge health plans<br />
	to develop pilot test plans using the implementation specifications<br />
	specified by the Secretary.<br />
	    Certain types of testing are commonly conducted by organizations<br />
	that transmit transactions electronically. These include site, unit,<br />
	integration, connectivity, end to end, and parallel testing. ASC X12N<br />
	has agreed to solicit private individuals, organizations, vendors and<br />
	other interested parties to facilitate these types of testing and<br />
	document their results and conditions on the X12N web site. Many<br />
	government agencies will test and post results as well. X12N intends to<br />
	continue to review and refine its testing process to make sure it<br />
	continues to meet the requirements of the health care industry.</p>
<p>H. Enforcement</p>
<p>    Proposal Summary: Under the statute, failure to comply with<br />
	standards may result in monetary penalties. The Secretary is required<br />
	by statute to impose penalties of not more than $100 per violation on<br />
	any person who fails to comply with a standard, except that the total<br />
	amount imposed on any one person in each calendar year may not exceed<br />
	$25,000 for violations of a single standard for a calendar year.<br />
	    We did not propose any enforcement procedures, but we will do so in<br />
	a future Federal Register document.<br />
	    We did, however, solicit input on appropriate mechanisms to permit<br />
	independent assessment of compliance.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on Enforcement</p>
<p>    1. Comment: We received many comments regarding the timing of<br />
	enforcement. Several commenters stated an enforcement and mediating<br />
	body is needed immediately. The majority of commenters called for the<br />
	delay of enforcement. Commenters also requested that HCFA permit<br />
	initial compliance testing of these standard transactions to be based<br />
	on good faith. It was also recommended that actual testing for<br />
	compliance occur later. Several commenters said that we should not<br />
	assess penalties in the first year. A few commenters requested that we<br />
	establish a body to which a health care provider may go for help.<br />
	Others requested advance notice of enforcement procedures.<br />
	    A few commenters requested that we define the terms ``person'' and<br />
	``violation,'' as well as provide examples of violations and provide<br />
	descriptions of how penalties will apply. Several commenters requested<br />
	that fines apply only to health plans and health care clearinghouses,<br />
	and not to health care providers.<br />
	    One commenter suggested that the Electronic Healthcare Network<br />
	Accreditation Commission (EHNAC) be endorsed as a process for<br />
	establishing compliance in using the standards.<br />
	    Response: The proposed rule, like the other three notices of<br />
	proposed rulemakings (NPRMs) published in 1998 to implement the<br />
	administrative simplification requirements of HIPAA, did not contain<br />
	provisions for compliance and enforcement. We are, therefore, not<br />
	adopting any compliance or enforcement provisions in this final rule.<br />
	As we indicated in the proposed rule, we will be developing a separate<br />
	compliance and enforcement rule to establish compliance and enforcement<br />
	procedures for these and other</p>
<p>[[Page 50343]]</p>
<p>administrative simplification requirements. We plan to publish an NPRM<br />
	requesting public comments next year, and to subsequently issue a final<br />
	compliance and enforcement regulation that will become effective prior<br />
	to the first compliance dates of these rules. We anticipate addressing<br />
	the specific issues of compliance, timing, appeals, and technical<br />
	assistance in the projected compliance and enforcement rulemaking. We<br />
	also plan to address the practicability of using some type of self-<br />
	certification or certification by external parties to demonstrate<br />
	compliance with some or all of the requirements.<br />
	    We encourage covered entities, trading partners and business<br />
	associates to address issues relating to compliance and resolution of<br />
	disputes concerning use of these standards in their trading partner<br />
	agreements. The following resources are available to assist with<br />
	questions of interpretation and application of specific transactions<br />
	standards and implementation guides:<br />
	    For assistance in resolving a particular X12N issue, submit the<br />
	issue to the X12N Insurance list serve. To subscribe to the X12N<br />
	Insurance list serve, go to <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.x12.org">http://www.x12.org</a>.<br />
	    For additional information regarding the interpretation of the<br />
	NCPDP standards, go to <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/leaving.cgi?from=leavingFR.html&amp;log=linklog&amp;to=http://www.ncpdp.org">http://www.ncpdp.org</a>.<br />
	    The Department will develop a plan for providing technical<br />
	assistance to covered entities and others affected by the rule. We plan<br />
	to announce the availability of technical assistance through the<br />
	Federal Register, various web sites including the Department's<br />
	Administrative Simplification web site and the web sites identified<br />
	above, and through other means.<br />
	    2. Comment: Several commenters suggested we address educational<br />
	activities. It was stated that the changes required by the<br />
	administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA cannot be implemented<br />
	without a concerted and sustained educational effort.<br />
	    Response: We agree that HIPAA educational activities are critical<br />
	to the successful implementation of the standards. Industry<br />
	organizations, such as X12N have begun to provide education about<br />
	standard transactions. While not required by this rule, we encourage<br />
	health care clearinghouses and vendors to educate their customers as<br />
	well. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has scheduled a<br />
	series of regional training sessions for Medicare and Medicaid. They<br />
	have contracted with instructors who are nationally recognized experts<br />
	in EDI standards. Medicare and Medicaid have also published health care<br />
	provider education articles. Copies of these articles may be obtained<br />
	from local HCFA contractors.</p>
<p>I. New and Revised Standards</p>
<p>    We proposed a procedure for entities to follow if they want a new<br />
	standard. We also proposed a procedure that we would follow if a<br />
	standard needs to be revised.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on the Procedures for New and Revised Standards</p>
<p>1. New Standards for Existing Transactions<br />
	    Proposal Summary: To encourage innovation and promote development<br />
	of new standards, we proposed to develop a process that would allow an<br />
	organization to request a replacement of any adopted standard or<br />
	standards.<br />
	    An organization could request the replacement of an adopted<br />
	standard by requesting a waiver from the Secretary of HHS to test a new<br />
	standard. The organization, at a minimum, would have to demonstrate<br />
	that the new standard clearly offers an improvement over the adopted<br />
	standard. If the organization presented sufficient documentation that<br />
	supported testing a new standard, we wanted to be able to grant the<br />
	organization a temporary waiver to test the new standard while<br />
	remaining in compliance with the law. We did not intend to establish a<br />
	process that would allow organizations to request waivers as a<br />
	mechanism to avoid using an adopted standard.<br />
	    Comment: Most commenters supported the proposed process for testing<br />
	proposed revisions to standards. Several commenters preferred the word<br />
	``exemption'' instead of the word ``waiver,'' since it makes it clearer<br />
	that standards should generally not be waived. It was also suggested<br />
	that the cost benefit analysis should apply to the report developed<br />
	after the pilot study and not to the application phase of the temporary<br />
	exemption. Another suggestion was to have organizations wishing to test<br />
	a new standard submit written concurrences from trading partners who<br />
	will participate in testing the new standard. Those organizations must<br />
	also assure they will continue to support existing standards during the<br />
	testing process.<br />
	    Response: We agree that standards should generally not be<br />
	``waived.'' We agree with the substance of commenters concern and<br />
	therefore, we have added language in Sec. 162.940 to include the<br />
	suggested changes and are using the term ``exception'' to indicate that<br />
	the standard generally applies, but that a specific group of entities<br />
	are not required to follow all or a portion of one standard to permit<br />
	testing of proposed revisions. While industry practice uses 1 year for<br />
	testing, we have decided to grant an exception for a period not to<br />
	exceed 3 years. We decided to adopt a 3 year time frame because we<br />
	believe this period gives us flexibility in determining the extent to<br />
	which testing may be required. We emphasize that a new standard is a<br />
	standard that is not one of the transactions defined in this rule,<br />
	including code sets. A revised standard is specific to the version of<br />
	the Secretary's standard and the implementation specifications.</p>
<p>2. Revised Standards/Proposals for Additional Standards</p>
<p>    Proposal Summary: We recognized the very significant contributions<br />
	that the traditional data content committees (DCCs) (the NUCC, the<br />
	NUBC, the ADA, and the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs<br />
	(NCPDP)) have made to the content of health care transactions over the<br />
	years and, in particular, the work they contributed to the content of<br />
	the proposed standards in the proposed rule. We proposed that these<br />
	organizations be designated to play an important role in the<br />
	maintenance of data content for standard health care transactions. We<br />
	proposed that these organizations, assigned responsibility for<br />
	maintenance of data content for standard health care transactions,<br />
	would work with X12N data maintenance committees to ensure that<br />
	implementation documentation is updated in a consistent and timely<br />
	fashion.<br />
	    We intended that the private sector, with public sector<br />
	involvement, would continue to have responsibility for defining the<br />
	data content of the administrative transactions. Both Federal agencies<br />
	and private organizations would continue to be responsible for<br />
	maintaining medical data code sets.<br />
	    a. Code Sets. Comment: Several health care systems, State agencies,<br />
	and insurance companies submitted comments agreeing that all coding<br />
	systems adopted as HIPAA standards should have an open updating<br />
	process, e.g., the responsible panel or committee of experts should be<br />
	representative of a broad cross-section of the relevant stake-holders;<br />
	all panel or committee members should have voting privileges, any<br />
	interested party should be eligible to submit proposals for additions<br />
	and changes, and the meetings should be announced in advance and should<br />
	be open to the public. They made specific criticisms of the current<br />
	processes used</p>
<p>[[Page 50344]]</p>
<p>for updating HCPCS (for example, no representation from the commercial<br />
	companies that actually pay claims), CPT, and ``The Code'' (dental).<br />
	    Commenters made several favorable comments about the current<br />
	process for obtaining public input and making decisions regarding<br />
	changes to ICD-9-CM.<br />
	    Response: We agree that the current process for making decisions<br />
	regarding updates to the ICD9-CM provides a useful model, and we<br />
	consider it to be probably the most workable approach for code sets.<br />
	This process encourages broad input but gives final decision-making<br />
	authority to the organizations responsible for developing the code<br />
	sets. A purely democratic approach, under which all changes are put to<br />
	a vote by the members of a particular standards committee and any<br />
	organization eligible to become a voting member, is likely to have<br />
	significant drawbacks for routine code set maintenance, e.g., delays in<br />
	updates, inability to make changes that are essential for a minority of<br />
	players, and changes in the code set that undermine its logical<br />
	structure. We received clarification from the developers of the ``The<br />
	Code'' (dental) and the CPT-4 about their update processes that will be<br />
	in place at the time these standards are implemented. We are confident<br />
	that it will be a workable open updating process.<br />
	    In response to the comments regarding the process for updating<br />
	HCPCS, we have reviewed our current policies and procedures governing<br />
	the submission of requests from the public for revisions/changes to the<br />
	HCPCS. We have ensured that existing procedures are easy to use and are<br />
	adequately communicated to the public. The current process for updating<br />
	the HCPCS includes the following features:</p>
<p>    &lt;bullet&gt; Identification of a central contact for information/<br />
	assistance regarding the process for submitting requests to modify<br />
	the coding system.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Advance notice of meeting agendas.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Identification of proposals submitted for coding<br />
	consideration.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Opportunity for public comment on the proposals.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Subsequent posting of coding changes for public<br />
	information.</p>
<p>    b. Transaction Standards. Comment: While most commenters supported<br />
	the proposal that the NUCC, NUBC, and the ADA be designated as the data<br />
	content committees (DCCs), several commenters opposed this proposal.<br />
	Commenters opposing designation of these bodies recommended that X12 be<br />
	named as the sole content body, pointing out that X12 is sufficiently<br />
	open to include views from the NUCC, NUBC, ADA and others. Some<br />
	commenters believe that the NUBC and NUCC do not adequately support nor<br />
	understand the health care providers they represent, and their<br />
	expertise is grounded in paper rather than electronic transactions.<br />
	Some commenters opposed selection of the ADA as it was perceived to<br />
	include inadequate non-health care provider representation for data<br />
	content issues. Others opposed the selection of the NUCC because it was<br />
	perceived as non-representative of the full range of health care<br />
	professionals.<br />
	    Other commenters stated there should not be a separate DCC for each<br />
	X12N transaction because a change in one transaction may impact<br />
	another. Another commenter stated X12 should be allowed to have a<br />
	permanent voting member on each DCC that is selected, and that X12<br />
	should retain responsibility for the maintenance of the data dictionary<br />
	for the selected transactions. Some commenters recommended that the<br />
	NUCC, NUBC, and ADA continue to interact with X12N, and did not see a<br />
	need for government oversight of the process. They felt that the<br />
	current process works well and should not be tampered with.<br />
	    Several commenters recommended that these multiple content bodies<br />
	should have consistent protocols and should implement them uniformly.<br />
	They recommended that the committees have meetings open to the public<br />
	with cross-industry representation, including input from the public<br />
	sector. Commenters also suggested that the committees operate under an<br />
	equitable consensus process, and that they sign a memo of understanding<br />
	(MOU) with the Secretary to ensure due process, close cooperation with<br />
	standard setting organizations, and balanced voting. They asked that<br />
	the data maintenance and change process for the standards be clearly<br />
	described in the final rule. A request was also made for the<br />
	establishment of an oversight group responsible for arbitrating<br />
	conflicting decisions reached by different data content committees;<br />
	handling appeals on data content committee decisions; coordinating data<br />
	requests involving more than one data content committee; and centrally<br />
	coordinating with X12.<br />
	    Some commenters recommended that while NUCC, NUBC and ADA have a<br />
	DCC role, this role should focus primarily on claims information. These<br />
	committees were not perceived as having experience with enrollment,<br />
	eligibility, premium payment, remittance, claim status, and referral<br />
	issues. It was recommended that X12N or another industry forum serve as<br />
	the data content committee for these other standards.<br />
	    A few commenters asked that, as an SSO, the NCPDP's role in the DCC<br />
	process be addressed in the final rule. A number of comments were also<br />
	submitted concerning appointment of a DCC for the attachments<br />
	transaction standard under HIPAA.<br />
	    Response: Only the NUCC, NUBC, ADA, NCPDP and X12N expressed an<br />
	interest in having a role as a DCC for the X12N standards selected for<br />
	the HIPAA transactions in this rule. To address the issues raised by<br />
	these comments, representatives of the Secretary have contacted many<br />
	officers and members of the NUCC, NUBC, ADA, NCPDP, X12N, WEDI and<br />
	other organizations. Discussions centered on the following issues:<br />
	Preferences; operational models; control and coordination issues; time<br />
	frames for incorporation for a request for a data change in<br />
	implementation specifications; membership composition; internal<br />
	processing rules and voting requirements; willingness to serve;<br />
	expectations; public participation; and other details.<br />
	    In Sec. 162.910, we state that the Secretary may designate an<br />
	organization(s) to maintain the standards, propose modifications to<br />
	existing standards, and propose new standards to the National Committee<br />
	on Vital Health Statistics (NCVHS). These organizations, which can<br />
	include DCCs (for example, the NUCC) and SSOs (for example, X12N), also<br />
	receive and process requests for the creation of a new standard, or the<br />
	modification of an existing standard. In the proposed rule, we referred<br />
	to these organizations strictly as DCCs and SSOs. In this final rule,<br />
	we call the organizations that are designated under Sec. 162.910<br />
	Designated Standard Maintenance Organizations (DSMOs). The DSMOs are a<br />
	subset of DCCs and SSOs, and we have published a notice announcing<br />
	these organizations elsewhere in this Federal Register.<br />
	    We recognize that not every medical specialty or health plan may<br />
	consider itself to have sufficient voting representation or weight<br />
	within the DSMOs. Therefore, the DSMOs will operate a process which<br />
	allows open public access for requesting changes to the standards,<br />
	consideration of the request by each organization, coordination and<br />
	final agreement among the DSMOs on the request, an appeals process for<br />
	a requester of a proposed modification if the final decision is not<br />
	satisfactory. The DSMO's process will also allow for an expedited<br />
	process to address content needs of the industry, and address new<br />
	Federal legislation within the implementation date</p>
<p>[[Page 50345]]</p>
<p>requirements of the law. Recommendations will be presented by the DSMOs<br />
	to the NCVHS, where appropriate. Change requests can be submitted via a<br />
	designated web site that will be made available to the public.<br />
	    The DSMOs will also improve coordination among themselves,<br />
	publicize open meetings, and, in some cases, expand voting membership.<br />
	The DSMOs understand that their appointments as DSMOs will be<br />
	reconsidered if they fail to perform, coordinate, and respond to the<br />
	public as described in Sec. 162.910.</p>
<p>J. Proposed Impact Analysis</p>
<p>    Proposal Summary: On the same day that we proposed the standards<br />
	that are the subject of this final rule, we also published a rule to<br />
	propose the national provider identifier (NPI)(63 FR 25320). In that<br />
	rule, we set forth an impact analysis that covered the collective<br />
	impact of most of the administrative simplification standards<br />
	(including standards for security and the unique identifiers, but not<br />
	including the costs of privacy standards, which will be detailed in the<br />
	privacy final rule) since estimating the impact of them individually<br />
	would be misleading. We did provide an impact analysis that was<br />
	specific to each standard, but the impact analysis assessed only the<br />
	relative impact of implementing a given standard.</p>
<p>Conclusion of impact analysis of proposed rules</p>
<p>    We estimated that the impact of the proposed rules would result in<br />
	net savings to health plans and health care providers of $1.5 billion<br />
	during the first five years; use of the standards would continue to<br />
	save the industry money.</p>
<p>Comments and Responses on the Proposed Impact Analysis--General</p>
<p>1. Cost/Benefit Analysis<br />
	    a. Comment: Several commenters questioned the validity of the<br />
	projected cost of implementing electronic data interchange standards<br />
	(EDI) because it was based largely on data compiled in 1992 by WEDI.<br />
	The WEDI report projected implementation costs ranging between $5.3<br />
	billion and $17.3 billion with annual savings projected to be between<br />
	$8.9 billion and $20.5 billion. It was stated the WEDI report projected<br />
	the costs as being much higher. One reason the projected cost was<br />
	inflated by WEDI is because the HIPAA compliance process will be spread<br />
	out over a longer period of time than is provided for in the statute.<br />
	The HIPAA standards will require additional data elements, will replace<br />
	local coding schemes with national ones, and will affect many business<br />
	process associated with health plans and health care providers.<br />
	Therefore, the modifications to existing systems will be extensive and<br />
	time consuming, with a high degree of uncertainty regarding the<br />
	projected benefits. The estimates in this section need to be<br />
	recalculated taking into account more current figures and trends.<br />
	    Response: The cost estimates used in the proposal cost analysis<br />
	were based largely on data compiled in 1992 but updated to reflect 1998<br />
	costs. The report developed by WEDI projects implementation costs<br />
	ranging from between $5.3 billion and $17.3 billion with annual savings<br />
	projected to be between $8.9 billion and $20.5 billion. The Department<br />
	has obtained more current data and information on costs and market<br />
	trends, and these data are used in the final cost analysis. It is an<br />
	accurate statement that the HIPAA standards would create new data<br />
	elements and would remove local coding schemes in favor of national<br />
	ones. However, some of the factors that would cause health care<br />
	providers or health plans to incur a substantial financial burden have<br />
	been spread out over a longer period of time than was suggested by the<br />
	commenters. The removal of local coding schemes, for example, will not<br />
	occur immediately, but will occur over a two year time period following<br />
	the publication of this final rule. A longer time frame will spread out<br />
	the implementation costs and therefore will not pose as great a burden<br />
	as previously expected. With regard to Medicaid specifically, some of<br />
	the unusual service type codes (i.e. taxi services) will also not have<br />
	to be removed.<br />
	    a. Comment: One commenter stated that although the methodology used<br />
	in the WEDI report served as a basis for determining the cost/benefit<br />
	analysis explored within the proposed rule, the concept of cost-benefit<br />
	analysis is vague and resembles something of a ``black art.'' Because<br />
	of the large number of variables and the complexity of the assumptions<br />
	with which health care providers and health plans will have to deal in<br />
	implementing of HIPAA, it is hard to determine the actual advantages or<br />
	disadvantages for the HIPAA standards as a group.<br />
	    Response: It is difficult to assess the cost and benefits of the<br />
	HIPAA standards with absolute certainty. While there are no standard<br />
	methods for doing these analyses, an effort was made not to overstate<br />
	the benefits or understate the costs of implementation. The WEDI report<br />
	is the most extensive industry analysis of the effects of EDI standards<br />
	available.<br />
	    c. Comment: Several commenters stated that the sweeping changes<br />
	that HIPAA mandates make it difficult to do a precise cost-benefit<br />
	analysis. One commenter noted that additional actuarial studies should<br />
	be done, with the cooperation of health plans and health care<br />
	providers. The commenter also stated that pilot programs should be<br />
	initiated in different geographic regions in order to identify the<br />
	feasibility of the scope and time frames for HIPAA implementation.<br />
	Another commenter stated that they believed that the costs associated<br />
	with the NPI and subsequent system changes required of covered entities<br />
	may run into the six-figure range, which is not mentioned in the<br />
	proposed rule.<br />
	    Response: It is difficult to assess the cost and benefits of the<br />
	HIPAA standards with complete accuracy. This is particularly true<br />
	considering that these changes have no historical precedent. While<br />
	initiating pilot programs in each region and conducting further actuary<br />
	studies may provide detailed analysis, it is neither feasible nor<br />
	practical. The time frame for implementation, as mandated by the<br />
	statute, precludes this. The analysis given was derived from aggregate<br />
	figures that provided the most realistic impact in terms of costs and<br />
	savings. NPI costs are currently being evaluated by the Department of<br />
	Health and Human Services and will be published in the final rule<br />
	regarding the NPI.<br />
	    d. Comment: Several commenters expressed concern with the cost-<br />
	benefit analysis in regard to Medicaid. One commenter stated that<br />
	dismantling 80% of the Medicaid systems that process EDI in order to<br />
	accommodate the HIPAA standards will result in a loss. Furthermore, it<br />
	was noted that the use of a dual health care provider assignment number<br />
	will continue to be used in their Medicaid Management Information<br />
	System (MMIS) which would mitigate any cost savings benefit.<br />
	    Response: The rationale behind the Impact Analysis was to evaluate<br />
	the cost and savings for the health care system as a whole. While the<br />
	cost to a specific health plan or health care provider may outweigh the<br />
	benefits to that entity, our analysis showed overall savings to the<br />
	health care system. There is a greater possibility for savings in the<br />
	future due to use of a common identifiers, the increased simplicity of<br />
	processing transactions, and the overall coordination of benefits. We<br />
	do not anticipate an immediate need to overhaul an entire system, but<br />
	we do expect some implementation costs</p>
<p>[[Page 50346]]</p>
<p>which have been factored into the analysis. Translation software may be<br />
	purchased at reasonable cost thus avoiding major reprogramming. (Since<br />
	the translators will not affect the issues raised, they should have no<br />
	impact.) Health plans and health care providers may also use a health<br />
	care clearinghouse to perform the translation. We believe entities that<br />
	use health care clearinghouses will see costs reduced or at least<br />
	stabilized.<br />
	    We do acknowledge that the $1 million cost estimate for redesigning<br />
	a State Medicaid system to accommodate these standards may have been<br />
	too low. Further analysis indicated that costs to individual State<br />
	Medicaid programs may be in the $10 million range. While the cost in<br />
	each State may differ somewhat, the Federal government will pay<br />
	approximately 75-90 percent of these costs, leaving the costs to each<br />
	State near the $1-2.5 million range. We believe that long-term benefits<br />
	to States will outweigh the costs.<br />
	    e. Comment: Several commenters stated that many of the numbers<br />
	associated with our analysis were based upon calculations using<br />
	aggregate data instead of evaluating the standards individually. It was<br />
	stated that a separate assessment of each standard would yield more<br />
	realistic results because the staged release of the proposed rules led<br />
	to the impression that the HIPAA standards will be implemented in a<br />
	staggered fashion. Assessing the cost of implementing each standard<br />
	independently would not yield inflated costs, but would yield numbers<br />
	that would approximate what the actual costs will be. A number of<br />
	commenters suggested different approaches to make the rules more<br />
	effective and beneficial, as well as make the implementation more<br />
	orderly. One such approach was that the implementation of all of the<br />
	standards be postponed until all of the proposed rules are published<br />
	(e.g., a single harmonized implementation date based on the date of the<br />
	last published rule), perhaps with the exception of those standards<br />
	that have been deferred such as the First Report of Injury and the<br />
	Patient Identifier. Another would be to break down the implementation<br />
	into phases. The first phase would be full implementation of the<br />
	standards within 2 years of the publication dates of the final rule for<br />
	identifiers for health care providers, employers, and health plans.<br />
	Phase 2 would be the full implementation of all the transactions<br />
	including attachments and the security rule within 2 years of the<br />
	publication of the last of these final rules. Phase 3 would be the<br />
	implementation of the individual identifier within 2 years after the<br />
	publication of the identifier final rule. The last recommended approach<br />
	is the simultaneous publication of the final rules for the health care<br />
	provider, health plan and employer identifiers; the transaction sets,<br />
	including the First Report of Injury and the attachments; and the<br />
	security regulations. This method would ensure that health care<br />
	providers and vendors will have the changes necessary for both internal<br />
	application systems and external communications.<br />
	    Response: While the original plan was to implement all of the<br />
	standards at the same time, the realities of the regulatory process and<br />
	the impact of millennium activities will cause a variety of effective<br />
	dates. This rule is the first to be published, with other rules for<br />
	standards following shortly. It is difficult to assess the cost-benefit<br />
	of each standard individually because there are costs and benefits<br />
	associated with the interaction of many of the standards. It is more<br />
	realistic to assess cost-benefits of standardizing EDI in general,<br />
	using aggregate data to give a more complete picture, than attempting<br />
	to measure the impact of each standard. Many of the numbers associated<br />
	with this analysis are based upon calculations using aggregate data.<br />
	2. Implementation Costs<br />
	    a. Comment: One commenter noted that a translator does not address<br />
	the problems health care providers will have in relating their health<br />
	care provider type to State billing systems or in billing local codes.<br />
	    Response: The local code issue has been addressed in this rule. The<br />
	health care provider type issue will be addressed in the final rule for<br />
	the National Provider Identifier. Translators will allow health care<br />
	providers to accommodate most of the business process changes required<br />
	by this rule.<br />
	    b. Comment: Several commenters stated that we greatly<br />
	underestimated the implementation costs. They claimed that the costs<br />
	associated with translator devices were not included, and upgrades to<br />
	EDI systems could continue annually and could involve multiple<br />
	standards which would not be classified as short-term costs.<br />
	Furthermore, it was stated that all methods of complying with the HIPAA<br />
	requirements will have costs associated with them that will not be<br />
	limited to the first three years of implementation. There will be<br />
	ongoing costs for training and support that will surpass the estimates<br />
	given by the impact analysis. In addition, third-party administrators<br />
	opting for in-house programming have already spent large sums of money<br />
	to prepare for administrative simplification before compliance is<br />
	mandated. Some commenters fear that health care clearinghouses will<br />
	potentially charge high yearly fees and high transaction fees due to an<br />
	increase in demand. They believe high fees will not be eliminated after<br />
	the three year time frame has ended and the costs could be passed on to<br />
	health care providers, health plans and purchasers. Finally, while the<br />
	proposed rule proposed the elimination of data entry clerks and mailing<br />
	costs, it did not account for software engineers that will be needed to<br />
	redesign or reprogram a system. The personnel costs associated with<br />
	these individuals could be 4-6 times as high as a data entry clerk.<br />
	    Response: These comments raise several important issues. The first<br />
	one deals specifically with the cost of a translator. The cost of<br />
	translators, in fact, were included in estimating upgrade costs. In<br />
	addition, some of these EDI standards would have occurred without the<br />
	passage of HIPAA due to the demands of the health care industry. Many<br />
	of the other costs mentioned, such as costs for training and support,<br />
	would have also occurred whether or not standards were mandated, so we<br />
	do not believe them relevant to the impact of this rule. The financial<br />
	data given in the Impact Analysis was based on the most reasonable<br />
	estimates available and took into account the implementation costs,<br />
	including software engineering, that will be incurred during the first<br />
	three years. This justifies the categorization of expenditures<br />
	associated with the HIPAA standards as one-time or short-term. All of<br />
	the costs associated with a system upgrade have been included in the<br />
	implementation time-frame noted in the Proposed Rule. Finally,<br />
	redesigning or reprogramming work that will be done in accordance with<br />
	this regulation has been included in the implementation costs. While it<br />
	is an aggregate amount, it provides the most realistic estimate based<br />
	on available data. Health care clearinghouse charges can be expected to<br />
	decrease due to market forces.<br />
	    c. Comment: One commenter noted that the statement that increased<br />
	EDI claims submission has the potential to improve cash flow because<br />
	those who use EDI get their payments faster runs counter to HCFA's<br />
	decision to instruct its contractors to increase the waiting period<br />
	before they issue checks to a health care provider. It was stated that<br />
	HCFA's decision may cause cash flow problems for physicians and mute<br />
	the benefits of increased efficiency that are supposed to be generated<br />
	by electronic claims submission. It was also stated</p>
<p>[[Page 50347]]</p>
<p>that HCFA needs to refrain from taking actions that run counter to<br />
	realizing the benefits envisioned by Congress and specified in the<br />
	statute.<br />
	    Response: Health care providers will share in many benefits of<br />
	administrative simplification. HCFA is fully supportive of<br />
	administrative simplification and will examine this issue carefully to<br />
	ensure that there is no conflict. We have not instructed our<br />
	contractors to change the waiting period for payment of Medicare<br />
	claims, be they paper or electronic.<br />
	    d. Comment: One commenter stated that before the industry begins to<br />
	use any of the transactions in production, the National Provider System<br />
	(NPS) should be fully loaded and tested. It was recommended that all<br />
	health care providers be enumerated and NPS data should be ready for<br />
	use on all transaction sets required under HIPAA within the first six<br />
	months of the implementation period.<br />
	    Response: The proposed rule acknowledged that there is a strong<br />
	likelihood that implementation problems will result in rejected<br />
	transactions, manual exception processing, payment delays, and requests<br />
	for additional information. Therefore, the transaction formats allow<br />
	for the use of current/legacy identifiers until the NPS is fully<br />
	implemented. As recommended by a number of commenters, we have<br />
	concluded that it would be best to implement the transactions and make<br />
	sure they are implemented correctly before we begin requiring the<br />
	identifiers be to used in the transactions.<br />
	    e. Comment: Several commenters representing Medicaid have raised<br />
	the notion that costs, both initial and long-term, will be far more<br />
	expensive than originally anticipated. For example, one commenter<br />
	stated that they currently use intelligent health care provider numbers<br />
	with extensive hard coding and editing. Changing their MMIS would<br />
	require changing the basic logic of 11 subsystems and 3 million lines<br />
	of code. Another commenter estimated they will spend $6.5 million to<br />
	implement the HIPAA standards despite the fact that 78% of their claims<br />
	are already submitted electronically.<br />
	    Response: The Impact Analysis generalized that standardization can<br />
	be expected to lead to cost-effectiveness and avoidance of burden (see<br />
	also the response to the comment in J. 1. d. in this section of the<br />
	preamble). A number of States have provided cost estimates which<br />
	indicate that the $1 million figure given may be too low. We do not<br />
	disagree with this assertion, but believe that the costs will be spread<br />
	out over a longer period of time than expected, and will not be as<br />
	severe as anticipated. The costs to States to implement the HIPAA<br />
	standards were carefully considered, but were not the only factor<br />
	considered in developing the individual standards. A number of guiding<br />
	principles (see B. Guiding Principles for Standard Selection in section<br />
	IV. of this preamble) were followed and the overall adequacy and<br />
	acceptance of these standards is dependent upon the standards meeting<br />
	these guiding principles.<br />
	    f. Comment: Several commenters expressed concern that the<br />
	implementation time frame falls within the time period required to make<br />
	millennium and Medicare Balanced Budget Act (BBA) changes. It was<br />
	stated that the industry was given little flexibility in determining<br />
	the most cost-effective way to implement the HIPAA standards.<br />
	    Response: The Impact Analysis states that health care providers<br />
	have considerable flexibility in determining how and when to accomplish<br />
	changes in their systems to accommodate the HIPAA standards. Due to the<br />
	longer than expected time to publish this final rule, the<br />
	implementation time frame will fall beyond millennium changes and most<br />
	BBA changes. Therefore, it is still possible to evaluate the most cost-<br />
	effective approach.<br />
	    g. Comment: One commenter stated that the impact analysis did not<br />
	specifically mention who would provide the translator software that<br />
	would be integrated into an existing system. If small physician<br />
	practices are using older ``legacy'' type systems, they may not be able<br />
	to create an interface with a translator that would accept the standard<br />
	data. A complete system overhaul would be extremely costly to these<br />
	specific health care provider groups.<br />
	    Response: The Impact Analysis did not specifically mention who<br />
	would provide the translator software that would be integrated into an<br />
	existing system because we expect such software to be readily available<br />
	on the open market. However, it did include estimates from the WEDI<br />
	reports which were updated to reflect the current costs for small<br />
	practices to convert their systems in order to use the standard<br />
	formats. These estimates indicate an overall cost savings for physician<br />
	practices. The most efficient way for small physician practices to<br />
	circumvent high implementation costs may be to use a health care<br />
	clearinghouse. If health care providers cannot create an interface with<br />
	a translator, they have the option to use a health care clearinghouse.<br />
	This would avoid the need to overhaul older type systems in order to<br />
	accommodate the HIPAA standards. Furthermore, the costs for vendors and<br />
	health care clearinghouses should be reduced due to the use of national<br />
	EDI standards as well as the NPI. The overall homogeneity of these EDI<br />
	formats should significantly reduce the high costs associated with the<br />
	processing of different electronic claims formats. In turn, this would<br />
	allow vendors and health care clearinghouses to provide services at<br />
	lower costs, which should enable savings to be passed on to health care<br />
	providers. In this regard, we also anticipate that market competition<br />
	should tend to keep costs down.<br />
	    h. Comment: One commenter believed that as part of a 1999<br />
	Presidential proposal, Medicare will charge one dollar for each paper<br />
	Medicare claim that a physician submits. The commenter stated that this<br />
	unfairly undermines a physician's ability to continue to submit paper<br />
	claims.<br />
	    Response: Medicare has not instituted a user fee for paper claims.<br />
	3. Benefits of Increased EDI for Health Care Transactions<br />
	    Comment: One commenter stated that the impact analysis should<br />
	factor in the cost of dismantling existing electronic interchange<br />
	systems. It was also stated that health care providers may move from<br />
	electronic to paper submission if they feel that the costs and burdens<br />
	associated with the new standards are too great.<br />
	    Response: There is no need to dismantle entire systems. Rather,<br />
	provisions need to be made to accommodate the new standards. We believe<br />
	that the benefits health care providers are currently realizing through<br />
	EDI will continue and will increase with the adoption of these<br />
	standards. Unlike current practices which compel health care providers<br />
	to use multiple formats when sending and receiving, health care<br />
	providers will only need to use one format for each HIPAA standard when<br />
	they send and receive. If health care providers are unwilling to<br />
	upgrade their EDI system, they have the option of using a health care<br />
	clearinghouse, or reverting to paper claim submission.<br />
	4. The Role of Standards in Increasing the Efficiency of EDI<br />
	    Comment: One commenter stated that there are many factors affecting<br />
	a health care provider's decision as to when to convert to EDI. Thus,<br />
	the idea that a health care provider may decide to delay conversion to<br />
	EDI until it is ``cost-effective'' is made moot by other forces</p>
<p>[[Page 50348]]</p>
<p>affecting a health care provider's decision making process.<br />
	    Response: Health care providers must use the standards if they wish<br />
	to do business electronically. While other factors will impact their<br />
	decision to do business electronically, we believe that the HIPAA<br />
	standards will produce cost savings and efficiencies in EDI which<br />
	should help convince health care providers of the benefits of EDI.<br />
	    All known factors that may influence a health care provider's<br />
	decision were taken into account when the proposed rule was written and<br />
	published. However, other factors may arise that were not accounted<br />
	for. It is impossible to account for every possible scenario for every<br />
	health care provider. The Impact Analysis took into account factors<br />
	based on the data available at the time. These factors, which represent<br />
	a wide spectrum of possibilities, were included in the cost-<br />
	effectiveness figures and the overall decision making process.<br />
	5. Cost/Benefit Tables<br />
	    a. Comment: Several commenters representing Medicaid had a number<br />
	of comments regarding these tables. First, with respect to Table 1 (63<br />
	FR 25344) (see VI. Final Impact Analysis, I. Cost/Benefit Tables of<br />
	this preamble for the updated table) they stated it was difficult to<br />
	assess where Medicaid was represented or whether any other Federal<br />
	program was included. Second, regarding that same table, it was stated<br />
	that the method of allocating savings was imprecise and illogical when<br />
	consideration is given to existing EDI systems that will have to be<br />
	changed. For high end-users, the costs to convert will consume most of<br />
	the savings. Third, because so much of Medicaid is automated already,<br />
	the estimated savings that will offset 50% of the upgrade cost will be<br />
	less. The cost assumptions are also not inclusive of the numerous<br />
	operational activities associated with the possible role of the<br />
	enumerator. One Medicaid Agency specifically mentioned that they pay<br />
	their fiscal associate $.2672 to process any type of claim. They stated<br />
	that the savings estimates based on $1 per claim for health plans and<br />
	physicians and $.75 per claim for hospitals and other health care<br />
	providers does not relate to their experience.<br />
	    Response: Medicare and Medicaid program costs and savings were not<br />
	included in the table on cost and savings to health plans because the<br />
	Impact Analysis was done for private sector health plans only, as<br />
	required. Cost estimates were made using the WEDI report and may not be<br />
	specific to Medicaid or other State Agencies. They are also not<br />
	specific to any unique experience. The savings mentioned in the<br />
	analysis are based on overall utilization.<br />
	    b. Comment: Several commenters stated that the pharmacist<br />
	enumeration costs were underestimated. Table 2 (63 FR 25344) (see VI.<br />
	Final Impact Analysis, I. Cost Benefit/Tables of this preamble for the<br />
	updated table) lists 70,100 pharmacies; however, no data was included<br />
	regarding the number of pharmacists. There are about 200,000<br />
	pharmacists. It was stated that the enumeration costs should be<br />
	adjusted accordingly.<br />
	    Response: We did not enumerate pharmacists, because the pharmacy is<br />
	the entity that does most of the billing and, therefore, is the<br />
	appropriate unit for analysis.<br />
	    c. Comment: One commenter raised several questions regarding Table<br />
	4a (63 FR 25346), which shows relative savings and volume of other<br />
	transactions (note, Table 4a corresponds to Table 5 in VI. Final Impact<br />
	Analysis, I. Cost/Benefit Tables of this preamble): (1) Was the ASC<br />
	X12N 997 transaction included in the ``Claim'' transaction in Table 4a;<br />
	(2) was the ASC X12N 277 included in the ``Claims Inquiry''<br />
	transaction; (3) does the ``Remittance Advice'' include payment data<br />
	and Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) payment; (4) has allowance been<br />
	made for any charges by banks for passing on the payment data; (5) is<br />
	the ASC X12N 275 included in one of the transactions listed; and (6)<br />
	how was the ``Average Cost for Non-EDI Health Plans'' calculated?<br />
	    Response: (1) The ASC X12N 997 is not a HIPAA transaction standard<br />
	and was not included. (2) The ASC X12N 277 does represent a HIPAA<br />
	transaction standard and was included in the analysis. (3) The<br />
	``Remittance Advice'' includes payment data and EFT payment. (4) The<br />
	cost of the banks processing data was not included in the impact<br />
	analysis because the EFT process will remain the same under the<br />
	standards. Banks are not required to use the HIPAA standards; however,<br />
	most, if not all, are expected to continue to use the Automated<br />
	Clearinghouse (ACH) standard which they are now using for EFT (and<br />
	which would be compliant with these standards). (5) The ASC X12N 275<br />
	was not included in the transactions listed. (6) The cost to non-EDI<br />
	health plans was computed as follows: total entities  x  (1 - EDI %)<br />
	x  average upgrade cost  x  0.5.<br />
	    d. Comment: One commenter stated that more information is needed on<br />
	the methodology used to calculate the costs/benefits in order for each<br />
	hospital to model the cost/benefits.<br />
	    Response: The methodology for calculating the costs/benefits for<br />
	health care providers was derived from the WEDI report and was<br />
	mentioned at the beginning of the Impact Analysis. The WEDI report also<br />
	documents how that methodology was applied.<br />
	6. Quantitative Impacts of Administrative Simplification<br />
	    a. Comment: In regard to Medicaid, commenters noted that with the<br />
	mandatory nature of EDI rules, the obligation to coordinate ``who pays<br />
	when'' was not included (i.e., Medicaid is the payer of last resort).<br />
	It was stated that standardization of data and transactions alone will<br />
	not help unless health plans pass on those rules. Administrative<br />
	simplification could facilitate coordination of benefits by having a<br />
	standardized set of data that is known to all parties, along with<br />
	standardized name and address information that tells where to route<br />
	transactions.<br />
	    Response: We agree that standardization will facilitate<br />
	coordination of benefits by having in place a standardized set of data.<br />
	This is one of the goals of administrative simplification. The HIPAA<br />
	standards do require health plans to use the standard COB transaction<br />
	for exchanging COB with other health plans.<br />
	    b. Comment: Some comments stated that the administrative burden for<br />
	health plans may increase as more data validation occurs in a post-<br />
	adjudication environment. It was stated that the example of staff<br />
	translation of codes due to standardized codes was misleading, since<br />
	individuals must still perform coding actions in order to enter patient<br />
	data into the hospital information system or other patient data<br />
	systems.<br />
	    Response: The implementation of the HIPAA standards will actually<br />
	reduce the overall need for data validation as it will reduce the need<br />
	for clerical entry. Although there may still be individual manipulation<br />
	or translation of codes, it will be less labor intensive; this result<br />
	will be due to the replacement of multiple EDI formats with one set of<br />
	nationally accepted standards.<br />
	    c. Comment: One commenter stated that the cost to maintain a<br />
	proprietary health care provider file may remain basically the same or<br />
	may increase as there may be an increased need to validate data between<br />
	the proprietary file and the National Provider System database (NPS);<br />
	this result would more than offset any savings that may have been<br />
	realized through the elimination of other health care provider numbers.</p>
<p>[[Page 50349]]</p>
<p>    Response: When the NPI is implemented, there will be a one time<br />
	cost to entities to align their proprietary health care provider files<br />
	to NPS data and add the NPI to their files. Once the NPI has been<br />
	added, though, we would expect ongoing costs for several functions<br />
	(COB, health care provider monitoring, communications with health care<br />
	providers, etc.) to be reduced because of the uniform numbering system<br />
	and the elimination of health care provider enumeration activities by<br />
	individual health plans.<br />
	7. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis<br />
	    a. Comment: One commenter recommended that the statement ``cost<br />
	savings will be passed on to customers of health care clearinghouses<br />
	and billing agencies'' should be reworded to state that cost savings<br />
	``should'' be passed on rather than imply that they will. It is<br />
	possible that these savings won't be passed on because health care<br />
	clearinghouses may be in a position to profit from the increased demand<br />
	for their services. The possibility also exists that costs will<br />
	decrease, and as a result prices will drop to reflect these savings.<br />
	    Response: We believe that market forces will drive down costs, and<br />
	as a result savings will be passed on to customers of health care<br />
	clearinghouses and billing agencies.<br />
	    b. Comment: One commenter stated that there is no guarantee that<br />
	small health care providers will embrace EDI. There should be<br />
	information about educational campaigns and how that educational<br />
	outreach will occur.<br />
	    Response: The Impact Analysis acknowledges that not everyone will<br />
	move to the HIPAA standards and use EDI. However, since the catalyst<br />
	behind this statute was the health care industry, we expect that health<br />
	plans and others will recognize the benefits they can enjoy through<br />
	administrative simplification, and will educate health care providers<br />
	so that benefits will be realized.<br />
	8. Unfunded Mandates<br />
	    a. Comment: Several commenters stated that it is possible that a<br />
	portion of the costs which managed care organizations will incur due to<br />
	HIPAA will be passed onto the Medicaid program in the form of increased<br />
	capitation payments. It was stated that while the Secretary puts forth<br />
	a Cost Budget Office (CBO) analysis indicating that States ``have the<br />
	option to compensate by reducing other expenditures,'' they have first-<br />
	hand knowledge of the challenges associated with ``reducing''<br />
	expenditures associated with entitlement programs. Furthermore,<br />
	enrollment of Medicaid recipients into managed care programs does not<br />
	eliminate the need for fee-for-service claims processing under the new<br />
	standards. One commenter noted that $2 million is a conservative<br />
	estimate of the cost to a State to modify its MMIS to comply with the<br />
	HIPAA mandates. The improvements offered are geared towards EDI between<br />
	commercial health plans and their health care providers. Benefits of<br />
	increased EDI and health care provider enumeration accrue to all EDI<br />
	participants at the expense of the Medicaid program.<br />
	    Response: We do not agree that the benefits of EDI for the health<br />
	care community would increase at the expense of the Medicaid program.<br />
	We acknowledge that the implementation costs for each State may be<br />
	underestimated. However, the benefits of administrative simplification<br />
	should accrue to every health care entity, whether public or private.<br />
	The costs to the Medicaid program will be spread out over a longer<br />
	period of time than expected, which will mitigate any large financial<br />
	impact. Additional provisions were also included for specialized<br />
	delivery services. The Department will match 75-90% of the costs<br />
	associated with the MMIS and the new software that will be integrated<br />
	for the HIPAA standards. The long-term savings will offset<br />
	implementation costs. We recognize that fee-for-service claims<br />
	processing will continue.<br />
	    b. Comment: Several commenters stated that it may be an inaccurate<br />
	conclusion that the unfunded mandates of HIPAA will not result in<br />
	significant costs to State governments. In fact, it may cost States<br />
	between $2 and $10 million to restructure for HIPAA compliance.<br />
	Furthermore, the start-up costs will be high in order to align current<br />
	health care provider files with the NPS so that matches can be made.<br />
	Start-up costs will probably exceed $1 million per health plan. There<br />
	are also additional indirect costs which are not mentioned. Indirect<br />
	costs may arise from having to reorganize business functions and<br />
	possibly having to pay the implementation costs of health care<br />
	providers, health care clearinghouses and health plans.<br />
	    Response: We agree that the calculated costs may be underestimated<br />
	and the Impact Analysis does state that it is difficult to assess cost/<br />
	benefits of such a sweeping change. Many of the costs mentioned in the<br />
	comment are short-term costs. The long-term savings that will accrue<br />
	from administrative simplification will offset the short-term<br />
	expenditures. Each health care provider will have to determine how to<br />
	treat these initial costs until the savings begin to accrue.<br />
	    c. Comment: One commenter stated that many areas of the payment<br />
	processes are still done manually. Changes/upgrades to bulletin board<br />
	type systems that receive electronic billing data from health care<br />
	providers will also impact the costs of this unfunded mandate.<br />
	    Response: The costs associated with these bulletin board type<br />
	systems have been included in the estimated cost of system upgrades<br />
	mentioned in the Impact Analysis.</p>

	162.1601, 162.1701, and 162.1801.</p>
<p>V. Collection of Information Requirements</p>
<p>    Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), agencies are<br />
	required to provide a 30-day notice in the Federal Register and solicit<br />
	public comment on a collection of information requirement submitted to<br />
	the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. In<br />
	order to fairly evaluate whether an information collection should be<br />
	approved by OMB, section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA requires that we<br />
	solicit comment on the following issues:<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Whether the information collection is necessary and useful<br />
	to carry out the proper functions of the agency.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; The accuracy of the agency's estimate of the information<br />
	collection burden.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be<br />
	collected.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Recommendations to minimize the information collection<br />
	burden on the affected public, including automated collection<br />
	techniques.<br />
	    We are soliciting public comment on each of these issues for the<br />
	following sections of this document that contain information collection<br />
	requirements:<br />
	    In summary, each of the sections identified below require health<br />
	care plans, and/or health care providers to use the standards<br />
	referenced in this regulation for all electronically transmitted<br />
	standard transactions that require it on and after the effective date<br />
	given to it.</p>
<p>Subpart I--General Provisions for Transactions</p>
<p>Section 162.923 Requirements for covered entities</p>
<p>Section 162.925 Additional requirements for health plans</p>
<p>    Discussion: As referenced in the proposed rule, the emerging and<br />
	increasing use of health care EDI standards and transactions has raised<br />
	the issue of the applicability of the PRA. As such, we solicited<br />
	comment on whether a regulation that adopts an EDI standard used to<br />
	exchange certain information constitutes an information collection is<br />
	subject to the PRA. Public comments were presented which suggested that<br />
	the use of an EDI standard is not an information collection and under<br />
	the PRA. The Office of Management and Budget, however, has determined<br />
	that this regulatory requirement (which mandates that the private<br />
	sector disclose information and do so in a particular format)<br />
	constitutes an agency sponsored third-party disclosure as defined under<br />
	the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA).<br />
	    HIPAA mandates the Secretary to adopt standards that have been<br />
	developed, adopted, or modified by a standard setting organization,<br />
	unless there is no such standard, or unless a different standard would<br />
	substantially reduce administrative costs. OMB has concluded that the<br />
	scope of its review under the PRA would be limited to the review and<br />
	approval of this regulatory requirement, that is, the Secretary's<br />
	decision to adopt or reject an established industry standard, based on<br />
	the HIPAA criterion of whether a different standard would substantially<br />
	reduce administrative costs. For example, if OMB concluded under the<br />
	PRA that a different standard would substantially reduce administrative<br />
	costs as compared to an established industry standard, the Secretary<br />
	would be required to reconsider its decision under the HIPAA standards.<br />
	The Secretary would be required to make a new determination of whether<br />
	it is appropriate to adopt an established industry standard or whether<br />
	it should enter into negotiated rulemaking to develop an alternative<br />
	standard (section 1172(c)(2)(A)).<br />
	    The burden associated with these requirements, which is subject to<br />
	the PRA, is the initial one-time burden on the entities identified<br />
	above to modify their current computer system requirements. However,<br />
	the burden associated with the routine or ongoing use of these<br />
	requirements is exempt from the PRA as defined in 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2).<br />
	    Based on the assumption that the burden associated with HIPAA,<br />
	Title II systems modifications may overlap and the HIPAA standards<br />
	would replace the use of multiple standards, resulting in a reduction<br />
	of burden, commenters should take into consideration when drafting<br />
	comments that: (1) One or more of these standards may not be used; (2)<br />
	some of the these standards may already be in use by several of the<br />
	estimated entities; (3) systems modifications may be performed in an<br />
	aggregate manner during the course of routine business and/or; (4)<br />
	systems modifications may be made by contractors such as practice<br />
	management vendors, in a single effort for a multitude of affected<br />
	entities.<br />
	    As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of<br />
	1995, we have submitted a copy of this document to the Office of<br />
	Management and Budget (OMB) for its review of these information<br />
	collection requirements.<br />

	requirements, please e-mail comments to Paperwork@hcfa.gov (Attn:HCFA-<br />

<p>VI. Final Impact Analysis</p>
<p>A. Executive Summary</p>
<p>    Title II of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act<br />
	(HIPAA) provides a statutory framework for the establishment of a<br />
	comprehensive set of standards for the electronic transmission of<br />
	health information. Pursuant to this Title, the Department of Health<br />
	and Human Services published proposed regulations concerning electronic<br />
	transactions and code sets (May, 1998), national standard health care<br />
	provider identifier (May, 1998), national standard employer</p>
<p>[[Page 50351]]</p>
<p>identifier (June, 1998), security and electronic signature standards<br />
	(August, 1998), and standards for privacy of individually identifiable<br />
	health information (November, 1999).<br />
	    Currently, there are numerous electronic codes available in the<br />
	market. Without government action, a common standard might eventually<br />
	emerge as the result of technological or market dominance. However, the<br />
	uneven distribution of costs and benefits may have hindered the<br />
	development of a voluntary industry-wide standard. Congress concluded<br />
	that the current market is deadlocked and that the health care industry<br />
	would benefit in the long run if government action were taken now to<br />
	establish an industry standard. This approach, however, does entail<br />
	some risks. For example, whenever the government chooses a standard,<br />
	even one that is the best available at any point in time, the<br />
	incentives to develop a better standard may be diminished because there<br />
	is virtually no market competition and government-led standards often<br />
	take longer to develop than those developed as the result of market<br />
	pressures. The approach taken in this regulation is designed to<br />
	encourage and capitalize on market forces to update standards as needs<br />
	and technology change and have the government respond as quickly and<br />
	efficiently as possible to them.<br />
	    As discussed in the proposals, the regulations will provide a<br />
	consistent and efficient set of rules for the handling and protection<br />
	of health information. The framework established by these<br />
	administrative simplification regulations is sufficiently flexible to<br />
	adapt to a health system that is becoming increasingly complex through<br />
	mergers, contractual relationships, and technical and telecommunication<br />
	changes. Moreover, the promulgation of a final privacy standard will<br />
	enhance public confidence that highly personal and sensitive<br />
	information is being properly protected, and therefore, it will enhance<br />
	the public acceptance of increased use of electronic systems.<br />
	Collectively, the standards that will be promulgated under Title II can<br />
	be expected to accelerate the growth of electronic transactions and<br />
	information exchange in health care.<br />
	    The final Impact Analysis provides estimates based on more current<br />
	information and more refined assumptions than the original NPRM<br />
	analysis. Since the original estimates were made, some of the voluntary<br />
	development and investment in technology that was anticipated at the<br />
	time of the proposal was diverted or delayed because of Y2K concerns;<br />
	the investment is still expected but the timing of it has been delayed.<br />
	The analysis utilizes more current data and reflects refinements in<br />
	underlying assumptions based on the public comments and other<br />
	information that has been collected on market changes. In addition,<br />
	this analysis extended the time period for measuring costs and savings<br />
	from five years to ten years. Given that the HIPAA provisions require<br />
	initial expenses but subsequently produce a steady stream of savings, a<br />
	ten year analysis more accurately measures the impact of the<br />
	regulations.<br />
	    This final rule has been classified as a major rule subject to<br />
	Congressional review. The effective date is October 16, 2000. If,<br />
	however, at the conclusion of the Congressional review process the<br />
	effective date has been changed, we will publish a document in the<br />
	Federal Register to establish the actual effective date or to issue a<br />
	notice of termination of the final rule action.<br />
	    Therefore, the following analysis includes the expected costs and<br />
	benefits of the administration simplification regulations related to<br />
	electronic systems for ten years. Although only the electronic<br />
	transactions standards are being promulgated in this regulation, the<br />
	Department expects affected parties to make systems compliance<br />
	investments collectively because the regulations are so integrated.<br />
	Moreover, the data available to us are also based on the collective<br />
	requirements of the regulations; it is not feasible to identify the<br />
	incremental technological and computer costs for each regulation based<br />
	on currently available data. The Department acknowledges that the<br />
	aggregate impact analysis does not provide the information necessary to<br />
	assess the choice of specific standards.<br />
	    The costs of implementing the standards specified in the statute<br />
	are primarily one-time or short-term costs related to conversion. These<br />
	costs include system conversion/upgrade costs, start-up costs of<br />
	automation, training costs, and costs associated with implementation<br />
	problems. These costs will be incurred during the first three years of<br />
	implementation. Although there may be some ongoing maintenance costs<br />
	associated with these changes, vendors are likely to include these<br />
	costs as part of the purchase price. Plans and providers may choose to<br />
	upgrade their systems beyond the initial upgrade required by the rule<br />
	as technology improves over time. Since the rule only requires an<br />
	initial systems upgrade, the costs of future upgrades are not included<br />
	in the cost estimate of the rule. The benefits of EDI include reduction<br />
	in manual data entry, elimination of postal service delays, elimination<br />
	of the costs associated with the use of paper forms, and the enhanced<br />
	ability of participants in the market to interact with each other.<br />
	    In this analysis, the Department has used conservative assumptions<br />
	and it has taken into account the effects of the trend in recent years<br />
	toward electronic health care transactions. Based on this analysis, the<br />
	Department has determined that the benefits attributable to the<br />
	implementation of administrative simplification regulations will accrue<br />
	almost immediately but will not exceed costs incurred by health care<br />
	providers and health plans until after the second year of<br />
	implementation. After the second year, however, the benefits will<br />
	continue to accrue for an extended period of time. The total net<br />
	savings for the period 2002-2011 will be $29.9 billion (a net savings<br />
	of $13.1 billion for health plans, and a net savings of $16.7 billion<br />
	for health care providers). The single year net savings for the year<br />
	2011 will be $5.6 billion ($2.5 billion for health plans and $3.1<br />
	billion for health care providers). The discounted present value of<br />
	these savings is $19.1 billion over the ten years. These estimates do<br />
	not include the sizeable secondary benefits that are likely to occur<br />
	through expanded e-commerce resulting from standardized systems.<br />
	    In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this<br />
	rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p>B. Guiding Principles for Standard Selection</p>
<p>    The implementation teams charged with designating standards under<br />
	the statute have defined, with significant input from the health care<br />
	industry, a set of common criteria for evaluating potential standards.<br />
	These criteria are based on direct specifications in the HIPAA, the<br />
	purpose of the law, and principles that support the regulatory<br />
	philosophy set forth in Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993,<br />
	and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. In order to be designated as a<br />
	standard, a proposed standard should:<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health<br />
	care system by leading to cost reductions for or improvements in<br />
	benefits from electronic HIPAA health care transactions. This principle<br />
	supports the regulatory goals of cost-effectiveness and avoidance of<br />
	burden.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Meet the needs of the health data standards user<br />
	community, particularly health care providers, health plans, and health<br />
	care clearinghouses. This</p>
<p>[[Page 50352]]</p>
<p>principle supports the regulatory goal of cost-effectiveness.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Be consistent and uniform with the other HIPAA standards<br />
	(that is, their data element definitions and codes and their privacy<br />
	and security requirements) and with other private and public sector<br />
	health data standards to the extent possible. This principle supports<br />
	the regulatory goals of consistency and avoidance of incompatibility,<br />
	and it establishes a performance objective for the standard.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Have low additional development and implementation costs<br />
	relative to the benefits of using the standard. This principle supports<br />
	the regulatory goals of cost-effectiveness and avoidance of burden.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Be supported by an ANSI-accredited standard setting<br />
	organization or other private or public organization that will ensure<br />
	continuity and efficient updating of the standard over time. This<br />
	principle supports the regulatory goal of predictability.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Have timely development, testing, implementation, and<br />
	updating procedures to achieve administrative simplification benefits<br />
	faster. This principle establishes a performance objective for the<br />
	standard.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Be technologically independent of the computer platforms<br />
	and transmission protocols used in HIPAA health transactions, except<br />
	when they are explicitly part of the standard. This principle<br />
	establishes a performance objective for the standard and supports the<br />
	regulatory goal of flexibility.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Be precise and unambiguous but as simple as possible. This<br />
	principle supports the regulatory goals of predictability and<br />
	simplicity.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Keep data collection and paperwork burdens on users as low<br />
	as is feasible. This principle supports the regulatory goals of cost-<br />
	effectiveness and avoidance of duplication and burden.<br />
	    &lt;bullet&gt; Incorporate flexibility to adapt more easily to changes in<br />
	the health care infrastructure (such as new services, organizations,<br />
	and health care provider types) and information technology. This<br />
	principle supports the regulatory goals of flexibility and<br />
	encouragement of innovation.</p>
<p>C. Introduction</p>
<p>    The Department assessed several strategies for determining the<br />
	impact of the various standards that the Secretary will designate under<br />
	the statute. The costs and savings of each individual standard could be<br />
	analyzed independently, or the Department could analyze the costs and<br />
	savings of all the standards in the aggregate. The decision was made to<br />
	base the analysis on the aggregate impact of all the standards. Given<br />
	that all the standards are likely to be made final within a reasonable<br />
	period of one another, it is likely that organizations will seek to<br />
	make changes to comply with all the regulations at the same time, at<br />
	least for those components of the regulations that require computer and<br />
	technology changes. This will be the most efficient investment for most<br />
	affected organizations, and the estimates the Department has obtained<br />
	from industry sources are based on this assumption.<br />
	    The statute gives health care providers and health plans 24 months<br />
	(36 months for small health plans) to implement each standard after the<br />
	effective date of the final rule. This provides the industry<br />
	flexibility in determining the most cost-effective means of<br />
	implementing the standards. Dictated by their own business needs,<br />
	health plans and health care providers may decide to implement more<br />
	than one standard at a time or to combine implementation of a standard<br />
	with other system changes. As a result, overall estimates will be more<br />
	accurate than individual estimates.<br />
	    Assessing the benefits of implementing each standard independently<br />
	could also be inaccurate. While each individual standard is beneficial,<br />
	the standards as a whole have a synergistic effect on savings. For<br />
	example, the combination of the standard health plan identifier and the<br />
	standard claim format will improve the coordination of benefits process<br />
	to a much greater extent than use of either standard individually.<br />
	    It is difficult to assess the costs and benefits of such a sweeping<br />
	change because no-one has historical experience with this unique area.<br />
	Moreover, the standardization of electronic transactions will spur<br />
	secondary innovations, particularly in e-commerce, that may be<br />
	described generally but are too new to assess quantitatively.<br />
	Consequently, the analysis of these secondary benefits will be<br />
	qualitative.</p>
<p>D. Overall Cost/Benefit Analysis</p>
<p>    To assess the impact of the HIPAA administrative simplification<br />
	provisions, it is important to understand current industry practices. A<br />
	1993 study by Lewin-VHI estimated that administrative costs comprised<br />
	17 percent of total health expenditures. Paperwork inefficiencies are a<br />
	component of those costs, as are the inefficiencies caused by the more<br />
	than 400 different data transmission formats currently in use. Industry<br />
	groups such as ANSI ASC X12N have developed standards for EDI<br />
	transactions which are used by some health plans and health care<br />
	providers. However, migration to these recognized standards has been<br />
	hampered by the inability to develop a concerted approach. For example,<br />
	even ``standard'' formats such as the Uniform Bill (UB-92), the<br />
	standard Medicare hospital claim form (which is used by most hospitals,<br />
	skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies for inpatient and<br />
	outpatient claims) are customized by health plans and health care<br />
	providers.<br />
	    Several reports have made estimates of the costs and/or benefits of<br />
	implementing EDI standards. In assessing the impact of the HIPAA<br />
	administrative simplification provisions, the Congressional Budget<br />
	Office reported that:</p>
<p>    ``The direct cost of the mandates in Title II of the bill would<br />
	be negligible. Health plans (and those health care providers who<br />
	choose to submit claims electronically) would be required to modify<br />
	their computer software to incorporate new standards as they are<br />
	adopted or modified...Uniform standards would generate offsetting<br />
	savings for health plans and health care providers by simplifying<br />
	the claims process and coordination of benefits.'' (Page 4 of the<br />
	Estimate of Costs of Private Sector Mandates in the Congressional<br />
	Budget Office report)</p>
<p>    The most extensive industry analysis of the effects of EDI<br />
	standards was developed by WEDI in 1993, which built upon a similar<br />
	1992 report. The WEDI report used an extensive amount of information<br />
	and analysis to develop its estimates, including data from a number of<br />
	EDI pilot projects. The report included a number of electronic<br />
	transactions that are not covered by HIPAA, such as materials<br />
	management. The WEDI report projected implementation costs ranging<br />
	between $5.3 billion and $17.3 billion (3, p. 9-4) and annual savings<br />
	for the transactions covered by HIPAA ranging from $8.9 billion and<br />
	$20.5 billion (3, pp. 9-5 and 9-6). Lewin estimated that the data<br />
	standards proposed in the Healthcare Simplification and Uniformity Act<br />
	of 1993 would save from 2.0 to 3.9 percent in administrative costs<br />
	annually ($2.6 to $5.2 billion based on 1991 costs) (1, p.12). A 1995<br />
	study commissioned by the New Jersey Legislature estimated yearly<br />
	savings of $760 million related to EDI claims processing, reducing<br />
	claims rejection, performing eligibility checks, decreasing accounts<br />
	receivable, and other potential EDI applications in New Jersey alone<br />
	(4, p.316).<br />
	    We have drawn on the 1993 WEDI report for many of our estimates<br />
	because it is the most comprehensive available.</p>
<p>[[Page 50353]]</p>
<p>However, our conclusions differ, especially in the area of savings, for<br />
	a number of reasons. The WEDI report was intended to assess the savings<br />
	in an EDI environment that is much broader than is covered by HIPAA.<br />
	Furthermore, EDI continued to grow through the 1990's (see Faulkner &amp;<br />
	Gray, 2000), and it is reasonable to assume that EDI would continue to<br />
	grow for the foreseeable future even without HIPAA. The Department's<br />
	objective in this analysis is to assess the effect of the legislation<br />
	and these regulations on the health care sector; only a portion of the<br />
	benefits of EDI identified by WEDI would be attributable to HIPAA.</p>
<p>E. Implementation Costs</p>
<p>    The costs of implementing the standards specified in the statute<br />
	are primarily one-time or short-term costs related to conversion. They<br />
	can be characterized as follows:<br />
	    1. System Conversion/Upgrade--Health care providers and health<br />
	plans will incur costs to convert existing software to utilize the<br />
	standards. Health plans and large health care providers generally have<br />
	their own information systems, which they maintain with in-house or<br />
	contract support. Small health care providers are more likely to use<br />
	off-the-shelf software developed and maintained by a vendor. Examples<br />
	of software changes include the ability to generate and accept<br />
	transactions using the standard (for example, claims, remittance<br />
	advices) and converting or cross walking medical code sets to chosen<br />
	standards. However, health care providers have considerable flexibility<br />
	in determining how and when to accomplish these changes. One<br />
	alternative to a complete system redesign would be to purchase a<br />
	translator that reformats existing system outputs into standard<br />
	transaction formats. A health plan or health care provider could also<br />
	decide to implement two or more related standards at once or to<br />
	implement one or more standards during a software upgrade. Each health<br />
	care provider's and health plan's situation will differ, and each will<br />
	select a cost-effective implementation scheme. Many health care<br />
	providers use billing associates or health care clearinghouses to<br />
	facilitate EDI. (Although we discuss billing associates and health care<br />
	clearinghouses as separate entities in this impact analysis, billing<br />
	associates are considered to be the same as health care clearinghouses<br />
	for purposes of administrative simplification if they meet the<br />
	definition of a health care clearinghouse). Those entities would also<br />
	have to reprogram to accommodate standards.<br />
	    2. Start-up Cost of Automation--The statute does not require health<br />
	care providers to conduct transactions electronically. To benefit from<br />
	EDI, health care providers who choose to conduct electronic<br />
	transactions but do not currently have electronic capabilities would<br />
	have to purchase and install computer hardware and software as well as<br />
	train their staffs to use the technology. However, this conversion is<br />
	likely to be less costly once standards are in place because there will<br />
	be more vendors providing support services. Furthermore, providers<br />
	without electronic capabilities are more likely to conclude that the<br />
	benefits of conducting transactions electronically justify a capital<br />
	investment in EDI technology.<br />
	    3. Training--Health care provider and health plan personnel will<br />
	require training on the use of the various standard identifiers,<br />
	formats, and code sets. For the most part, training will be directed<br />
	toward administrative personnel, though clinical staff will also need<br />
	training on the new code sets. With standardization, however, vendors<br />
	are more likely to offer assistance in training as a means of<br />
	increasing sales, thereby reducing the per unit cost of training.<br />
	    4. Implementation Problems--The implementation of any industry-wide<br />
	standards will inevitably create additional complexity in regard to how<br />
	health plans and health care providers conduct business. Health plans<br />
	and health care providers will need to work on re-establishing<br />
	communication with their trading partners, and process transactions<br />
	using the new formats, identifiers, and code sets. This is likely to<br />
	result in a temporary increase in rejected transactions, manual<br />
	exception processing, payment delays, and requests for additional<br />
	information.<br />
	    While the majority of costs are one-time costs related to<br />
	implementation, there are also on-going costs associated with<br />
	administrative simplification, such as subscribing to or purchasing<br />
	documentation and implementation specifications related to code sets<br />
	and standard formats and obtaining current health plan and health care<br />
	provider identifier directories or data files. Because covered entities<br />
	are already incurring most of these costs, the costs under HIPAA will<br />
	be marginal. These small ongoing costs are included in the estimate of<br />
	the system conversion and upgrade costs.<br />
	    In addition, EDI could affect cash flow throughout the health<br />
	insurance industry. Electronic claims reach the health plan faster and<br />
	can be processed faster. This has the potential to improve health care<br />
	providers' cash flow situations while decreasing health plans' earnings<br />
	on cash reserves. However, improved cash flow is generally considered a<br />
	benefit, particularly for small businesses.</p>
<p>F. Benefits of Increased Use of EDI for Health Care Transactions</p>
<p>    Some of the benefits attributable to increased EDI can be readily<br />
	quantified, while others are more intangible. For example, it is easy<br />
	to compute the savings in postage from EDI claims, but attributing a<br />
	dollar value to processing efficiencies is difficult.<br />
	    The benefits of EDI to the industry in general are well documented<br />
	in the literature. One of the most significant benefits of EDI is the<br />
	reduction in manual data entry. The paper processing of business<br />
	transactions requires manual data entry when the data are received and<br />
	entered into a system. For example, the data on a paper health care<br />
	transaction from a health care provider to a health plan have to be<br />
	manually entered into the health plan's business system. If the patient<br />
	has more than one health plan, the second health plan would also have<br />
	to manually enter the data into its system if it cannot receive the<br />
	information electronically. Repeated keying of information transmitted<br />
	via paper results in increased labor as well as significant<br />
	opportunities for keying errors. EDI permits direct data transmission<br />
	between computer systems which, in turn, reduces the need to rekey<br />
	data.<br />
	    Another problem with paper-based transactions is that these<br />
	documents are primarily mailed. Normal delivery times of mailings can<br />
	vary anywhere from one to several days for normal first class mail.<br />
	Shipping paper documents more quickly can be expensive. While bulk<br />
	mailings can reduce some costs, paper mailings remain costly. Using<br />
	postal services can also lead to some uncertainty as to whether the<br />
	transaction was received, unless more expensive certified mail options<br />
	are pursued. A benefit of EDI is that the capability exists for the<br />
	sender of the transaction to receive an electronic acknowledgment once<br />
	the data is opened by the recipient. Also, because EDI involves direct<br />
	computer to computer data transmission, the associated delays with<br />
	postal services are eliminated. With EDI, communication service<br />
	providers such as value added networks function as electronic post<br />
	offices and provide 24-hour service. Value added networks</p>
<p>[[Page 50354]]</p>
<p>deliver data instantaneously to the receiver's electronic mailbox.<br />
	    In addition to mailing time delays, there are other significant<br />
	costs in using paper forms. These include the costs of maintaining an<br />
	inventory of forms, typing data onto forms, addressing envelopes, and<br />
	the cost of postage. The use of paper also requires significant staff<br />
	resources to receive and store the paper during normal processing. The<br />
	paper must be organized to permit easy retrieval if necessary.</p>
<p>G. The Role of Standards in Increasing the Efficiency of EDI</p>
<p>    There was a steady increase in the use of EDI in the health care<br />
	market through the late 1990's, and there is likely to be some<br />
	continued growth, even without national standards. However, the upward<br />
	trend in EDI health care transactions will be enhanced by having<br />
	national standards in place. Because national standards are not in<br />
	place today, there continues to be a proliferation of proprietary<br />
	formats in the health care industry. Proprietary formats are those that<br />
	are unique to an individual business. Due to proprietary formats,<br />
	business partners that wish to exchange information via EDI must agree<br />
	on which formats to use. Since most health care providers do business<br />
	with a number of health plans, they must produce EDI transactions in<br />
	many different formats. For small health care providers facing the<br />
	requirement of maintaining multiple formats, this is a significant<br />
	disincentive to converting to EDI.<br />
	    National standards will allow for common formats and translations<br />
	of electronic information that will be understandable to both the<br />
	sender and receiver. Multiple electronic formats increase associated<br />
	labor costs because more personnel time and more skills are required to<br />
	link or translate different systems. These costs are reflected in<br />
	increased office overhead, a reliance on paper and third party vendors,<br />
	and communication delays. National standards eliminate the need to<br />
	determine what format a trading partner is using. Standards also reduce<br />
	software development and maintenance costs that are required for<br />
	operating or converting multiple proprietary formats. Health care<br />
	transaction standards will improve the efficiency of the EDI market and<br />
	will help further persuade reluctant industry partners to choose EDI<br />
	over traditional mail services.<br />
	    The statute directs the Secretary to establish standards and sets<br />
	out the timetable for doing so. The Secretary must designate a standard<br />
	for each of the specified transactions and medical code sets. Health<br />
	plans and health care providers generally conduct EDI with multiple<br />
	partners and the choice of a transaction format is a bilateral decision<br />
	between the sender and receiver. Many health care providers and health<br />
	plans need to support many different transaction formats in order to<br />
	meet the needs of all of their trading partners. Single standards will<br />
	maximize net benefits and minimize ongoing confusion.<br />
	    Health care providers and health plans have a great deal of<br />
	flexibility in how and when they will implement standards. The statute<br />
	specifies dates by which health plans will have to use adopted<br />
	standards, however, health plans can determine if, when, and in which<br />
	order they will implement standards before the date of mandatory<br />
	compliance. Health care providers have the flexibility to determine<br />
	when it is cost-effective for them to convert to EDI. Health plans and<br />
	health care providers have a wide range of vendors and technologies<br />
	from which to choose in implementing standards and can choose to<br />
	utilize a health care clearinghouse to transmit (produce and receive)<br />
	standard transactions.</p>
<p>H. Updated Cost and Benefit Assumptions</p>
<p>    As mentioned above, we have made changes to the original impact<br />
	analysis published in the NPRM. In response to the public comments<br />
	regarding the NPRM impact analysis, the Department did a thorough<br />
	review of the original assumptions and data sources. In the review<br />
	process, it became clear that the original data sources required<br />
	updating and that there were some inconsistencies in the original<br />
	assumptions. What follows is an explanation of each change and the<br />
	rationale behind the new methodology.<br />
	    Ten Year Time-Frame: This Impact Analysis changes the original<br />
	NPRM's time-frame from five years to ten years. The need for this<br />
	change results from the nature of the HIPAA regulations: there will be<br />
	significant one-time initial investments followed by many years of<br />
	savings. Because a five year impact analysis will show the full cost of<br />
	the regulations but truncate the savings significantly, a ten year<br />
	time-frame allows for a fuller presentation of the benefits<br />
	administrative simplification offers the health care industry. As an<br />
	illustration of the difference between a five year and a ten year time<br />
	frame, the initial NPRM Impact Analysis estimated $1.5 billion in net<br />
	savings to the industry, but a ten year analysis using identical<br />
	assumptions as the original NPRM would estimate $24.2 billion in net<br />
	savings. The Department believes it is more appropriate to use a time<br />
	frame that more accurately estimates the long term impact of the<br />
	regulations.<br />
	    New Data: Given the length of time between the publication of the<br />
	NPRM and the final rule, it was necessary to update data for the number<br />
	of plans and providers, the number of claims, and the current<br />
	proportion of claims that are electronic in the health care industry.<br />
	Updated data on the number of different types of plans and providers<br />
	were obtained from a variety of sources, including the 1997 Economic<br />
	Census, the 1999 Statistical Abstract of the United States, the<br />
	American Medical Association and other industry groups, the Department<br />
	of Labor, and the Department of Health and Human Services. In the NPRM,<br />
	the 1993 WEDI report was used to determine the total number of claims<br />
	in the health care industry for 1993, which was trended forward using<br />
	data from the 1996 edition of Faulkner and Gray's Health Data Directory<br />
	to estimate the number of claims annually over the 1998 to 2002 time<br />
	frame. For the final impact analysis, we used 1999 data (the most<br />
	recent available) from the 2000 edition of Faulkner and Gray's Health<br />
	Data Directory to determine the total number of claims in the industry,<br />
	the number of claims by provider type, and the percent of claims that<br />
	are billed electronically by provider type.<br />
	    The baseline rate of growth in the number of claims and the rate of<br />
	growth in the proportion of electronic claims were revised using<br />
	historical trend data from the 2000 Faulkner and Gray report. In the<br />
	final impact analysis, the average annual rate of growth over the 1995<br />
	to 1999 period is used to determine the annual increase in the number<br />
	of claims and in the proportion of claims that are electronic, for all<br />
	claims in the industry and by provider type.<br />
	    New Electronic Claims Growth Assumptions: This Impact Analysis<br />
	makes a refinement to the original assumptions for determining the rate<br />
	of increase in electronic claims due to HIPAA. The model assumes that<br />
	electronic claims submissions will increase in the first three years<br />
	after the implementation at a rapid pace as many health care providers<br />
	and health plans make the switch to electronic formats but then the<br />
	rate will decrease over time. The model also assumes some providers<br />
	will not make the transition to EDI during the ten year period.<br />
	Specifically, we assumed that the proportion of manual claims will<br />
	decrease by twenty percent annually from 2002 to 2005 and then will<br />
	decrease by ten percent annually from</p>
<p>[[Page 50355]]</p>
<p>2006 to 2011. By contrast, the original NPRM model assumed the rate of<br />
	increase in electronic claims would grow by two additional percentage<br />
	points above the baseline rate each year.<br />
	    Savings per Claim: This impact analysis uses more consistent<br />
	assumptions for the savings per claim. In the original NPRM, the<br />
	savings per claim for payers and each provider type was based on the<br />
	ranges developed by WEDI. However, the NPRM did not consistently pick<br />
	from a given point in the WEDI ranges, but rather various points were<br />
	chosen for different groups based on limited anecdotal information.<br />
	Upon further analysis, the Department no longer believes there is a<br />
	justifiable basis to pick from different parts of the WEDI ranges,<br />
	given the lack of additional evidence to support more precise<br />
	assumptions. Therefore, the final impact analysis assumes the savings<br />
	per claim will be at the mid-point of the WEDI ranges for payers and<br />
	all providers.<br />
	    Inflation Adjustment: The final Impact Analysis corrects an<br />
	inconsistency found in the NPRM regarding an inflation adjustment to<br />
	the annual savings per claim assumptions. Specifically, the NPRM<br />
	increased the savings per claim by 3% annually to account for<br />
	inflation. This adjustment was an inconsistency because no other<br />
	figures in the NPRM impact analysis were adjusted for inflation.<br />
	Therefore, for the final impact analysis, all dollar estimates,<br />
	including the savings per claim, are in current 2000 dollars.<br />
	    First Year Savings: Another change made to the impact analysis was<br />
	to include savings in the first year of mandatory compliance with the<br />
	rule. The NPRM assumed that there would be no savings in the first year<br />
	of mandatory compliance, yet we believe that this assumption was in<br />
	error because most entities must comply no later than two years after<br />
	the effective date of the final rule (three years for small health<br />
	plans), and therefore some savings will begin two years after<br />
	publication of the rule. In fact, it could be argued that some entities<br />
	will come into compliance prior to the two year deadline and begin to<br />
	produce savings, but in order to produce a conservative estimate, this<br />
	analysis only assumes that savings begin in the first year of mandatory<br />
	compliance.<br />
	    Impact of Changes: The cumulative effect of the changes made to the<br />
	impact analysis increases the net savings from administrative<br />
	simplification. Although the NPRM only showed five year costs and<br />
	savings, the underlying analysis included ten year estimates as well.<br />
	Compared to the original impact analysis, the final impact analysis<br />
	increases the estimated gross costs of the rule from $5.8 billion to<br />
	$7.0 billion over ten years. The original impact analysis produced<br />
	gross savings of $30 billion and net savings of $24.2 billion over ten<br />
	years while the new impact analysis produces gross savings of $36.9<br />
	billion and net savings of $29.9 billion over ten years. Although the<br />
	new impact analysis now shows an additional $5.7 billion in savings<br />
	over ten years, the Department believes the revised assumptions<br />
	underlying these estimates are based on better, more up-to-date data,<br />
	are more consistent, and are more reasonable. The discounted present<br />
	value of the savings is $19.1 billion over ten years. Furthermore, the<br />
	updated impact analysis still produces a conservative estimate of the<br />
	impact of administrative simplification. For example, the new impact<br />
	analysis assumes that over the ten-year post-implementation period,<br />
	only 11.2% of the growth in electronic claims will be attributable to<br />
	HIPAA. Given the widely recognized benefits standardization offers the<br />
	health care industry, assuming that only 11.2% of all health claims<br />
	will be affected by HIPAA represents a reasonably conservative estimate<br />
	of the impact .</p>
<p>I. Cost/Benefit Tables</p>
<p>    The tables below illustrate the essential costs and savings for<br />
	health plans and health care providers to implement the standards and<br />
	the savings that will occur over time as a result of the HIPAA<br />
	administrative simplification provisions. All estimates are stated in<br />
	2000 dollars. The costs are based on estimates of a moderately complex<br />
	set of software upgrades, which were provided by the industry. The<br />
	range of costs and savings that health plans and health care providers<br />
	will incur is quite large and is based on such factors as the size and<br />
	complexity of the existing systems, ability to implement using existing<br />
	low-cost translator software, and reliance on health care<br />
	clearinghouses to create standard transactions. The cost of a<br />
	moderately complex upgrade represents a reasonable mid-point in this<br />
	range. In addition, we assume that health plans and health care<br />
	providers that operate EDI systems will incur implementation costs<br />
	related to manual operations to make those processes compatible with<br />
	the EDI systems. For example, manual processes may be converted to<br />
	produce paper remittance advices that contain the same data elements as<br />
	the EDI standard transaction. These costs are estimated to equal 50<br />
	percent of the software upgrade cost. Health care providers that do not<br />
	have existing EDI systems will also incur some costs due to HIPAA, even<br />
	if they choose not to implement EDI for all of the HIPAA transactions.<br />
	For example, a health care provider may have to change accounting<br />
	practices in order to process the revised paper remittance advice<br />
	discussed above. We have assumed the average cost for non-EDI health<br />
	care providers and health plans to be half that of already-automated<br />
	health care providers and health plans.<br />
	    Savings due to standardization come from three sources. First,<br />
	there are savings due to increased use of electronic claims submissions<br />
	throughout the health care industry. Second, there will be savings<br />
	based on simplification of the manual claims that remain in the system.<br />
	Finally, there will be savings due to increased electronic non-claims<br />
	transactions, such as eligibility verifications and coordination of<br />
	benefits. It is important to view these estimates as an attempt to<br />
	furnish a realistic context rather than as precise budgetary<br />
	predictions. The estimates also do not include any benefits<br />
	attributable to the qualitative aspects of administrative<br />
	simplification, nor is there any inclusion of secondary benefits.<br />
	Industry people have argued that standardization will accelerate many<br />
	forms of new e-commerce. These innovations may generate significant<br />
	savings to the health care system or improvements in the quality of<br />
	health but they have not been included here.<br />
	    More detailed information regarding data sources and assumptions is<br />
	provided in the explanations for the specific tables.<br />
	    Table 1 below shows estimated costs and savings for health plans.<br />
	The number of plans listed in the chart is derived from the 1993 WEDI<br />
	report, trade publications, and data from the Department of Labor. The<br />
	cost per health plan for software upgrades is based on the WEDI report,<br />
	which estimated a range of costs required to implement a fully capable<br />
	EDI environment, and more current estimates provided by the industry.<br />
	The high-end estimates ranged from two to ten times higher than the<br />
	low-end estimates. Lower end estimates were used in most cases because,<br />
	as explained above, HIPAA does not require changes as extensive as<br />
	envisioned by WEDI. The estimated percentages of health plans that<br />
	accept electronic billing are based on reports in the 2000 edition of<br />
	Faulkner &amp; Gray's Health Data Directory (5). The total cost for each<br />
	type of health plan is the sum of the cost for EDI and non-EDI health<br />
	plans. Cost for EDI health plans is computed as follows:</p>
<p>[[Page 50356]]</p>
<p>(Total Entities  x  EDI %  x  Average Upgrade Cost  x  1.5)</p>
<p>    Note: As described above, EDI health plans would incur costs<br />
	both to upgrade software and to make manual operations compatible<br />
	with EDI systems. The cost of changing manual processes is estimated<br />
	to be half the cost of system changes.</p>
<p>    Cost for non-EDI health plans is computed as follows:</p>
<p>Total entities  x  (1-EDI %)  x  Average Upgrade Cost  x  0.5</p>
<p>    Note: As described above, cost to non-EDI health plans is<br />
	assumed to be half the cost of systems changes for EDI plans.</p>
<p>    The data available permit us to make reasonable estimates of the<br />
	costs that will be borne by different types of health plans (Table 1).<br />
	Unfortunately, though we can estimate the overall savings, we cannot<br />
	reliably estimate their distributional effects. Hence, only the<br />
	aggregate savings estimates are presented.</p>

	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>    Note: The estimates in Table 1 show cost savings in 2000 dollars<br />
	(estimates in the proposed rule were in 1998 dollars). The Office of<br />
	Management and Budget now requires all agencies to provide estimates<br />
	using a net present value calculation. Furthermore, OMB recommends<br />
	the use of a 7 percent discount rate based on the current cost of<br />
	capital. The discounted totals in the table are based on this rate<br />
	beginning in 2003.</p>
<p>    Table 2 illustrates the costs and savings attributable to various<br />
	types of health care providers.<br />
	    The number of entities (practices or establishments, not individual<br />
	health care providers) is based on the 1997 Economic Census, the 1999<br />
	Statistical Abstract of the United States, the American Medical<br />
	Association's Physician Characteristics and Distribution in the U.S.<br />
	(2000-2001 edition), and Department of Health and Human Services data<br />
	trended to 2002. Estimated percentages of EDI billing are based on the<br />
	2000 edition of Faulkner &amp; Gray's Health Data Directory or are<br />
	Departmental estimates.<br />
	    The cost of software upgrades for personal computers (PCS) in<br />
	provider practices or establishments is based on reports of the cost of<br />
	software upgrades to translate and communicate standardized claims<br />
	forms. The low end of the range of costs is used for smaller practices<br />
	or establishments and the high end of the range of costs for larger<br />
	practices/establishments with PCS. The cost per upgrade estimate for<br />
	hospitals and other facilities is a Departmental estimate derived from<br />
	estimates by WEDI and estimates of the cost of new software packages in<br />
	the literature. The estimates fall within the range of the WEDI<br />
	estimates, but that range is quite large. For example, WEDI estimates<br />
	that the cost for a large hospital upgrade will be from $50,000 to<br />
	$500,000.<br />
	    The $20.2 billion in savings in Table 4 represents savings to<br />
	health care providers for the first ten years of implementation. The<br />
	discounted present value of these savings is $19.1 billion over ten<br />
	years. They are included to provide a sense of how the HIPAA<br />
	administrative simplification provisions will affect various entities.</p>

<p>    Note: The estimates in Table 2 show cost savings in 2000 dollars<br />
	(estimates in the proposed rule were in 1998 dollars). The Office of<br />

	the use of a 7 percent discount rate based on the current cost of<br />
	capital. The discounted totals in the table are based on this rate<br />
	beginning in 2003.</p>
<p>    Table 3 shows the estimates we used to determine the portion of EDI<br />
	claims increase attributable to the HIPAA administrative simplification<br />
	provisions. The proportion of claims that would be processed<br />
	electronically even without HIPAA is assumed to grow at the same rate<br />
	from 2002 through 2011 as it did from 1995-1999. The proportion of<br />
	``other'' health care provider claims is high because it includes<br />
	pharmacies that generate large volumes of claims and have a high rate<br />
	of electronic billing.<br />
	    The increase in EDI claims attributable to HIPAA is highly<br />
	uncertain and is critical to the savings estimate. These estimates are<br />
	based on an analysis of the current EDI environment. Most of the growth<br />
	rate in electronic billing is attributable to Medicare and Medicaid;<br />
	smaller private insurers and third party administrators (who are not<br />
	large commercial insurers) have lower rates of electronic billing and<br />
	may benefit significantly from standardization.</p>

	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>    Table 4 shows the annual costs, savings, and net savings over a ten<br />
	year implementation period which are gained by using the HIPAA<br />
	standards. Virtually all of the costs attributable to HIPAA will be<br />
	incurred within the first three years of implementation, since the<br />
	statute requires health plans other than small health plans to<br />
	implement the standards within 24 months and small health plans to<br />
	implement the standards within 36 months of the effective date of the<br />
	final rule. As each health plan implements a standard, health care<br />
	providers that conduct electronic transactions with that health plan<br />
	will also implement the standard. No net savings would accrue in the<br />
	first year because not enough health plans and health care providers<br />
	will have implemented the standards. Savings will increase as more<br />
	health plans and health care providers implement the standards, thus<br />
	exceeding costs in the fourth year. At that point, the majority of<br />
	health plans and health care providers will have implemented the<br />
	standards and, as a result, costs will decrease and benefits will<br />
	increase.<br />
	    The savings per claim processed electronically instead of manually<br />
	is based on the mid-point of the range estimated by WEDI.: $1 per claim<br />
	for health plans, $1.49 for physicians, $0.86 for hospitals and $0.83<br />
	for others. These estimates are based on surveys of health care<br />
	providers and health plans. Total savings are computed by multiplying<br />
	the per claim savings by the number of EDI claims attributed to HIPAA.<br />
	The total number of EDI claims is used in computing the savings to<br />
	health plans, while the savings for specific health care provider<br />
	groups is computed using only the number of EDI claims generated by<br />
	that group (for example, savings to physicians is computed using only<br />
	physician EDI claims).<br />
	    WEDI also estimated savings resulting from other HIPAA<br />
	transactions, such as eligibility verifications, coordination of<br />
	benefits, and claims inquiries (among others). The average savings per<br />
	transaction was slightly higher than the savings from electronic<br />
	billing, but the number of transactions was much smaller than the<br />
	number of claims transactions. The estimates for transactions other<br />
	than claims were derived by approximating a number of</p>
<p>[[Page 50358]]</p>
<p>transactions and estimating the anticipated savings associated with<br />
	each transaction relative to those assumed for the savings for<br />
	electronic billing (see table 5). In general, the approximations are<br />
	close to those used by WEDI. For these non-billing transactions, the<br />
	Department assumed that the simplification promoted by HIPAA will<br />
	facilitate a significant conversion from manual to electronic formats.<br />
	While today it is estimated that about 44% of these non-billing<br />
	transactions are electronic, by the end of the ten year period it is<br />
	estimated that 92% will become electronic.<br />
	    Savings can also be expected from simplifications in manual claims.<br />
	The basic assumption is that the savings are ten percent of savings per<br />
	claim that are projected for conversion from manual to electronic<br />
	billing. However, it is also assumed that the standards will only<br />
	gradually allow health care providers and health plans to abandon old<br />
	manual forms and identifiers by 10% annually; this staged transition is<br />
	inevitable because many of the relationships that have been established<br />
	with other entities will require a period of overlap during<br />
	transitioning with entities with which they do business.</p>

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
	Note: Figures do not total due to rounding.<br />
	Note: The estimates in Table 4 show cost savings in 2000 dollars (estimates in the proposed rule were in 1998 dollars). The Office of Management and<br />
	  Budget now requires all agencies to provide estimates using a net present value calculation. Furthermore, OMB recommends the use of a 7 percent<br />
	  discount rate based on the current cost of capital. The discounted totals in the table are based on this rate beginning in 2003.</p>
<p>    The ratios in Table 5 were derived from the WEDI Report, which<br />
	estimated the volume and savings of the listed non-billing<br />
	transactions. By comparing the relationship between billing volume and<br />
	savings to non-billing volume and savings, it is possible to estimate<br />
	total savings due to other transactions. These ratios were used because<br />
	the billing data has been updated by the Faulkner and Gray Health Data<br />
	Directory, but WEDI has not updated the estimates for non-billing<br />
	transactions. Therefore, this model implicitly assumes that the ratio<br />
	of billing transactions to non-billing transactions has remained<br />
	constant since 1993.</p>

<p>J. Qualitative Impacts of Administrative Simplification</p>
<p>    Administration simplification produces more than hard-dollar<br />
	savings. There are also qualitative benefits that are less tangible,<br />
	but nevertheless important. These changes become possible when data can<br />
	be more easily integrated across entities. WEDI suggests in its 1993<br />
	report that the implementation of an EDI infrastructure will cause a<br />
	``ripple-effect'' on the whole health care delivery system; this chain<br />
	reaction will occur because there will be a reduction in duplicate<br />
	medical procedures and processes as a patient is handled by a continuum<br />
	of health care providers during an episode of care. WEDI also suggests<br />
	that there will be a reduction in the exposure to health care fraud as<br />
	security controls on electronic</p>
<p>[[Page 50359]]</p>
<p>transactions will prevent unauthorized access to financial data.<br />
	    Standards may also reduce administrative burden and improve job<br />
	satisfaction. For example, fewer administrative staff will be required<br />
	to translate procedural codes, since a common set of codes will be<br />
	used. All codes used in these transactions will be standardized,<br />
	eliminating different values for data elements (for example, place of<br />
	service).<br />
	    Administrative simplification will promote the accuracy,<br />
	reliability and usefulness of the information shared. For example,<br />
	today there are any number of transaction formats in use. There are<br />
	over 400 variations of electronic formats for claims transactions<br />
	alone. As noted earlier, these variations make it difficult for parties<br />
	to exchange information electronically. At a minimum, it requires data<br />
	to be translated from the sender's own format to the different formats<br />
	specified by each intended receiver. Translation usually requires<br />
	additional equipment and labor.<br />
	    Administrative simplification greatly enhances the sharing of data<br />
	both within entities and across entities. It facilitates the<br />
	coordination of benefits information by having in place a standardized<br />
	set of data that is known to all parties, along with standardized name<br />
	and address information that tells where to route transactions. Today,<br />
	health care providers are reluctant to file claims with multiple health<br />
	plans on behalf of the patient because information about a patient's<br />
	eligibility in a health plan is difficult to verify. Most claims filed<br />
	by patients today are submitted in hard copy. We anticipate that more<br />
	health care providers will file claims and coordinate benefits on the<br />
	patient's behalf once standard transactions are adopted and this<br />
	information is made available electronically.</p>
<p>K. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</p>
<p>    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980, Public Law 96-354,<br />
	requires the Department to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis if<br />
	the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulation will have a<br />
	significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<br />
	In the health care sector, a small entity is one with less than $5<br />
	million in annual revenues. For the purposes of this analysis (pursuant<br />
	to the RFA), nonprofit organizations are considered small entities;<br />
	however, individuals and States are not included in the definition of a<br />
	small entity. We have attempted to estimate the number of small<br />
	entities and provide a general discussion of the effects of the<br />
	statute.<br />
	    For the purpose of this analysis, all 31 nonprofit Blue Cross-Blue<br />
	Shield Health Plans are considered small entities. 28% of HMOs are<br />
	considered small entities because of their nonprofit status. Doctors of<br />
	osteopathy, dentistry, podiatry, as well as chiropractors, and solo and<br />
	group physicians' offices with fewer than three physicians, are<br />
	considered small entities. Forty percent of group practices with 3 or<br />
	more physicians and 100 percent of optometrist practices are considered<br />
	small entities. Seventy-two percent of all pharmacies, 88% of medical<br />
	laboratories, 100% of dental laboratories and 90% of durable medical<br />
	equipment suppliers are assumed to be small entities as well.<br />
	    We found the best source for information about the health data<br />
	information industry is Faulkner &amp; Gray's Health Data Directory. This<br />
	publication is the most comprehensive data dictionary of its kind that<br />
	we could find. The information in this directory is gathered by<br />
	Faulkner &amp; Gray editors and researchers who called all of the more than<br />
	3,000 organizations that are listed in the book in order to elicit<br />
	information about their operations. It is important to note that some<br />
	businesses are listed as more than one type of business entity; this is<br />
	because in reporting the information, companies could list themselves<br />
	as many as three different types of entities. For example, some<br />
	businesses listed themselves as both practice management vendors and<br />
	claims software vendors because their practice management software was<br />
	``EDI enabled.''<br />
	    All the statistics referencing Faulkner &amp; Gray's come from the 2000<br />
	edition of its Health Data Directory. It lists 78 claims<br />
	clearinghouses, which are entities under contract that take electronic<br />
	and paper health care claims data from health care providers and<br />
	billing companies that prepare bills on a health care provider's<br />
	behalf. The claims clearinghouse acts as a conduit for health plans; it<br />
	batches claims and routes transactions to the appropriate health plan<br />
	in a form that expedites payment.<br />
	    Of the 78 claims clearinghouses listed in this publication, eight<br />
	processed more that 20 million electronic transactions per month.<br />
	Another 15 handled 2 million or more transactions per month and another<br />
	4 handled over a million electronic transactions per month. The<br />
	remaining 39 entities listed in the data dictionary processed less than<br />
	a million electronic transactions per month. Almost all of these<br />
	entities have annual revenues of under $5 million and would therefore<br />
	be considered small entities.<br />
	    Another entity that is involved in the electronic transmission of<br />
	health care transactions is materials management/supply ordering<br />
	software companies (value added networks). They are involved in the<br />
	electronic transmission of data over telecommunication lines. Faulkner<br />
	&amp; Gray list 21 materials management/supply ordering software vendors<br />
	that handle health care transactions. We believe that almost all of<br />
	these companies meet the definition of a small business. \1\<br />
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>    \1\ The SBA size standard for computer software related<br />
	industries (SIC 7371-7379) is $18.0 million or less. Between 81% and<br />
	99% of the companies in these categories qualify.<br />
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>    A billing company is another entity involved in the electronic<br />
	routing of health care transactions. It works primarily with physicians<br />
	in office and hospital-based settings. Billing companies, in effect,<br />
	take over the office administrative functions for a physician; they<br />
	take information such as copies of medical notes and records and<br />
	prepare claim forms that are then forwarded to an insurer for payment.<br />
	Billing companies may also handle the receipt of payments, including<br />
	posting payment to the patient's record on behalf of the health care<br />
	provider. They can be located within or outside of the physician's<br />
	practice setting.<br />
	    In the proposed rule we stated that The International Billing<br />
	Association, a trade association representing billing companies,<br />
	estimated that there were 4,500 billing companies in business in the<br />
	United States. The International Billing Association's estimates are<br />
	based on the number of names and addresses of actual billing companies<br />
	on its mailing list. Since we were unable to find more recent<br />
	information about these entities, we are assuming that the number of<br />
	billing companies has not changed significantly and that all of the<br />
	4,500 billing companies continue to have revenues under $5 million<br />
	annually.<br />
	    Software system vendors provide computer software applications<br />
	support to health care clearinghouses, billing companies, and health<br />
	care providers. In particular, they work with health care providers'<br />
	practice management and health information systems. These businesses<br />
	provide integrated software applications for such services as accounts<br />
	receivable management, electronic claims submission (patient billing),<br />
	record keeping, patient charting, practice analysis and patient<br />
	scheduling. Some software vendors are</p>
<p>[[Page 50360]]</p>
<p>also involved in providing applications for translating paper and<br />
	nonstandard computer documents into standardized formats that are<br />
	acceptable to health plans.<br />
	    Faulkner &amp; Gray list 78 physician practice management vendors and<br />
	suppliers, 76 hospital information systems vendors and suppliers, 140<br />
	software vendors and suppliers for claims-related transactions, and 20<br />
	translation vendors (now known as Interface Engines/ Integration<br />
	Tools). We were unable to determine the number of these entities with<br />
	revenues over $5 million, but we assume most of these businesses would<br />
	be considered small entities.<br />
	    As discussed earlier in this analysis, the cost of implementing the<br />
	standards specified in the statute are primarily one-time or short-term<br />
	costs related to conversion. They were characterized as follows:<br />
	software conversion; cost of automation; training; implementation<br />
	problems; and cost of documentation and implementation specifications.<br />
	Rather than repeat that information here, we refer you to the beginning<br />
	of this impact analysis.<br />
	1. Health care Providers and Health Plans<br />
	    As a result of standard data format and content, health care<br />
	providers and health plans that wish to do business electronically will<br />
	be able to do so knowing that capital outlays they make are likely to<br />
	be worthwhile, with some certainty on the return of their investment.<br />
	This is because covered entities that exchange electronic health care<br />
	transactions will be required to receive and send transactions in the<br />
	same standard formats. We believe this will be an incentive for small<br />
	physicians' offices to convert from paper to EDI. In a 1996 Office of<br />
	the Inspector General study entitled ``Encouraging Physicians to Use<br />
	Paperless Claims,'' the Office of the Inspector General and HCFA agreed<br />
	that over $36 million in annual Medicare claims processing savings<br />
	could be achieved if all health care providers submitting 50 or more<br />
	Medicare claims per month submitted them electronically. Establishment<br />
	of EDI standards will make it financially beneficial for many small<br />
	health care providers to convert to electronic claim submissions<br />
	because all health plans will accept the same formats.<br />
	    Additionally, health care providers that currently use health care<br />
	clearinghouses and billing agencies will see costs stabilize and will<br />
	potentially enjoy some cost reduction. This will result from the<br />
	increased efficiency that health care clearinghouses and billing<br />
	companies will realize from being able to more easily link with health<br />
	care industry business partners.<br />
	2. Third Party Vendors<br />
	    Third party vendors include third party processors/health care<br />
	clearinghouses (including value added networks), billing companies, and<br />
	software system vendors. While the market for third party vendors will<br />
	change as a result of standardization, these changes will be positive<br />
	for the industry and its customers over the long term. However, the<br />
	short term/one time costs discussed above will apply to the third party<br />
	vendor community.<br />
	    a. Health Care Clearinghouses and Billing Companies. As noted<br />
	above, health care clearinghouses are entities that take health care<br />
	transactions, convert them into standardized formats, and forward them<br />
	to the insurer. Billing companies take on the administrative functions<br />
	of a physician's office. The market for health care clearinghouse and<br />
	billing company services will definitely be affected by the HIPAA<br />
	administrative simplification provisions; however, there appears to be<br />
	some debate on how the market for these services will be affected.<br />
	    It is likely that competition among health care clearinghouses and<br />
	billing companies will increase over time as standards reduce some of<br />
	the technical limitations that currently inhibit health care providers<br />
	from conducting their own EDI. For example, by eliminating the<br />
	requirement to maintain several different claims standards for<br />
	different trading partners, health care providers will be able to more<br />
	easily link themselves directly to health plans. This could negatively<br />
	affect the market for health care clearinghouses and system vendors<br />
	that do translation services; however, standards should increase the<br />
	efficiency in which health care clearinghouses operate by allowing them<br />
	to more easily link to multiple health plans. The increased efficiency<br />
	in operations resulting from standards could, in effect, lower their<br />
	overhead costs as well as attract new health care clearinghouse<br />
	customers to offset any loss in market share that they might<br />
	experience.<br />
	    Another potential area of change is that brought about through<br />
	standardized code sets. Standard code sets will lower costs and break<br />
	down logistical barriers that discouraged some health care providers<br />
	from doing their own coding and billing. As a result, some health care<br />
	providers may choose an in-house transaction system rather than using a<br />
	billing company as a means of exercising more control over information.<br />
	Conversely, health care clearinghouses may acquire some short-term<br />
	increase in business from those health care providers that are<br />
	automated but do not use the selected standards. These health care<br />
	providers will hire health care clearinghouses to take data from the<br />
	nonstandard formats they are using and convert them into the<br />
	appropriate standards. Generally, health care clearinghouses can also<br />
	be expected to identify opportunities in which they could add value to<br />
	transaction processing and to find new business opportunities, such as<br />
	in training health care providers on the new transaction sets.<br />
	Standards will increase the efficiency of health care clearinghouses,<br />
	which could in turn drive costs for these services down. Health care<br />
	clearinghouses may be able to operate more efficiently or at a lower<br />
	cost based on their ability to gain market share. Some small billing<br />
	companies may be consumed by health care clearinghouses that may begin<br />
	offering billing services to augment their health care clearinghouse<br />
	activities. However, most health care providers that use billing<br />
	companies will probably continue to do so because of the comprehensive<br />
	and personalized services these companies offer.<br />
	    Value added networks transmit data over telecommunication lines. We<br />
	anticipate that the demand for value added network services will<br />
	increase as additional health care providers and health plans move to<br />
	electronic data exchange. Standards will eliminate the need for data to<br />
	be reformatted, which will allow health care providers to purchase<br />
	value added network services individually rather than as a component of<br />
	the full range of health care clearinghouse services.<br />
	    b. Software Vendors. As noted above, software vendors provide<br />
	computer software applications support to health care clearinghouses<br />
	and health care providers. In particular, they work with health care<br />
	providers' practice management and health information systems. These<br />
	entities will be affected positively, at least in the short term. The<br />
	implementation of administrative simplification will enhance their<br />
	business opportunities as they become involved in developing<br />
	computerized software solutions that allow health care providers and<br />
	other entities that exchange health care data to integrate the new<br />
	transaction set into their existing systems.<br />
	L. Unfunded mandates<br />
	    We have identified the private sector costs associated with the</p>
<p>[[Page 50361]]</p>
<p>implementation of these standards. Although these costs are unfunded,<br />
	we expect that they will be offset by subsequent savings as detailed in<br />
	this impact analysis.<br />
	    Most costs to health care providers and health plans will occur in<br />
	the first 3 years following the adoption of the HIPAA standards, with<br />
	savings to health care providers and health plans exceeding costs in<br />
	the fourth year. The total net savings for the period 2001-2011 will be<br />
	$29.8 billion (a net savings of $13.1 billion for health plans, and a<br />
	net savings of $16.7 billion for health care providers). The single<br />
	year net savings for the year 2011 will be $5.6 billion ($2.5 billion<br />
	for health plans and $3.1 billion for health care providers). The<br />
	discounted present value of these savings is $19.1 billion over ten<br />
	years. These estimates do not include the secondary benefits that will<br />
	be realized through expanded e-commerce resulting from standardized<br />
	systems.<br />
	    The costs to State and local governments and tribal organizations<br />
	are also unfunded, but we do not have sufficient information for<br />
	programs other than Medicaid to provide estimates of the impact of<br />
	these standards on those entities. As discussed previously, several<br />
	State Medicaid agencies have estimated that it may cost as much as $10<br />
	million per state to implement all the HIPAA standards. However, the<br />
	Congressional Budget Office analysis stated that ``States are already<br />
	in the forefront in administering the Medicaid program electronically;<br />
	the only costs--which should not be significant--would involve bringing<br />
	the software and computer systems for the Medicaid programs into<br />
	compliance with the new standards.'' The report went on to point out<br />
	that Medicaid State agencies have the option to compensate for costs by<br />
	reducing other expenditures. State and local government agencies are<br />
	likely to incur less in the way of costs since most of them will have<br />
	fewer enrollees than Medicaid agencies. Moreover, the Federal<br />
	government pays a portion of the cost of converting State Medicaid<br />
	Management Information Systems (MMIS) as Federal Financial<br />
	Participation--75 percent for system maintenance changes and 90 percent<br />
	for new software (if approved). Many States are in the process of<br />
	changing systems as they convert many of the current functions in the<br />
	move to enroll Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care. The net effect<br />
	is that some States may have to pay $1 million to comply; however,<br />
	numerous States may have already incurred some of these costs, though<br />
	the Department does not have a complete record of State changes.</p>
<p>M. Code Sets--Specific Impact of Adoption of Code Sets for Medical Data</p>
<p>Affected Entities<br />
	    Standard codes and classifications are required in some segments of<br />
	administrative and financial transactions. Covered entities that create<br />
	and process administrative transactions must implement the standard<br />
	codes according to the implementation specifications adopted for each<br />
	coding system and each transaction. Those that receive standard<br />
	electronic administrative transactions must be able to receive and<br />
	process all standard codes irrespective of local policies regarding<br />
	reimbursement for certain conditions or procedures, coverage policies,<br />
	or need for certain types of information that are part of a standard<br />
	transaction.<br />
	    The adoption of standard code sets and coding guidelines for<br />
	medical data supports the regulatory goals of cost-effectiveness and<br />
	the avoidance of duplication and burden. The code sets that are being<br />
	proposed as initial HIPAA standards are already in use by most health<br />
	plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers.<br />
	    Health care providers currently use the recommended code set for<br />
	reporting diagnoses and one or more of the recommended procedure coding<br />
	systems for reporting procedures/services. Since health plans can<br />
	differ with respect to the codes they accept, many health care<br />
	providers use different coding guidelines for dealing with different<br />
	health plans, sometimes for the same patient. (Anecdotal information<br />
	leads us to believe that use of other codes is widespread, but we<br />
	cannot quantify the number.) Some of these differences reflect<br />
	variations in covered services that will continue to exist irrespective<br />
	of data standardization. Others reflect differences in a health plan's<br />
	ability to accept as valid a claim that may include more information<br />
	than is needed or used by that health plan. The requirement to use<br />
	standard coding guidelines will eliminate this latter category of<br />
	differences and should simplify claims submission for health care<br />
	providers that deal with multiple health plans.<br />
	    Currently, there are health plans that do not adhere to official<br />
	coding guidelines and have developed their own plan-specific guidelines<br />
	for use with the standard code sets, which do not permit the use of all<br />
	valid codes. Again, we cannot quantify how many health plans do this,<br />
	but we are aware of some instances when this occurs. When the HIPAA<br />
	code set standards become effective, these health plans will have to<br />
	receive and process all standard codes, without regard to local<br />
	policies regarding reimbursement for certain conditions or procedures,<br />
	coverage policies, or need for certain types of information that are<br />
	part of a standard transaction.<br />
	    We believe that there is significant variation in the reporting of<br />
	anesthesia services, with some health plans using the anesthesia<br />
	section of CPT and others requiring the anesthesiologist or nurse<br />
	anesthetist to report the code for the surgical procedure itself. When<br />
	the HIPAA code sets become effective, health plans following the latter<br />
	convention will have to begin accepting codes from the anesthesia<br />
	section.<br />
	    We note that by adopting standards for code sets we are requiring<br />
	that all parties accept these codes within their electronic<br />
	transactions. We are not requiring payment for all of these services.<br />
	Those health plans that do not adhere to official coding guidelines<br />
	must therefore undertake a one-time effort to modify their systems to<br />
	accept all valid codes in the standard code sets or engage a health<br />
	care clearinghouse to preprocess the standard claims data for them.<br />
	Health plans should be able to make modifications to meet the deadlines<br />
	specified in the legislation, but some temporary disruption of claims<br />
	processing could result.<br />
	    There may be some temporary disruption of claims processing as<br />
	health plans and health care clearinghouses modify their systems to<br />
	accept all valid codes in the standard code sets.</p>
<p>N. Transaction Standards</p>
<p>1. Specific Impact of Adoption of the National Council of Prescription<br />
	Drug Programs (NCPDP) Telecommunication Claim<br />
	    a. Affected Entities. Health care providers that submit retail<br />
	pharmacy claims, and health care plans that process retail pharmacy<br />
	claims, currently use the NCPDP format. The NCPDP claim and equivalent<br />
	encounter is used either in on-line interactive or batch mode. Since<br />
	all pharmacy health care providers and health plans use the NCPDP claim<br />
	format, there are no specific impacts to health care providers.<br />
	    b. Effects of Various Options. The NCPDP format met all of the 10<br />
	guiding principles used to designate a standard as a HIPAA standard,<br />
	and there are no other known options for a standard retail pharmacy<br />
	claim transaction.</p>
<p>[[Page 50362]]</p>
<p>2. Specific Impact of Adoption of the ASC X12N 837 for Submission of<br />
	Institutional Health Care Claims, Professional Health Care Claims,<br />
	Dental Claims, and Coordination of Benefits<br />
	    a. Affected Entities. All health care providers and health plans<br />
	that conduct EDI directly and use other electronic format(s), and all<br />
	health care providers that decide to change from a paper format to an<br />
	electronic one, would have to begin to use the ASC X12N 837 for<br />
	submitting electronic health care claims (hospital, physician/supplier<br />
	and dental). (Currently, about 3 percent of Medicare health care<br />
	providers use this standard for claims; it is used less for non-<br />
	Medicare claims.)<br />
	    Some of the possible effects of adopting the ASC X12N 837 include<br />
	the possibility of an initial disruption in claim processing and<br />
	payment during a health plan's transition to the standard format and<br />
	the possibility that health care providers could react adversely to<br />
	implementation costs and thus revert to hard copy claims.<br />
	    Despite the initial problems health care providers may encounter<br />
	with administrative simplification, health care providers will, in the<br />
	long run, enjoy the advantages associated with not having to keep track<br />
	of and use different electronic formats for different insurers. This<br />
	will simplify health care provider billing systems and processes as<br />
	well as reduce administrative expenses.<br />
	    Health plans will, as long as they meet the deadlines specified in<br />
	the statute, be able to schedule their implementation of the ASC X12N<br />
	837 in a manner that best fits their needs, thus allaying some costs<br />
	through coordination of conversion to other standards. Although the<br />
	costs of implementing the ASC X12N 837 are generally one-time costs<br />
	related to conversion, the cost of systems upgrades for some smaller<br />
	health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses may<br />
	be prohibitive. Health care providers and health plans have the option<br />
	of using a health care clearinghouse to satisfy the HIPAA standard<br />
	requirements.<br />
	    Coordination of benefits. Once the ASC X12N 837 has been<br />
	implemented, health plans that perform coordination of benefits will be<br />
	able to eliminate the support of multiple proprietary electronic claim<br />
	formats, thus simplifying claims receipt and processing as well as<br />
	reducing administrative costs. Coordination of benefits activities will<br />
	also be greatly simplified because all health plans will use the same<br />
	standard format. There is no doubt that standardization in coordination<br />
	of benefits will greatly enhance and improve efficiency in the overall<br />
	claims process and the coordination of benefits.<br />
	    From a non-systems perspective (meaning policy and program issues),<br />
	there should not be an adverse effect on the coordination of benefits<br />
	process. The COB transaction will continue to consist of the incoming<br />
	electronic claim and the data elements provided on a remittance advice.<br />
	Standardization of the information needed for coordination of benefits<br />
	will clearly increase efficiency in the electronic processes utilized<br />
	by the health care providers, health care clearinghouses, and health<br />
	plans.<br />
	    b. Effects of Various Options. We assessed the various options for<br />
	a standard claim transaction against the principles, listed at the<br />
	beginning of this impact analysis above, with the overall goal of<br />
	achieving the maximum benefit for the least cost. We found that the ASC<br />
	X12N 837 for institutional claims, professional claims, dental claims,<br />
	and coordination of benefits met all of the 10 guiding principles that<br />
	were used to designate a standard as a HIPAA standard, but no other<br />
	candidate standard transaction met all the principles.<br />
	    Since the majority of dental claims are submitted on paper and<br />
	those submitted electronically are being transmitted using a variety of<br />
	proprietary formats, the only viable choice for the standard is the ASC<br />
	X12N 837. The American Dental Association (ADA) also recommended the<br />
	ASC X12N 837 for the dental claim standard.<br />
	    The ASC X12N 837 was selected as the standard for the professional<br />
	(physician/supplier) claim because it met the principles above. The<br />
	only other candidate standard, the National Standard Format, was<br />
	developed primarily by HCFA for Medicare claims. While it is widely<br />
	used, it is not always used in a standard manner. Thus, we declined to<br />
	adopt the National Standard Format. Many variations of the National<br />
	Standard Format are in use. Moreover, the NUCC, the AMA, and WEDI<br />
	recommended the ASC X12N 837 for the professional claim standard.<br />
	    The ASC X12N 837 was selected as the standard for the institutional<br />
	(hospital, nursing facilities and similar inpatient institutions) claim<br />
	because it met the principles above. The only other candidate standard<br />
	was the UB-92 Format developed by HCFA for Medicare claims. While the<br />
	UB-92 is widely used, it is not always used in a standard manner.<br />
	Consequently, we did not elect to adopt the UB-92.<br />
	    The selection of the ASC X12N 837 does not impose a greater burden<br />
	on the industry than the nonselected options because the nonselected<br />
	formats are not used in a standard manner by the industry and they do<br />
	not incorporate the flexibility necessary to adapt easily to change.<br />
	The ASC X12N 837 presents significant advantages in terms of<br />
	universality and flexibility.<br />
	3. Specific Impact of Adoption of the ASC X12N 835 for Receipt of<br />
	Health Care Remittance<br />
	    a. Affected Entities. Health care providers that conduct EDI with<br />
	health plans and that do not wish to change their internal systems will<br />
	have to convert the ASC X12N 835 transactions received from health<br />
	plans into a format compatible with their internal systems either by<br />
	using a translator or a health care clearinghouse. Health plans that<br />
	want to transmit remittance advice directly to health care providers<br />
	and that do not use the ASC X12N 835 will also incur costs to convert<br />
	to the standard. Many health care providers and health plans do not use<br />
	this standard at this time. We do not have information to quantify the<br />
	standard's use outside the Medicare program. However, according to<br />
	Medicare statistics, in 1996, 15.9 percent of part B health care<br />
	providers and 99.4 percent of part A health care providers were able to<br />
	receive this standard. All Medicare contractors must be able to send<br />
	the standard.<br />
	    Some of the possible effects of adopting the ASC X12N 835 include<br />
	the potential for an initial delay in payment or the issuance of<br />
	electronic remittance during a plan's transition to the standard format<br />
	and the possibility that health care providers could react adversely to<br />
	implementation costs and thus, revert to hard copy remittance notices<br />
	in lieu of an electronic transmission.<br />
	    Despite the initial problems health care providers may encounter<br />
	with administrative simplification, health care providers will, in the<br />
	long run, enjoy the advantage associated with not having to keep track<br />
	of or accept different electronic payment/remittance advice formats<br />
	issued by different health plans. This will simplify automatic posting<br />
	of all electronic payment/remittance advice data, thus reducing<br />
	administrative expenses. This will also reduce or eliminate the<br />
	practice of posting payment/remittance advice data manually from hard<br />
	copy notices, again reducing administrative expenses. Most manual<br />
	posting occurs currently in response to the problem of</p>
<p>[[Page 50363]]</p>
<p>multiple formats; using standard transactions will eliminate this<br />
	burden.<br />
	    Additionally, once the ASC X12N 835 has been implemented, health<br />
	plans' coordination of benefits activities, which will use the ASC X12N<br />
	837 format supplemented with limited data from the ASC X12N 835, will<br />
	be greatly simplified because all health plans will use the same<br />
	standard format.<br />
	    As long as they meet the deadlines specified in the statute, health<br />
	plans will be able to schedule their implementation of the ASC X12N 835<br />
	in a manner that best fits their needs, thus allaying some costs<br />
	through coordination of conversion to other standards.<br />
	    The selection of the ASC X12N 835 does not impose a greater burden<br />
	on the industry than the nonselected options because the nonselected<br />
	formats are not used in a standard manner by the industry and they do<br />
	not incorporate the flexibility necessary to adapt easily to change.<br />
	The ASC X12N 835 presents significant advantages in terms of<br />
	universality and flexibility.<br />
	    b. Effects of Various Options. We assessed the various options for<br />
	a standard payment/remittance advice transaction against the principles<br />
	listed above which aim at achieving the maximum benefit for the least<br />
	cost. We found that the ASC X12N 835 met all the principles, but no<br />
	other candidate standard transaction met all the principles, or even<br />
	those principles supporting the regulatory goal of cost-effectiveness.<br />
	    The ASC X12N 835 was selected as it met the principles above. The<br />
	only other candidate standard, the ASC X12N 820, was not selected<br />
	because, although it was developed for payment transactions, it was not<br />
	developed for health care claims payment purposes. The ASC X12N<br />
	subcommittee itself recognized this in its decision to develop the ASC<br />
	X12N 835.<br />
	4. Specific Impact of Adoption of the ASC X12N 276/277 for Health Care<br />
	Claim Status/Response<br />
	    a. Affected Entities. Most health care providers that are currently<br />
	using an electronic format for claim status inquiries (of which there<br />
	are currently very few) and that wish to request claim status<br />
	electronically using the ASC X12N 276/277 will incur conversion costs.<br />
	We cannot quantify the number of health care providers that will have<br />
	to convert to the standard, but we do know that no Medicare contractors<br />
	use the standard; thus, we assume that few health care providers are<br />
	able to use it at this time.<br />
	    After implementation, health care providers will be able to request<br />
	and receive the status of claims in one standard format from all health<br />
	care plans. This will eliminate their need to maintain redundant<br />
	software and will make electronic claim status requests and receipt of<br />
	responses feasible for small health care providers, eliminating their<br />
	need to manually send and review claim status requests and responses.<br />
	    Health plans that do not currently directly accept electronic claim<br />
	status requests and do not directly send electronic claims status<br />
	responses will have to modify their systems to accept the ASC X12N 276<br />
	and to send the ASC X12N 277. No disruptions in claims processing or<br />
	payment should occur.<br />
	    After implementation, health plans will be able to submit claim<br />
	status responses in one standard format to all health care providers.<br />
	Administrative costs incurred by supporting multiple formats and<br />
	manually responding to claim status requests will be greatly reduced.<br />
	    b. Effects of Various Options. There are no known options for a<br />
	standard claims status and response transaction.<br />
	5. Specific Impact of Adoption of the ASC X12N 834 for Enrollment and<br />
	Disenrollment in a Health Plan<br />
	    a. Affected entities. The ASC X12N 834 may be used by an employer<br />
	or other sponsor to electronically enroll or disenroll its subscribers<br />
	into or out of a health plan. Currently, most small and medium size<br />
	employers and other sponsors conduct their subscriber enrollments using<br />
	paper forms. We cannot quantify how many of these sponsors use paper<br />
	forms, but anecdotal information indicates that most use paper. We<br />
	understand that large employers and other sponsors are more likely to<br />
	electronically conduct subscriber enrollment transactions because this<br />
	method makes it easier to respond to the many changes that occur in a<br />
	large workforce; for example, hirings, firings, retirements, marriages,<br />
	births, and deaths. Large employers currently use proprietary<br />
	electronic data interchange formats, which differ among health plans,<br />
	in order to conduct subscriber enrollment. Nonetheless, it is our<br />
	understanding, based on anecdotal information, that health plans still<br />
	use paper to conduct most of their enrollment transactions.<br />
	    We expect that the impact of the ASC X12N 834 transaction standard<br />
	will differ, at least in the beginning, according to the current use of<br />
	electronic transactions. As stated earlier, at the present time, most<br />
	small and medium size employers and other sponsors do not use<br />
	electronic transactions and will therefore experience little immediate<br />
	impact from the adoption of the ASC X12N 834 transaction. The ASC X12N<br />
	834 will offer large employers, currently conducting enrollment<br />
	transactions electronically, the opportunity to shift to a single<br />
	standard format. A single standard will be most attractive to those<br />
	large employers that offer their subscribers choices among multiple<br />
	health plans. Thus, the early benefits of the ASC X12N 834 will accrue<br />
	to large employers and other sponsors that will be able to eliminate<br />
	duplicative hardware and software, and human resources required to<br />
	support multiple proprietary electronic data interchange formats. In<br />
	the long run, we expect that the standards will lower the costs of<br />
	conducting enrollment transactions, thus making it possible for small<br />
	and medium size companies to achieve significant additional savings by<br />
	converting from paper to electronic transactions.<br />
	    Overall, employers and other sponsors, and the health plans with<br />
	which they deal, stand to benefit from the adoption of the ASC X12N 834<br />
	and electronic data interchange. The ASC X12N 834 and electronic data<br />
	interchange will facilitate the performance of enrollment and<br />
	disenrollment functions. Further, the ASC X12N 834 supports detailed<br />
	enrollment information on the subscriber's dependents, which is often<br />
	lacking in current practice. Ultimately, reductions in administrative<br />
	overhead may be passed along in lower premiums to subscribers and their<br />
	dependents.<br />
	    b. Effects of Various Options. The only other option, the NCPDP<br />
	Member Enrollment Standard, does not meet the selection criteria and<br />
	would not be implemented in the larger health industry setting.<br />
	6. Specific Impact of Adoption of the ASC X12N 270/271 for Eligibility<br />
	for a Health Plan<br />
	    a. Affected Entities. The ASC X12N 270/271 transaction may be used<br />
	by a health care provider to electronically request and receive<br />
	eligibility information from a health care plan prior to providing or<br />
	billing for a health care service. Many health care providers routinely<br />
	verify health insurance coverage and benefit limitations both prior to<br />
	providing treatment and/or before preparing claims for submission to<br />
	the insured patient and his or her health plan. Currently, health care<br />
	providers secure most of these eligibility determinations through<br />
	telephone calls, proprietary point of sale terminals, or</p>
<p>[[Page 50364]]</p>
<p>using proprietary electronic formats that differ from health plan to<br />
	health plan. Since many health care providers participate in multiple<br />
	health plans, these health care providers must maintain duplicative<br />
	software and hardware, as well as human resources to obtain eligibility<br />
	information. This process is inefficient, often burdensome, and takes<br />
	valuable time that could otherwise be devoted to patient care.<br />
	    The lack of a health care industry standard may have imposed a cost<br />
	barrier to the widespread use of electronic data interchange. The ASC<br />
	X12N 270/271 is used widely, but not exclusively, by health care plans<br />
	and health care providers; this may be due, in part, to the lack of an<br />
	industry-wide implementation specification for these transactions in<br />
	health care. We expect that adoption of the ASC X12N 270/271 and its<br />
	implementation specification will lower the cost of using electronic<br />
	eligibility verifications. Use of the ASC X12N 270/271 and its<br />
	implementation specification will benefit health care providers because<br />
	they will be able to move to a single standard format. Consequently,<br />
	electronic data interchange will be feasible for the first time for<br />
	small health plans and health care providers that rely currently on the<br />
	telephone, paper forms, or proprietary point of sale terminals and<br />
	software.<br />
	    b. Effect of Various Options. There were two other options, the ASC<br />
	X12N IHCEBI, and its companion, IHCEBR, and the NCPDP<br />
	Telecommunications Standard Format. None of these meet the selection<br />
	criteria and thus they would not be implementable.<br />
	7. Specific Impact of Adoption of the ASC X12N 820 for Payroll Deducted<br />
	and Other Group Premium Payment for Insurance Product<br />
	    a. Affected Entities. An employer or sponsor can respond to a bill<br />
	from a health plan by using the ASC X12N 820 to electronically transmit<br />
	a remittance notice to accompany a payment for health insurance<br />
	premiums. Payment may be in the form of a paper check or an electronic<br />
	funds transfer transaction. The ASC X12N 820 can be sent with<br />
	electronic funds transfer instructions that are routed directly to the<br />
	Federal Reserve System's automated health care clearinghouses or with<br />
	payments generated directly by the employer's or other sponsor's bank.<br />
	The ASC X12N 820 transaction is widely used by many industries<br />
	(manufacturing, for instance) and government agencies (Department of<br />
	Defense) in addition to the insurance industry in general. However, the<br />
	ASC X12N 820 is not widely used in the health insurance industry and is<br />
	not widely used by employers and other sponsors to make premium<br />
	payments to their health insurers. This may be due, in part, to the<br />
	lack of an implementation specification specifically for health<br />
	insurance.<br />
	    Currently, most payment transactions are conducted on paper, and<br />
	those that are conducted electronically use proprietary electronic data<br />
	interchange standards that differ across health plans. We cannot<br />
	quantify how many of these transactions are conducted on paper, but<br />
	anecdotal information suggests that most are. We believe that the lack<br />
	of a health care industry standard may have imposed a cost barrier to<br />
	the use of electronic data interchange; larger employers and other<br />
	sponsors that often transact business with multiple health plans need<br />
	to retain duplicative hardware and software, and human resources to<br />
	support multiple proprietary electronic premium payment standards. We<br />
	expect that the adoption of national standards will lower the cost of<br />
	using electronic premium payments. This will benefit large employers<br />
	that can move to a single standard format; national standards will make<br />
	electronic transmissions of premium payments feasible for the first<br />
	time for smaller employers and other sponsors whose payment<br />
	transactions have been performed almost exclusively in paper.<br />
	    At some point, an organization's size and complexity will require<br />
	it to consider switching its business transactions from paper to<br />
	electronic formats, due to the savings and efficiencies conversion<br />
	would produce. The ASC X12N 820 would facilitate premium payment by<br />
	eliminating redundant proprietary formats that are certain to arise<br />
	when there are no widely accepted common standards. By eliminating the<br />
	software, hardware, and human resources associated with redundancy, a<br />
	business may reach the point where it becomes cost beneficial to<br />
	convert from paper to electronic transactions. Also, those sponsors and<br />
	health care plans that already support more than one proprietary format<br />
	will incur some additional expense in the conversion to the standard,<br />
	but they would enjoy longer term savings that result from eliminating<br />
	the redundancies.<br />
	    b. Effects of Various Options. There are no known options for<br />
	premium payment transactions.<br />
	8. Specific Impact of Adoption of ASC X12N 278 for Referral<br />
	Certification and Authorization<br />
	    a. Affected Entities. The ASC X12N 278 may be used by a health care<br />
	provider to electronically request and receive approval from a health<br />
	plan prior to providing a health care service. Prior approvals have<br />
	become standard operating procedure for most hospitals, physicians and<br />
	other health care providers due to the rapid growth of managed care.<br />
	Health care providers secure most of their prior approvals through<br />
	telephone calls, paper forms or proprietary electronic formats that<br />
	differ from health plan to health plan. Since many health care<br />
	providers participate in multiple managed care health plans, they must<br />
	devote redundant software, hardware, and human resources to obtaining<br />
	prior authorization; this process is often untimely and inefficient.<br />
	    The lack of a health care industry standard may have imposed a cost<br />
	barrier to the widespread use of electronic data interchange. The ASC<br />
	X12N 278 is not widely used by health plans and health care providers,<br />
	which may be due, in part, to the lack of an industry-wide<br />
	implementation specification for it. The adoption of the ASC X12N 278<br />
	and its implementation specification will lower the cost of using<br />
	electronic prior authorizations. This will benefit health care<br />
	providers that can move to a single standard format; the standard<br />
	transaction will also make electronic data interchange feasible for the<br />
	first time for smaller health plans and health care providers that<br />
	perform these transactions almost exclusively using the telephone or<br />
	paper.<br />
	    At some point, an organization's size and complexity will require<br />
	it to consider switching its business transactions from paper to<br />
	electronic form, due to the savings and efficiencies conversion would<br />
	produce. The ASC X12N 278 will facilitate that by eliminating<br />
	duplicative proprietary formats that are certain to arise when there<br />
	are no widely accepted standards. By eliminating the software,<br />
	hardware, and human resources associated with redundancy, a business<br />
	may reach the point where it becomes cost beneficial to convert from<br />
	paper to electronic transactions. Health plans and health care<br />
	providers that already support more than one proprietary format will<br />
	incur some additional expense in converting to the standard, but will<br />
	enjoy longer term savings that result from eliminating the<br />
	redundancies.<br />
	    b. Effects of Various Options. There are no known options for<br />
	referral and certification authorization transactions.</p>
<p>VII. Federalism</p>
<p>    Executive Order 13132 of August 4, 1999, Federalism, published in<br />
	the Federal Register on August 10, 1999 (64</p>
<p>[[Page 50365]]</p>
<p>FR 43255) requires us to ensure meaningful and timely input by State<br />
	and local officials in the development of rules that have Federalism<br />
	implications. Although the proposed rule (63 FR 25272) was published<br />
	before the enactment of this Executive Order, the Department consulted<br />
	with State and local officials as part of an outreach program early in<br />
	the process of developing the proposed regulation. The Department<br />
	received comments on the proposed rule from State agencies and from<br />
	entities who conduct transactions with State agencies. Many of the<br />
	comments referred to the costs incurred by State and local governments<br />
	which will result from implementation of the HIPAA standards. We assume<br />
	that government entities will have these costs offset by future<br />
	savings, consistent with our projections for the private sector. A<br />
	Congressional Budget Office analysis made the following points: States<br />
	are already in the forefront of administering the Medicaid program<br />
	electronically, Medicaid State agencies can compensate (for these<br />
	costs) by reducing other expenditures, and the Federal government pays<br />
	a portion of the cost of converting State Medicaid Management<br />
	Information Systems.<br />
	    Other comments regarding States expressed the need for<br />
	clarification as to when State agencies were subject to the standards.<br />
	Responses to comments from States and State organizations regarding the<br />
	standard transactions set forth in this rule are found in this<br />
	preamble.<br />
	    In complying with the requirements of part C of title XI, the<br />
	Secretary established interdepartmental implementation teams who<br />
	consulted with appropriate State and Federal agencies and private<br />
	organizations. These external groups consisted of the NCVHS<br />
	Subcommittee on Standards and Security, the Workgroup for Electronic<br />
	Data Interchange (WEDI), the National Uniform Claim Committee (NUCC),<br />
	the National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC) and the American Dental<br />
	Association (ADA). The teams also received comments on the proposed<br />
	regulation from a variety of organizations, including State Medicaid<br />
	agencies and other Federal agencies.</p>
<p>VIII. Interaction with Privacy</p>
<p>    The Secretary has developed this rule in conjunction with the<br />
	development of standards to protect the privacy of individually<br />
	identifiable health information, including information that will be<br />
	transmitted pursuant to these transaction standards. Compliance with<br />
	the privacy standards will be required at approximately the same time<br />
	as the compliance dates of this rule. If the privacy standards are<br />
	substantially delayed, or if Congress fails to adopt comprehensive and<br />
	effective privacy standards that supercede the standards we are<br />
	developing, we would seriously consider suspending the application of<br />
	the transaction standards or taking action to withdraw this rule.</p>

<p>Sec. 162.923  Requirements for covered entities.</p>
<p>    (a) General rule. Except as otherwise provided in this part, if a<br />
	covered entity conducts with another covered entity (or within the same<br />
	covered entity), using electronic media, a transaction for which the<br />
	Secretary has adopted a standard under this part, the covered entity<br />
	must conduct the transaction as a standard transaction.<br />
	    (b) Exception for direct data entry transactions. A health care<br />
	provider electing to use direct data entry offered by a health plan to<br />
	conduct a transaction for which a standard has been adopted under this<br />
	part must use the applicable data content and data condition<br />
	requirements of the standard when conducting the transaction. The<br />
	health care provider is not required to use the format requirements of<br />
	the standard.<br />
	    (c) Use of a business associate. A covered entity may use a<br />
	business associate, including a health care clearinghouse, to conduct a<br />
	transaction covered by this part. If a covered entity chooses to use a<br />
	business associate to conduct all or part of a transaction on behalf of<br />
	the covered entity, the covered entity must require the business<br />
	associate to do the following:<br />
	    (1) Comply with all applicable requirements of this part.<br />
	    (2) Require any agent or subcontractor to comply with all<br />
	applicable requirements of this part.</p>
<p>Sec. 162.925  Additional requirements for health plans.</p>
<p>    (a) General rules. (1) If an entity requests a health plan to<br />
	conduct a transaction as a standard transaction, the health plan must<br />
	do so.<br />
	    (2) A health plan may not delay or reject a transaction, or attempt<br />
	to adversely affect the other entity or the transaction, because the<br />
	transaction is a standard transaction.<br />
	    (3) A health plan may not reject a standard transaction on the<br />
	basis that it contains data elements not needed or used by the health<br />
	plan (for example, coordination of benefits information).<br />
	    (4) A health plan may not offer an incentive for a health care<br />
	provider to conduct a transaction covered by this part as a transaction<br />
	described under the exception provided for in Sec. 162.923(b).<br />
	    (5) A health plan that operates as a health care clearinghouse, or<br />
	requires an entity to use a health care clearinghouse to receive,<br />
	process, or transmit a standard transaction may not charge fees or<br />
	costs in excess of the fees or costs for normal telecommunications that<br />
	the entity incurs when it directly transmits, or receives, a standard<br />
	transaction to, or from, a health plan.<br />
	    (b) Coordination of benefits. If a health plan receives a standard<br />
	transaction and coordinates benefits with another health plan (or<br />
	another payer), it must store the coordination of benefits data it<br />
	needs to forward the standard transaction to the other health plan (or<br />
	other payer).<br />
	    (c) Code sets. A health plan must meet each of the following<br />
	requirements:<br />
	    (1) Accept and promptly process any standard transaction that<br />
	contains codes that are valid, as provided in subpart J of this part.<br />
	    (2) Keep code sets for the current billing period and appeals<br />
	periods still open to processing under the terms of the health plan's<br />
	coverage.</p>
<p>Sec. 162.930  Additional rules for health care clearinghouses.</p>
<p>    When acting as a business associate for another covered entity, a<br />
	health care clearinghouse may perform the following functions:<br />
	    (a) Receive a standard transaction on behalf of the covered entity<br />
	and translate it into a nonstandard transaction (for example,<br />
	nonstandard format and/or nonstandard data content) for transmission to<br />
	the covered entity.<br />
	    (b) Receive a nonstandard transaction (for example, nonstandard<br />
	format and/or nonstandard data content) from the covered entity and<br />
	translate it into a standard transaction for transmission on behalf of<br />
	the covered entity.</p>
<p>Sec. 162.940  Exceptions from standards to permit testing of proposed<br />
	modifications.</p>
<p>    (a) Requests for an exception. An organization may request an<br />
	exception from the use of a standard from the Secretary to test a<br />
	proposed modification to that standard. For each proposed modification,<br />
	the organization must meet the following requirements:<br />
	    (1) Comparison to a current standard. Provide a detailed<br />
	explanation, no more than 10 pages in length, of how the proposed<br />
	modification would be a significant improvement to the current standard<br />
	in terms of the following principles:<br />
	    (i) Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care<br />
	system by leading to cost reductions for, or improvements in benefits<br />
	from, electronic health care transactions.<br />
	    (ii) Meet the needs of the health data standards user community,<br />
	particularly health care providers, health plans, and health care<br />
	clearinghouses.<br />
	    (iii) Be uniform and consistent with the other standards adopted<br />
	under this part and, as appropriate, with other private and public<br />
	sector health data standards.<br />
	    (iv) Have low additional development and implementation costs<br />
	relative to the benefits of using the standard.<br />
	    (v) Be supported by an ANSI-accredited SSO or other private or<br />
	public organization that would maintain the standard over time.<br />
	    (vi) Have timely development, testing, implementation, and updating<br />
	procedures to achieve administrative simplification benefits faster.<br />
	    (vii) Be technologically independent of the computer platforms and<br />
	transmission protocols used in electronic health transactions, unless<br />
	they are explicitly part of the standard.<br />
	    (viii) Be precise, unambiguous, and as simple as possible.<br />
	    (ix) Result in minimum data collection and paperwork burdens on<br />
	users.<br />
	    (x) Incorporate flexibility to adapt more easily to changes in the<br />
	health care infrastructure (such as new services, organizations, and<br />
	provider types) and information technology.<br />
	    (2) Specifications for the proposed modification. Provide<br />
	specifications for the proposed modification, including any additional<br />
	system requirements.<br />
	    (3) Testing of the proposed modification. Provide an explanation,<br />
	no more than 5 pages in length, of how the organization intends to test<br />
	the standard, including the number and types of health plans and health<br />
	care providers expected to be involved in the test, geographical areas,<br />
	and beginning and ending dates of the test.<br />
	    (4) Trading partner concurrences. Provide written concurrences from<br />
	trading partners who would agree to participate in the test.<br />
	    (b) Basis for granting an exception. The Secretary may grant an<br />
	initial exception, for a period not to exceed 3 years, based on, but<br />
	not limited to, the following criteria:<br />
	    (1) An assessment of whether the proposed modification demonstrates<br />
	a significant improvement to the current standard.<br />
	    (2) The extent and length of time of the exception.<br />
	    (3) Consultations with DSMOs.<br />
	    (c) Secretary's decision on exception. The Secretary makes a<br />
	decision and</p>
<p>[[Page 50370]]</p>
<p>notifies the organization requesting the exception whether the request<br />
	is granted or denied.<br />
	    (1) Exception granted. If the Secretary grants an exception, the<br />
	notification includes the following information:<br />
	    (i) The length of time for which the exception applies.<br />
	    (ii) The trading partners and geographical areas the Secretary<br />
	approves for testing.<br />
	    (iii) Any other conditions for approving the exception.<br />
	    (2) Exception denied. If the Secretary does not grant an exception,<br />
	the notification explains the reasons the Secretary considers the<br />
	proposed modification would not be a significant improvement to the<br />
	current standard and any other rationale for the denial.<br />
	    (d) Organization's report on test results. Within 90 days after the<br />
	test is completed, an organization that receives an exception must<br />
	submit a report on the results of the test, including a cost-benefit<br />
	analysis, to a location specified by the Secretary by notice in the<br />
	Federal Register.<br />
	    (e) Extension allowed. If the report submitted in accordance with<br />
	paragraph (d) of this section recommends a modification to the<br />
	standard, the Secretary, on request, may grant an extension to the<br />
	period granted for the exception.</p>
