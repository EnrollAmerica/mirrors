<p>The policy debate regarding the merits of an expanded Federal role in  		providing financial assistance to elderly individuals with long-term care needs  		continues. In this debate, there appears to be a growing consensus that if an  		expanded Federal role is enacted, long-term care benefits should be allocated  		to the elderly on the basis of objective functional criteria, particularly  		functioning in the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). This consensus has  		evolved from a considerable body of research which has demonstrated that  		measures of functioning in Activities of Daily Living are an extremely  		effective approach for assessing the need for long-term care assistance. As  		articulated by Drs. Robert and Rosalie Kane, two renowned researchers in  		long-term care:</p>
<blockquote><p>Functional ability is the key to defining the need for long-term care.  		  An emphasis on functioning taps into the behavioral consequences of chronic  		  disease or ill health, rather than focusing on the disease itself.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based upon research which has linked measures of functional performance  		and the need for assistance, Federal policy initiatives in long-term care  		generally focus on functional criteria as the basis of allocating long-term  		care benefits. The eligibility of elderly persons to receive publicly-supported  		long-term care benefits will be determined on the basis of functional measures  		of performance, on the assumption that such measures are the best indicator of  		"need" available. Accordingly, most of the legislation which has been developed  		to expand the Federal government's role in financing long-term care services  		for the elderly propose to use functional criteria as the eligibility triggers  		for allocating benefits.</p>
<p>This paper discusses the policy implications of such an approach.  		Although research has documented the link between measures of ADL performance  		and the need for services, developing a long-term care program which allocates  		resources on the same basis must address an entirely new set of issues. Our  		paper does not say it can't be done; it's purpose, however, is to move the  		discussion from a research context into a policy context. If we have such a  		system for allocating benefits, what will it look like? What problems are  		likely to arise? How can we estimate the costs of such a program? How might  		functional criteria interact with other eligibility criteria in the allocation  		of benefits? As someone once said: "The unfortunate thing about policy is that  		it has to be implemented. Implementation is like original sin, it can't be  		avoided." And as program managers are well aware, there is a considerable  		amount of implementation which takes place between the enactment of a piece of  		long-term care legislation and the point at which an elderly beneficiary walks  		in the door and says: "Am I eligible for these services or not?"</p>
<p>In <a href="#chap2">Chapter 2</a>, we begin with a discussion of how  		existing long-term care programs employ functional criteria in determining  		eligibility for benefits on the premise that future policy initiatives should  		naturally draw upon what has been learned in the real world. In  		<a href="#chap3">Chapter 3</a>, we summarize various strategies for triggering  		benefits based on functional measures of performance, as proposed by the most  		current Congressional legislation for financing long-term care services.  		Finally, <a href="#chap4">Chapter 4</a> provides a discussion of some of the  		policy implications of rationing long-term care services based on functional  		eligibility criteria.</p>
<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2">CHAPTER 2. THE ALLOCATION OF LONG-TERM CARE BENEFITS IN  		EXISTING PROGRAMS</a></h2>
<p>In examining the policy implications of allocating long-term care  		benefits based on functional criteria, it is obviously useful to review how  		existing third-party payers of long-term care services determine eligibility  		for benefits. Long-term care services are currently provided to functionally  		impaired elderly persons under a wide variety of financing mechanisms,  		including Medicare, Medicaid, State-funded home care programs, and private  		long-term care insurance. Each of these financing mechanisms has had to develop  		eligibility criteria for determining who receives benefits and who does not.  		All of these financing mechanisms include functional criteria in the allocation  		of long-term care benefits, although it is extremely important to note that  		functional criteria are not the sole determinants of benefit eligibility in  		these programs--other eligibility criteria are used as well.</p>
<p>This chapter presents an overview of the functional criteria presently  		employed in the allocation of long-term care benefits, and how other  		eligibility criteria used in the allocation of benefits interact with these  		functional criteria. Lessons which might be drawn from the "real world" of  		long-term care benefit management in developing future long-term care  		eligibility criteria are discussed in <a href="#chap4">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
<h3>2.1 Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF)  		Benefits</h3>
<p>Of all the long-term care benefit packages presently in existence, the  		Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) benefit is probably the most  		restrictive. In fact, the criteria used in determining eligibility for SNF  		benefits make it clear that the Medicare SNF benefit is strictly for "subacute  		or rehabilitative" care, and not for custodial care. The Medicare SNF benefit  		was originally enacted and is presently administered as "extended hospital  		care" for patients who are still recovering from an acute illness episode, but  		who can be more economically served in a skilled nursing facility, rather than  		an inpatient hospital setting.</p>
<p>To be eligible for Medicare SNF coverage, a Medicare beneficiary must  		require "on a daily basis, skilled nursing care (provided directly by, or  		requiring the supervision of, skilled nursing personnel) or other skilled  		rehabilitation services which, as a practical matter, can only be provided in a  		skilled nursing facility on an in-patient basis, for any of the conditions with  		respect to which he was receiving inpatient hospital services."<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> The regulations governing  		Medicare SNF coverage and the Medicare Intermediary Manual are quite specific  		in defining what type of patients and conditions are considered to require  		skilled care, and eligible for coverage, as opposed to requiring custodial care  		only, and not eligible. Custodial care is defined as care "which serves to  		assist the individual in the activities of daily living--such as assistance in  		walking, getting in and out of bed, bathing, dressing, feeding, and using the  		toilet, preparation of special diets, and supervision of medication that  		usually can be self-administered. Custodial care essentially is personal care  		that does not require the continuing attention of trained medical or  		paramedical personnel." Thus, the same functional criteria which are generally  		used to determine eligibility for other long-term care benefits (deficits in  		activities of daily living) are specifically cited as <i>not eligible</i> for  		coverage under the Medicare SNF benefit, if skilled nursing care is not also  		required.</p>
<p>Other eligibility criteria for Medicare SNF coverage serve to reinforce  		the distinction between subacute and long-term care. These criteria  		include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>SNF services are only covered after an individual has been  			 transferred from a hospital in which he was a patient for not less than three  			 consecutive days before discharge; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SNF services must have been necessitated by the same condition which  			 occasioned the patient's qualifying hospital stay.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The subacute character of the Medicare SNF benefit is also reflected in  		its benefit provisions, which limit coverage to 100 days per spell of illness,  		with, a significant coinsurance requirement for days 21 to 100. In 1987, less  		than one percent of Medicare enrollees received Medicare- covered SNF benefits,  		and the average number of covered days per admission was 21.5.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Effective April 1, 1988, HFCA issued new implementing instructions for  		reviewing SNF claims "for greater clarity and in order to help ensure that the  		guidelines are implemented in a uniform and consistent manner."<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> Although HCFA claims that the new  		guidelines represent only clarifications of current coverage policies, and not  		a liberalization of functional eligibility criteria, there was a significant  		increase in the number of SNF claims submitted by providers after  		implementation of the new guidelines. One possible "clarification" which may  		have contributed to the increase in submitted claims was that the new  		guidelines made clear that "a service that is ordinarily considered nonskilled  		could be considered a skilled service in cases in which, because of special  		medical complications, skilled nursing or skilled rehabilitation personnel are  		required to perform or supervise it or to observe the patient." Thus, the new  		guidelines made it clear that if the overall management and supervision of a  		patient require skilled nursing personnel, although the direct services  		provided to the patient may not require skilled care, that the care nonetheless  		qualifies as skilled care for the purposes of Medicare SNF coverage.</p>
<p>Partly as a result of the clarifications of Medicare SNF coverage,  		Medicare SNF expenditures rose dramatically from 1988 to 1989. However, it has  		been difficult to disaggregate the independent effects of the new coverage  		guidelines and the expanded benefits enacted under the Medicare Catastrophic  		Coverage Act of 1988, which went into effect on January 1, 1989, and which  		included the elimination of the three-day prior hospitalization requirement. In  		FY 1988, Medicare SNF reimbursements totalled $883 million. Total FY 1989  		reimbursements are expected to total about $2.3 billion, an increase of 260  		percent in a single year.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup> Of course, should the expanded Medicare SNF  		benefits enacted under the, Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act (MCCA) be  		repealed, Medicare SNF reimbursements will decline by some amount, and it may  		be possible to better ascertain the independent impact of the new coverage  		guidelines on utilization and costs.</p>
<h3>2.2 Medicare Home Health Benefit</h3>
<p>Medicare will pay for home health visits, including nursing care;  		physical, occupational or speech therapy; medical social services; home health  		aide services; and durable medical equipment and supplies, for eligible  		Medicare beneficiaries. To be eligible for Medicare home health services, an  		individual must be certified by a physician as in need of skilled nursing  		services on an "intermittent" (as opposed to continuous) basis. To meet the  		requirement for "intermittent" skilled nursing care, an individual must have a  		medically predictable recurring need for skilled nursing services, which in  		most instances will be met if a patient requires a skilled nursing service at  		least once every 90 days.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup> On the other hand, a patient who is expected  		to need more or less full-time skilled nursing care over an extended period of  		time would not qualify for home health benefits.</p>
<p>A final functional requirement that is unique to this benefit is that an  		eligible beneficiary must be "confined to his home." An individual is  		considered confined to his home if he has a condition which restricts his  		ability to leave his home, except with the assistance of another person or the  		aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, wheelchair, or a walker),  		or if he has a condition such that leaving the home is medically  		contraindicated. This "homebound" requirement has been one of the more  		controversial eligibility criteria for Medicare home health benefits, and it  		has been necessary for HCFA to clarify that the requirement doesn't necessarily  		mean that the individual can never leave his home in order to maintain  		eligibility for benefits.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that while the Medicare home health benefit  		can include assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), there are no  		specific eligibility requirements concerning the level of ADL impairment  		required to receive home health aide services, only that the need for home  		health aide services be certified by a physician, and that the specific  		services to be provided be determined by a registered professional nurse.</p>
<p>In 1987, approximately 1.6 million Medicare beneficiaries received home  		health care benefits, or about 5 percent of the total enrolled population.  		Medicare reimbursement for home health visits in 1987 totalled just under $1.8  		billion.</p>
<h3>2.3 Proposed Medicare Respite Care Benefit</h3>
<p>The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act included coverage of in-home  		respite care for certain chronically dependent individuals. This benefit  		represented the first time in which impairments in ADLs were specifically used  		as eligibility criteria for Medicare-covered services. The Act defined a  		chronically dependent individual as someone who was certified by a physician as  		being dependent on a voluntary caregiver for assistance with at least two of  		the five following activities of daily living: (1) eating; (2) bathing; (3)  		dressing; (4) toileting; and (5) transferring in and out of a bed or in and out  		of a chair.</p>
<p>It is important to note that in enacting the respite care benefit,  		however, Congress attached additional restrictions to the benefit in order to  		reduce its estimated cost. The Medicare respite benefit was restricted to  		persons who had met either the Part B out-of-pocket limit ($1,370 in 1990) or  		the prescription drug deductible ($600 in 1991). Once the deductible was met in  		any given year, a beneficiary would remain eligible for respite care services  		for 12 months thereafter.</p>
<h3>2.4 Medicaid Nursing Home Benefits</h3>
<p>Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) services are a mandatory Medicaid benefit  		for eligible persons in all States. States may opt to cover services received  		in Intermediate Care Facilities (ICF), and virtually all States offer this  		benefit.</p>
<p>Individual States are given considerable leeway in determining  		functional eligibility criteria for Medicaid coverage of nursing home care.  		Federal Medicaid regulations only stipulate that a physician must certify an  		individual's need for care in a SNF or ICF, and additionally, that those  		receiving care in an ICF must be assessed by an interdisciplinary team of  		health professionals to determine need for care. These criteria are referred to  		as "Level of Care" criteria. Initial certification of the need for SNF or ICF  		care must be made upon admission, and periodic recertifications must be made  		thereafter. Recertification of SNF services is required every 30 days in the  		first three months of a stay, and every 60 days thereafter. Recertification of  		the need for ICF services is required at 60 days, 180 days, 12 months, 18  		months, 24 months, and every 12 months thereafter.</p>
<p>Some States have developed more formal Level of Care procedures by  		requiring Preadmission Screening (PAS) of persons seeking nursing home  		admission. State approaches vary considerably. Some require only  		Medicaid-eligible applicants to be screened; others include persons who, once  		in the facility, are likely to "spend-down" and become Medicaid eligible after  		their private resources are depleted. A few States even require persons who are  		likely to remain private-pay residents to be screened upon admission, although  		the legality of such a requirement has been the subject of litigation.</p>
<p>The most recent national survey of State PAS programs was conducted by  		Interstudy in 1985.<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a>,<a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup> This survey found that 30 States had  		implemented some form of preadmission screening for nursing home applicants.  		Nearly all of these States screen those who are eligible for Medicaid upon  		nursing home admission. Approximately one-third of these States also require  		private-pay residents converting to Medicaid be screened at the time of  		conversion. Of those States requiring screening of the potential "spend-down"  		applicants, one State stipulates that persons who would spend-down to Medicaid  		levels in 60 days must be screened; four States require that a PAS be  		administered to applicants who would spend-down within 180 days; two States  		require applicants whose income is less than 300% of the SSI level be screened;  		and one State stipulates that those who would be "eligible soon" must be  		screened.</p>
<p>Nearly all State preadmission screening instruments collect information  		on an applicant/resident's physical health, mental health, informal social  		supports and functional status. Where the States differ, however, is the manner  		in which they use the information for deciding whether an individual is  		eligible for nursing home level of care. Some States rely upon the clinical  		acumen of the screener/assessor or upon the consensus of a review panel to  		determine eligibility. In these cases, States may also have written guidelines  		or regulations to guide the clinicians) in making a judgement. The format of  		these PAS's may consist of standard prompts/open-ended questions to which the  		interviewer responds through textual descriptions. The other type of instrument  		is more structured and provides the screener with standard prompts as well as  		categorical responses.</p>
<p>Other States, fewer in number, use objective decision rules, or  		algorithms, for deciding the appropriateness of institutionalization. These  		algorithms are applied to findings from the PAS, and an individual is  		classified either as eligible or ineligible.<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup> Examples of the decision rules used in four  		States (CT, NY, VA, OR) is presented in <a href="#exhibit2-1">Exhibit 2-1</a><a href="#exhibit2-1"></a>.<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup> As seen in the Exhibit, the decision rules  		in each of these States vary, but all rely upon some combination of ADLs and  		behavior problems/cognitive impairment to determine eligibility.</p>

</ol></td>
</tr></table><p>The differences in these screens are instructive to the extent that they  		vary in their restrictiveness. By way of relative comparison, the Connecticut  		and Oregon screens are the least restrictive of the four screens, and the  		Virginia and New York screens the most restrictive. For example, one would be  		considered nursing home eligible in Connecticut if one did not have adequate  		informal supports <b>and</b> had dependencies in bathing and dressing (2 ADLs)  		[<b>or</b> dependent in shopping, transportation, housework and laundry (4  		IADLs)]. On the other hand, in Virginia, one would have to be dependent in the  		four ADLs of mobility, transfer, toileting and eating as well as have  		inadequate informal supports in order to be nursing home eligible. In comparing  		the two approaches, Virginia seems to exclude from eligibility persons with  		impairments in only the ADLs of bathing and/or dressing. Since it has been  		demonstrated that dependency in these two ADL items is likely to appear before  		dependencies in other ADL (i.e. those used in the Virginia screen), the  		Virginia screen is likely to exclude from eligibility persons who would be  		determined nursing home eligible on the basis of the Connecticut screen.</p>
<p>Some recent research corroborates empirically this contextual  		analysis.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup> Decision  		rules derived from each of the four State screens were applied to a 50% random  		sample of control group participants in the Channeling demonstration study  		(baseline). The percent of subjects classified as nursing home eligible under  		each State PAS was then calculated. <a href="#table2-1">Table 2-1</a> shows  		that the Oregon screen would determine 95.5 percent of the sample population  		eligible for nursing home placement, while the Connecticut screen would find  		the vast majority of the sample eligible as well (81.1%). The Virginia and New  		York screens, on the other hand, would consider only 39% and 37% of this same  		group eligible for nursing home placement, respectively.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a>,<a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><p>While the restrictiveness of a screen is clearly one design  		consideration, especially in containing program costs, another factor to be  		taken into account is the relative direction of error built into a given  		screen. By being overly restrictive, a screen is likely to exclude from program  		eligibility persons who may really need nursing home services. The predominant  		errors in these screens; occur in not correctly identifying eligible persons.  		On the other hand, less restrictive screens are likely to err in the direction  		of deeming individuals eligible for nursing home services who do not require  		the level of care provided in a nursing home. A good screen tries to minimize  		both kinds of errors, but one of the other type of error is likely to  		predominate in any screen. These data underscore the observation that while  		research may inform about the types of individuals who need services--and thus  		who should be considered eligible for services, the relative restrictiveness of  		eligibility criteria also inevitably reflect public policy and the willingness  		to fund services.</p>
<h3>2.5 Medicaid Home and Community-Based Waiver  		Services</h3>
<p>Under Section 2176 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of  		1981, States may provide, under Secretarial waiver authority, certain home and  		community-based services to persons who without such services are at risk of  		placement in an institutional setting. Such services are not otherwise eligible  		for Federal Financial Participation (FFP) under the regular Medicaid program.  		In FY 1988, States spent approximately $712 million for Medicaid waiver  		services for the aged and disabled.<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup></p>
<p>To be eligible for waiver services, an applicant must meet the same  		Level of Care criteria which are used by States to certify eligibility for  		Medicaid payment in a nursing home. At their option, States may use additional  		criteria in targeting waiver services to functionally impaired Medicaid  		enrollees in order to increase the likelihood that persons receiving waiver  		services would otherwise be forced to enter a nursing home or other  		institutional setting. . A survey of 31 out of 36 States with Medicaid waivers  		for the aged and/or physically disabled conducted in 1986 showed that States  		used a variety of targeting criteria in determining eligibility for waiver  		services.<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup> For  		example, a few States limited eligibility for home and community-based waiver  		services to persons who were already placed in an institution. Some States  		incorporate measures of informal support availability in targeting waiver  		services, while other States prioritize waiver allocation decisions based on  		patient safety issues. Further, of the 21 States which had Preadmission  		Screening (PAS) programs in place for nursing home applicants, 14 (67%) had  		also incorporated their PAS programs into their assessment process for waiver  		services. However, more specific data on how States use measures of ADL and  		IADL functioning in their waiver eligibility assessment procedures are not  		generally available.</p>
<h3>2.6 Medicaid State Plan Home Care Services</h3>
<p>In addition to Medicaid waiver programs, States can provide home care  		services to eligible Medicaid enrollees under their regular State Medicaid  		plans. In general, the primary distinctions between regular State plan services  		and waiver services are that: (1) regular State plan services must always be  		certified by a physician and provided under the supervision of licensed health  		care professionals, whereas waiver services can be authorized and provided  		outside the mainstream health care system; and (2) States are provided  		increased flexibility in allocating waiver services (i.e. rationing) than is  		allowed for regular State plan services. Nonetheless, States provide a broad  		array of home care services under the personal care, adult day health, home  		health, rehabilitation and other service options under their regular State  		plans. For example, in 1987 the State of New York spent $835 million in  		Medicaid funds for the provision of personal care services to aged and disabled  		Medicaid enrollees. Again, specific data on the assessment methods used by  		States in allocating home care benefits under regular State plan services  		(beyond the Federal requirement that the services be authorized by a physician)  		are not generally available.</p>
<h3>2.7 Private Long-Term Care Insurance</h3>
<p>According to the Health Insurance Association of America there were 1.3  		million long-term care insurance policy holders as of mid-1989. Based upon  		their semiannual marketplace survey they found that 109 companies were offering  		long-term care policies, up from 103 companies as of December 1988. While the  		greatest expansion in the market occurred in employer/group coverage, the vast  		majority of policies (88 percent) were hold by individuals.<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Accompanying the growth in the private long-term care insurance market  		is a trend toward changing the criteria used to define benefit eligibility.  		Although many policies still require a prior hospital stay in order to be  		eligible for nursing home coverage (and a prior nursing home stay for home  		health benefits), an increasing number of policies now rely upon functional  		criteria, most notably ADLs, as a means for defining the insurable event. This  		trend is documented in the most recent survey conducted by Consumer  		Reports,<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup> and  		corroborated by a recent review of eligibility criteria conducted by the HIAA.  		HIAA reports that 14 out of 43 plans reported by member companies offering  		long-term care insurance used limitations in ADLs as a trigger for services  		(both institutional and community-based).<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup> The number and configuration of ADL items  		used in plans varies. Thirteen policies, however, include bathing, dressing,  		and eating. Other ADL items included are: toileting (12 plans); transferring  		(11), mobility or walking (10), and continence (2). One plan also includes  		cognitive impairment, defined as "the ability to be properly oriented as to  		time, surrounding other people and the recognition of basic human needs", as a  		criterion (p.3). And one policy includes the IADL (Instrumental Activities of  		Daily Living) items of meal preparation and medication management. Criteria for  		eligibility ranges from 1 out of 7 impairments to 3 out of 7.</p>
<p>Another survey by HIAA, focusing on home health benefits of long-term  		care insurance policies sold by HIAA member companies in 1988 and 1989, also  		indicates a move toward functional criteria for benefit  		determination.<sup><font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></sup> Only  		eight of the 28 plans reviewed rely upon functional criteria for determining  		eligibility. The others require either a prior nursing home stay or a  		physician's certification of need. When functional items are used for defining  		home-health eligibility they are similar to those cited above, with bathing,  		dressing, and eating used by all plans relying upon functional criteria.</p>
<p>In sum, while the industry seems to be moving toward using functional  		criteria for benefit determination, there seems to be only minimal agreement on  		which functional items should be used. Policies vary on the number of  		impairments used to trigger benefits, and presumably they will differ on how  		impairments are defined. The long-term care insurance market is still  		developing; one would expect that as claims begin coming in there will be more  		information forthcoming on how impairment criteria are actually operationalized  		in the benefit determination process.</p>
<h3><a name="section2.8" id="section2.8">2.8 Public-Private Long-Term Care  		Insurance Initiatives</a></h3>
<p>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has funded eight States to develop  		partnerships with insurance carriers to offer long-term care insurance. A task  		of all States involved in these initiatives is to define the criteria which  		will be used by insurers to determine eligibility for benefits. For some States  		one of the challenges of defining the insurable event is to devise criteria  		which are consistent with that used by their Medicaid programs in determining  		(non-financial) eligibility for nursing home admission.</p>
<p>Consistency between the two programs is viewed as important since the  		State will guarantee Medicaid long-term care coverage for persons who have  		purchased insurance and whose private benefits have expired (or once they have  		spent-down to the level of assets which they have protected by their policy).  		That is, these States feel that they cannot operate under a double standard  		whereby they allow less restrictive criteria for those who are promised  		Medicaid funding after their private insurance benefits expire than for those  		who are not insured privately (and must rely on Medicaid for financing their  		long-term care).</p>
<p>Connecticut is one of the partnership States which has chosen to tie the  		definition of the "insured event" to its Medicaid long-term care benefit  		criteria. Connecticut's Medicaid nursing home preadmission screen requires that  		the individual actively seek nursing home placement <b>and</b> have  		dependencies in 5-6 ADL's; or actively seek nursing home placement <b>and</b>  		have at least two out of six ADL dependencies (<b>or</b> dependencies in at  		least 4 out of 8 IADL <b>or</b> at least 4 out of 10 errors on a mental status  		questionnaire <b>or</b> evidence of wandering or abusive assaultive behavior)  		<b>and</b> the absence of a totally intact informal social support system to  		provide for the applicant's needs (See <a href="#exhibit2-1">Exhibit  		2-1</a>).<sup><font><a href="#note20">20</a></font></sup> The major  		difficulty in setting comparable criteria for the private program is that  		insurers cannot reasonably discriminate on the basis of informal support in  		paying for benefits (which Medicaid does do).</p>
<p>The other problem facing the CT partnership is that Medicaid requires  		persons to be seeking nursing home placement in order to access community-based  		(2176 waiver) services, whereas there would be no such constraint placed upon  		beneficiaries of private insurance seeking home health services. Given  		thedifferences in accessibility to community-based services, Connecticut felt  		that they needed to be somewhat more stringent in defining the insured event  		for insurance beneficiaries -- if the State was to assure the policy holder  		Medicaid coverage once s/he had spent down to the asset protection level  		defined in his/her policy. Thus, in order to compensate for the informal  		support and seeking-nursing home criteria in the Medicaid PAS, the Connecticut  		partnership program and insurers have agreed to the following criteria:</p>
<ul><li>Dependencies in at least 2 out of 6 ADL;
<p>     <b>or</b></p>
</li>
<li>Evidence of cognitive impairment indicated by any of the following  		  behavioral problems:
<ul><li>Wandering</li>
<li>Abusiveness</li>
<li>Unacceptable Hygiene or Habits</li>
<li> Threats to Health/Safety.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>If evidence of any behavior problems exists for which daily supervision  		is required, a mental status exam (Folstain's Mini-Mental State) would then be  		administered to validate that the behaviors are due to cognitive impairment,  		and not to psychiatric impairment.</p>
<p>Some insurers in the Connecticut partnership preferred to rely upon the  		mental status questionnaire items currently being used by in the PAS rather  		than using behavior problems and the Folstein to identify cognitive impairment.  		The definition of the insurable event used by these insurers will be:</p>
<ul><li>Dependencies in at least 2 out of 6 ADLs;
<p>     <b>or</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least 7 (out of 10) errors on the MSQ.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Planners in Connecticut believe that excluding the IADL criteria and  		making the cognitive criteria somewhat more stringent will result in the  		identification of comparable populations eligible for Medicaid long-term care  		benefits and for private long-term care insurance benefits.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts partnership program, on the other hand, represents a  		slightly different approach to defining benefit eligibility criteria.  		Massachusetts has chosen to use Medicaid eligibility criteria as a  		<b>guide</b>, rather than an as a standard, in developing benefit criteria.  		Thus, "in keeping with the Commonwealth's Medicaid criteria for benefit  		eligibility," persons would qualify for benefits based on the following  		criteria:</p>
<ul><li>Need for human assistance in two or more ADLs (bathing, dressing,  		  toileting, transferring, continence, eating);
<p>     <b>and</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a medical need <b>or</b> demonstrate evidence of mental  			 dysfunction.<sup><font><a href="#note21">21</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p>Medical need is established by determining need for services which are:  		(1) "in accord with accepted standards of medical practice for the diagnosis  		and treatment for the insured's condition"; (2) are "delivered in the least  		intensive health care setting required by the insured's condition when  		possible" and (3) are "not solely for the convenience of the insured or the  		insured's family or health care provider, except for respite care..."<sup><font><a href="#note22">22</a></font></sup> Massachusetts proposes using  		the Connecticut partnership's approach to defining "mental dysfunction", as  		defined above. In contrast to Connecticut, the Massachusetts criteria are more  		stringent. Whereas Connecticut will provide benefits to persons with documented  		cognitive deficits, regardless of ADL status, Massachusetts will authorize  		benefits for a cognitively impaired beneficiary only if s/he also demonstrates  		impairments in two or more ADLs.</p>
<p>As the other States involved in this project come to define benefit  		criteria, we are likely to see similar functional criteria emerge. We can also  		expect differences among the States' criteria to parallel, at least loosely,  		the restrictiveness of their respective Medicaid nursing home eligibility  		criteria since Medicaid will assume some amount of risk for those enrolled in  		the demonstration programs.</p>
<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3">CHAPTER 3. FUNCTIONAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA IN CURRENT  		LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to describe legislative bills filed  		during the 101st Congress (1st Session) which require the use of functional  		criteria for determining eligibility for the long-term care services that are  		proposed by the legislation. Long-term care bills that include functional  		criteria which were filed during this session fell into four major  		categories:</p>
<ul><li>Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986</li>
<li>Amendments to Title XVI (SSI) of the Social Security Act</li>
<li>Amendments to Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act</li>
<li>Amendments to Title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act.</li>
</ul><p>An overview of the content of the legislation within each of these four  		categories is presented below.<sup><font><a href="#note23">23</a></font></sup> In instances where there is detailed  		function-specific eligibility criteria, these criteria are presented. To the  		extent that it is outlined in the particular legislation, the proposed process  		of functional eligibility determination is also reviewed.</p>
<h3>3.1 Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986</h3>
<p>All of the bills proposing changes in the tax code do so in order to  		give tax breaks to those who pay out-of-pocket for long-term care services; or  		to those who purchase long-term care insurance; or to insurance companies  		offering long-term care insurance; or for employer tax incentives for long-term  		care coverage. Nearly all of the bills mention functional impairment as the  		criteria for establishing the need for long-term care services. None of these  		bills, however, deals with the provision of actual services, and thus do not  		specify eligibility criteria per se. For this reason, the functional criteria  		mentioned in these bills will not be described in detail in this report. A  		summary of these bills appears in <a href="#exhibit3-1">Exhibit 3-1</a>.</p>
<h3>3.2 Amendments to Title XVI (SSI) of the Social Security  		Act</h3>
<p>During this session three bills were proposed that would amend Title  		XVI.. One, the <b>SSI Disabled and Blind Children Act of 1989</b> (H.R.868:  		Matsui), proposes to take functional limitations into account when determining  		the eligibility of a child for the entitlement; no specific functional criteria  		are suggested by the bill, but the Secretary of DHHS must publish guidelines  		within 18 months of the bill's enactment.</p>
<p>Another proposal, the <b>Supplemental Security Income Reform Act of  		1989</b> (S.665: Heinz), would expand SSI financial eligibility criteria as  		well as require the Institute of Medicine, or some other entity, to develop  		clear criteria for determining who is a disabled child.</p>
<p>A third bill amending Title XVI, the <b>National Board and Care Reform  		Act of 1989</b> (H.R.2219), was proposed by the late Representative Pepper to  		establish national minimum standards for board and care facilities. This  		legislation includes no mention of functional criteria.</p>
<p>Since none of these three bills developed any detailed functional  		criteria for program participation, they will not be analyzed further in this  		report.</p>

</tr></table><h3>3.3 Amendments to Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social  		Security Act</h3>
<p>Two of the bills proposing changes in Medicaid long-term care services  		suggest expansion of benefits, but do not include any specifics regarding  		functional eligibility criteria. The <b>Medicaid Home and Community Quality  		Services Act of 1989</b> (S.384: Chaffee et al.) would expand services (social  		and other services) to the severely disabled to help them attain/maintain  		maximal potential for independence. H.R.1259 (Panetta et al.) would provide  		hospice care as Medicaid benefit.</p>
<p>Two other pieces of legislation with nearly identical House and Senate  		versions, the <b>Medicaid Home and Community Care Options Act of 1989</b>  		(S.785: Rockefeller) and the <b>Medicaid Frail Elderly Community Care  		Amendments of 1989</b> (H.R.1453: Wyden), would allow States the option of  		providing community-based long-term care services to the Medicaid-eligible  		population. They would provide States with an option to the 2176 waiver  		programs. The bills contain somewhat specific functional criteria for  		determining eligibility. To be eligible an individual must be at least 65 years  		of age and unable to perform, without substantial assistance of another person,  		at least two (out of five) Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). The five ADLs  		considered are: bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring and eating. ADL  		disability must be due to physical or cognitive impairment; if a person's ADL  		disability is due solely to mental illness, then s/he is not program eligible.  		An individual may also be program eligible if s/he meets the age criteria and  		has a primary or secondary diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Both H.R.1453 and S.785 require that assessments for determining  		eligibility be conducted by an interdisciplinary team designated by the State.  		The legislation further stipulates that the eligibility team cannot be the same  		entity as the Case Management Agency which is to conduct another assessment to  		serve as the basis for developing an Individual Community Care Plan (ICCP).  		Payments for community-based care may not exceed 50% of the average number of  		persons receiving care in a given quarter, multiplied by the average per them  		rate for extended care services (institutional), multiplied by the number of  		days in the quarter. The 50% cost cap refers to an average across all program  		recipients, and not to individual recipients.</p>
<h3>3.4 Amendments to Title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social  		Security</h3>
<p>Two of the proposed amendments to Title XVIII involve regulation of  		long-term care insurance policies. One, the <b>Long-Term Care Insurance  		Consumer Protection Act of 1989</b> (S.142: Durenberger et al.), proposes  		voluntary certification of policies; and the other, the <b>Consumer Protection  		for Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 1989</b> (H.R.1325: Stark), would require  		mandatory standards for all long-term care insurance policies. S.142 mentions  		functional impairment as criteria for defining who is chronically ill, and thus  		eligible for benefits; no detail on the nature of the impairments is given in  		the bill. There is no mention of functional criteria in H.R.1325.</p>
<p>The remaining four bills seeking to amend Title XVIII all propose  		expanding the coverage of long-term care services. Only one, the <b>Medicare  		Adult Day Care Amendments of 1989</b> (H.R.990: Panetta), does not include any  		detailed functional criteria. It merely stipulates that to be eligible a person  		must be 18 years of age or older and have a physical, emotional, mental or  		neurological impairment that, without the provision of adult day care, would  		require the level of care provided in a hospital, skilled nursing facility  		(SNF), or intermediate care facility (ICF). The other three bills which would  		expand Medicare covered long-term care services are: the <b>Medicare Adult Day  		Health Care Amendments of 1989</b> (S.524: Bradley); the <b>Long-Term Care Act  		of 1989</b> (H.R.2263: Pepper); and <b>Elder-Care Long-Term Care Assistance Act  		of 1989</b> (H.R.3140: Waxman). Each of these is discussed in detail below.</p>
<p>S.524 (Bradley), the <b>Medicare Adult Day Health Care Amendments of  		1989</b>, is similar in intent to Panetta's H.R.990; it differs from H.R.990 in  		that it does outline some function-related eligibility criteria. S.524  		stipulates that to be eligible for the adult day health care benefit an  		individual must be age 18 or older and not able to perform (without  		assistance), on a daily basis, at least two ADLs out of five. The five ADLs  		include bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring in and out of bed or in and  		out of a chair, and eating. A nonfunctional alternative eligibility criteria is  		also outlined in the bill; to fulfill this alternative criteria an individual  		must also be age 18 or older and require care in a hospital, SNF or ICF (i.e.,  		needs health maintenance or restorative care) due to a medical or mental  		impairment.</p>
<p>The eligibility determination process specified in S.524 calls for an  		assessment conducted by a multidisciplinary team located at the adult day care  		center; the team is to consist of a physician, registered nurse, social worker,  		and other consultants as needed. Those receiving benefits under this provision  		would be required to pay a $5 per day coinsurance fee for services, but the  		Medicare deductible would not apply to these services.</p>
<p>H.R.2263 (Pepper), the <b>Long-Term Care Act of 1989</b>, seeks to amend  		Title XVIII to provide protection for long-term home care for certain  		chronically ill/disabled children and elderly individuals. The eligibility  		criteria for children stipulates that the child must be under age 19 and meet  		<b>one of the following three conditions</b>:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Be chronically ill or disabled <b>and</b> unable to perform (without  			 human assistance or supervision) due to chronic illness/injury at least two  			 age-appropriate ADLs (out of five); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a similar level of disability as defined above due to cognitive  			 impairment; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require a medical device to compensate for the loss of a vital body  			 function necessary to avert death or loss of body functional capacity  			 <b>and</b> require substantial and ongoing nursing care to avert death or  			 further disability.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Criteria for determining eligibility for the elderly are that the person  		must be at least 65 years of age and meet <b>one of the following</b>:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Be chronically ill or disabled <b>and</b> unable to perform (without  			 human assistance or supervision) at least two ADLs (out of five); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a similar level of disability (as defined immediately above)  			 due to cognitive impairment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>An elderly person who is also terminally ill must first exhaust benefits  		for hospice care under Medicare before becoming eligible for home care under  		this provision. Determination of eligibility is the responsibility of a case  		management agency.</p>
<p>H.R.2263 specifies that the five ADLs to be considered in determining  		eligibility are: bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring and eating. This  		legislation also provides definitions for each of these functional tasks. For  		example, bathing includes "the overall complex behavior of getting water and  		cleansing the whole body, including turning on the water for a bath, shower, or  		sponge bath, getting to, in and out of a tub or shower, and washing and drying  		oneself." Such specific definitions will prove helpful when it comes time to  		apply the functional criteria of the bill to national data sets for estimating  		the numbers of persons eligible for benefits. Legislation which is less  		specific will require assumptions about the actual definition of ADLs;  		estimates will be accurate to the extent that assumptions match emerging  		definitional guidelines of bills which become law. An example of lack of  		definitional clarity is the absence of guidelines for defining "cognitive  		impairment" in H.R.2263; the bill merely stipulates that upon passage the  		Secretary of DHHS must develop regulations for defining "cognitive  		impairment".</p>
<p>The amount of coverage under H.R.2263 varies as a function of the  		beneficiary's age and type/degree of disability. Full coverage for home care  		services would be provided up to 100% of the per diem nursing facility rate in  		a State for children (under age 19) who require a medical device and ongoing  		nursing care. For all other beneficiaries, home care services are covered up to  		50% of the cost of the average per diem State nursing facility rate for persons  		with moderate impairment, and up to 65% for those with severe impairment. (The  		legislation does not include definitions of "moderate" and "severe" impairment;  		as such, cost estimates for such a bill will have to rely on assumptions as to  		what constitutes impairment severity.) No copayments are required, but if there  		is a program deficit at any point, the bill contains a provision to establish  		copayments which are never to exceed 5% of the national average daily payment  		rate for home care.</p>
<p>A portion of H.R.3140 (Waxman), the <b>Elder-Care Long-Term Care  		Assistance Act of 1989</b>, seeks to amend Title XVIII to expand coverage for  		both community-based and institutional care. All Medicare Part A participants  		would be eligible for expanded benefits provided they meet the functional  		eligibility criteria. To be eligible for community care a person must have  		either a severe or moderate impairment. Operational definitions of "severe" and  		"moderate" are not given in the legislation, but are to be defined by the  		Secretary of DHHS upon passage of the bill. One may receive up to 20 hours of  		community-based care per week for moderate impairments, and up to 30 hours per  		week for severe impairments. A copayment of 20% would be required of those  		receiving services.</p>
<p>Nursing facility eligibility requirements under Waxman's proposal state  		that the person must be:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Chronically dependent, defined as being unable to perform, without  			 substantial assistance of another person, because of physical or cognitive  			 impairment, at least two ADLs (bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring,  			 eating);     or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have similar functional disabilities due to cognitive impairment  			 such that they require substantial direction, instruction, or supervision of  			 another person in order to perform two or more  			 ADLs;     or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Require substantial direction, instruction or supervision of another  			 person in order to remain in the community without causing harm to self/others  			 because of inappropriate behavioral problems.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Eligibility for coverage under the nursing home provision also requires  		that an individual must need nursing home level of care for a continuous period  		of at least 60 days.</p>
<p>Waxman's nursing home benefit covers the "back-end" of institutional  		stays; the individual is fully responsible for the first 60 days of nursing  		home care. Beneficiaries are responsible for coinsurance of 33.3% of the  		national average per them rate beginning on day 61 through the second year of a  		stay; coinsurance would be reduced to 10% for stays beyond two years.  		(Coinsurance would not apply to skilled nursing care under Medicare Part  		A.)</p>
<p>The process of eligibility determination for both community and  		institutional services is similar. A multidisciplinary team, which must include  		a registered nurse, from a CARE (community assessment, review and evaluation)  		agency would assess individuals seeking services/admission. Eligibility  		determination for those seeking institutional care would occur before admission  		to a facility.</p>
<p>Finally, Senator <b>Kennedy</b> has drafted, but not yet filed,  		legislation which would also expand coverage for community-based and  		institutional long-term care. The tentative title of this legislation is the  		<b>Security Care Act</b>. While Waxman's proposal would cover the "back-end" of  		nursing home stays (but covers an increasingly larger proportion of the cost of  		longer stays), Kennedy's bill would fund the "front-end." The Kennedy bill  		would fully cover the first six months of a nursing home stay. Coverage for  		stays beyond six months would be the responsibility of the individual. This  		legislation, however, would also establish an optional federal long-term care  		insurance program for persons age 45 and older through which one could insure  		against nursing home stays longer than six months duration. Insured stays  		beyond six months would be reimbursed at 65% of the cost of the per them rate  		for an unlimited time, provided eligibility criteria continue to be met.</p>
<p>Community-based long-term care under Kennedy's plan would be covered in  		full as long as the cost of care does not exceed, per individual, 65% of the  		cost of the average amount for care in a nursing facility multiplied by a  		severity index weight. The only other constraint is that respite care may not  		exceed 30 days, or 720 hours, during a calendar year.</p>
<p>Like some of the other expanded-care bills, Kennedy's specifies  		function-based criteria for determining program eligibility. To be eligible for  		community-based services a person must fall into <b>one of the following three  		categories</b>:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>* Age 65 or older* Medicare Part A eligible* Completely  			 dependent (does not participate) in at leas one ADL (out of  			 five)     ORPartially dependent in 2 or more  			 ADLs (requires physical assist of  			 supervision     ORSo cognitively impaired as  			 to require substantial supervision from another individual because s/he engages  			 in inappropriate behavior that poses a substantial health/safety hazard to self  			 or other (i.e., cognitively impaired and exhibiting dangerous  			 behaviors)</p>
</li>
<li>* Under age 19* Dependent in one or more age-appropriate ADLs  		  (includes complete and partial dependence -- may include supervision, some  		  human assistance as well as does not  		  participate)     ORRequires device necessary  		  to avert death or maintain functional capacity and requires ongoing nursing  		  care to avert death or further disability</li>
<li>* Would be eligible for benefits under Title XVIII of the Social  		  Security Act, except for required 24 month waiting period* Completely  		  dependent (does not participate) in one or more age-appropriate  		  ADLs     ORIs unable to perform two or more  		  age-appropriate ADLs without some physical assistance or  		  supervision     OR* Has a medical prognosis of  		  life expectancy of 12 months or less.</li>
</ul><p>Nursing home eligibility criteria are identical to those for  		community-based care, and criteria for respite care are also the same as those  		for community-based services, with the additional following stipulation:</p>
<blockquote><p>* Is dependent on a primary caregiver for performance of at least two  		  age-appropriate ADLs <b>and</b> without such assistance the individual would  		  not perform the ADL     ORHas dementia or  		  other cognitive impairments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Senator Kennedy's legislation contains very specific definitions of what  		constitutes ADL impairments. The five ADLs which are included are: bathing,  		dressing, toileting, transferring, and eating. An example of the high degree of  		specificity in defining ADLs in this legislation is the definition of  		toileting: going to the bathroom for bladder/bowel function; transferring  		on/off the toilet; cleansing after elimination; and arranging clothing.</p>
<p>Persons applying for benefits under this proposal would be judged  		eligible based upon the outcome of a screen administered by a Long-Term Care  		Screening Agency. The screening process would be a two-pronged activity. First,  		an initial screen would be administered over the phone or a questionnaire would  		be completed by the applicant/proxy. On the basis of this initial information,  		an in-person screening would be conducted for those having passed the first  		screening component. The second screen would be administered by a team that  		must include a physician, nurse practitioner, or registered nurse. Once deemed  		eligible by the Screening Agency, a Long-Term Care Management Agency would  		conduct a comprehensive needs assessment and develop a care plan. The only  		exception to this eligibility determination process would be in the case of  		those applying for respite care services; eligibility for these applicants  		would be conducted by the Long-Term Care Management Agency.</p>
<h3>3.5 Summary</h3>
<p>Long-term care-related bills filed during the first session of the 101st  		Congress fall into four general categories: amendments to the Internal Revenue  		Code of 1986 or amendments to either Title XVI (SSI), Title XIX (Medicaid), or  		Title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act. The purpose of bills  		proposing changes in the tax code is to render tax breaks to purchasers and  		offerors of long-term care insurance (insurance companies, employers). Proposed  		amendments to the Social Security Act seek, for the most part, to expand  		long-term care benefits.</p>
<p>Nearly all of these bills include some mention of physical functioning  		as a criteria for determining eligibility for benefits. Some bills are more  		specific than others in defining criteria. Most of the bills, however, also  		specify additional eligibility criteria other than physical functioning (ADL).  		These include indicators of cognitive impairment (e.g., Alzheimer's diagnosis,  		behavior problems indicative of cognitive deficits) and the need for medical  		devices or ongoing nursing care.</p>
<p>Besides criteria relating to the condition of the beneficiary, the  		expanded care bills also stipulate other criteria that serve to limit the  		beneficiary pool. These other factors include waiting periods, co-payments for  		services, and limits on the amount and duration of care. In this regard, the  		proposed programs are similar to existing federal programs (e.g., the Medicare  		SNF and respite benefits), which place analogous restrictions on  		utilization.</p>

<p>There is considerable discussion in the policy arena regarding an  		expanded Federal role in financing long-term care services for functionally  		impaired elderly and disabled persons, and it is commonly assumed that under  		this expanded Federal initiative, long-term care benefits will be allocated on  		the basis of functional measures of performance in the Activities of Daily  		Living. This chapter discusses the implications of this assumption, drawing  		upon what can be learned from the research on ADL measurement and from existing  		programs which already allocate long-term care benefits using functional  		eligibility criteria.</p>
<h3>4.1 No Existing Long-Term Care Program Allocates  		Benefits Solely on the Basis of ADL Measures</h3>
<p>The review of long-term care eligibility criteria presented in  		<a href="#chap3">Chapter 3</a> shows that while measures of ADL performance are  		often included in the eligibility determination process under existing  		long-term care programs, ADL impairments are never the sole eligibility  		criteria. Indeed, one general observation is that the broader the entitlement  		nature of the program, the <b>less</b> likely that benefit allocation decisions  		are based on ADL measures.</p>
<p>Medicare, our broadest entitlement program, has strictly shied away from  		using ADLs as eligibility criteria in the allocation of benefits. Medicare's  		Skilled Nursing Facility benefit and home health care benefit are still  		primarily based upon a physician's certification of the need for care, and upon  		a determination that the individual is need of skilled, rather than custodial,  		care. In fact, care needs related to deficits in ADL performance are  		specifically cited as needs which are <b>not</b> covered by the Medicare  		benefit package. This exclusion of coverage for assistance in ADLs reinforces  		the position that Medicare is strictly an acute care insurance program, and  		that chronic care needs are not addressed by the Medicare benefit package. It  		is interesting to note, however, that the proposed respite care benefit,  		enacted as part of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, <b>did</b> propose  		to use ADLs as eligibility criteria in allocating benefits, although  		policymakers were sure to include other criteria to limit access to the benefit  		(i.e. limiting the benefit to persons who had met the out-of-pocket limit for  		Part B or prescription drug costs) and expected costs.</p>
<p>Medicaid is the primary public financing mechanism for long-term care,  		and many States include assessments of ADL performance in determining  		eligibility for nursing home and/or home-based long-term care services.  		However, our review of State long-term care eligibility criteria shows that  		service allocation decisions are only loosely tied to standardized measures of  		functional performance in most States. In most States, a combination of  		physician authorization, clinical judgment, <b>and</b> functional assessment  		are used in determining eligibility for Medicaid payment for nursing home care.  		More importantly, we cited recent research which demonstrates that even within  		those States which rely more heavily on functional assessment, that objective  		measures of "need" in ADLs vary significantly from State to State depending  		upon the overall availability of Medicaid resources to pay for long-term care  		services. There is little available data on how States use functional criteria  		in allocating home and community-based care services under Medicaid.</p>
<p>ADLs are used in many private long-term care insurance policies as  		eligibility triggers for nursing home and home care benefits, although it is  		interesting to note that only 8 of 28 plans which cover home care services rely  		on ADLs. Others require either a prior nursing home stay or a physician's  		certification of need. We believe this reflects the skittishness of insurers to  		promise benefits strictly based on ADL measures. Since benefit eligibility in  		the long-term care insurance market is more hypothetical than actual at this  		stage, we believe the subject of functional eligibility criteria for benefits  		will become a much larger issue once claims for covered services begin to  		increase.</p>
<h3>4.2 Estimates of the Functionally Impaired Elderly Vary  		Depending Upon the Data Source</h3>
<p>Although there is considerable agreement that functional measures are  		superior to diagnostic or other approaches for assessing the need for long-term  		care services, it is difficult to develop accurate estimates of the number of  		elderly persons who are functionally impaired.<sup><font><a href="#note24">24</a></font></sup> At the same time, any Federal policy  		initiative in long-term care will require the development of reasonably  		accurate estimates of the costs of expanded benefits, so that financing  		mechanisms can also be developed.</p>
<p>To address this question, the Committee on Definitions of Functional  		Limitations, under the direction of the Forum on Age-Related Statistics and  		comprised of representatives from various government agencies, reviewed  		estimates of the functionally impaired elderly population based upon several  		national surveys. Initial examination of these estimates revealed considerable  		discrepancies. One major reason for the differences is that definitions of  		functional impairment varied somewhat from survey to survey. In an attempt to  		reconcile the differences among the estimates the Committee applied a uniform  		definition of impairment to each survey. Prevalence estimates of impairment  		were generated for the five ADL items common to the surveys (bathing, dressing,  		toileting, transferring and eating). Receipt of human assistance in the  		performance of an ADL was taken as evidence of impairment.</p>
<p>Even after the estimates of ADL functioning were standardized by number,  		type and definition of impairment, discrepancies remained. For example, data  		from the 1984 Supplement on Aging show that that 5.0% of the  		non-institutionalized elderly (1.32 million) have at least one ADL impairment,  		while data from the 1987 National Medical Expenditures Survey show that  		approximately 8.1% (2.25 million) are impaired, a difference of slightly over  		70%.<sup><font><a href="#note25">25</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Since most of the current legislative proposals discussed in  		<a href="#chap3">Chapter 3</a> propose to trigger long-term care benefits when  		someone is impaired in two or more ADLs, estimates of the elderly population  		dependent in two or more ADLs are of greater policy interest. While the  		Committee on Definitions of Functional Limitations did not report these  		estimates, it is possible to develop estimates based on prior research of the  		hierarchical nature of ADLs. Research has shown that loss of function occurs in  		an orderly and hierarchical fashion whereby loss of ability to bathe oneself is  		very likely to occur before loss of function in other ADLs.<sup><font><a href="#note26">26</a></font></sup> Loss of function in bathing is  		followed in sequence by inability to dress, toilet, transfer and feed oneself.  		For example, a person dependent in dressing is likely to be dependent in  		bathing as well. Persons with disabilities further on down the hierarchy are  		very likely to also be dependent in bathing and dressing.<sup><font><a href="#note27">27</a></font></sup> Using this approach with the  		reported data from the 1984 Supplement on Aging and the 1987 National Medical  		Expenditures Survey, estimates of the number of non-institutionalized elderly  		with two or more impairments range between 2.9% and 4.4% (between 771,000 and  		1,228,000 persons).<sup><font><a href="#note28">28</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Another policy option is to limit benefit eligibility to persons who  		require ADL assistance more than once daily, i.e. in the ADLs of transferring,  		toileting, and eating, or using the hierarchical method, persons who have three  		or more ADL impairments. Persons with three ADL impairments are likely to need  		assistance in toileting, the ADL limitation which is most strongly associated  		with increased future needs for assistance.<sup><font><a href="#note29">29</a></font></sup> A three ADL benefit trigger would ration  		benefits to persons with more heavy care needs. Somewhere between 2.6% and 4.2%  		of the community-dwelling elderly would be eligible for benefits under the 3+  		ADL criteria.<sup><font><a href="#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>4.3 National Surveys May Underestimate the Number of  		Elderly with ADL Limitations</h3>
<p>Even if all discrepancies between data sources could be resolved, there  		will continue to be uncertainty about estimates that are derived from national  		survey data. Estimates derived from survey data may underestimate the true  		prevalence of impairment in the population. There is some evidence which  		suggests that the elderly may underreport the extent of their impairments,  		perhaps in order to present themselves in the best possible light, i.e.,  		unimpaired or less impaired.<sup><font><a href="#note31">31</a>,<a href="#note32">32</a></font></sup> However, if a national long-term care  		program was implemented which rationed benefits on the basis of functional  		impairments, it is reasonable to expect some amount of exaggeration of reported  		impairment in order to increase the probability of accessing services. In  		developing estimates of the eligible population under an ADL-triggered benefit  		program, it is important to account for these factors in projecting program  		utilization and costs.<sup><font><a href="#note33">33</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>4.4 Estimates of the Cognitively Impaired Elderly Are  		Even More Difficult to Derive</h3>
<p>In the long-term care policy debate, there is an emerging consensus that  		eligibility criteria for long-term care benefits should include cognitive as  		well as physical impairments. This trend can be observed in both legislative  		proposals and in private long-term care insurance policies. While loss of ADL  		functioning is considered the "final common pathway" of decline for conditions  		associated with both physical and cognitive etiologies, persons in the early to  		middle stages of Alzheimer's disease (and related disorders) may not exhibit  		any dependence in ADLs, but may not safely reside in the community without some  		level of supervision. Cognitively impaired persons may be able to bathe and  		dress themselves, but many should not be left unattended for long periods of  		time because they may wander off, get lost, or put themselves or others at  		risk, e.g. leaving on the stove, not remembering-to eat, ingesting harmful  		substances, etc. Eligibility criteria based on physical functioning alone will  		exclude some individuals who are in need of less intense human assistance but  		who may require fairly consistent supervision, and who would otherwise be at  		risk. Recent research estimates this population to be approximately one-half  		million persons.<sup><font><a href="#note34">34</a></font></sup></p>
<p>There is no standard measure for identifying cognitive impairments. The  		measures and approaches which do exist are not universally accepted in the way  		ADL impairments are accepted as measures of physical functioning. This dilemma  		is reflected in the Federal legislative proposals, which detail the number and  		types of ADL eligibility criteria, but which are notably non-specific regarding  		indicators for cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>One approach proposed in both the Rockefeller (S.785) and Wyden  		(H.R.1453) bills is to qualify individuals for benefits based on a primary or  		secondary diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. This is not a terribly satisfactory  		approach since a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease can only be made  		post mortem. But more importantly, most persons in the very early stages of  		Alzheimer's do not need long-term care. These individuals may have some  		difficulty in recall, but in the early stages of the disease process are not  		likely to present a safety hazard to themselves or others. Relying upon a  		diagnostic approach may result in some misspecification of the target  		population, i.e., deeming eligible persons not currently needing assistance,  		unless other criteria are employed as well.</p>
<p>Surveys of the elderly have typically used the Short Portable Mental  		Status Questionnaire, a ten-item scale tapping orientation and memory, or some  		variant of the measure, to identify persons with cognitive impairments. The  		difficulty with this strategy is that such measures provide only gross  		approximations of impairment level. They are able to identify persons in the  		later stages of decline with a good deal of certainty, but not necessarily  		those in the early to middle stages. And it is precisely those persons in the  		middle stages of decline who are not as likely to also be ADL dependent, but  		who may need some amount of assistance and supervision. Depending upon the  		specific cut-off points employed, use of an MSQ-type approach could result in  		considerable targeting inefficiencies.<sup><font><a href="#note35">35</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Another method of identifying cognitively impaired persons in need of  		assistance, which has promise, is the "behavior problems" approach. Many  		nursing home preadmission screening programs utilize this approach, and a few  		of the legislative proposals suggest this approach as well, although the  		content of the bills provide no guidance regarding actual measures.<sup><font><a href="#note36">36</a></font></sup> Behaviors which are sometimes  		used as manifesting cognitive impairments which place an individual at risk  		include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Wandering</b>: Aimless, potentially dangerous movement within or  			 outside the home;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Abusiveness</b>: Physically causing harm to self or others;  			 verbal assaults such as threatening physical attack or menacing in other  			 ways;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Unacceptable Hygiene or Habits</b>: Gross and unacceptable  			 hygiene or eating habits, such as throwing or smearing food or excrement;  			 disrobing in inappropriate situations; screaming; making dangerous or  			 inappropriate sexual advances;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Threats to Health or Safety</b>: Inability to follow medication  			 or dietary regimens without supervision; creating fire hazards; exhibiting poor  			 judgment which is potentially harmful to self or others.<sup><font><a href="#note37">37</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><p>In order to determine eligibility based on these criteria, the need for  		daily supervision due to these behavioral problems must also be considered,  		since what is really appropriate for the the policy process is the <b>need</b>  		for oversight, which ultimately translates into need for services.</p>
<p>One problem with the behavioral approach to cognitive impairment  		assessment is that persons displaying the types of behavioral problems  		described above may suffer from mental illness rather than cognitive  		impairment. There are instruments which can be used in differential diagnosis,  		but since we don't know how frequently potential beneficiaries may exhibit  		behavior problems due solely to psychiatric problems, it seems premature to  		suggest further assessments to validate the finding of cognitive impairment  		based on behavioral indicators.<sup><font><a href="#note38">38</a></font></sup> Another potential disadvantage of using a  		behavioral approach over an MSQ approach is that it relies upon reported  		observations of the applicant which may or may not be accurate. Also, some  		applicants may not have a caregiver or family member who could provide this  		type of information. In these instances, the more objective approach  		exemplified by the MSQ may be a preferred method for ascertaining cognitive  		impairment.</p>
<h3>4.5 What Level of Functional Impairment Should Trigger  		Eligibility for Services</h3>
<p>A major goal in the implementation of a national long-term care benefit  		program will be to assure uniformity in the eligibility determination process.  		Eligibility systems will be structured, regulations will be promulgated,  		assessment tools will be developed, and screeners/assessors will be trained,  		all with the objective of attaining an acceptable level of uniformity in  		allocation of benefits.</p>
<p>One major problem in the development of this eligibility system is that  		within the potential target population (the impaired elderly), functional  		impairment is always a continuous variable, while the eligibility determination  		process is always a binary decision. One cannot be more eligible or less  		eligible--one is either eligible or not eligible. But one can be more or less  		functional. An individual's functioning level can range from total  		independence, to slight impairment, to moderate impairment, to severe  		impairment, to so impaired that someone else must take care of all of one's  		basic daily needs. In developing a long-term care eligibility system,  		policymakers will essentially be deciding the "optimal" point on the functional  		continuum for separating out the eligible from the non-eligible.</p>
<p>The prevailing opinion, as evidenced from the legislative proposals  		stlymarized in <a href="#chap3">Chapter 3</a>, appears to be that impairment in  		two or more ADLs is the optimal eligibility trigger. There seems to be little  		rationale, however, in any of the literature for selecting two or more ADLs as  		the optimal eligibility cut-off point. Obviously, one reason for selecting two  		or more ADLs as the benefit trigger, rather than one or more, is to limit the  		eligible population and thereby program costs. However, this approach is likely  		to exclude from services persons who require assistance with bathing or  		dressing.<sup><font><a href="#note39">39</a></font></sup> For persons  		with such impairments, lack of assistance on a daily basis may not be  		life-threatening. This is not to say however, that those with one ADL  		impairment are not in need, or would not benefit from assistance.</p>
<p>Whatever level of impairment is decided upon as the trigger for  		benefits, there will inevitably be assessment, measurement, and clinical  		decision errors around that point. Given the political and regulatory  		controversies over decision rules regarding Medicare payment for "medically  		necessary" hospital care, eligibility for SNF services, and other  		Medicare-covered services, the enactment and implementation of a  		Federally-financed long-term care benefit based upon functionally-based  		eligibility criteria will inevitably lead to additional controversies regarding  		approved and denied applications for services, particularly for that population  		which falls extremely close to the designated "cut-off point." Indeed, the  		clear demarcation of eligible and non-eligible applicants for benefits is even  		more problematic in a chronically ill population than in a population whose  		needs are more acute in nature. Policymakers need to consider the controversies  		that will inevitably surround the designation of an eligibility cut-off point  		in the continuum of functional impairment levels.</p>
<h3>4.6 Should Long-Term Care Benefits be Rationed Based on  		Objective Measures of ADL and Cognitive Impairment or Should Benefits Take Into  		Account "Unmet Needs"?</h3>
<p>Policymakers concerned about the costs of a Federally-financed long-term  		care benefit package are naturally motivated to target resources to persons who  		are in the most need of public assistance. Given concerns about the number of  		elderly persons who may be eligible for benefits based on objective measures of  		the need for assistance, alternative strategies for restricting the benefit  		population are being considered. One alternative is to base eligibility on  		evidence of unmet need, rather than total needs. Unmet need is generally  		defined as the difference between the amount of care which an individual's  		support system is currently providing, or can provide, and the individual's  		total need for care.</p>
<p>Some States incorporate the concept of unmet need in their nursing home  		screening and waiver programs by including the availability of informal  		caregivers in their decision rules. That is, to be eligible, persons must not  		only have documented impairments, but must also be receiving inadequate  		assistance from family, friends, or other available avenues of assistance.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the concept of unmet needs as a strategy  		for rationing benefits is inimical to the entitlement concept exemplified by  		the Medicare program.<sup><font><a href="#note40">40</a></font></sup>  		Under Medicare, if one has a demonstrated need, then one qualifies for  		benefits. Although Medicaid is also an entitlement program, States are more  		likely to impose criteria beyond need in determining eligibility for benefits.  		It is interesting to note that although Medicaid regulations do not  		<b>require</b> that informal supports be taken into account when determining  		eligibility for nursing home admission (ICF), they do indicate that the  		assessment preceding admission must include an "evaluation by an agency worker  		of the resources available in the home, family and community..."<sup><font><a href="#note41">41</a></font></sup> Thus, at least implicitly,  		Medicaid regulations suggest that unmet needs, rather than total needs per se,  		be considered as criteria for long-term care benefits.</p>
<p>Some States clearly limit Medicaid services to persons with unmet needs.  		Connecticut, for example, invokes the notion of "practical matter" in  		determining Medicaid eligibility for nursing home care. If an individual is  		impaired, but all service needs are being supplied by a family member, the  		State may not provide assistance because, as a "practical matter," the  		individual does not require additional assistance.<sup><font><a href="#note42">42</a></font></sup> New York also operationalizes the concept of  		unmet needs in its PAS decision rules by stipulating that functional impairment  		must be accompanied by inadequate informal supports.<sup><font><a href="#note43">43</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Even though States may use the concept of unmet needs in rationing  		long-term care resources under Medicaid, such a rationing approach may be more  		problematic within a Federal policy initiative, since Federally-administered  		programs generally require more formal decision rules regarding the allocation  		of benefits. Although the concept of unmet needs has intuitive appeal as a  		strategy for targeting long-term care resources, it is a difficult concept to  		operationalize in a formal program.<sup><font><a href="#note44">44</a></font></sup> For example, it is difficult to develop  		uniform decision rules for evaluating both the capacity and the willingness of  		the informal support system to provide services, particularly when a support  		system may be available but unwilling. Similarly, it is difficult to develop  		decision rules regarding the competing demands on informal caregivers, or  		regarding their physical and emotional capacity to fulfill caregiving  		functions. Thus, existing long-term care programs which incorporate assessments  		of informal caregiving capacity into their allocation decisions tend to rely  		heavily on clinical judgment, rather than formal decision rules.</p>
<p>The unmet needs concept has also been criticized as being inherently  		discriminatory towards women. Women's advocates correctly point out that such a  		policy unfairly reinforces the cultural expectation that wives, daughters, and  		other female relatives are responsible for the care of elders. In the absence  		of a national long-term care benefit program, the current caregiving burden  		falls disproportionately on women, and an unmet needs policy in a Federal  		long-term care initiative would institutionalize this uneven distribution of  		responsibility. Thus, a long-term care allocation policy which incorporates the  		concept of unmet need is likely to encounter significant political resistance,  		and might also be challenged in the courts.</p>
<h3>4.7 What are the Alternatives to Functional Eligibility  		Criteria?</h3>
<p>Although functional criteria are likely to be a central component of any  		Federally-established eligibility system for long-term care benefits, the  		inherent difficulties involved in the implementation of a system based solely  		on functional criteria has led to the consideration of additional criteria or  		program features which be incorporated into a long-term care eligibility system  		which could make the allocation of benefits simpler, "cleaner," more  		efficiently targeted, and less subject to controversy.</p>
<p>One idea is to impose a deductible or waiting period period on a  		Federally-supported long-term care benefit. One example of this approach,  		commonly referred to as "back-end" coverage, is Congressman's Waxman's proposal  		for nursing home coverage. This bill (H.R.3140) would require individual  		liability for the first 60 days of nursing home coverage. For days 61 through  		to the end of two years, the beneficiary would be responsible for a 33.3%  		co-payment on the cost of nursing home care. For nursing home stays beyond two  		years, this co-insurance requirement would be reduced to 10%.</p>
<p>Under this approach, <b>prior utilization</b> of long-term care  		services, paid for out-of-pocket, becomes the primary criterion for allocating  		publicly financed benefits. This approach assumes that a person who pays for  		long-term care services out of their own resources must be truly in need of  		assistance (i.e. sufficiently impaired) and therefore, should qualify for  		public assistance after the deductible period has been met.<sup><font><a href="#note45">45</a></font></sup></p>
<p>One major criticism of this approach is that benefits which require a  		substantial out-of-pocket deductible tend to favor persons with higher income  		and assets. Persons of more moderate means may forego purchasing long-term care  		benefits, despite high levels of impairment, and therefore never qualify for  		public benefits.</p>
<p>Another criticism of this approach is that it assumes that once an  		individual is impaired, he or she will either remain at the same level of  		impairment or deteriorate further. Empirical evidence shows, however, that  		there is as considerable improvement, as well as decline, in functional status  		over time among the elderly population.<sup><font><a href="#note46">46</a>,<a href="#note47">47</a></font></sup> The approach also  		assumes that an individual's prior level of service utilization was not in  		excess of what was actually needed.</p>
<p>In effect, Medicaid is an example of a "back-end" long-term care  		coverage program in which the deductible is defined as "everything you have in  		excess of $2,000." However, even for nursing home patients who enter as private  		pay residents and impoverish themselves to Medicaid eligibility levels after  		spending-down, States still employ functional criteria in establishing  		eligibility for Medicaid payment. A small percentage of spend-down residents do  		not meet these functional criteria at their point of conversion to Medicaid,  		and become at risk of being discharged. In other cases, those who have spent  		down their assets in a Skilled Nursing Facility do not meet Medicaid criteria  		for SNF coverage, and must be transferred to a lower level facility (i.e. an  		ICF). Thus, even under a Federal program which rations long-term care benefits  		by imposing a significant deductible or waiting period, there will still be a  		need to apply functional criteria at the point of eligibility. However, given  		the prior utilization of long-term care services, the application of functional  		criteria at this eligibility point may be significantly less problematic than  		in a program which attempts to apply criteria for "front-end" coverage.</p>
<h3>4.8 Should the Same Functional Criteria be Applied for  		Institutional Services and Community-Based Services?</h3>
<p>A number of Federal long-term care policy initiatives have addressed the  		issue of whether it is possible to ration home and community-based services to  		persons who would otherwise enter nursing homes. These initiatives were  		implemented with the hope that long-term care service benefit packages could be  		expanded to include home-based services at no increased cost to the taxpayer,  		<b>if</b> services could be efficiently targeted to persons who would otherwise  		become utilizers of publicly-financed nursing home care.</p>
<p>The answer to this policy issue has been a fairly definitive "no" due to  		the fact that there are a large number of persons in the community who are as  		functionally impaired as persons in nursing homes (some evidence that the  		proportion may be as high as three community-impaired elders to every nursing  		home resident), but who will never enter nursing homes. Thus, it has become  		increasingly acknowledged that an expansion in public coverage of long-term  		care services to include home and community-based services will require  		increased investment of public resources.</p>
<p>However, as the policy debate goes beyond the "cost-effectiveness" of  		home and community-based services, the issue will remain whether the  		eligibility criteria for home-based services should be the same as those  		applied for institutional services. On a conceptual level, it is reasonable to  		expect that a Federally-financed long-term care program would ration benefits  		according to various levels of need among those deemed eligible for benefits.  		Thus, persons who receive a higher level of benefits (e.g. nursing home care)  		would be expected to meet a more restrictive set of eligibility criteria than  		persons in need of lower level services (e.g. respite care). Nursing home  		case-mix reimbursements systems are an example of how long term care systems  		are becoming increasingly more sophisticated in allocating long-term care  		resources according to levels of need, and similar systems may be developed for  		home care services. Thui, in enacting a Federal long-term care benefit,  		policymakers will not only have to develop "threshold" functional criteria to  		determine eligibility for benefits, but criteria for rationing benefits among  		the eligible population.</p>
<h3>4.9 Summary</h3>
<p>This chapter discusses some of the policy issues related to the  		enactment of a Federal long-term care benefit package which allocates services  		on the basis of functional criteria among the elderly population. These issues  		include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Existing long-term care programs do not allocate benefits solely on  			 the basis of functional criteria. Clinical judgment and physician authorization  			 are generally used, in addition to functional criteria, in allocating  			 benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is difficult to estimate the number of elderly persons who will  			 be eligible for benefits on the basis of functional criteria because data  			 sources differ in their estimates of the functionally impaired elderly,  			 depending upon how impairments are defined and measured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of functionally impaired elderly persons who will be  			 eligible for benefits may be underestimated from existing data sources since  			 survey respondents may tend to underreport their impairments while program  			 applicants tend may tend to exaggerate their disabilities in order to receive  			 services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most long-term care initiatives recognize the need to also extend  			 eligibility for services to persons who may be physically capable of  			 functioning independently, but whose cognitive impairments result in a need for  			 monitoring supervision. However, objective measures of cognitive performance,  			 except at very high levels of impairment, are not well refined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The considerations discussed above make the estimation of the costs  			 of a long-term care benefit package based on functional criteria extremely  			 problematic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In developing eligibility criteria for long-term care benefits,  			 policymakers are essentially designating a level of "need" that determines  			 eligibility for benefits. For some reason, policymakers seem to have focused on  			 "impairment in two or more ADLs" as the level of need warranting publicly  			 supported services, without strong justification. Further, <b>any</b>  			 eligibility cut-off point is likely to encounter controversy as persons of  			 relatively equal impairment near the cut-off point are determined eligible or  			 not eligible for services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although the concept of unmet needs has proved a useful mechanism  			 for allocating services in smaller programs, it will be a difficult concept to  			 operationalize in a more formal and uniform Federal program, because it is  			 difficult to develop formal decision rules about the availability and  			 willingness of informal care providers to supplement publicly-financed  			 services. Also, the concept of unmet needs may encounter resistance as being  			 inherently discriminatory towards women, who make up the vast majority of  			 informal caregivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative functional criteria for allocating benefits, other than  			 objective measures of impairment at the point of application, are being  			 considered. For example, a "back-end" long-term care benefit package, with a  			 significant "front-end" deductible, has the effect of using "prior utilization"  			 of long-term care services as a functional eligibility criterion. This approach  			 is not without its own disadvantages, however, such as its eligibility bias  			 towards persons who can afford the costs of the deductible period.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>We anticipate that until the issues discussed above can be adequately  		addressed by the policy process, that they will serve as barriers to enactment  		of a Federal long-term care benefit package. Given the legitimate concerns  		about the costs of a Federal long-term care initiative, any proposal which  		cannot define the eligible population in fairly specific terms, and therefore  		estimate the costs of the proposal with a relatively high level of certainty,  		does not stand much chance of enactment. We believe that the legislation  		currently being proposed to expand Federal coverage of long-term care services  		is not adequate in this regard, and will have to become much more specific in  		proposing eligibility criteria for program benefits. The recent rise in  		Medicare SNF utilization and expenditures associated with a simple  		"clarification" of coverage criteria (not even an expansion) underscores the  		considerable impact which even a minor change in criteria can have on program  		costs. As well, objective measures of "need" and the allocation of benefits  		will always be affected by the availability of resources, so that it is  		important for the policy process to develop functional eligibility criteria for  		long-term care benefits in close coordination with the development of financing  		mechanisms, rather than along separate policy tracks.</p>
