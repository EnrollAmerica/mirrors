</dl><p>Private expenses for long-term care can reach catastrophic proportions  		for some older Americans with chronic physical or mental disabilities. Because  		of the high costs of nursing home care, which is about $25,000 per year, many  		individuals who enter nursing homes as private-pay patients can expect to  		spenddown their assets and become dependent on Medicaid as the source of  		payment for the remainder of their nursing home stay. Similarly, private  		expenses for the long-term care services required by disabled persons residing  		in the community can exceed income and lead to an erosion of assets.</p>
<p>Recognition that the potentially catastrophic costs of long-term care  		are generally borne out-of-pocket by individuals and their families has  		heightened consideration of alternative means for financing long-term care. A  		wide range of options is being considered, with considerable recent attention  		focused on different types of private long-term care insurance (Meiners, 1983).  		In addition, there has been discussion recently of the possibility of expanding  		Medicare benefits to cover long-term care (Blumenthal et al., 1986). Some  		analysts believe that, given the magnitude of the likely costs and recent  		fiscal and socio-demographic trends, options which combine private and public  		cost sharing are the most likely to be adopted (Wiener et al., 1987).</p>
<p>Despite increasing concern about private expenses for long-term care,  		the development of policy is currently hampered by the paucity of information  		on the conditions under which catastrophic expenses are incurred, especially  		how private expenses that are initially manageable eventually escalate into  		catastrophic financial burdens. Although the potential financial consequences  		of long-term care are widely recognized (Rice &amp; Gabel, 1987), studies of  		the spenddown phenomenon and its implications have been scarce.</p>
<p>Presented are results from a descriptive analysis of data from the 1982  		and 1984 National Long-Term Care Surveys (NLTCS). The analysis was designed to  		measure the use of nursing homes over time by disabled persons and the effects  		of nursing home use on Medicaid eligibility. The results are focused not only  		on the relationship between nursing home use and Medicaid eligibility, but also  		on how Medicaid eligibility is related to long and short nursing home stays as  		well as long-term care without nursing home use. The research is presented in  		four sections. First, information from the 1982 and 1984 NLTCS used in this  		analysis is described. Second, the use of nursing homes between 1982 and 1984  		is presented. Third, results on the relationship between Medicaid status and  		nursing home use between 1982 and 1984 are discussed. Finally, the implications  		of the findings for future long-term care research and policy are  		discussed.</p>
<h2><a name="NLTCS" id="NLTCS">1982 AND 1984 NATIONAL LONG-TERM CARE SURVEYS  		(NLTCS)</a></h2>
<h3>The 1982 NLTC Survey</h3>
<p>The 1982 NLTCS was a nationally representative survey of the  		noninstitutional Medicare population over age 65 needing assistance with one or  		more Activities of Daily Living (ADL) or Instrumental Activities of Daily  		Living (IADL). It was sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services  		and conducted by the Census Bureau. A sample of 36,000 Medicare enrollees was  		drawn from Health Care Financing Administration (HFCA) administrative files and  		interviewed by telephone to identify those with assistance needs. Approximately  		6,000 persons who were identified as requiring assistance with ADLs or IADLs  		for a period of 3 months or longer and residing in the community were included  		in the survey.</p>
<p>For all 36,000 sampled individuals, the screener document contained data  		on age, race, sex, and birth date. For each of 9 ADL and 7 IADL items, the  		person was asked if he or she had problems performing that activity and the  		duration of the difficulty. If the individual responded that the actual or  		expected duration had been (or was expected to be) more than 3 months, the  		respondent was given the detailed interview.</p>
<p>The detailed portion of the survey was administered to all  		noninstitutionalized persons with chronic (90 days or more) difficulty  		performing one or more ADL or IADL functions as indicated by the screener.  		Questions were asked about the presence of 17 chronic medical conditions, and  		whether in the last 12 months any of 12 medical events had occurred (e.g.,  		heart attack, stroke, broken hip). A series of detailed questions were asked  		regarding each function included in the ADL scale: eating, transferring,  		walking, dressing, bathing, and toileting. Questions on health insurance  		involved coverage by Medicaid, CHAMPUS, other public assistance programs, or  		private health insurance.</p>
<p>Respondents were also asked a series of questions about prior stays in a  		nursing home, including admission dates and durations. Income questions  		addressed receipt of payments by each household member in the past month from  		various sources (e.g., Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits,  		Supplementary Security Income, wages, salaries).</p>
<h3>The 1984 NLTC Survey</h3>
<p>The 1984 survey was designed to provide both longitudinal information on  		persons in the 1982 survey and a nationally representative cross-section of  		disabled persons in 1984. The longitudinal component was intended to provide  		insights into factors contributing to or inhibiting change in functional and  		health status and institutionalization.</p>
<p>Because of the focus of this paper on transitions in nursing home use  		and Medicaid status, the longitudinal data on the cohort of cases for whom  		detailed information was available in both the 1982 and 1984 surveys were  		employed. In 1982, these persons were functionally disabled and residing in the  		community. In 1984, they were still in the community, residing in nursing  		homes, or had died between 1982 and 1984. For these three different situations  		that were possible in 1984, three different survey instruments were used in the  		1984 NLTCS.</p>
<p>The community questionnaire, which was similar to the 1982 survey  		instrument, was used for all functionally limited persons living in the  		community in 1984. Few modifications were introduced, but one was the addition  		of information on liquid assets such as equities and savings accounts.</p>
<p>The questionnaire on deceased persons, which was administered to next of  		kin, had two sections: health care and personal information. The health care  		section elicited data on nursing home, convalescent home and hospital stays if  		that was where the patient died. Questions included the sources of payment for  		those stays. For patients who did not die in such institutions, the  		questionnaire was used to ask about stays just prior to death. There were also  		questions about earlier periods of institutionalization. Finally, there were  		questions about others who provided care to the decedent, both paid and unpaid.  		Personal information surveyed included marital status, race, ethnic origin, and  		income.</p>
<p>The questionnaire for institutionalized persons included three major  		sections: cognitive functions, ADL impairments, and payment sources at  		admission and at the time of survey. As with the other questionnaires, there  		was an indicator for whether the sample person or a proxy answered the  		questions. Questions were asked about admission to nursing homes and periods of  		institutionalization prior to the current nursing home stay. There was also a  		question about hospital stays in the last 12 months. Finally, it was determined  		who paid for care, both at admission and on the date of the survey.</p>
<p>The analysis is focused on transitions between 1982 and 1984 of the  		sample of noninstitutionalized disabled persons who received the detail  		community questionnaire in 1982. Although the 1982 survey was representative of  		the disabled persons in the community, detailed information on disabled persons  		in nursing homes in 1982 was not collected. Hence, the transitions analyzed  		reflected the experience of only noninstitutionalized persons when the sample  		was drawn. If detailed information were available on the institutionalized  		persons, it would have been included in the analysis of transition. Overall  		rates of future nursing home and Medicaid status transitions might be different  		with their inclusion, but a different data source would be required to answer  		this question.</p>
<p>For most of the comparisons, status at the time of the surveys in 1982  		and 1984 was employed. For example, persons who had died in the 2 intervening  		years were regarded as being dead as of 1984. One major intra-interval measure  		that was constructed was any use of nursing homes between 1982 and 1984. Hence,  		this measure included persons who had entered nursing homes and were discharged  		dead or alive to the community, as well as persons who were residents of  		nursing homes in 1984. To measure Medicaid status, the information that was  		available from the community, institutional, and deceased questionnaires was  		used. For the community surveys, Medicaid eligibility for both 1982 and 1984  		were employed, whereas for the institutional and deceased questionnaires,  		Medicaid status referred to actual use of Medicaid as a payment source for  		nursing homes or hospitals. Although a uniform definition would have been  		preferable, this option was not possible in light of the data available.</p>
<p>Findings track the cohort between 1982 and 1984. Described in three  		sequential sections are nursing home use, changes in Medicaid status associated  		with nursing home use, and payment source changes in nursing homes.</p>

<h3>Nursing Home Use</h3>
<p>Nursing homes are use d for different purposes ranging from short-term  		rehabilitative care to long-term care for persons with chronic disabilities  		that preclude their residency in the community. The fact that short- and  		long-stay patients both occupy nursing homes suggested that different types of  		patients need to be differentiated in estimating the risks of nursing home  		entry and the costs of nursing home care over time. To date, the identification  		and measurement of long- versus short-stay nursing home episodes have been  		based primarily on surveys of persons already in nursing homes. In several  		studies of the 1977 National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS), admission  		characteristics and utilization patterns of nursing home patients after they  		were in institutions were described (Keeler et al., 1981; Liu &amp; Manton,  		1983; Liu and Manton, 1984). The distinction between long- and short-stays is  		important to the consideration of Medicaid spenddown issues because many  		short-stay patients may not have to expend personal assets for their nursing  		home stays. Results presented below illustrate the effects of this  		distinction.</p>
<p>Because the 1984 NLTCS elicited detailed information on nursing home use  		in the 2 years since the 1982 NLTCS, it was possible to estimate the total  		incidence of nursing home admissions in this period, as well as to distinguish  		admissions that were long- versus short-stay. In this initial analysis, persons  		who entered nursing homes during the interval and who were still residents in  		nursing homes in 1984 were viewed as long-stay patients. The assumption  		underlying this distinction is the observation that institutionalized persons  		captured in a cross-sectional sample (e.g., persons in nursing homes at the  		time of the 1984 survey) tended to have much longer lengths of stay on average  		than persons in an admission or discharge sample (Manton et al., 1984). For  		example, the median length of completed stays in the 1977 NNHS discharge sample  		was 75 days whereas the average length of stay in the 1977 NNHS current  		resident sample was 597 days (National Center for Health Statistics, 1979).</p>
<p><a href="nhumedes.htm#table1">Table 1</a> presents the proportion of disabled  		community residents in 1982 who were in nursing homes as of the survey in 1984.  		Hence, this table is used to describe the long-stay patients. Subgroup rates of  		nursing home use are also presented by 1982 Medicaid eligibility status and  		other personal characteristics. Overall, 7% of the disabled community residents  		in 1982 were in nursing homes in 1984. As expected, the risk of being a nursing  		home resident increased with age, rising from 4% for those 65 to 74 to 12% for  		persons over age 85. Higher rates of nursing home use were found for females  		and whites, results consistent with other research (NCHS, 1979). Nursing home  		use risks were also strongly related to disability status, with a monotonic  		increase of nursing home use rates by disability status up to ADL 5 to 6.  		Persons with the greatest ADL dependency in 1982 might be expected to have the  		highest rates of nursing home use; the slightly lower rate was due to the high  		mortality risks of this subgroup (Manton, 1987). Although not shown in  		<a href="nhumedes.htm#table1">Table 1</a>, 21% of the 1982 community disabled persons had  		died whereas the remainder who were not in nursing homes were residing in the  		community. About 36% of persons with 5 to 6 ADLs in 1982 had died by 1984, in  		contrast to 15% to 23% for other ADL categories.</p>
<p>Of particular importance is the relationship between income and nursing  		home use. As shown in <a href="nhumedes.htm#table1">Table 1</a>, nursing home use rates  		declined with increasing income for the total sample. This finding suggests  		that availability of financial resources to pay for community care may reduce a  		persons's need to enter nursing homes, all other factors being equal.</p>

</tr></table><p>Medicaid status did not differentiate nursing home use by demographic  		characteristics. The patterns of nursing home use by income categories,  		however, were different between the Medicaid and non-Medicaid groups. Nursing  		home use rates were similar across the income categories for Medicaid, whereas  		nursing home use rates declined monotonically with income for non-Medicaid  		persons. A comparison of lower income groups (i.e., less than $10,000) suggests  		that differences in nursing home use rates were small between Medicaid and  		non-Medicaid persons at these income levels. Higher income non-Medicaid persons  		had notably lower rates of nursing home use, suggesting that income is a more  		important determinant of nursing home use than Medicaid status.</p>

</tr></table><p>Also presented in <a href="nhumedes.htm#table2">Table 2</a> is nursing home use by  		Medicaid status in 1982. Similar to the findings in <a href="nhumedes.htm#table1">Table  		1</a>, Medicaid status did not differentiate the overall patterns that were  		found between demographic characteristics and nursing home use. Also similar  		was the finding that Medicaid and non-Medicaid persons in the lower income  		categories had approximately the same use rates, whereas non-Medicaid persons  		with incomes of $20,000 or more had notably lower rates.</p>
<p>Of the 12% of respondents who spent any time in nursing homes in the  		2-year interval, 24% died by 1984,15% returned to the community with 60% still  		in nursing homes in 1984. Hence, 40% of nursing home admissions were for  		relatively short periods of stay. Among the persons who entered nursing homes  		but returned to the community by 1984, approximately half were in nursing homes  		for less than 30 days and 80% had lengths of stay of less than 90 days. Those  		residents used nursing homes for convalescent or rehabilitative care and were  		distinct from others who were institutionalized for very long stays. Further  		analyses indicated no notable difference in length of stay for those who were  		Medicaid eligible and not Medicaid eligible in 1982.</p>
<p>After examining the risk of nursing home use, the amount of time it took  		for individuals with specific characteristics to enter nursing homes since the  		1982 survey was investigated. As shown in <a href="nhumedes.htm#table3">Table 3</a> for  		both Medicaid and non-Medicaid persons who entered nursing homes, the mean time  		before admission was about 470 days. Approximately 15% entered a nursing home  		after less than 6 months in the community. Although not presented here, in  		additional analyses no notable differences were found in duration prior to  		nursing home admissions between subsets of the Medicaid and non-Medicaid  		samples in terms of their demographic and functional characteristics.</p>
<p>Although these findings are contradictory to widely held notions that  		Medicaid patients have greater problems than private pay patients in gaining  		access to nursing homes, a possible explanation is that many disabled elderly  		persons who were not Medicaid eligible were only marginally better off than  		their Medicaid eligible counterparts and were subject to similar access  		barriers to nursing homes.</p>
<h3>Nursing Home and Medicaid Status Changes</h3>
<p>Described in the prior section was the use of nursing homes of the 1982  		NLTCS sample. Examined in this section is how their use of nursing homes  		resulted in spenddown to Medicaid. Although individuals can be on and off  		Medicaid eligibility over time, an important issue is whether nursing home use,  		particularly long stays in nursing homes, resulted in indefinite Medicaid  		eligibility. Because most policy concerns have been on how individuals who are  		not Medicaid eligible become impoverished through use of long-term care and  		remain Medicaid recipients over time, focus was on the transitions experienced  		by persons who were non-Medicaid in 1982.</p>
<p>To investigate the relationship between nursing home use and change from  		non-Medicaid to Medicaid status, the likelihood of Medicaid spenddown given  		that the person had been in a nursing home and the likelihood of Medicaid  		spenddown in the absence of a nursing home admission were compared. These  		results are presented in <a href="nhumedes.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a>, and reflect the joint  		events of nursing home use and qualification for Medicaid eligibility. Depicted  		in <a href="nhumedes.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a> is the partitioning of the 1982 sample of  		disabled non-Medicaid persons in 1982 by whether nursing homes were used  		between 1982 and 1984, whether location status in 1984 was nursing home  		residency, community residency or deceased, and whether persons were Medicaid  		eligible in 1984.</p>

</tr></table><p>Shown in <a href="nhumedes.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a> is that 12% of non-Medicaid  		eligible community disabled persons in 1982 spent some time in a nursing home  		between 1982 and 1984. The remaining 88% remained in the community for the  		entire 2-year period or died between 1982 and 1984. Next, the nursing home use  		and non-nursing home use groups are each separated by their 1984 status, i.e.,  		they were still in the community, in a nursing home, or died between 1982 and  		1984. Among the persons who had spent any time in nursing homes, 17% had  		returned to the community, 24% had deceased but 60% were still in nursing homes  		in 1984. Over 90% of the persons who entered nursing homes, but returned to the  		community, were not Medicaid eligible in 1984. Although the number of cases at  		this point was small, the apparently high proportion of nursing home patients  		who did not spend down because they did not spend much time in nursing homes is  		consistent with expectation. In contrast, persons who were still in nursing  		homes in 1984, the expected long-stay patients, had a much higher proportion  		(41%) who had become Medicaid patients. For the deceased, 21% had become  		Medicaid eligible by the time they died.</p>
<p>Among the persons who had not used nursing homes at any time between  		1982 and 1984, 80% were still in the community in 1984 whereas 20% had died.  		Regardless of their vital status in 1984, only 6% to 7% were Medicaid eligible  		as of 1984. In contrast to the persons who had used nursing homes at any time  		between 1982-84, this rate of Medicaid eligibility was quite low.</p>
<p>Results in <a href="nhumedes.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a> indicated several important  		relationships between nursing home use and Medicaid status. First, there is a  		strong relationship between nursing home use and Medicaid spenddown. In  		comparing persons who were Medicaid eligible in 1984 who spent time in nursing  		homes in the prior 2 years with those who had not, it was found that the  		likelihood of being Medicaid eligible was 31% if they spent any time in a  		nursing home compared to 7% if nursing homes were not used. From  		<a href="nhumedes.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a>, summing the cases that used nursing homes and  		were Medicaid eligible as of 1984 (<i>n</i> = 155) and dividing by the number  		of cases experiencing any nursing home use between 1982 and 1984 (<i>n</i> =  		506) yielded the proportion (31%) of nursing home users who were Medicaid  		eligible. A similar calculation can be made with the non-nursing home users  		which yielded a 7% Medicaid eligibility rate. Hence, a disabled elderly person  		has 4 to 5 times greater risk of being Medicaid eligible in 2 years if he or  		she were admitted anytime in the 2-year period.</p>

</tr></table><p>Second, temporary or short stays in nursing homes do not increase one's  		risk of spending down to Medicaid. Only 7% of persons who entered nursing homes  		and returned to the community were Medicaid eligible in 1984; this rate of  		Medicaid eligibility is similar to the 6% to 7% of community residents in 1984  		who became Medicaid eligible and did not spend time in a nursing home. In  		contrast, 41 % of the persons still in nursing homes in 1984, the long stayers,  		were Medicaid eligible. Hence long-term residents had a 7-fold increase in risk  		of Medicaid spenddown.</p>
<p>Third, <a href="nhumedes.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a> also indicated that spenddown to  		Medicaid can occur without nursing home use. About 6% to 7% of the disabled  		elderly people who were not Medicaid eligible are expected to become eligible  		within 2 years without high costs of nursing home care.</p>
<p>The analysis presented in <a href="nhumedes.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a> is an initial  		assessment of the important relationship between nursing home use and Medicaid  		eligibility. It is limited in several ways. For example, the description of the  		process by which noninstitutionalized, non-Medicaid persons in 1982 used  		nursing homes and became Medicaid eligible by 1984 offered in  		<a href="nhumedes.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a> is limited to a comparison of differences in  		status at two fixed points in time. Between 1982 and 1984, multiple nursing  		home admissions could have been experienced by persons in the sample, with  		Medicaid spenddown occurring at any point in the interval. In addition, the  		results reflected the average national experience of a sample of disabled older  		persons. The patterns of transitions may differ considerably between states  		because of the variability of Medicaid eligibility policies and the variation  		of socio-economic characteristics of disabled elderly populations across  		states. Finally, the analysis was focused on changes in Medicaid eligibility.  		Not described is the rate at which Medicaid costs were being incurred for  		services. Hence, although the results of this analysis were intended to provide  		insights for the development of cost assessment strategies, the data available  		from the NLTCS were not designed to make specific analyses of Medicaid  		costs.</p>
<h3>Payment Sources Changes of Nursing Home Admissions</h3>
<p>Described earlier was the relationship between nursing home use between  		1982 and 1984 and the conversion of non-Medicaid disabled persons to Medicaid  		status as of 1984. Examined in this section in greater detail are payment  		sources of persons who were nursing home patients in 1984.</p>
<p>Data in the NLTCS on payment source changes for nursing home care were  		available only for persons who were residents of nursing homes in 1984.  		Approximately 400 persons from the 1982 community sample fell into this  		category. Because persons in the 1982 cohort were known to reside in the  		community, at the lime of the 1982 survey they could only have been  		institutionalized for 2 years or less by 1984. In addition, since the survey  		was conducted in 1984, the length of stay in nursing homes of this group was  		also truncated. Thus, in assessing payment source changes, only partial  		information was available be cause some sample members had not been in nursing  		homes long enough for all changes in payment source to occur.</p>
<p>Presented in <a href="nhumedes.htm#table4">Table 4</a> are the sources of payment  		reported at admission and at the time of the 1984 survey. For both time points,  		asked in the 1984 NLTCS were sources that contributed to payment for care.  		Hence, <a href="nhumedes.htm#table4">Table 4</a> results reflected multiple responses to  		the payment source questions. A major source of payment for most persons is  		Social Security which in the NLTCS was included under the response category  		self. The most significant comparison in this table is the percentage of  		persons who were Medicaid eligible at admission and at the time of the 1984  		survey. It is important to recall, however, that most Medicaid eligible nursing  		home patients are expending other sources of funds (e.g., Social Security)  		toward the payment of their nursing home care, and Medicaid does not normally  		pay for 100% of per them nursing home costs.</p>
<p>Shown in <a href="nhumedes.htm#table4">Table 4</a> is that Medicaid was reported to  		be a source of payment at admission in 40% of the cases and a payment source at  		the time of the survey in 50% of the cases. The increases in the proportion of  		cases with Medicaid as a payment source from admission to current residence  		reflects the process of spenddown. This estimate (i.e., 10%) may be high,  		however, because persons who reported Medicare as a payment source might have  		been Medicaid eligible while Medicare was paying for the days of nursing home  		care.</p>
<p>Approximately half the sample reported self as a source of payment both  		at admission and at the time of the 1984 survey. Children contributed to the  		payment of nursing home care for 8% of both samples. Private insurance was a  		source of payment in 5% of the cases at admission. This proportion declined to  		3% by the time of the survey. Similarly, Medicare, which was a source of  		payment in 21% of the cases at admission, declined to 12% by the time of the  		survey.</p>

</tr></table><p>The decline in the proportion of residents using private insurance and  		Medicare payments from admission to the survey date reflected the relatively  		short period to time these payment mechanisms cover nursing home costs.  		Medicare, for example, has a maximum duration of coverage of 100 days. The  		change in private insurance suggested that durations of coverage by this source  		could also have been short, possibly as a benefit of Medigap policies.</p>
<p>Another important question with policy implications is the duration in  		which people spenddown. Because sample persons had not completed their nursing  		home stays, it was not possible to describe this phenomenon completely.  		Additionally, many private payers had not been in facilities long enough for  		spenddown to occur. For those who did spenddown, however, by the time the 1984  		survey was conducted, it was possible to measure the duration between  		non-Medicaid and Medicaid status. Specifically, information on spenddown over  		time was available from the 1982-84 NLTCS on only 22 cases for the 1982 cohort.  		Because of the selection for short stayers in the 1982 cohort (i.e., the  		constraint that they were in the community 2 years earlier), the mean spenddown  		period for this group was only 159 days whereas 73% converted in 6 months. This  		duration is short relative to prior estimates by the U.S. Government General  		Accounting Office (1979) and the U.S. House of Representatives Aging Committee  		(1985). The GAO, for example, found that approximately half of the private  		patients took about 6 months to convert to Medicaid.</p>
<h2><a name="discussion" id="discussion">DISCUSSION</a></h2>
<p>Initial findings were presented on the transition of nursing home use  		and Medicaid status of functionally impaired persons originally residing in the  		community. Simple measures were employed to provide insights on the  		relationship between use of nursing homes, by type of stay, and catastrophic  		costs from the 1982-84 NLTCS. For example, short- versus long-stay nursing home  		patients were identified by their institutional status in 1984. This provided  		only a crude approximation of long- and short-stays. Improved estimates could  		be derived by employing other characteristics of patients entering nursing  		homes such as clinical conditions (e.g., hip fracture versus Alzheimer's  		disease). Similarly, transition from non-Medicaid to Medicaid status was used  		as a measure of catastrophic long-term care costs. Although other constructs  		(e.g., costs relative to ability to pay) (Wyszewianski, 1986) could produce  		different results, there is general consensus that the spenddown of personal  		wealth to Medicaid eligibility reflects the effects of catastrophic health care  		costs.</p>
<p>Initial findings from the 1982-84 NLTCS added new information for the  		consideration of long-term care research and policies. First, the analysis  		indicated that short-stays in nursing homes had virtually no impact on the  		risks of becoming Medicaid eligible, whereas long-stays greatly increased the  		risk of Medicaid spenddown. Because 40% of the nursing home admissions between  		1982-84 were short-stays, adjustments for the heterogeneity of nursing home use  		would be important in actuarial and policy analysis of long-term care  		requirements. Although prior research on determinants of nursing home use  		tended to view nursing home entry as a homogeneous event, it is likely that  		functions predicting different types of nursing home use could be quite  		different types of nursing home use could be quite different.</p>
<p>Second, the results indicated a strong association between nursing home  		use and Medicaid spenddown. Whereas disabled older persons who were not  		Medicaid eligible and residing in the community had a 7% risk of becoming  		Medicaid eligible in 2 years, those who used nursing homes at any time had 4 to  		5 times the risk of spending down to Medicaid eligibility. Although nursing  		home use heightens the risks of spenddown, the results also indicated that  		disabled older Americans incur catastrophic long-term care costs without  		entering nursing homes.</p>
<p>Third, the results indicated that overall duration prior to nursing home  		admission were similar for Medicaid and non-Medicaid eligible persons.  		Moreover, nursing home use rates of disabled older persons were similar for  		Medicaid eligible persons and non-Medicaid persons in lower income categories.  		On the other hand, nursing home use rates were notably lower for non-Medicaid  		individuals with higher incomes. These results suggest that income rather than  		Medicaid status is the important determinant of nursing home use. Future  		research involving multivariate analyses of health and functional status,  		income and informal support would be required, however, to determine the extent  		to which differences by Medicaid eligibility status or income were due to need  		for nursing home care or ability to pay for community based care.</p>
<p>Fourth, although the payment source information presented provided  		further information on the nursing home spenddown process, the paucity of data  		on how long patients use one payment source before hanging to another continues  		to be a limitation in the consideration of many public and private policies on  		nursing home care. Other sources of information would be needed to provide  		actuarial estimates of the costs of nursing home care to individuals and to  		Medicaid. Ideally, a data source that permits the derivation of the full  		nursing home use experience of an admission cohort by proportion of total costs  		would be needed for this purpose. Moreover, this information for specific  		states would be desirable because of the variability of the state Medicaid  		policies noted earlier.</p>
<p>Although further research would clarify the different ways in which  		financially catastrophic long-term care costs are incurred, the findings  		presented earlier highlighted the fact that both community based care and  		nursing home care costs need to be addressed in the consideration of new  		policies to reduce the financial risks of older Americans. Further research is  		required to translate these preliminary findings into empirical models to  		estimate Medicaid program costs, private costs, and the potential effects of  		programs, such as long-term care insurance, that might alter the period of  		private payment for nursing home care.</p>
<h2><a name="conclusions" id="conclusions">CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p>Congressional deliberations about catastrophic health care costs have  		resulted in the recommendation of new Medicare policies to reduce the risks of  		catastrophic costs from acute care. Although policy makers also recognized that  		costs of long-term care can be catastrophic, there has been less movement  		toward safeguarding individuals and their families from the financial hazards  		of long-term care costs. The absence of action to address the financially  		catastrophic long-term care risk of elderly people stems from many reasons  		including the anticipation that coverage of long-term care could have high  		public costs. The high potential costs of long-term care have also induced  		private insurers to proceed cautiously in the development and marketing of  		private long-term care policies.</p>
<p>The collective findings from the preliminary analysis begin to describe  		a highly vulnerable subgroup of the elderly population in terms of its use of  		and financial ability to pay for long-term care. An overall 9% Medicaid  		spenddown rate indicated that many non-Medicaid disabled persons had marginal  		incomes and assets above Medicaid eligibility and were at high risk of  		impoverishment. Their high rates of nursing home use, in contrast to higher  		income persons, suggest a possible combination of more severe disabilities and  		inability to pay for formal community based care.</p>
<p>As policy makers continue to deliberate long-term care policies to  		mitigate the risks associated with chronic disabilities, a key consideration  		should be the availability of private financial resources to pay for long-term  		care. It is apparent that both financial status and health status predispose  		subgroups of the disabled elderly population toward becoming Medicaid  		beneficiaries. Although elderly persons of all income categories are at risk of  		requiring long-term care, those with limited financial resources are  		particularly subject to catastrophic costs and possible limitations in access  		to care. As various new public and private options for financing long-term care  		are considered, a clear priority concern for public policies should be the  		financially vulnerable among the disabled elderly population.</p>
