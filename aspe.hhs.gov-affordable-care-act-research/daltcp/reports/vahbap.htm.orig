<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">1.0 INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>There is an incongruity in the way noninstitutional services are  		subsidized in this country. Disabled persons in the general population with  		money make decisions daily so to the makeup of their living environments,  		buying a mix of goods and services which best promotes their independence. In  		contrast, most disabled persons without sufficient resources have very little  		freedom of choice: Rather than being provided with a cash supplement which  		they, too, could spend to maximize independence, the poor in general either are  		restricted to choices from a narrow list of services paid for by public monies  		(known as vouchers), or, more commonly, are limited to the type and quantity of  		services they can receive as dictated by agents of a public authority (known as  		in-kind transfer payments). Our society is implicitly saying that the  		financially needy disabled cannot manage their resources as well as all other  		disabled persons and should not be trusted to do so.</p>
<p>This is not the case in almost every other country in the world. In most  		countries, including virtually all industrialized nations, public subsidies for  		noninstitutional long-term care are in the form of cash as well as in-kind  		(Tracy, 1974). These cash disability grants for long-term care, called  		"attendance" or "attendant care" allowances in recognition of the need for  		assistance by another person, are usually the first, and sometimes the only  		public intervention used to help noninstitutionalized frail elderly cope with  		the additional burdens imposed by their functional disabilities (Grana, 1983).  		Recipients who qualify on the basis of medical need, and in most cases on the  		basis of financing need as well, receive unrestricted cash grants which can be  		spent on anything they wish.</p>
<p>Attendance allowances were generally adopted first by agencies charged  		with the affairs of war veterans. The U.S. Veterans Administration (VA) is no  		exception. The Housebound and Aid and Attendance Allowance Program of the VA  		provides cash grants to 220,000 disabled veterans and surviving spouses a year  		in lieu of formally provided homemaker, personal care and other services needed  		for assistance in activities of daily living and other help at home. VA has  		been providing these allowances for over 35 years--legislative authority for  		this program is provided by Public Law 82-149, enacted on November 1, 1951. The  		program is means-tested for nonservice-connected disabilities under the general  		pension program (185,160 beneficiaries in 1985); grants for service-connected  		disabilities are made on the basis of medical need only (35,422 beneficiaries  		in 1985). Implicit VA policy is to allow competent disabled persons to decide  		how best to meet their own needs, not to make all those decisions on their  		behalf.</p>
<p>The advantages of cash compared to in-kind benefits have long been noted  		by economists. Competent consumers know best how to allocate their scarce  		budgets among all possible commodities and services to maximize the  		satisfaction of their needs and wants; they are more efficient than any other  		person in promoting their own personal well-being, happiness and independence.  		The cash equivalent of an in-kind transfer will permit a beneficiary to achieve  		a higher level of well-being and happiness, and in this sense, the cash  		transfer is socially optimal and more efficient. A cash benefit has the  		additional advantage (in most cases) of being easier and less costly to  		administer.</p>
<p>Cash benefits are used extensively in other public programs in the U.S.  		For recipients of an old age or survivor's pension, or of supplemental security  		income, the government does not try to purchase housing, food and clothing in  		the right quantities for each individual. The task of equating the complex  		needs and preferences of each individual to a set of in-kind transfers is  		clearly an impossible one. Instead, the level of entitlement of need is set,  		and checks are sent to beneficiaries who spend their monies on needed goods and  		services just like everyone else. Since the need for long-term care also is  		multidimensional, why, then, should not assistance for help at home be in the  		form of cash?</p>
<p>Critics of cash disability allowances would argue that most old disabled  		persons dont know what they need in the way of services, or are not  		competent to judge what is good for them: that people will squander their  		grants on unnecessary items, purchase an insufficient amount of needed  		services, become more frail and ill, need more intensive acute and long-term  		care, and eventually fall back on the social safety net at an even greater cost  		to society. They feel that care decisions must be made on behalf of the  		elderly, and that subsidies should be in the form of in-kind services which  		leave little decision-making in the hands of the recipient. Others might argue  		that the number of claims for a cash benefit would be much greater than for an  		in-kind benefit, so that screening, and hence administrative, costs of the cash  		benefit could actually be greater.</p>
<p>This project had two major goals. This first was to describe the  		workings of a successful, large-scale, cash disability allowance program from  		an administrative perspective. The VA allowance program is described in detail,  		to provide a benchmark for future research and program design. The second goal  		was to examine the question whether recipients of a cash allowance for  		long-term care are worse off than similar persons who receive in-kind  		subsidies. This study does so by examining the life circumstances of 139  		recipients of the VA Housebound Allowance or Aid and Attendance Allowance. The  		health, functional needs, and use of services of these persons are compared  		with those of 610 persons interviewed in the 1983 National Long-Term Care  		Survey who received services in-kind. This report represents the first outside  		evaluation of this program.</p>
<p>The analytical results of the study suggest that recipients of the cash  		disability allowance received similar levels of long-term care and were no  		worse off than the comparison group with regard to acute health care  		utilization. Evidence on hours of care per week and the direct  		(non-administrative) costs of the VA cash allowance program suggest that the  		cash benefit may be the more cost-effective alternative for many beneficiaries.  		One interesting by-product of the analysis was the finding that the  		substitution of subsidized, in-kind care for informal effort was significant  		and approximately one-to-one.</p>
<p>The full report is organized as follows: <a href="#restrict">Section  		2.0</a> lays out the conceptual issues underlying the use of cash versus  		in-kind subsidies, and summarizes the literature pertinent to these topics.  		<a href="#cash">Section 3.0</a> describes the VA Housebound and Aid and  		Attendance Allowance Program, including program benefits, eligibility criteria,  		and administration. <a href="#research">Section 4.0</a> describes the study  		research design and methodology. <a href="#analysis">Section 5.0</a> presents  		the analytical results and findings, including implications for policy and  		further research.</p>
<h2><a name="restrict" id="restrict">2.0 RESTRICTED TRANSFERS VERSUS CASH  		ALLOWANCE</a></h2>
<p>With the exception of the United States Veterans Administration, most  		public home care programs are in-kind: after eligibility for the program has  		been determined, the client is usually provided with a fixed amount of services  		determined by the administering agency. Services are either provided by  		salaried personnel from the local public authority or are purchased in the  		private market on behalf of the client by the authority. Some countries in some  		states provide vouchers for services which allow the client to select the mix  		and amount of services from the narrow list of possible alternatives; a few  		provide cash supplements. Both of these types of programs, however, are rare  		(Urban Systems Research and Engineering, 1981). In general, the provision of  		services in-kind predominates.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of such cash transfer programs for long-term care,  		little research has been conducted to compare their cost and effectiveness with  		in-kind services. One of the earliest discussion of the advantages of cash  		allowances in Humm-Delgado and Morris (1976). They discuss cash allowances in  		the context of payments to families with mentally retarded dependents. They  		describe a number of cash payment programs which share three goals: to help  		support, strengthen and keep families intact; to reduce and prevent the social  		and economic costs of institutionalization; and to provide necessary services  		without social service agency and bureaucratic structures and overhead. They  		point out that the substitution of public dollars for private effort is both a  		wise intervention and a major concern. They note the fear that some  		policymakers have that such subsidies will make families refuse to provide  		services without them. Cash subsidies also are easy to abuse and difficult to  		monitor. The key public policy issue is how to maximize the economic benefit by  		supporting the disabled person and enabling caregivers to sustain their effort  		while, at the same time, trying not to supplant too much private effort with  		public resources.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the economic benefits of public subsidies for  		care at home do not necessarily have to take the form of reduced or retarded  		institutionalization. Recent research concludes that the relationship between  		home care and reduced institutionalization is tenuous (Weissert, 1985; Skellie,  		et al, 1982; and Mathematica, 1985). This study takes the view that there are  		other legitimate and socially useful reasons for subsidizing care at home, such  		as relieving the burdens of caregivers, and because of which, taxpayers are  		willing to pay for it. Therefore, this study does not address the relationship  		between home care and institutionalization. Instead, this study asks the  		question: Which method of subsidizing care is the most efficient one, given  		that society wishes to subsidize home care?</p>
<h3>2.1 Conceptual Issues</h3>
<p>This and the following section discusses the theoretical issues of  		in-kind services versus cash allowances from the perspective of economics. The  		economic model, which is but one of many possible conceptualizations of this  		topic area, establishes the framework for the empirical analysis which  		follows.</p>
<p><b><i>2.1.1 Consumer Sovereignty and Efficiency</i></b></p>
<p>The provision of in-kind services for needy persons precludes  		sovereignty: that is, the making of informed and rational choices  		by consumers to maximize their personal well-being. Under conditions of  		competitive markets and consumer sovereignty, if the public is interested in  		the well-being of the recipient of public transfers in general, but not the  		recipients consumption of a particular commodity or service, cash  		transfers are generally more efficient (less costly for the same beneficial  		effects) than restricted transfers. Sovereign consumers may spend all of the  		cash equivalent on exactly the same amount of service they would have received  		in-kind; the consumer may also spend less than this amount, if he or she feels  		some portion of it could be better spent on other goods or services. Cash  		enables the beneficiary to purchase things which are of greatest value. Under  		these conditions, the value of the benefits are optimal, and the social cost of  		the program is minimized. (These conceptual issues, and those that follow, are  		discussed in an excellent article by Gruenberg and Pillemer, 1981, and also by  		Grana, 1983.)</p>
<p>A common argument for restricting transfers in long-term care is that,  		like acute care medical services, long-term care services are complex and not  		capable of being understood even by fully competent consumers who must seek  		advice before making choices among a set of highly technical alternatives. In  		consequence, the provider must demand the service on behalf of the individual.  		The demand for services is thus distorted, markets may not be competitive, and  		the final allocation of resources does not reflect the preference of consumers.  		That is, consumers of health care are not sovereign, and it may be more  		efficient to restrict transfer payments to recipients with vouchers or with  		in-kind transfers.</p>
<p>It is not necessarily true, however, that long-term care consumers are  		incapable of informed and rationale choices. Some aspects of personal care in  		the home are technical, but compared with acute care services, they are far  		less technical and sophisticated and much easier to match with individual  		needs. Information gathering in medical care markets and perhaps in long-term  		care markets may be similar to that in markets for other commodities, such as  		stereo equipment, where consumer sovereignty exists and technical advice is  		sought before a purchase is made (Reinhardt, 1981). May elderly people have an  		informal network of family and friends to help with important decisions and act  		as broker to the system in general; local agencies can also fulfill this role  		by giving advice. Thus, it is not always necessary for medical providers to  		make choices for the consumer of long-term care.</p>
<p>Cash subsidies also may be more efficient than in-kind subsidies because  		they permit time-shifting of expenditures. Whereas in-kind  		subsidies are consumed when provided, cash may be saved and accumulated to be  		spent at a more propitious time. Cash also may be accumulated and spent on  		needed goods and services which yield equivalent benefit but which costs more  		than a single unit of an in-kind benefit. An example of this is an  		electromechanical device which raises and lowers disabled persons into  		bathtubs. Although an expensive investment, its use may obviate a much greater  		value of personal attendant care required for the same function. Thus, cash can  		enhance the sovereignty of consumers by eliminating barriers due to the timing  		and lumpiness of expenditures.</p>
<p><i><b>2.1.2 Substitution Effects</b></i></p>
<p>Most home care is provided by informal caregivers (Soldo, 1983). This  		represents an enormous financial burden which is borne by families and friends  		rather than taxpayers in general. From societys point of view, it is  		worthwhile to support the informal support network in their efforts to keep  		their disabled dependents out of more costly institutions by substituting  		public resources for the excessive caregiving burden which can ultimately  		destroy the will to care for a dependent person at home.</p>
<p>As public subsidies to encourage informal caregiving are increased,  		however, there is the risk that too much informal effort will be reduced; that  		public resources will substitute for private time and money that would  		otherwise be spent willingly on behalf of the disabled person. This  		substitution effect can translate into a tremendous waste of public  		resources. Despite the potential magnitude of this problem, however, little is  		known about the impact of public subsidies on caregiver behavior.</p>
<p>In light of the dearth of information on this complex problem, we may  		ask a different question: Does the form of public subsidies for long-term home  		care matter? That is, is one type of subsidy more efficient than the others in  		encouraging informal caregiving and not providing incentives for the excessive  		substitution of public for private effort?</p>
<p>Given any chosen level of care for a dependent, a family or informal  		support network must decide how much of its own time to substitute for goods  		and services purchased in the market. This is an economic decision tempered by  		family preferences. Families that are relatively more efficient at earning  		incomes will tend to work more and buy more caregiving services in the market;  		those who can earn only relatively low wages face lower opportunity costs of  		staying home to care for a dependent elder and will tend to do so, and will  		tend to purchase fewer caregiving services in the market. In-kind subsidies are  		inflexible in the sense that they substitute one-for-one for services otherwise  		delivered by the family and informal caregivers; they do not permit the kinds  		of allocative decisions mentioned above that families make on the first amounts  		of home care needed by the dependent person. In contrast to in-kind subsidies,  		however, for recipients of a cash subsidy, some informal effort may be used to  		substitute for services otherwise purchased in the marketplace, and the cash  		retained to be spent on goods and services which complement rather than  		substitute for caregiving. This allows the dependent and caregiver to select  		the mix of substitute care and other goods and services which are most  		appropriate given family resources and the informal caregivers available  		time and opportunity wage (that is, the wage the caregiver could earn if a  		participant in the labor market). The incentive is clearly to choose the right  		amount of formal (market-supplied) and informal caregiving which maximizes the  		value of the subsidy.</p>
<p>Pollak (1986) summarizes the importance of the flexibility of cash  		subsidies to public policy. Under policies that subsidize only formal  		noninstitutional care, . . .there is an incentive to use formal rather  		than informal care even when the social cost of the informal care is lower. The  		efficiency of a cash grant system relative to its alternatives derives from  		shifting actual care tasks toward informal systems when they are the preferred  		(least social cost) mode, even as, consistent with an equity objective, it  		shifts burdens from the impaired and their families by providing cash  		resources. This significant virtue is still further enhanced to the degree that  		society sees a social benefit in family and informal care even beyond the  		benefit felt by those directly involved.</p>
<h3>2.2 Critiques of Cash Transfers</h3>
<p><i><b>2.2.1 Competency and Consumer Protection</b></i></p>
<p>Some elderly consumers of long-term care are not capable of making  		rational decisions even with perfect information. Some need formal advice, and  		a small portion of them require some or all decisions to be made on their  		behalf. It is the clear responsibility of society to protect those individuals  		who, because of brain disease or other causes of confusion, are not capable of  		making appropriate decisions regarding their well-being, and who do not have  		brokers. Paternalism is often a realistic response to the elders  		preference for happiness over freedom in a world dominated by forces too vast  		and too complicated for him to manage himself (Halper, 1980). In this  		case, cash is not an efficient mechanism and restricted transfers are  		appropriate. The costs, in both human and economic terms, from the  		inappropriate allocation of a cash benefit will likely exceed those costs of  		the inefficient matching of needs and preferences with a set of in-kind  		benefits.</p>
<p>For most, though, restrictions on the long-term care market may cause  		problems. Restricted client decision-making greatly diminishes the possibility  		that limited resources will be spent most appropriately to maximize well-being  		for many. Incorrect decisions about long-term care use are costly, both in  		human and financial terms. But there are also costs involved in designing  		programs for all to protect the few who will make poor decisions. Public  		programs designed to restrict the choices and hence, the liberty, of  		recipients, for many of whom such restrictions are not appropriate, tend to  		undermine an individuals self-confidence and independence, which  		reinforces dependent behavior. Such programs will tend to promote and propagate  		stereotypes of old people as decrepit and dependent, further distancing them  		from the mainstream of society. Thus, the social and personal costs of  		paternalism, which are often ignored or neglected by society, can be high.</p>
<p>Even if the effects of long-term care services on well-being were known  		with great accuracy, it is not clear that individuals preferences for other  		goods and services are not more important to well-being than long-term care.  		How do we know that 15 hours of personal attendance is more appropriate for a  		given individual than 11 hours of personal attendance and a jug of wine? In  		fact, it is quite possible that for many people the actual act of choosing  		ones environment may be far more important to well-being and resulting  		postponement of dependency and institutionalization than any formal service  		society can provide (Bishop, 1981).</p>
<p>Restricting client decision-making for every public recipient greatly  		diminishes the possibility that limited resources will be spent most  		appropriately to maximize well-being for many. Given the heterogeneity of the  		elderly population in the United States, with a wide range of personal care  		needs and mental competence, and the uncertainty of existing assessment  		instruments and the unpredictability of the impact of standard sets of services  		and therapies, the efficient allocation of noninstitutional long-term care can  		not be achieved with one policy instrument. Rather, attempts should be made to  		seek out and employ the whole spectrum of policy instruments: Given a  		continuum of individuals with varying degrees of competence, transfer payments  		need a corresponding continuum of transfers ranging from cash, cash with  		advice, vouchers, in-kind provision, and finally, compulsion (Thurow,  		1974).</p>
<p><i><b><a name="section2.2.2" id="section2.2.2">2.2.2 Moral Hazard</a></b></i></p>
<p>A major criticism of cash subsidies is that they are inherently more  		attractive than equivalent amounts of in-kind subsidies: They will provide an  		incentive for persons to misrepresent their condition or state of health either  		to qualify for the subsidy or to receive a larger subsidy. There is also an  		incentive for families to exaggerate (lower) their capacities and capability to  		care for a dependent, where such considerations are taken into account by the  		public agency. This is commonly called moral hazard. In this  		regard, an in-kind subsidy such as a particular commodity or service is  		superior to cash (Krashinsky, 1981).</p>
<p>The primary implication of moral hazard is that administrative costs  		associated with screening will be greater for cash than for in-kind subsidies  		for home care. The woodwork effect (persons seeking a cash subsidy  		who would not otherwise have sought an in-kind subsidy) and an  		exaggeration effect (persons falsely overstating their claim for a  		greater level of subsidy) will increase the level of resources needed to screen  		out illegitimate claims on the subsidy. Pollack (1983) points out that an  		in-kind long-term care subsidy for noninstitutional services also faces the  		moral hazard posed by the cash grant program, but to a lesser degree. Such a  		benefit aids relatives of the impaired by releasing them from caregiving  		responsibilities; incentives exist for false representation of the impaired  		persons degree of infirmity. Better (more accurate) screening and  		assessment should mitigate this problem. Nevertheless, the number of screens  		should be higher, and information gathering costs will be higher. There is,  		therefore, an empirical question: Do the increased administrative costs for  		screening outweigh the savings from a more efficient cash program? One study  		observed seven small-scale cash subsidy programs and noted negligible rates of  		fraud as well as reduced levels of administrative burden (CSR, 1983). Because  		of the expense involved and the unavailability of key information on  		administrative costs for the VA cash disability allowance program, this study  		is not able to address this issue.</p>
<p><i><b>2.2.3 Adjusting for Family Situation</b></i></p>
<p>Pollak (1986) points out that in the ideal case, the cash grant benefit  		should be equal to the excess of needs over family assistance. The problem is  		measuring what the family can, is willing to, or should do. Inaccurate  		measurement will lead to a higher or lower grant than necessary. The question  		is whether the social costs of not adjusting the benefit level for family  		situation outweigh the social benefits of the cash program. This is an  		empirical question; a matter of degree. Some elements can be measured; for  		example, the presence or absence of a relative or caregiver, and also the  		relative burden of a task. Some elements can not be measured; for example, the  		willingness of families and the strength of familial relationships. It should  		be noted that this is a problem with in-kind benefits as well.</p>
<p><i><b>2.2.4 Beneficiary and Caregiver Preferences</b></i></p>
<p>A final criticism of cash allowances for long-term care is the claim  		that both care receivers and caregivers prefer services to cash (Sussman, 1979;  		Horowitz and Shindelman, 1980 and 1983). Such claims are based on studies of  		real life caregiving situations, but hypothetical, and poorly stated,  		alternatives. In general, the level of services or the total costs of services  		was not stated in the alternatives presented to recipients of services and  		their families, and legitimate comparisons were not capable of being made with  		a cash equivalent. For example, this was not the same as asking the question:  		To relieve this identified stress, would you prefer $400 per month worth of  		homemaker services or $400 in cash? These studies are policy irrelevant with  		respect to research on cash allowances.</p>
<h3>2.3 Experience with Cash and Voucher Programs in the  		U.S.</h3>
<p><i><b>2.3.1 Existing Home Care Programs with Other than In-Kind  		Benefits</b></i></p>
<p>Cash, vouchers, and tax reductions are three types of alternative  		mechanisms currently being utilized in the United States for financing public  		social services. Cash subsidy programs involved direct assistance or cash  		reimbursement to clients to finance social services. A voucher, which is given  		to the eligible recipient, represents a written guarantee or promise of payment  		to a service provider. In response to the desire by families to exercise choice  		in the amount, type, source, and use of family support services, the use of  		cash subsidies and vouchers in the delivery of family support services is on  		the increase (Agosta and Bradley, 1985). A survey of family-support programs in  		17 states reported that 14 of these states employed a cash subsidy or voucher  		mechanism (Bird, W.A., 1984). Tax reductions utilize the tax system to  		indirectly encourage persons or their families to purchase needed social  		services. All three mechanisms aim to stimulate the private market to supply  		long-term care services as well as to subsidize their consumption.</p>
<p><b>2.3.1.1 Cash Subsidy Programs for Home Care</b></p>
<p>As of 1983, 17 states had small scale cash subsidy programs for  		community-based home care (CSR, 1983). Some programs provided one-time grants  		intended to fill a particular gap in care. Other programs offered on-going  		assistance aimed at meeting day-to-day needs. CSR observed seven of these  		programs and found suggestive evidence that under this type of program, client  		choice was enhanced within limits,<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> while agency control in, and accountability  		over, service delivery remained strong. Program administration, involving  		initial determination of eligibility and subsequent monitoring of care and  		allocation of subsidy, was found to limit necessary agency contact with  		clients, decreasing administrative burden. By limiting effort on the cash  		subsidy population and increasing their interaction with the private  		marketplace, publicly-supported services are conserved for others who  		cannot be served with the cash subsidy approach. Also, as noted in  		<a href="#section2.2.2">Section 2.2.2.</a>, for cash subsidies, as well as for  		vouchers and tax reductions, negligible rates of fraud were found.</p>
<p>In their examination of cash programs, Agosta and Bradley (1985) report  		similar findings and argue that cash allowances represent a  		cost-effective and flexible means for states to accommodate the unique needs of  		individual families. They note, however, that the success of cash  		programs are dependent on the availability of needed services in the private  		market, the level of cash payment, and the competency of the beneficiary.</p>
<p><b>2.3.1.2. Vouchers for Home Care</b></p>
<p>The largest and oldest voucher program for long-term care in the United  		States is Californias In-Home Supportive Services program (IHSS). Begun  		in 1958, this program made payments to over 100,000 beneficiaries in 1984 at a  		cost of $318.5 million (Clinkscale, et al 1985). Two groups of people qualify  		for this program: 1) persons who receive SSI and/or state supplementation  		(SSP); and, 2) persons with income above the SSI/SSP ceiling, but who meet IHSS  		income limits. Beneficiaries are allowed to choose from three different types  		of delivery systems: 1) individual providers who are selected by the IHSS  		recipient, and who may be a recipients relative; 2) private vendors; and,  		3) county social services agencies.</p>
<p>The Supportive Home Care (SHC) program in Wisconsin is similar  		administratively to the IHHS program in California and acts as the primary  		social service program for providing in-home services to persons who require  		assistance with activities of daily living. Seventy-seven percent of the SHC  		caseload in 1983, with total expenditures of $15.5 million, were impaired  		elderly (Clinkscale, 1985).</p>
<p>The Colorado Home Care Allowance program utilizes the SSI system in the  		distribution of allowances. Although non-SSI eligible persons are eligible for  		home care allowances, monies are disbursed in combination with State SSI  		Supplementation checks.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup>  		Currently SSI is the major Federal income maintenance program providing support  		for elderly persons with long-term care needs (Callahan, et al 1980). Monies  		from this program are intended to provide for basic living expenses only and  		not for expenditures related to long-term care needs. The SSI program provides  		an infrastructure through which a national cash disability allowance program  		could potentially be administered.</p>
<p>In their analysis of financial incentives to families for the provision  		of long-term care services, Clinkscale et al (1985) reports that payments to  		families are becoming an increasingly popular option among states. Reasons  		cited by states for their support of this policy option included the following:  		1) the ability of long-term care consumers to have input into service  		decisions; 2) the additional flexibility afforded to the long-term care  		delivery system; 3) an increase in the cost-effectiveness of public long-term  		care support; 4) an increase in the quality of care; and 5) the positive  		reinforcement of the informal support network. Although these reasons  		constitute strong arguments in support of family payments, Clinkscale et al  		(1985) points out that the major criticism of such payments is the issue of the  		substitution of public support for familial support. In order to decrease the  		likelihood of substitution effects, states have established broad guidelines to  		target program monies to specific populations. The authors note, however, that  		if programs continue to expand and targeting of services becomes more  		stringent, it will become increasingly difficult to maintain program equity.  		Many of these same issues will face efforts to implement cash allowance  		programs.</p>
<p><b>2.3.1.3 Tax Credits for Home Care</b></p>
<p>Tax subsidies in the Federal income tax system take three basic forms:  		exemptions, deductions, and credits. At present, few families can claim a  		dependent elderly family member as an exception because of the $1,000 dependent  		income cap. As of 1982, the Child and Dependent Care Credit under the Internal  		Revenue Code became applicable to expenditures for out-of-home noninstitutional  		care of disabled spouses or other dependents. The Department of Treasury  		estimates that ten percent of this credit, which cost approximately $1.3  		million dollars in 1981, went for dependent care (Select Committee on Children,  		Youth and Families, 1984, and Clinkscale, et al, 1985).</p>
<p>As of 1983, 21 states also provided reductions in state taxes for  		general dependent care for employment-related expenses of a taxpayer (CSR,  		1983). Four states--Arizona, Idaho, Iowa, and Oregon--have subsidies targeted  		specifically to elderly dependent care (Clinkscale, 1985). The form of tax  		subsidy varies among the states, utilizing one or a mix of tax credit,  		deductions and exemptions.</p>
<p><i><b>2.3.2 Food and Housing Support Programs</b></i></p>
<p>The use of vouchers to subsidize the provision of long-term care  		services is a relatively new concept in the United States; however, vouchers  		(in the form of food stamps) have been used for a number of years to provide  		food support for the needy. According to Giertz and Sullivan (1978), taxpayers  		(donors) motivations have played a major role in determining the  		voucher structure of this program. A desire by a large number of taxpayers to  		maximize the food consumption instead of the utility of the transfer recipient  		limits the role of cash subsidies in food subsidization. The unsuccessful  		effort under the Carter administration to reform this program by cashing out  		food stamps reflects the continued preference of taxpayers to limit recipient  		benefits to food consumption.</p>
<p>Housing vouchers and cash allowances were used on an experimental basis  		in the 1970s under the Experimental Housing Allowance Program (EHAP); as  		of 1982, housing vouchers continued to be provided under Section 8 (Khadduri  		and Struyk, 1982). In examining the voucher component of this program, Khadduri  		and Struyk (1982) argue that vouchers are a more efficient method of providing  		housing assistance than the more traditional housing and rent subsidies.  		Vouchers allow recipients to purchase housing in the private market, saving the  		government money with regard to construction costs. Decreased costs per  		recipient assisted allows more needy persons to be served with the same  		budgetary amount.</p>
<p>Benedick (1983) believes, however, that if the government is interested  		in maximizing the utility of the poor, unrestricted income transfers rather  		than earmarked rent vouchers would be more effective. In support of his  		conclusion, he note that low-income households receiving housing allowances  		through the EHAP in the form of unrestricted cash payments spent their  		increased resources primarily for non-housing goods--from 5.7 to 19.0 percent  		on average were spent on increased housing expenditures (Struyk and Benedick,  		1981). A similar expenditure pattern was true for persons receiving earmarked  		housing vouchers; vouchers were used to purchase pre-program levels of housing  		and monies previously used for housing were spent on non-housing goods. Voucher  		programs also have additional administrative costs, which constitute  		approximately three percent of total program costs.</p>
<h3>2.4 Cash Disability Allowances in Other Countries</h3>
<p>Attendance allowances are prevalent in western industrialized countries.  		They are found under veterans legislation, general invalidity and the work  		injury provisions of social security legislation, social assistance or welfare  		programs, and in some cases under legislation for the elderly. In 1974, 47  		countries supplied attendance allowances or constant attendance supplements  		under the invalidity provisions of programs similar to the old age, survivors,  		and disability insurance (OASDI) program of the United States (Tracy, 1974). By  		1981, attendance allowances under OASDI-type programs were found in 59  		countries; when work injury programs were included, 95 countries provided  		attendance allowance programs (United States Social Security Administration,  		1982). Almost every European nation, and most other western industrialized  		countries, have some form of cash disability allowance for long-term care.</p>
<p>Grana (1983) studied attendance allowances in detail in six countries:  		France, The Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Switzerland, The United Kingdom  		and The United States. All of these countries are concerned about expenditures  		on institutional care and have formal policies designed to slow down the rapid  		rates of increase in those expenditures. These countries are turning to  		noninstitutional long-term care services as a possible cost-effective and  		humane way of reducing expenditures for institutional care. The attendance  		allowance is considered one component of a broad strategy to encourage care in  		the home or other sheltered living environment.</p>
<p>The countries in Granas study demonstrate the wide spectrum of  		design characteristics observable in existing attendance allowance programs. In  		general, disability criteria usually entail the need for a third person to  		assist or supervise disabled persons bodily functions and activities of  		daily living. Age is usually used as a criterion to exclude very young children  		as beneficiaries as their ultimate functional capacity can not be discerned, to  		make a distinction between young and old (usually on the basis of retirement  		age), or to exclude minors for purposes of social assistance. In the case of  		the United States Veterans pension program, a combination of age and percentage  		of disability is used as the primary eligibility criterion. In no country is  		the need for constant attendance a criterion for eligibility, nor  		are attendance allowances expected to provide for constant  		attendance.</p>
<p>Generally there is no means test in war veterans, general invalidity  		(except for Switzerland), work injury or special aged programs. Means testing  		is found in social assistance or welfare programs, as well as in the United  		States Veterans pension program, which includes nonservice connected  		disablement. Allowances are usually suspended or reduced if the client enters  		an institution, particularly one operated by the government, or at which  		in-kind benefits are provided. Family status is not taken into account for  		purposes of eligibility.</p>
<p>Under many of the programs, payment levels are modified according to the  		degree of the disability; in some countries payment levels are based on the  		application of a formal assessment instrument. In social assistance programs,  		payment levels are modified by allowable taxable income relative to ceilings  		used to determine eligibility, and have the effect of sliding scales.</p>
<p>In 1980, nearly 300,000 persons received an attendance allowance in the  		United Kingdom. This results in significant expenditures for attendance  		allowances--L243 million in that year. Notable also is the case of the Italy,  		where in May, 1982, the monthly allowance was raised from Lit. 35,000 to Lit.  		250,000, bringing the Italian allowance up to the same standard as in the other  		European countries. In the countries studied by Grana, attendance allowances in  		social assistance programs represent on an average from 10 to 25 percent of  		gross average monthly earnings from production workers, and attendance  		allowances in old age, invalidity or veterans programs from 25 to 50 percent of  		gross average monthly earnings for production workers, with higher allowances  		in cases of very great disability.</p>
<p>One evaluation of the French attendance allowance program,  		Allocation Compensatrice, was performed by Lasry (1982). Although  		the evaluation does not address questions of efficiency or impact on  		institutionalization, it is useful as a critique of the design flaws which may  		befall cash disability allowances in general. Lasry found that the disability  		criterion for eligibility was too stringent, and that large numbers of  		individuals who need assistance or special equipment were denied benefits.  		Irregularities in the application of eligibility rules were found across  		regional authorities. Another problem was the use of means testing, which often  		discriminates against persons with unearned income. The amount of the allowance  		was sometimes inadequate. On the assumption that services could be obtained on  		a minimum wage, it was found that the allowance permitted the recipient to pay  		for a maximum of four hours per day; conditions could be worse for those not  		receiving the full allowance. As a result, the allowance was sometimes used  		merely as a complement to income, compromising the original intention of the  		program. The question whether institutions could fulfill the role of  		third-party was unclear, again compromising the original aim of the  		allowance to encourage social integration in a normal environment. Finally, the  		effectiveness of the assisting persons was very seldom checked, raising the  		issue of quality of care. This study does not address the quality issue.</p>
<h2><a name="cash" id="cash">3.0 CASH DISABILITY ALLOWANCES AT THE VETERANS  		ADMINISTRATION</a></h2>
<h3>3.1 The Allowance Program in the Context of VA  		Benefits</h3>
<p>The Aid and Attendance and Housebound (A&amp;A and HB) Allowance Program  		at the Veterans Administration is part of the pension program administered by  		the Department of Veterans Benefits, and must be viewed in that context. The  		pension program provides non-service connected monetary support for low-income  		veterans and their survivors. Other components of the VA long-term care system  		are administered by the Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care, in the  		Department of Medicine and Surgery. Services provided include nursing home  		care, domiciliary care in VA facilities, hospital-based home care, and personal  		care and supervision in residential care homes. All veterans age 65 years and  		older, veterans with service-related conditions, and indigent veterans also are  		eligible to receive free medical care at VA facilities.</p>
<p><b><i>3.1.1 Pension</i></b><sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In FY 1985, approximately 3.84 billion dollars were disbursed to nearly  		1.4 million veterans and surviving spouses under the pension program. Before  		World War I, pensions for service in the armed services were provided only as  		compensation for service-connected disabilities and injuries. Disabilities  		incurred in periods other than other periods of active duty did not qualify for  		pensions. After World War I, however, qualified veterans with non-service  		connected disabilities became eligible to receive pensions. In December 1985,  		687,276 veterans were receiving non-service connected pensions. There were  		665,963 additional persons (surviving spouses and children) receiving death  		pensions. </p>
<p>Today four pension programs cover veterans from different wartime  		periods. One program covers veterans of the Spanish-American War (1898 to  		1902). This program provides a fixed payment to veterans (or their surviving  		dependents) who received other than a dishonorable discharge from service which  		lasted a minimum of 70 days (90 days of service by the veteran are required for  		surviving dependents to be eligible under this program). This is strictly a  		service-based pension and no disability is required for eligibility. </p>
<p>The first disability pension program covering nonservice-connected  		disabled veterans (and their surviving dependents), enacted in 1946, is  		referred to as the "Old Law." This law provides a disability pension of a fixed  		amount to veterans who received other than a dishonorable discharge, served at  		least 90 days in active duty, and have a total and permanent disability. Total  		disability is a function of the actual disability percentage assessed under the  		Rating Schedule, evaluated in light of the veteran's age and the effect of the  		actual disability on his/her ability to perform substantial gainful employment.  		Persons age 65 years or older are presumed to meet the disability requirement.  		There is also an income limit under the Old Law above which a veteran or  		his/her family cannot receive a pension. Income received under another Federal  		pension may be partially disregarded. Upon a veteran's death, surviving  		dependents can continue to receive a pension, and do not have to meet the  		disability requirement. </p>
<p>The Section 306 Pension Law modified the Old Law in 1960. The same  		service and disability requirements in the Old Law were retained, but the  		pension amount was placed on a graduated scale where personal income reduced  		the veteran's pension. New provisions were also made to take into account the  		size of the veteran's estate in calculating eligibility and level of pension.  		Veterans could elect to receive benefits under the Section 306 Law if they had  		already qualified for a pension under one of the earlier laws and felt that it  		would be to their advantage to do so. </p>
<p>In January 1979, the pension program at the Veterans Administration was  		revised a third time, creating the "Improved Pension" program (Public Law  		95-588). The major intent of this revision was to eliminate inequities in the  		prior programs which excluded some or all of the income which certain  		beneficiaries received. As a result, outside income that would be disregarded  		in calculating the pension was further restricted. All family household income  		became counted as personal income on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and all  		countable income reduced a veteran's pension dollar-for-dollar. As with the  		three other pension programs, the spouse and eligible dependents became  		eligible to receive benefits after the death of the veteran. Beneficiaries  		receiving pensions under prior laws were allowed to elect payments under the  		new program or to continue receiving benefits under prior programs. </p>
<p>Under all four pension programs, veterans and surviving spouses who  		qualify as housebound or requiring aid and attendance (see  		<a href="#section3.2.1">Section 3.2.1</a>) may be eligible to receive an  		allowance to assist them in coping with their disabilities. In 1984,  		expenditures for the pension aid and attendance program were over $452 million  		(see <a href="#table3-1">Table 3-1</a>). Veterans receiving a basic pension  		under prior pension laws are required to elect the Improved Pension program if  		they wish to begin receiving an aid and attendance or housebound allowance.  		However, those already receiving either allowance under the previous programs  		could continue to do so. The Housebound Aid and Attendance program is the  		mechanism the VA uses to assist veterans in obtaining social support services  		which it is not authorized to provide (U.S. Congress, 1985).</p>

</tr></table><p>As mentioned above, the non-service connected pension and the A&amp;A  		and HB programs are means-tested; veterans and/or their dependents who are  		otherwise eligible to receive a pension must also meet certain income criteria.  		The amount of the allowance (HB or AA) is added to the total pension amount  		that a beneficiary is eligible to receive. If countable income falls below a  		specified income ceiling (varying according to disability, dependency, and war  		service status), the VA will issue a monthly check<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> to the new beneficiary for the amount of the  		difference between countable income and the ceiling. If beneficiaries qualify  		for the aid and attendance or housebound allowance, their income ceiling is  		raised. Persons eligible for the aid and attendance or housebound allowance  		whose countable income previously exceeded allowable limits, may now qualify to  		receive a pension check from the VA under the higher income ceiling. An  		individual already being issued a check will receive a pension increase equal  		to the amount added to the income ceiling by the aid and attendance or  		housebound allowance.</p>
<p><i><b>3.1.2 Long-Term Care</b></i><sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care oversees a wide range of  		extended care programs, including nursing home care, domiciliary care,  		residential care, hospital-based home care, adult day health care, outpatient  		care, and hospice programs. </p>
<p>The nursing home program is comprised of three different components:  		VA-owned nursing homes, community (contract) nursing homes, and state-run  		nursing homes. VA-owned nursing homes are equipped with sufficient personnel  		and other resources to handle heavy care patients. Patient needs at these  		homes, which care for 9,000 persons per day, range from the intermediate care  		level to a "super" skilled nursing level. In addition to its own homes, the VA  		contracts out to approximately 3,000 private nursing homes to provide care for  		10,800 veterans daily. These community homes generally provide varying levels  		of patient care needs ranging from intermediate care to a high level of skilled  		nursing care. The remainder of VA nursing home care is provided by state-run  		facilities. With regard to these state-run homes, the VA has two grant  		programs; a per diem program through which the VA assists states in providing  		care to eligible veterans, and a construction program through which the VA  		provides up to 65 percent Federal funding for the building of new nursing home  		care facilities and the renovation of existing facilities. Nursing home care in  		these state institutions is available only to veterans and their spouses.  		Approximately 7,000 VA beneficiaries are cared for daily in state institutions.  		</p>
<p> For veterans who require care but not at the level given by a nursing  		home, the VA operates a domiciliary care program. The VA provides care to 8,000  		veterans daily at their 16 domiciliary homes. Eligibility for placement in  		these homes is partially based on income. The VA provides domiciliary care to  		an additional 5,000 veterans through state-run domiciliary homes. These  		state-run facilities are funded by the same mechanism as the state-run nursing  		homes. Veterans who live in either the VA-run or state-run domiciliary homes do  		not receive help with activities of daily living. A minimal medical care plan  		is currently being implemented. </p>
<p>The largest extended care program is the residential care program.  		Minimal personal care is provided to veterans in privately-run, community  		facilities. There is a daily census of 12,000 persons in 3,124 homes, with a  		preferred size of six persons or less per home. The VA system, through  		hospitals and social workers, acts as brokers for veterans with regard to these  		residential care facilities, commonly known as board and care homes. VA staff  		visit each of the participating homes once a week in order to review the  		quality of care. Veterans who live in these board and care homes pay an average  		of $440 per month in rent. Residents stay an average of over five years,  		receiving medical care in nearby VA hospitals. A number of board and care  		veterans have a service-connected disability rating beyond 50 percent and they  		are eligible to receive $800-1200 per month tax-free, a sufficient income to  		pay for their own board and care. </p>
<p>The hospital-based home care program, which is regulated by the Joint  		Committee for Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH), is seen as an alternative to  		nursing homes. There are 49 home care programs operating nationwide, with a  		daily census of 50 patients per program. A primary care team of health  		professionals is assigned to each patient. The teams, headed by a physician and  		staffed by a public health nurse, LPN, LVN, social worker, rehabilitation  		specialist, and dietician, develop individualized treatment plans for all  		patients. On average a patient is seen 3 times a week by a nurse. Each patient  		receives a 60-day review in order to evaluate his or her progress and update  		the treatment plan. </p>
<p>The hospital-based home health care program serves persons who ten to  		suffer from chronic diseases such as pulmonary illnesses and cancer. The  		majority of patients suffer from general medical problems; few post-acute  		surgical cases are served by in this program. Of the over 6,500 patients  		treated in FY 1982, approximately 22 percent were terminally ill cancer  		patients (Annual Report of the Administrator, 1982). In order to be eligible  		for VA hospital-based home health care, a veteran must be referred from a  		hospital and in general must require the services of at least three of the  		members of a home care team. Also, a veteran cannot have any dependents. </p>
<p>The VA is presently developing an adult day health care program, based  		on a medical model. The program will provide clinical day services to  		post-hospital patients whose families can provide night-time care. This program  		is targeted towards a population less disabled than that served by the  		hospital-based home care program. </p>
<p><i><b><a name="section3.1.3" id="section3.1.3">3.1.3 Health Care Services</a></b></i></p>
<p>The Veterans Administration provides a wide range of health care  		services, including hospitalization, outpatient medical care, outpatient dental  		treatment, and psychiatric care, to eligible veterans. Veterans who are 65  		years of age or older, veterans who have service-related health problems, and  		indigent veterans can receive free care at VA medical facilities (Tames, 1985).  		</p>
<p>In 1982, over 1.3 million persons received in-patient hospital care;  		total VA expenditures for hospital care in that year were 4.38 billion dollars  		(CBO, 1984). VA hospitals have increased by 30 percent the number of patients  		served over the last decade. Recent estimates indicate that 1.4 million  		inpatient cases as well as 19 million outpatient medical and dental visits were  		expected to be handled by the VA in 1985 (Tames, 1985). The number of veterans  		eligible for free care is expected to increase by 200 percent from 1980 to the  		year 2000, due to the general aging of the U.S. population. Veterans receiving  		aid and attendance or housebound allowances under the nonservice-connected  		pension program are eligible to receive two major types of services:  		hospitalization and outpatient medical care. In order to be eligible for  		hospitalization, the need for such care must be verified by appropriate medical  		personnel and beds must be available. Veterans with service-incurred or  		service-aggravated disabilities have greater priority than A&amp;A and HB  		beneficiaries with regard to hospital admission. </p>
<p>Outpatient care is generally limited to veterans with service-connected  		injuries and/or disabilities. However, A&amp;A and HB veterans are eligible for  		outpatient services, which include medical examinations and related medical  		services such as rehabilitation, professional counseling, consultation and  		training, and mental health services. Veteran A&amp;A and HB beneficiaries are  		also eligible for free prescription drugs from VA hospitals. Surviving  		dependents are, in general, ineligible to receive either medical care or free  		prescription drugs. </p>
<h3>3.2 Administrative Details of the Allowance  		Programs</h3>
<p><i><b><a name="section3.2.1" id="section3.2.1">3.2.1 Application Process</a></b></i></p>
<p>Applying for aid and attendance or housebound benefits is a complicated  		and often confusing process. Processing delays of applications caused by the  		submission of incomplete information to the VA are not uncommon.  		Applicants difficulties in dealing with this long process are exacerbated  		by their fragile health status and immobility. To streamline the application  		process, the VA created a program application checklist for Veterans Services  		Division (VSD) employees, who assist persons in this process (see  		<a href="#append1">Appendix 1</a>). Applicants may obtain assistance either at  		regional VA offices or by telephone (using a toll-free number). VSD employees  		also provide outreach to veterans and dependents who may be unaware of their  		eligibility for aid and attendance or housebound benefits. In addition,  		applicants may obtain assistance in filing claims from local veterans services  		organizations, such as the Disabled American Veterans and the Veterans of  		Foreign Wars.</p>
<p>Step 1: To apply for aid and attendance or housebound benefits,  		applicants not already receiving a VA disability pension must complete the  		Veterans Application for Compensation or Pension--VA form  		21-526 (See <a href="#append2">Appendix 2</a>). (Surviving spouses use VA Form  		21-534, Application for Dependency and </p>
<p>[Page 3-13 missing from original; they will be added at a  		later date]</p>
<p>examine a veteran who is unable to afford the cost of a physical  		examination, completing a standard form for submission. Use of the standardized  		form is not permitted outside of VA institutions so as to prevent non-VA  		doctors from anticipating those conditions and severity of conditions necessary  		to qualify as disabled under the program.</p>
<p>Step 3: Claims are filed at the regional office serving the area in  		which the claimant resides. Applications for an allowance are received by a  		ratings team from the VA. The ratings team is comprised of three members: a VA  		physician, a VA lawyer, and a VA occupational specialist. The occupational  		specialist compares the stated disability with the activities required for the  		kind of work the veteran did before the disability occurred.</p>
<p>To qualify for a basic disability pension, a veteran less than 55 years  		old must be 60 percent or more disabled as determined by the ratings team.  		After 55 years of age, a beneficiary can claim for eligibility purposes an  		increased level of disability for each year beyond age 55. At 65 years, the  		veteran is presumed to be 100 percent disabled; that is, the normal retirement  		age is equated with inability to work. Title 38 of the U.S. Code states that  		the specific disability criteria should be determined by the Veterans  		Administration.</p>
<p>Basic eligibility guidelines used by the VA for the Housebound Allowance  		are that the veteran or eligible surviving dependent must be  		substantially confined, due to severe mental or physical  		disability, and this condition must be reasonably likely to  		continue. For the aid and attendance allowance the veteran or eligible  		surviving dependent must require regular aid and attendance of another person  		to cope with hazards of daily living, to perform basic self-care, or to perform  		medical procedures recommended by physicians.</p>
<p>A veterans stated disabilities are compared with a ratings  		schedule by the ratings team. A housebound allowance is awarded if the ratings  		team judges that the applicant is confined to the premises and can get around  		only with the aid of someone else. The aid and attendance allowance is awarded  		to veterans and eligible surviving dependents who have more severe disabilities  		and need a second party for help in activities of daily living. Persons are  		rated as eligible for an allowance for life and do not need to reverify their  		disability status at any future time. There is no review procedure currently in  		place to account for persons who experience an improvement in health status.  		</p>
<p>If the claimant is in a VA nursing home, a State veterans home or  		a licensed nursing home, the entitlement is automatic. For non-VA facilities  		the homes administrator need only certify the admission and that the  		claimant regularly requires skilled or intermediate level nursing care (as  		defined under Title 42, United States Code). In all other cases medical  		evidence must establish the claimants inability to perform basic  		self-care, including daily activities like bathing, dressing or eating. The  		incapacity may arise from mental or physical disabilities, including conditions  		typically associated with advanced age.</p>
<p><i><b>3.2.2 Competency Procedure</b></i></p>
<p>The Veterans Administration generally assumes that pension beneficiaries  		are mentally competent, unless otherwise informed. Competency becomes an issue  		generally in one of four ways: (1) an interested party such as a family member  		or a neighbor informs the VA of the beneficiarys problem; (2) the  		beneficiary is adjudged incompetent, or otherwise placed under a legal  		disability by court action; (3) a veteran is evaluated by a doctor at a VA  		medical facility while receiving treatment; and, (4) a beneficiary voluntarily  		seeks help from the VA. This last situation occurs much less frequently than  		the other three.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the events that occur when competency is  		an issue:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>When evidence is received that a court of competent jurisdiction has  			 adjudicated a VA beneficiary to be incompetent or otherwise placed the person  			 under a legal disability and has appointed a fiduciary to administer the  			 beneficiarys estate, the VA will perform an independent investigation to  			 determine whether the beneficiary is, in fact, incapable of administering VA  			 benefits. Based on this investigation, the VA will determine whether to  			 recognize and pay the VA benefits to the court-appointed fiduciary or recognize  			 and appoint some other type of fiduciary, or continue payments direct to the  			 beneficiary, whichever is in the best interest of the beneficiary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also independent of the court action is the VA rating process when  			 competency is an issue. If evidence is received indicating that a VA  			 beneficiary may be incompetent, the VA rating board, which is composed of a  			 medical doctor, a lawyer, and an occupational expert may request a field  			 examination to gather the facts relating to competency, and request specific  			 medical evidence having a bearing on the issue. More often than not, the rating  			 is based on a sufficiency of medical evidence alone. If, after evaluating all  			 the evidence, the board believes that the beneficiary is incompetent, a  			 notification of their intent to declare him or her incompetent is sent to the  			 beneficiary. As a result of due process requirements, the beneficiary has 30  			 days in which to challenge this ruling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 60 days, the boards ruling of incompetency becomes  			 finalized if it is not challenged by the beneficiary. If the beneficiary  			 challenges the ruling, any new evidence is reviewed by the board before any  			 ruling becomes finalized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a beneficiary is declared incompetent by the VA, another  			 investigation is performed, this time to determine the payee best suited to the  			 needs of the beneficiary. The VA may seek appointment of a fiduciary by the  			 court if the estate or other issues warrant such protection, or the VA may  			 select a person as a federally appointed fudiciary. If the beneficiary is  			 institutionalized, the VA may make arrangements to pay for care and maintenance  			 and otherwise provide for the beneficiarys needs by making an award  			 directly to the institution. The beneficiary may also be paid directly while  			 under the supervision of the VA rather than a third party fiduciary. The last  			 method of payment is called supervised direct payment (SDP). Fees for providing  			 fiduciary services are generally paid only to court-appointed fiduciaries in  			 accordance with the State statutes governing the court of appointment, and come  			 out of the beneficiarys estate. Under certain limited conditions some  			 Federal fiduciaries may be authorized by the VA to take a fee of up to four  			 percent of VA benefits received during any one year from the estate for  			 services rendered. These fiduciaries generally would be professional persons  			 such as attorneys or professional fiduciaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VA maintains a program of regular evaluation to determine  			 whether the beneficiary continues to remain incompetent and whether or not the  			 fiduciary is performing according to State and/or Federal requirements. The VA  			 will perform field visits, or field examinations as they are called, on each  			 case every one to four years, depending on the circumstances of each case.  			 Those beneficiaries being paid under SDP are visited no less frequently than  			 annually because there is no third party handling the money and because this  			 method of payment is sometimes used to give the beneficiary the opportunity to  			 demonstrate competency. If, after any visit to any incompetent or legally  			 disabled VA beneficiary, it is determined that the beneficiary appears to be  			 competent to handle his or her funds, then appropriate recommendations are made  			 to the VA rating board and/or State court to reevaluate the rating or court  			 judgement. Upon removal of the VA rating of incompetency, the beneficiary may  			 be paid directly without supervision. Upon removal of the legal disability, and  			 assuming no VA rating of incompetency, the beneficiary may be paid directly. If  			 the VA rating of incompetency remains, then the VA must continue some form of  			 supervision. If only the legal disability remains, then the VA must decide  			 whether or not it is in the beneficiarys interest to be paid directly or  			 to continue supervision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to personal visits with the incompetent beneficiary and  			 the fiduciary, the VA monitors many cases through audits of accountings.  			 Accountings may be required of Federal fiduciaries depending on the amount of  			 VA income and/or the size of the VA estate or because of issues uncovered  			 during the field examinations. Court-appointed fiduciaries are generally  			 required to account in accordance with State statutes, and the VA being an  			 interested party will audit those accountings. Under some State statutes, the  			 fiduciary may be required to account to the VA for only VA income and estate,  			 while under other statutes the VA audits the administration of the entire  			 estate.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>In FY 1982, approximately 125,000 (3 percent) of compensation and  		pension beneficiaries were under supervision because of their competency  		status. Approximately 60 percent of the beneficiaries rated incompetent were  		veterans, 32 percent were other adult beneficiaries, and 8 percent were  		minors.</p>
<p><i><b>3.2.3 Reverification of Pension Entitlement</b></i></p>
<p>Once entitlement to pension is established, a claimant is responsible  		for notifying the VA of any change in income, net worth status or dependency  		status. The VA reviews each claim annually to reconfirm entitlement. In  		addition, the VA performs regular checks with other Federal agencies to verify  		the amount of payments they issue under several programs. These programs  		currently include Social Security, civil service annuity, Black Lung benefits  		(paid by either the Department of Labor or the Social Security Administration),  		and Railroad Retirement Board benefits.</p>
<p>Individual claims reviews are spread throughout the year. Each claimant  		is required to file an Eligibility Verification Report (EVR) on a reporting  		anniversary date. The EVR requests information about income, net worth, and  		dependents. These reviews frequently uncover status changes which claimants  		have not reported. Depending on the nature of a change and when it occurred, a  		retroactive benefit adjustment may result. Such adjustments frequently result  		in money owed to the VA to repay pension to which a claimant had no  		entitlement.</p>
<p><i><b>3.2.4 Determination of Pension Amount</b></i></p>
<p>The actual amount of pension received varies according to the  		beneficiarys specific pension program. Within each program, a number of  		additional factors are taken into consideration including disability rating,  		income and assets level, number of dependents, and veteran or surviving  		spouse/child status.</p>
<p>Under the Improved Pension Program, the VA subtracts countable household  		income from the maximum pension amount (which varies according to factors  		mentioned above) and yields the amount of pension the beneficiary is eligible  		to receive. The calculated amount is usually divided by 12 and sent to the  		beneficiary in monthly amounts.</p>
<p>Currently the Improved Pension maximum payments, which effectively set  		income limits, are:</p>

</tr></table><p>The VA excludes income from certain sources in determining countable  		income--the most commonly excluded income source is welfare payments from  		public or private sources. In addition to income exclusions, the law permits  		the deduction of certain types of expenses from countable income amounts. The  		most frequently occurring expense deductions are for medical, burial, and  		educational expenses. Medical expenses eligible for deduction include health  		insurance premiums, doctors and nurses charges, therapy charges,  		medicine charges, and payments for special equipment (prescribed by a doctor or  		required as a result of a disability). A beneficiarys out-of-pocket  		medical expenses must exceed 5 percent of the maximum pension set by law in  		order to deduct.</p>
<p>If a claimant is entitled under the income test, a separate net worth  		test is applied. In evaluating net worth the VA will exclude personal property  		and the value of a claimants residence. All other assets are considered.  		Non-liquid assets are considered at the value of cash to be realized from  		normal disposition. All liabilities are used to offset assets. The remaining  		value of assets is net worth.</p>
<p>If, based on the claimants age and considering recurring living  		expenditures, the value of net worth is such that it is reasonable to expect  		some part of it be used for maintenance (of the claimant and nay dependents),  		the claim will be denied. In assessing expenditures, allowance is made for  		funds necessary to educate any dependent children. Other expected expenses,  		such as housing adaptation for a disabled person, may be considered in specific  		claims.</p>
<p>For persons covered under the Section 306 pension program,  		beneficiaries pension amounts are dependent on where their countable  		income falls on a set graduated scale, on whether they receive A&amp;A or HB,  		and on whether they are age 78 or older (see <a href="#append4">Appendix  		4</a>). For example, a 79 year old single, housebound veteran who received $500  		per month of countable income is entitled to $315 per month: $191 is basic  		pension, $47.75 for being age 78 years or older, and $76.25 for being  		housebound and over 78 years of age (based on annual rates effective December  		1, 1984).</p>
<p>Veterans or surviving spouses under the Section 306 law have a slightly  		higher income ceiling than beneficiaries under the Improved Pension law ($6,493  		in 1985). For beneficiaries under the Old Law, pension limits fall in between  		those for the Improved Pension and those for the Section 306 Pension Law.  		However, the Old Law differs in that a set pension amount--$78.75 in 1985--is  		disbursed to all persons who fall under the income limit. Another advantage of  		the Old Law is that other Federal pensions are partially excludable when  		calculating countable income.</p>
<p>As for the Spanish-American War pension program, there is no income  		limit. A set pension is disbursed to qualified beneficiaries--$101.59 per month  		for a veteran with no dependents who served for 90 days or more.</p>
<p>Surviving spouses of veterans are not eligible to receive a housebound  		allowance under the Improved Pension law. They can qualify under all four  		pension programs for an aid and attendance allowance if they meet both the  		requirements for a basic disability pension for surviving spouses and those for  		the allowance. Surviving spouses, unlike veterans, do not receive special  		medical provisions or free prescription drugs. Children who became physically  		or mentally incapable prior to age 18 must meet the same requirements as  		spouses and are eligible for the same benefits.</p>
<p>If a pensioner is hospitalized, the total benefit amount may be changed.  		If the veteran receives only the basic pension and has dependents, no changes  		will be made. If a veteran is receiving an aid and attendance allowance and has  		dependents, the allowance portion of the pension reverts to the housebound  		allowance after one month in the hospital. If there are no dependents, however,  		then the allowance reverts to an amount of $60 per month after three months of  		hospitalization. These conditions also apply in cases where veterans are  		temporarily institutionalized in nursing homes (either Veterans Administration  		nursing homes or in nursing homes where the Veterans Administration is paying  		for the stay). For nursing home stays longer than three months, a  		veterans eligibility for a pension or allowance is revoked if he is  		living in a nursing home run or paid for by the VA. If a veteran is paying for  		his own nursing home care out-of-pocket, then there is no reduction in the  		Housebound or Aid and Attendance Allowance.</p>
<p><i><b>3.2.5 Claimants Rights -- Due Process of Law</b></i></p>
<p>The VA recognizes by regulation each claimants due  		process rights. Under regulation the VA affords each claimant an  		opportunity for a hearing with VA personnel prior to deciding any aspect of a  		claim. This opportunity exists for both original and supplemental claims filed.  		Claimants also may request hearings after decisions are made when they desire  		reconsideration or want to present new and material evidence.</p>
<p>As a matter of policy, the VA does not make any unfavorable adjustment  		based on third party information without first notifying the claimant about the  		proposed adjustment. This allows the claimant the opportunity to rebut the  		information before a final decision. Rebuttal may be in writing or in person.  		In the latter case, a hearing may be requested; less formal presentations may  		also be used.</p>
<p>A claimant for VA benefits may appoint a power of attorney as a  		representative in all aspects of a claim. Most often the claimant will select  		one of the veterans service organizations. A private attorney or a VA  		recognized agent may be selected. Service organizations do not  		charge fees to represent claimants. Attorneys and agents may charge fees, not  		to exceed $10.00 for any one claim. Severe penalties may be imposed when fee  		violations occur.</p>
<p>Any claimant dissatisfied with a claim decision may formally appeal it.  		The appeal must be made within a year following notice of the decision. Appeals  		are reviewed by the Board of Veterans Appeal (BVA) located in Washington, D.C.  		The BVA has jurisdiction to consider all aspects of the claim and may issue a  		decision differing wholly, or in part, from the decision made at the regional  		office. The BVA decision is binding and final.</p>
<p>Judicial review of claims decisions, i.e., by the courts, is not  		permitted under current law. For several years the Congress has introduced  		legislation to permit such review; however, no legislation has been  		enacted.</p>
<h3>3.3 The Future of the Aid and Attendance Allowance  		Program</h3>
<p>Since the A&amp;A and HB program is an integral part of the VA pension  		program, it is affected significantly by any changes or cutbacks in the basic  		pension rules and regulations. With each revision of the VAs non-service  		connected pension program, income eligibility criteria have become increasingly  		stringent. The pension program began with no income limits (SAW program). Next,  		under the Old Law, an income ceiling was established. Section 306  		set up a system whereby pension amounts were determined by a graduated income  		scale. The Improved Pension Law allows a smaller amount of outside  		income and assets to be disregarded when calculating pension amounts.</p>
<p>Over the last five years, veterans benefits have come under increasing  		budgetary attack. The current administration has proposed cuts in veterans  		benefits a number of times--each effort has been strongly opposed by veteran  		lobby groups and congressional supporters. In fiscal year 1985, the U.S.  		Department of Treasury proposed buy later dropped the idea of taxing  		compensation and pension monies. Under the current deficit-reduction mandates  		of the Gramm-Rudman Act, the compensation and pension programs are considered  		protected programs and will not be subject to mandatory budget cuts. </p>
<p>In future years, the pension program is likely to face increasing  		budgetary pressure. This will arise not only from Federal budget constraints  		but from a substantial rise in the number of aged veterans who are eligible to  		receive non-service connected pensions (subject to income and service  		constraints).</p>
<p>The VA, however, believes that the effects of two trends will help to  		counteract some of this budgetary pressure. First, a trend analysis performed  		by the VA, shows that many eligible claimants, both veterans and survivors,  		will not meet the means test provisions, and therefore, will not be entitled to  		receive pension payments. </p>
<p>Coupled with this trend is another showing that actual losses from the  		protected pension rolls, generally attributed to the higher death rate among  		the oldest claimants, exceed accessions in the current program and will for  		some time. When considered with the better financial status of new claimants,  		the VA believes that short-term problems will be counterbalanced. Long-term  		problems in funding will be counterbalanced by slow growth in entitled  		claimants and this generally should support maintenance of current programs  		(even considering inflation and resulting effects on the CPI).</p>
<h2><a name="research" id="research">4.0 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY</a></h2>
<h3>4.1 Research Questions</h3>
<p>This study was designed to examine:</p>
<ol><li>the relationship between different forms of subsidy for in-home care  		  (cash disability allowances and in-kind provision of care) and an  		  individuals functional and health status, use of medical and  		  institutional care, use of informal support systems, and net social costs;  		  and</li>
<li>the administration and management of an existing cash disability  		  allowance program.</li>
</ol><p>The Veterans Administration Housebound and Aid and Attendance Allowance  		program is described in detail in <a href="#cash">Section 3.0</a>. The impact  		of subsidy type on recipients well-being and use of services is analyzed  		by comparing data collected in a survey of recipients of the VA AA/HB program  		with data from the national Long Term Care (LTC) survey of noninstitutionalized  		elderly conducted in 1982 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  		The comparisons have been designed to address the following major research  		questions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Do the VA and comparison groups differ along socioeconomic  			 dimensions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the VA A&amp;A and HB recipients more frail or more functionally  			 impaired, or do they have higher rates of chronic and acute medical conditions  			 than the comparison groups?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> How much in-home help (ADL and IADL) is received by the VA  			 recipients and the comparison groups?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> How much help is purchased, provided by family and friends, or  			 provided by formal helping organizations?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Do the VA and comparison groups differ in their consumption of  			 nursing home care, hospital care, physician services, and prescription  			 drugs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do the two groups differ in self-report measures of  			 life-satisfaction? Happiness? Satisfaction with living environment?</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>4.2 Methodology</h3>
<p><i><b><a name="section4.2.1" id="section4.2.1">4.2.1 Sampling</a></b></i></p>
<p>The VA HB/AA program is the only large, nation-wide program of cash  		grants for disabled persons available for study in the U.S. (others exist  		abroad, but they that may have less relevance to U.S. policy). Thus, recipients  		of the program were chosen as the study population despite the fact that  		differences may exist between beneficiaries of this program and a potential  		target population, all disabled elderly (including non-veterans). A comparison  		group was selected from the long-term care survey population which resembled as  		much as possible the VA A&amp;A and HB population in initial impairment and  		sociodemographic characteristics, but which received in-kind benefits directly  		in the form of home nursing, homemaker or home health aid services, 21.6% in  		Los Angeles, 21.6% in Minneapolis-St. Paul, and 19.4% in Philadelphia. As  		mentioned earlier, however, response rates could not be improved due to the  		data sharing between Project HOPE and the VA.</p>

</tr></table><p>Of those persons who responded, 80.5% (n=372) indicated a willingness to  		participate in the survey. However, 29.3% of those who wished to participate  		indicated on the screen that they were nursing home resident and thus were not  		eligible for the study. In Minneapolis-St. Paul a disproportionate number of  		persons wishing to participate in the study were ineligible because they were  		institutionalized. An additional 24 persons could not be interviewed because of  		a variety of reasons including death of respondent, inability of interviewee to  		contact respondent in order to arrange an interview, and refusal by respondent  		to be interviewed. A total of 222 persons were interviewed--83 (37%) of the  		interviews could not be included in the main study analysis group because they  		were not 65 years of age or older or found to be ineligible for other reasons.  		Although the original study design had included only those persons 65 years and  		older, the age variable was improperly specified in the computer program which  		created the mailing list of 2000 VA beneficiaries. A description of this 64 and  		under group will be included in the results section of this report; this  		population will not be included in multivariate analyses due to the lack of a  		comparison group.</p>
<p>The LTC survey employed county based clusters stratified by  		characteristics such as geographic region, level of urbanization, percentage of  		non-white population, and per capita retail sales. Medicare recipients as of  		December 31, 1981 (updated with a 10% sample over the following three months)  		were stratified by age group, and a sample of 55,000 was drawn from 173 LTC  		Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). This was systematically reduced to 36,000 for  		the initial screening. From this group, about 6400 persons were chosen which  		fit the eligibility criteria for the survey (e.g., level of impairment,  		not-institutionalized etc.), and almost 6,100 people were interviewed. About  		5,000 LTC respondents received help from one or more caregivers, and 1,380  		received help from a source other than hired help or family and friends. This  		latter group comprises the comparison group for this study. Persons in this  		group are distinguished by their receipt of assistance in the form of services  		in-kind (in contrast to cash or a voucher). Persons in this group  		may be required to pay something for the care they receive, but the care is  		essentially subsidized. They may also receive services from family and friends,  		or from people they hire, but they are chosen for comparison because they  		receive an in-kind subsidy (see <a href="#section5.2.1">Section 5.2.1</a>). For  		comparability with the VA sample, those persons living in rural areas are not  		included; this results in a comparison sample of 610 persons.</p>
<p><i><b>4.2.2 Survey Development, Validation, and  		Implementation</b></i></p>
<p>The Long-Term Care Survey was designed to provide national data on  		noninstitutionalized persons age 65 or older who are chronically impaired. Data  		from the survey include: the number and type of physical limitations affecting  		aged persons, the kind and amount of help received by impaired individuals, the  		use and costs of health care services, the amount that impaired persons and  		their families pay for care, and the number and characteristics of impaired  		individuals not receiving care.</p>
<p>The beneficiary survey for the VA study instrument was developed using  		selected questions from the Long-Term Care survey. These questions were  		well-tested for validity and reliability. This approach maximized the  		comparability between the study and control groups, and reduced the cost of the  		study by obviating the development of new survey instruments for the study.  		Additional questions pertaining specifically to the VA program were included in  		the VA survey, however.</p>
<p>The beneficiary survey was designed to take no longer than one hour.  		After being pre-tested on 20 beneficiaries in the Washington, D.C. area  		(identified and contacted using the criteria and random selection process  		described previously), the instrument was revised to clarify instructions.  		Seven experienced interviewers employed by the National Opinion Research  		Corporation (NORC) were trained to use the instrument during a one-day training  		session in June, 1985. Over a three month period interviewers conducted the  		surveys. Copies of the survey and instruction forms are included in  		<a href="#append6">Appendix 6</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>4.2.3 Analysis Plan</b></i></p>
<p>Since the VA and comparison groups were selected from the entire U.S.  		population using two different sets of criteria, the first task of analysis is  		to assess if and to what extent the groups differ with respect to personal  		characteristics which might affect the use of health care or help at home with  		ADL and IADL needs. These important differences are identified by the  		calculation of means and frequency distributions for each group, which are  		compared using student t and chi-square statistics. Differences between the  		groups identified in this phase of the analysis are controlled for in latter  		analyses with multivariate statistical methods, especially regression  		analysis.</p>
<p>Since the sample of persons receiving a cash allowance is relatively  		small (n=139), the analysis must be limited to a small, select set of  		explanatory variables, which explain as much of the variance in the explained  		variables as possible. A small set of sociodemographic characteristics were  		included in the analyses: age, sex, race, marital status, household status,  		education level, type of area, Medicaid eligibility, and family income. The  		age, sex, and race parameters were included because of their influence on  		health status, and access to informal care. Limitations in activities of daily  		living have been shown to increase with age (Cornoni-Huntley, 1985); care  		receiver age may also be positively correlated with the age, and thus the  		caregiving capacity, of the primary caregiver. For both reasons, age might be  		expected to be positively related to the need for more care in general, and  		perhaps formal assistance in particular. Additional parameters which appear to  		affect the level of formal care are marital status and household status. Soldo  		and Manton (1985) found that for disabled community-based persons aged 65 and  		over, those living with a spouse or other relative received significantly less  		formal services than those who lived alone or with nonrelatives, for all types  		of need.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup> To conserve  		degrees of freedom, a summary variable, NOAVAIL, was created to capture the  		influence on care received when no informal caregiver was available. Neither  		survey provided physical or time distance between care receivers and potential  		caregivers. As a proxy measure for this phenomenon, a person was said to have  		no available informal caregiver if that person both lived alone and received no  		care from family and friends.</p>
<p>Family income, Medicaid eligibility, and type of area are factors which  		affect access to both the acute and long-term care systems. Persons in families  		with higher incomes have greater private resources which permit them to better  		access private systems, but which may serve as a barrier to access to public  		help. Medicaid eligibles generally receive more public help, primarily in the  		form of in-kind services. Areas with higher population densities tend to have  		higher input (e.g., labor) costs and higher prices for services, which may  		reduce individual demand for purchased care and enhance demand for  		publicly-funded care. The dichotomous variable AREA was used to distinguish  		between persons living in cities from those in suburbs and towns.</p>
<p>Despite problems inherent in the definition of what persons constitute  		the family unit for purpose of analysis, it was decided that a family income  		variable needed to be used. Family income, not solely personal income, is used  		by the VA in its calculation of countable income to set the level of a  		beneficiarys pension amount. Also for the comparison (LTC Survey)  		population, categorical information on income was collected only on a family  		basis. Income was then split into three categories based on the income  		distribution: high-income (HINC), $12,000 and over; middle-income (MINC),  		$6,000 to $11,999; and low-income (LINC), $5,999 and under. Limited available  		information on assets, specifically home values and automobile ownership, was  		examined but not included in the analyses.</p>
<p>Health status, limitations in activities of daily living, and  		instrumental activities of daily living are important factors which affect  		utilization of health care and long-term care (Soldo and Manton, 1985). A  		health status variable (DXTOT) was created which summed responses indicating  		the absence or presence of 27 selected medical conditions.<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup> Time, resource and degrees of  		freedom limitations prevented a more careful classification of persons with  		different subsets of chronic and other medical conditions (Manton and Woodbury,  		1984; Soldo and Manton, 1985). Relative weights to account for differences in  		severity among these conditions, (e.g., type of cancer, type of paralysis),  		were not available. The summing of these medical conditions is intended only as  		a crude estimate of health status.</p>
<p>Two additional variables were created which summed the number of ADL  		limitations and the number of IADL limitations (ADLSUM and IADLSUM,  		respectively). Activities included in ADLSUM correspond to those found in the  		Katz ADL scale--eating, transfer, dressing, toileting, bathing, and continence  		(Kane, et al 1983). Persons who either received human assistance with an  		activity or used special equipment to perform an activity are considered to be  		limited in that activity. Activities included in IADLSUM are the following:  		heavy and light work around the house, laundry, meal preparation, grocery  		shopping, and money management. Persons who did not perform these activities  		for disability or health reasons were considered to be limited in that  		activity. As with health conditions, relative weights were not assigned to each  		of the specified limitations due to information and resource constraints; this  		limits the accuracy of these summed variables. An additional indicator of  		limited activity examined but not included in the analyses was how often  		persons avoided doing things because of lack of energy.</p>
<p>The use of health care is analyzed using regression analysis. A separate  		regression equation is used to describe each of the following measures of an  		individuals use of care: the number of hospital days in the past 12  		months; the number of emergency room visits in the past month; the number of  		visits to a doctors office in the past month; the number of other doctor  		visits (e.g., dentist, foot doctor, optometrist, chiropractor) in the past  		month; the number of prescription drugs used in the past month; and the number  		of therapy visits (e.g., physical, occupational, speech, and hearing therapy)  		in the past month. The parameters of these equations are estimated using  		ordinary least squares (OLS), controlling for a set of variables (personal  		characteristics) which are believed to influence the use of care, and  		controlling for differences between the study and comparison groups identified  		in the first phase of the analysis. Group membership is represented in each  		equation by a dichotomous dummy variable; a significant coefficient for this  		variable indicates that the groups are different with respect to the use of  		care variable analyzed. Two additional measures of health care use the number  		of admissions to a hospital and admissions to a nursing home, are analyzed  		using logistical regression analysis. Because of the influence of insurance  		coverage on access and utilization care (Newhouse, et al 1981), private  		insurance coverage of hospital and physician care were included as control  		variables in the multivariate analyses.</p>
<p>The use of home help provided by various sources is also analyzed using  		regression analysis. The amount of help received from the informal care network  		(family and friends), from formal helping organizations (such as Medicaid  		agencies which provide in-kind services), and care purchased in the market is  		estimated controlling for a set of socioeconomic and personal characteristics  		which might also affect the use of home help. Again, a group dummy variable is  		used to distinguish those persons receiving a cash allowance.</p>
<p>The measure of the amount of home help from each source--the number of  		days each helper provided help during the past week--is noticeably weak. The  		problem is that the average number of hours per visit per helper, as well as  		the intensity of each visit was not collected in the Long-Term Care Survey  		(average hours per visit were collected on the VA population and are presented  		in <a href="#analysis">Section 5.0</a>). Despite these shortcomings, the total  		number of days of help per week (which may total to more than seven days under  		this definition) are used to describe the use of home help, with the  		understanding of the potential for severe measurement errors in the dependent  		(explained) variables.</p>
<p>Another problem with the variable used to describe help received in the  		home is that it measures a level of effort received regardless of level of  		need. The Long-Term Care Survey does ask detailed questions on unmet needs in  		specific areas; these questions were mistakenly dropped from the survey of VA  		beneficiaries. A single question on unmet needs was developed for the VA study  		which required interviewees to identify areas of unmet need without prompting  		of specific areas. While not strictly comparable along this dimension, the two  		populations are, nevertheless, compared with an explicit understanding of the  		limitations.</p>
<p>Out-of-pocket expenditures for help received in the home was examined.  		For persons in the LTC survey, cost information on helpers who are paid  		relatives was not sought. Data collected on all paid helpers for the VA sample  		group indicate however that this subgroup is a negligible percentage of the  		helper population.</p>
<p>A limited number of variables which describe the degree of social  		interaction and life satisfaction were also analyzed. Variables related to  		social interaction include the amount of contact with relatives and friends,  		either in person or by phone, personal hobbies, and community activities (e.g.,  		church services, senior center visits, etc.). A variable, PHONE, was created to  		indicate whether a person had anyone check to make sure he or she was all  		right; this variable was used as a proxy measure of contact and the strength of  		relationships with informal caregivers outside the household. General life  		satisfaction and satisfaction with living environment is likely to be of high  		importance to this relatively housebound population.</p>
<p>Finally, questions relating specifically to the VA program were  		examined. These include questions concerning the type and amount of allowance  		received, use of the grant money received, and the sufficiency of the allowance  		in meeting the needs of the disabled. As decided in <a href="#cash">Chapter  		3</a>, the allowance program is part of the VA pension program and allowance  		monies are included in a beneficiarys regular pension check. A  		significant number of VA allowance beneficiaries could not distinguish between  		monies received under the basic pension program and the additional monies  		provided under the allowance program. Limitations on the use of VA files  		(described earlier) prevented the use of additional information for revealing  		the type of grant received. Without information on type of allowance received,  		it is not possible to estimate the allowance amount. The allowance amount  		variable is therefore used only descriptively, based on the information  		obtained from persons who knew the type and size of the allowance.</p>
<p>Standard formulas used to calculate variance estimates for parameters  		are based on the assumption of simple random sampling (i.e., independence and  		equal probability of selection). Complex sampling techniques violate these  		assumptions; adjustments to the standard statistical methods may be necessary.  		The unadjusted variance estimates may produce an inappropriate rejection of the  		null hypothesis because the actual variability of the sample is underestimated  		(Cohen, 1983). Several programs available for use in making the necessary  		corrections (SESUDAAN, RATIOTEST and SURREGR) were examined. Discussions with  		other professionals using the Long-Term Care Survey data indicated that such  		adjustments did not significantly affect results. Therefore, these correction  		procedures were not employed in the analysis.</p>
<p><i><b>4.2.4 Limitations</b></i></p>
<p>The generalizability of the results of this study is a major concern.  		This was not a blinded, randomized experiment: The selection processes, of  		people into specific programs and of VA program recipients into this study,  		undoubtedly affects the representativeness of the sample population.</p>
<p>The main issue is the extent of differences between veterans and  		nonveterans, and between survey respondents and nonrespondents. The most  		obvious example of the former is the predominance of males over females in the  		veteran population compared to the general population, particularly for older  		age groups. In 1980, 5.8 percent of veterans over age 65 were female, compared  		to 59.6 percent of the total over 65 population (Stockford, 1985; U.S. Bureau  		of the Census, 1982). However, because the study sample contains female  		surviving spouses, this factor is reduced. Other differences between the  		veteran and nonveteran populations may remain, however, and must be considered  		before extending the results of this study to the target population of disabled  		elderly.</p>
<p>The requirement that members of the selected VA sample could not be  		recontacted if they refused or did not respond also reduces the  		generalizability of the study. The resulting nonrespondent bias arises from  		possible differences in factors of health, functional status, and satisfaction  		with program between those initially agreeing and initially refusing to  		participate. Given the confidential nature of the VA files, however, follow-up  		efforts could not be made. Some basic demographic information for responders  		and the entire population or VA HB/AA recipients is compared in order to assess  		some aspects of this potential problem.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the study is that the Veterans Administration is  		unable to provide information on administrative costs for the allowance  		program. We are unable, therefore, to assess the potential effect of  		moral hazard on program costs (see <a href="#section2.2.2">Section  		2.2.2</a>). Also, the choice of control group necessitated strict adherence to  		the content and format of the 1982 LTC and Caregiver surveys. This limited our  		ability to fully explore some areas, such as satisfaction with care and  		consumer choice in choosing the amount and type of care.</p>
<h2><a name="analysis" id="analysis">5.0 ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS</a></h2>
<h3>5.1 Description of the Populations</h3>
<p><i><b>5.1.1 Sociodemographic Characteristics</b></i></p>
<p>The composition of the VA group differed significantly from that of the  		comparison group with regard to sex, race, and geographical location (<a href="#table5-1">Table 5-1</a>). The proportion of females in the VA group was  		low: 54.7 percent compared to 74.6 percent in the comparison group. This  		variation is not surprising due to the small number of female veterans in the  		United States--1.2 million at the end of fiscal year 1982 (U.S. Veterans  		Administration, 1982). In addition, the percentage of non-whites and urban  		residents was greater in the sample population: 37.2 percent of the VA group  		versus 12.4 percent of the comparison group were non-white; 64.0 percent of the  		VA group versus 17.9 percent in the comparison group were urban  		dwellers.<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup> Again, these  		differences were not unexpected. The selection of four major SMSAs and their  		surroundings areas for this study introduced a bias towards the selection of  		urban dwellers. The means testing required by the VA cash disability allowance  		program and the strong correlation between race and income may explain a large  		amount of the variation in race between the two groups.</p>

</tr></table><p>Percentage of single households differed slightly but not significantly  		among the two groups--with 46.8 percent of the VA group living alone compared  		to 52.6 percent of the LTC group. Although there were slight differences  		between the groups in median age, median educational level, and marital status,  		none of these differences were statistically significant (<a href="#table5-2">Table 5-2</a>). For the VA group and the comparison group  		respectively, the median age was 77.4 versus 78.2 years; 24.1 percent of the VA  		group were married versus 28.8 percent of the comparison group; the median  		level of education was 9.2 years for the VA group versus 9.6 years for the  		comparison group.</p>
<p>The median income range for the VA group is greater than that for the  		LTC group--the VA groups median is $8,000-$8,999 compared to the  		LTCs group median of $7,000-$7,999 (<a href="#table5-3">Table 5-3</a>).  		This was not unexpected since amounts received through VA pensions work as  		income supplements to push elderly veterans above the poverty line. The  		distribution among income categories is significantly different among the two  		groups as well. Another indicator of available resources is food stamp  		eligibility: A significantly greater proportion of persons in the comparison  		group receive food stamps, 16.9 percent versus 4.3 percent. Again, the income  		supplementation function of the VA pension can account for much of this  		difference.</p>

<p>A significantly greater percentage of the LTC group, 32.2 percent versus  		13.2 percent of the VA group, reported being eligible for Medicaid.

This difference was not  		significantly different. For physician services, private coverage was  		significantly greater among the LTC group: 48 percent had such coverage versus  		only 35 percent of the VA group.

<p>Owing to data collection problems, findings on unmet needs are  		equivocal.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup> Crude  		estimates of unmet ADL need indicate that 3.2 percent of the LTC group reported  		one or more unmet ADLs compared to 6.5 percent of the VA group. In contrast,  		however, an average of 1.59 ADL needs were reported as unmet by the LTC group  		versus 1.17 for the VA group. With regard to selected IADLs, the VA group  		reported lower levels of unmet need, with 15.1 percent of the VA versus 22.6  		percent of the LTC population having one or more unmet IADLs. The LTC group has  		an average of 1.05 unmet IADL needs as compared to 1.4 for the VA group. Due to  		the difference in variable creation, it is not known whether the difference in  		unmet neeed are statistically significant. It is also difficult to draw  		conclusions about unmet need differences due to the very small proportions in  		each sample showing unmet need.</p>

</tr></table><p><i><b>5.1.3 Health Status</b></i></p>
<p>Of 27 selected health conditions, the VA group has a significantly  		higher incidence of the following 8 conditions: paralysis, other permanent  		numbness or stiffness, glaucoma, frequent severe headaches, arteriosclerosis,  		stroke, circulation trouble, and flu. A comparison of the overall health status  		for the two groups, however, shows a similar distribution pattern with respect  		to self-reported health: 37 percent of the VA group versus 34 percent of the  		comparison group indicated that they were in excellent or good health compared  		to others of the same age, and 63 percent of the VA group versus 66 percent of  		the comparison group indicated that they were in fair or poor condition.</p>
<p><i><b>5.1.4 Social Interaction/Quality of Life</b></i></p>
<p>The amount of contact with relatives in person or by phone differed  		between the two groups. The estimated number of visits with relatives during  		the last month was significantly different among the two groups--44 percent of  		the VA group versus 34 percent of the comparison group visited with friends  		less than three times in the last month. Contact by phone, however, differed  		only slightly--33 percent of the VA group versus 25 percent of the comparison  		group had spoken with relatives less than three times in the last month.</p>
<p>With regard to friends, the amount of contact also differed. Persons in  		the VA group were slightly less likely to have visited with friends two times  		or less in the last month than were persons in the comparison group--28 percent  		versus 21 percent. The amount of phone contact with friends was significantly  		different in the VA group--50 percent of the VA group versus 27 percent of the  		comparison group had spoken with friends five times or less in the last month.  		Overall, the VA group appears to be somewhat less isolated than the comparison  		group.</p>
<p>Respondents in both groups indicated similar levels of general life  		satisfaction. The following are percentages for the VA and comparison group  		respectively: 21 percent versus 20 percent were very satisfied with life; 54  		percent versus 55 percent were satisfied with life; and 25 percent of persons  		in each group were not satisfied with life.</p>
<p>Satisfaction with his/her living environment, likely to be of great  		importance to this relatively housebound population, was similar in both  		populations: 44 percent of the VA group and 49 percent of the LTC group were  		very satisfied with their living environment, 43 versus 42 percent were  		satisfied, and 13 versus 10 percent were not satisfied.</p>
<p><i><b>5.1.5 Additional Information Available on the VA  		Population</b></i><sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Limited data were available on the decision-making process with regard  		to helpers: who decided that help was needed, who decided on who would provide  		this help, and who decided how much help would be provided. Nearly half of the  		respondents; 47.4 percent, stated that they had decided they needed help; 62.3  		percent stated they had decided on who would be the caregiver; and 53.3 percent  		stated they decided how much help they would receive.</p>
<p>In the VA sample, 59.7 percent of the group were veterans and the  		remaining persons were surviving spouses or other veteran dependents. Forty-two  		and three tenths percent of the veterans served during World War II; 53.3  		percent served during World War I. The vast majority of the VA sample group,  		84.2 percent, had no dependents (according to VA eligibility criteria).  		Beneficiaries had been receiving the VA pension an average of 16.14 years.</p>
<p>With regard to the disability allowance, the majority of beneficiaries,  		56.5 percent, did not know what type of allowance (AA or HB) they were  		receiving. The primary reason for this is that the disability allowance is  		simply added to the monthly pension check, and recollection of the original  		award is difficult, especially if it was made in the distant past. Of those  		responding, 71.7 percent reported receiving an AA allowance and 28.3 percent  		received a HB allowance.</p>
<p>Although a large percentage of allowance recipients surveyed were unable  		to distinguish between monies received under the basic pension program and  		those received under the allowance program, a number o f persons did appear  		quite knowledgeable about the connection between allowance monies and their  		need for long-term care. When these respondents were questioned about the  		source of money used to pay for particular helpers, they indicated that  		allowance funds were the source. This was true in several cases where spouses  		were recognized as paid helpers who would have had to go to work outside the  		home in absence of monies received through the allowance program.</p>
<p><i><b>5.1.6 Information Regarding Veterans Administration  		Pension</b></i></p>
<p>The median pension amount (regular plus disability allowance) was  		$289.72 per month. However, nearly 76 percent of responding pensioners (n=128)  		felt that their monthly pension amount was not enough. An additional $160 per  		month was the mean amount that they reported was necessary in order for the  		pension to be sufficient. Other pensioners merely responded that they did  		the best with what they had.</p>
<p>Concern was expressed by a number of veterans that the government was  		trying gradually to take away their benefits. In some cases, hostility was  		expressed by interviewees against the government for attacking what the  		interviewees felt were earned benefits (through war service). This may indicate  		that, given a particular amount of resources, these families are utilizing  		these resources in the manner that they believe is most efficient.</p>
<p>General attitudes towards the VA ranged from frustration to strong  		appreciation. A number of persons expressed frustration with the bureaucracy at  		the VA and their inability to get sufficient services. At the other end of the  		spectrum, a large number of interviewees expressed a great deal of gratitude  		for the Veterans Administrations assistance, without which they do not  		know how they would get by--this attitude was especially common in Minneapolis  		recipients. In almost all cases, however, recipients felt that allowance monies  		had been earned through service rendered for their country. The stigma  		generally associated with transfer programs was not apparent.</p>
<p>VA beneficiaries reported using their pension monies (including  		disability allowance) to pay for the following items:</p>

One innovative recipient combined  		his/her allowance monies with other limited personal resources to start up a  		business, obtain attendant care, and meet other daily needs. This situation was  		an excellent example of the ability of cash recipients to determine  		individualized and sometimes innovative approaches to dealing with their  		disabilities.</p>
<p><i><b>5.1.7 Special Concerns</b></i></p>
<p>Each of the four data collection sites had varying degrees of publicly  		supported assistance available to the VA beneficiaries. In Minneapolis/St.  		Paul, a small proportion of the sample received public assistance in the form  		of subsidized housing and home care. In Tampa/St. Petersburg, a number of  		beneficiaries also lived in government-subsidized housing and/or received other  		assistance from public agencies. In this metropolitan area, the problem of a VA  		pension potentially preventing a beneficiary from qualifying for Medicaid by  		pushing them over the Medicaid income ceiling was an area of concern identified  		by regional VA personnel. In Philadelphia, many of the beneficiaries who were  		age 65 and older were participants in a state-supported program of prescription  		medicine subsidization called PACE. All prescription medications under this  		program cost $4.00 and can be purchased at local drugstores. In the Los Angeles  		County area, a number of beneficiaries received care under a county-run,  		state-supported program called In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS). Under this  		program, participants receive the services of a home attendant for a specified  		number of hours per week. An important program concept is the ability of  		program participants to choose their own caregiver; relatives are eligible to  		be paid caregivers under the IHSS program.</p>
<p>As a result of the varying degrees of additional public assistance  		available to VA beneficiaries in each of the four sites, clear interpretation  		of the findings may be a problem. To the degree that these cities are not  		representative of the rest of the nation with regard to available services for  		the impaired elderly, this study may not be generalizable.</p>
<p><i><b>5.1.8 Under 65 Population</b></i></p>
<p>Persons in the initial VA sample who were under the age of 65 (n=56,  		mean age: 60.0 years) differed significantly from the over 65 group with regard  		to sex, household status, and marital status. 94.6 percent of the under 65  		group versus 54.7 percent of the over 65 group were male. Only 21.4 percent of  		the under 65 group lived alone versus 46.8 percent of the over 65 group. As for  		marital status, over double the percentage of the under 65 group, 57.4 percent,  		were married compared to the over 65 group, 24.1 percent. Taking into account  		the higher percentage of married persons among the younger VA sample  		population, it is not surprising that fewer of them live alone.</p>
<p><i><b>5.1.9 Nonrespondents</b></i></p>
<p>The average age of the general AA/HB population is slightly higher than  		that of the sample VA group, 78.05 versus 77.40 years, a difference which is  		not statistically significant. Information was not available on the sex of  		surviving spouse beneficiaries. Nevertheless, using available data which shows  		that 96.7 percent of veterans are male and assuming that the vast majority of  		surviving spouses are female,<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup> it is not unreasonable to assume that the  		veteran versus surviving spouse distribution, 44.7 versus 55.3 percent, is  		similar to the male versus female distribution. Based on these assumptions, the  		proportion of females in the sample group--45.3 percent--is similar to that of  		all VA beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Information was not available on the competency status of surviving  		spouses. With regard to veteran beneficiaries, 77.6 percent are rated competent  		by the VA. As for the actual sample group, incompetents were excluded in the  		initial selection process; therefore, 100 percent of this population was rated  		competent by the VA. As for disability status, housebound versus need for aid  		and attendance, 90.8 percent of the general AA/HB group are rated AA compared  		to 71.7 percent of the sample group.<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup> The percentage of HB beneficiaries in this  		sample group was significantly greater than that in the total VA allowance  		population (n=97,000).<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup> There are two major reasons that probably  		account for this difference: 1) AA beneficiaries are more disabled than those  		receiving HB and may thus be less able or willing to participate in a study;  		and, 2) those persons who expressed a willingness to participate, but were  		ineligible due to institutionalization, were predominantly AA level  		beneficiaries.</p>
<h3>5.2 Multivariate Analysis of Long-Term Care and Acute  		Care</h3>
<p><i><b><a name="section5.2.1" id="section5.2.1">5.2.1 Home Care Markets</a></b></i></p>
<p>Data from the VA and LTC surveys permit insight into the relative  		importance of the various sources of home care to disabled elderly.  		<a href="#table5-6">Table 5-6</a> compares the average number of days during a  		one week period persons received help, by type of caregiver (the VA group  		(n=139) and the LTC group (n=610) were described in <a href="#section4.2.1">Section 4.2.1</a>) Note that, as used here, a  		day of care is really a euphemism for visits by a formal caregiver  		or periods of help by an informal caregiver; since a person can receive such  		interventions from more than one caregiver per day, the total number of  		days of care per day can exceed one, and the total number of  		days of care received per week can exceed seven.  		<a href="#table5-6">Table 5-6</a> above that the number of days of help  		received per week as well as the number of days of help received from certain  		types of caregivers is different for the two groups: The goal of this analysis  		is to explain these differences.</p>
<p>It should be noted that these categories are a mixture of relationship  		to care receiver and funding type. Although they are intended to be mutually  		exclusive, they obviously may obscure certain important phenomena, such as the  		purchase of care from informal caregivers or from helping organizations.  		Despite this limitation, however, these categories may be collapsed into three  		groups which can be used to illustrate caregiver and care receiver decisions  		about care in the home.</p>

</tr></table><p>One particularly useful conceptualization of care in the home is an  		economic model. Home care (measured in days of care) is received  		from three major sources: formal helping organizations, such as visiting nurse  		associations, area agencies on aging, and church groups, that provide  		subsidized in-kind care for nominal or no out-of-pocket expense by the  		recipient (SUBDAYS); public and private providers that are hired directly by  		the care recipient, family or friends, and paid out of private funds that may  		be supplemented with a cash disability allowance (BUYDAYS); and care provided  		by informal caregivers, family and friends, whether or not remunerated by the  		care receiver (INFDAYS). Help may be hired from formal helping organizations,  		but the distinction between SUBDAYS and BUYDAYS is made because the  		relationships between consumers and providers are different in each case. The  		important distinction is the different nature of the markets; exactly what  		these helping organizations are does not matter. Survey respondents, given the  		choice, made the distinction between help that was hired and help that was not  		hired, and that is the distinction used in this analysis.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this is a departure from the common distinction  		made between formal and informal care. The formal care sector has been divided  		in this analysis into two sources of care to reflect the different incentives  		and choices faced by care recipients and their families. In one case, the  		disabled persons receive a subsidy in the form of services which requires no  		choices to be made between care and other goods and services; in the second,  		they must decide whether to spend their limited incomes on services or  		something else. Because of this difference, it is possible that care decisions  		and costs may differ depending on whether a subsidy is in the form of services  		or cash, and this is important for public policy.</p>
<p>The levels of care received from these sources can be viewed as being  		demanded and supplied in three separate markets, each characterized by the  		needs, incomes and other sociodemographic characteristics of care receivers,  		costs and prices. A reorganization of the information in <a href="#table5-6">Table 5-6</a> is presented in <a href="#table5-7">Table  		5-7</a> which illustrates the levels of care received from each market.</p>

</tr></table><p>It is apparent that the way care in the home is subsidized does have an  		effect on the relative importance of source of caregiving. Persons who receive  		public support in-kind but no cash subsidy have an order of magnitude more care  		from that source than persons who receive a cash subsidy. In contrast, persons  		receiving cash purchase more care and receive more informal care than persons  		receiving an in-kind subsidy. The two groups chose for comparison are, however,  		different along certain dimension (for example, the VA group is more frail),  		and it is not clear whether differences in the total amount and source of care  		received are due to differences in subsidy type or to socioeconomic and  		demographic differences. The multivariate analysis below answers this  		question.</p>
<p>One potential flaw in this and subsequent analyses is that these  		days of care may not be comparable. The mix of care received from  		the different sources may, on average, be qualitatively different (e.g., more  		ADL care versus IADL care from another). In addition, the level of intensity of  		care from one source may be greater than that from another, so that what may be  		called a helping intervention may take place in a longer or shorter period  		(e.g., informal caregivers may take much longer to accomplish the same task  		than a more efficient formal caregiver). There also may be multiple visits by  		formal caregivers or multiple interventions by informal caregivers  		during a single day which are not captured by the day measure.</p>
<p>Intensity or hours of care per period of intervention was not queried in  		the LTC Survey, a serious omission. This error was redressed in the VA Survey,  		where the following information was asked: Thinking about all of the  		things (caregiver name) does for you because of your disability, about how many  		<b>extra</b> hours does he/she spend helping you on an average day? The  		responses to this question and reported days per week are presented in  		<a href="#table5-8">Table 5-8</a> for persons in the VA group who received some  		positive level of support from the sources of care.</p>

It is also not  		surprising that the average duration of a helping intervention by informal or  		paid caregivers takes longer than that of caregivers providing subsidized,  		in-kind care: More care may be provided during a given day; caregivers  		providing subsidized care may be relatively more efficient at caregiving than  		informal caregivers; or subsidized care may be fundamentally different (e.g.,  		more skilled). Since INFDAYS are approximately 4.8 times longer than SUBDAYS,  		and BUYDAYS 5.5 times longer, the difference is probably due to all three  		reasons. These findings are important to the analysis of substitution  		below.</p>
<p>If the relative number of hours per day of intervention are different  		for different sources of care, than it is not appropriate to sum days of care  		from the three markets. Using the data in <a href="#table5-8">Table 5-8</a>, it  		is possible to transform days of care into hours of care from each source.  		These results are shown in <a href="#table5-9">Table 5-9</a>, assuming that  		hours per day estimates derived from the VA sample also hold for persons in the  		LTC comparison group. This is not necessarily the case (for example, the VA  		group is more frail, and hours of care per day for this group may be greater),  		and findings based on that assumption must be considered suggestive only.</p>

</tr></table><p>The figures in <a href="#table5-10">Table 5-10</a> indicate that the  		distribution of the type of care helpers provide is similar for the informal  		and paid caregivers: greater proportions of these caregivers provided IADL and  		nursing care and less ADL only care than caregivers providing subsidized care.  		This finding further supports the estimates of hours per day in  		<a href="#table5-8">Table 5-8</a> which indicate that INFDAYS and BUYDAYS  		appear to be different than SUBDAYS. Nevertheless, it is clear that all three  		types of care are obtained from each of the three markets.</p>
<p>The average days of care received by group by market reported in  		<a href="#table5-7">Table 5-7</a> are the equilibrium levels: they  		are the resolution of the demands of consumers with the supply of providers,  		given the costs and prices in each market. The following describes each of the  		three markets and their interaction, with the goal of explaining the  		differences in outcomes among the groups. The markets are specified to reflect  		the realities and peculiarities of care at home. The research question is  		whether the VA group is statistically different with respect to these outcomes,  		and in what way.</p>
<p><b>The Market for SUBDAYS</b></p>
<p>The salient characteristic of the market for help from helping  		organizations providing subsidized, in-kind care is that the price of care to  		consumers is intended to be virtually zero. Small copayments for each visit may  		be required by the helping agency, but these are likely to be negligible (in  		some cases, e.g., Medicare services, copayments might be substantial). For  		persons in the comparison group, approximately one-quarter (156/610) actually  		paid something out-of-pocket for care received from a helping organization;  		only 14% paid more than $5.00 per visit. Only two persons in the VA group of  		the 12 who received SUBDAYS paid anything for that care.</p>
<p>At zero or negligible price, it can be expected that the demand for  		SUBDAYS is essentially infinite (with respect to price) within the relevant  		range, and because of this, demand plays no role in determining the ultimate  		(or equilibrium) level of care or help provided in this market. It should be  		noted that individual consumer preferences have a definite role in determining  		individual demand for SUBDAYS but do not affect the equilibrium supply in this  		market within the relevant range. (Strictly speaking, although any one  		individuals physical needs may be fulfilled, at zero cost that person may  		continue to demand SUBDAYS because they meet other needs and wants. Further,  		from the perspective of providers, the demand for their product is essentially  		insatiable, since persons with minor or no disabilities would also want such  		services at zero price. As a practical matter, the low number of observations  		on persons who paid a positive amount for SUBDAYS rules out estimation of the  		demand for SUBDAYS.) Consequently, it is assumed that the rationing of SUBDAYS  		is based on mechanisms other than price, and is determined entirely by the  		conditions of supply.</p>
<p>Formal helping organizations providing subsidized care presumably supply  		help according to need, and in many cases, according to inability to pay. Some  		organizations may base their decisions on the beneficiarys absolute level  		of need; others on the level of unmet need, taking into consideration levels of  		informal and purchased care. Some agencies may be limited by budgets and are  		sensitive to resource costs such as the wages of personnel; others may be  		required to provide care to all who are entitled regardless of total costs, and  		are insensitive to the prices of inputs.</p>
<p>The supply of SUBDAYS can be represented more formally by the following  		equation:</p>
<table><tr><td nowrap="NOWRAP" scope="row">SUBDAYS  			 =  </td>
<td>a<sub>o</sub> + a<sub>1</sub>VA +  			 a<sub>2</sub>ADL + a<sub>3</sub>IADL + a<sub>4</sub>DXTOT + a<sub>5</sub>AGE +  			 a<sub>6</sub>SEX + a<sub>7</sub>RACE + a<sub>8</sub>LALONE + a<sub>9</sub>URBAN  			 + a<sub>10</sub>LINC + a<sub>11</sub>HINC + a<sub>12</sub>MEDICAID +  			 u<sub>1</sub></td>
<td>  (1)  </td>
</tr></table><p>Equation (1) describes the supply of SUBDAYS as a linear function of a  		set of variables which are expected to influence supply. The as are  		parameters (a<sub>o</sub> is a constant) which describe the impact of each  		variable on supply, taking into account the impact of the other variables. The  		u<sub>1</sub> is an error term representing the influence of errors in  		measurement of the variables, errors in the specification of the equation, and  		random error. These parameters are estimated using regression analysis. Since  		(by assumption) the demand for SUBDAYS plays no role in this market, Equation  		(1) also determines the equilibrium level of SUBDAYS.</p>
<p>ADL and IADL are measures of recipients levels of needs for  		assistance in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily  		living; DXTOT is a measure of the number of chronic conditions each person has;  		LALONE is a dichotomous variable distinguishing persons who live alone; age is  		self-explanatory. It is hypothesized that the coefficients a<sub>2</sub>,  		a<sub>3</sub>, a<sub>4</sub>, a<sub>5</sub> and a<sub>8</sub> are all positive;  		that is, that SUBDAYS are greater for persons with greater needs. Sex and race  		are included because of their potential effect on need; but because  		discrimination by helping organizations on the basis of sex and race is not  		permitted, their effect on supply is indeterminate a priori (i.e.,  		a<sub>6</sub>, a<sub>7</sub> &gt;, = or &lt; o). The supply of SUBDAYS should  		be less the greater are prices of inputs which are likely higher in URBAN areas  		(a<sub>9</sub> should be negative). The greater a persons income, the less  		likely it should be that that person would qualify or receive support from this  		source of help (and vice versa); thus, it is hypothesized that a<sub>10</sub>  		&gt; 0, a<sub>11</sub> &lt; 0 (family income has been divided into three dummy  		variables: high (HINC), medium (MINC) and low (LINC) income; the left out  		category is MINC). Membership in the VA group, characterized by the receipt of  		an AA or HB cash grant as well as a pension designed to raise persons above the  		poverty line, should also reduce a persons chance of receiving SUBDAYS  		(a<sub>1</sub> should be negative).</p>
<p>It is likely that the helping organizations ability to assess  		levels of informal effort (informal and purchased care) will be limited either  		by the failure of recipients to be fully revealing of their personal  		circumstances, or by regulations which prevent discrimination against persons  		who receive care from available caregivers. Thus, INFDAYS and BUYDAYS are not  		included in Equation (1). Equation (1) was estimated a second time with INFDAYS  		and BUYDAYS as explanatory variables to test whether helping organizations make  		decisions on the basis of unmet need instead of just need. This assumption  		introduces the complication of simultaneity into the estimation process and  		requires a multi-stage estimation procedure. The hypothesis of helping  		organizations making decisions on the basis of unmet need (as measured crudely  		by these variables) was not confirmed by the data.</p>
<p><b>The Market for INFDAYS</b></p>
<p>Because decisions as to the level of informal care and help to be  		provided by family and friends are often joint ones, taking into consideration  		the availability and willingness of informal caregivers as well as the needs  		and resources of the care receiver, it is difficult to imagine demand and  		supply occurring separately in what strictly may be called a market.  		Nevertheless, an attempt is made here to do so in order to isolate and  		highlight the determinants of the supply of informal care and the factors which  		influence informal caregivers to substitute publicly-funded, in-kind care or  		others forms of public assistance for their own effort when it is offered. This  		framework also will permit an examination of whether public support in the form  		of cash instead of in-kind care has a differential effect on substitution of  		public resources for private effort. Consumers and providers of informal help  		are strictly separate in theory; the absence of readily observable prices and  		costs does not permit their distinction empirically.</p>
<p>As in the market for SUBDAYS, a key element in the market for INFDAYS is  		missing: price. Conceptually, the price of INFDAYS is the payment made by care  		receivers to informal caregivers necessary to encourage the flow of services.  		At best, this phenomenon is hard to measure; in reality, it probably has little  		relevance to the supply of informal services forthcoming; and, in practice, our  		data are not very revealing of its magnitude (payments to relatives were not  		queried on the LTC Survey). Data from the VA Survey indicate that the frequency  		of side payments to informal caregivers was very low: only 13 persons in the VA  		sample of the 104 who received help from a relative or friend (12.5%) actually  		paid something for that care. Consequently, this framework explicitly assumes  		that the price of informal care is zero, and it is excluded from the analysis  		even though at the margin, such payments may encourage a greater supply of care  		(money given to informal caregivers to pay for expenses such as gasoline may  		not be considered payments per se by either party and are not reported as such;  		yet, they are in fact).</p>
<p>At a zero price (in strictly pecuniary terms) the demand for INFDAYS  		effectively would be infinite in the relevant range, and would have no effect  		in determining the equilibrium level of INFDAYS consumed. Other non-pecuniary  		costs to the recipient (particularly emotional ones) are likely to limit  		demand, but these are virtually impossible to quantify for purposes of  		analysis. Thus, it is assumed that the amount of care observed in this market  		is determined solely by the conditions of supply.</p>
<p>The supply of INFDAYS is represented formally by Equation (2):</p>
<table title="add"><tr><td nowrap="NOWRAP" scope="row">INFDAYS  			 =  </td>
<td>b<sub>o</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>VA +  			 b<sub>2</sub>ADL + b<sub>3</sub>IADL + b<sub>4</sub>DXTOT + b<sub>5</sub>AGE +  			 b<sub>6</sub>SEX + b<sub>7</sub>RACE + b<sub>8</sub>LALONE + b<sub>9</sub>TOUCH  			 + b<sub>10</sub>SUBDAYS + u<sub>2</sub></td>
<td>  (2)  </td>
</tr></table><p>The bs in Equation (2) are parameters which are estimated;  		u<sub>2</sub> is an error term. It is hypothesized that more INFDAYS are  		supplied to persons with greater need (b<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>3</sub>,  		b<sub>4</sub>, b<sub>5</sub> &gt; 0); that people who live alone have fewer  		available informal caregivers and receive fewer INFDAYS (b<sub>8</sub> &lt; 0);  		and that sex and race may affect the supply of INFDAYS (b<sub>6</sub>,  		b<sub>7</sub> &gt;, = or &lt; 0). TOUCH is a dichotomous variable indicating  		whether relatives or friends keep in touch with the sample person either by  		phone or by visiting, a crude measure of the strength of informal ties  		(b<sub>9</sub> is hypothesized to be positive). The pecuniary costs of  		providing informal care, that is, the opportunity costs, are the wages (or some  		other value of time) foregone by providing care rather than being engaged in  		some other (possibly remunerative) activity. This has been omitted from  		Equation (2) because of lack of data, but also because of its likely  		unimportance to elderly caregivers, and evidence that it is not a serious issue  		with other relative caregivers (Department of Health and Human Services,  		<b>1982 National Long-Term Care Survey</b>, 1985). With expected changes in the  		caregiver population resulting from different sociodemographic forces, this  		issue may become more important in determining the supply of informal care.  		Because of the infrequency of side payment in this sample, it is presumed that  		income is unimportant to supply and it is omitted from the equation.</p>
<p>The coefficient of VA in Equation (2) , b<sub>1</sub>, is a measure of  		the impact of receiving a cash subsidy for home care versus services in-kind.  		It was argued above that cash subsidies permit recipients and their informal  		caregivers to substitute informal effort for purchased care and to spend the  		savings on whatever they wish--an option not available if the subsidy is  		in-kind services. Consequently, it is hypothesized that the substitution of  		public resources for informal effort will be no greater for the VA  		beneficiaries than for the LTC comparison group; that is, controlling for  		differences in sociodemographics and need, the VA group will receive either the  		same amount or more informal care (b &gt; = 0).</p>
<p>SUBDAYS is included in Equation (2) to measure the rate of substitution  		of public (or private) resources for public effort. Informal caregivers are  		expected to react rationally to the provision of essentially free care by  		reducing their caregiving efforts (b<sub>10</sub> &lt; 0); if the care provided  		by each source is similar, then the substitution of SUBDAYS for INFDAYS will be  		perfect (i.e., adjusting for differences in hours per day, b<sub>10</sub> would  		equal -1).</p>
<p><b>The Market for BUYDAYS</b></p>
<p>In contrast to the markets for INFDAYS and SUBDAYS, price may play an  		important role in the market for BUYDAYS. Of the 39 persons in the VA group who  		purchased BUYDAYS, 21 (53.8%) said they themselves paid something out-of-pocket  		for that care (presumably care for the remainder was paid for by friends or  		relatives); 70.9% (56/79) of persons consuming BUYDAYS in the comparison group  		reported a positive expenditure for BUYDAYS. Persons in the entire sample  		reporting a positive expenditure for BUYDAYS (77 persons) paid an average of  		$32.23 per BUYDAY, or $5.72 per hour. This figure is the out-of-pocket cost to  		the disabled person, and does not necessarily represent the average market  		price of care since some of the care purchased may have been paid for by  		someone else (the total cost of care was not queried on the LTC Survey.)</p>
<p>For convenience, it is assumed that in metropolitan market areas such as  		being examined here, there are many sellers of BUYDAYS who, in the relevant  		range, can sell all of their available product at the given market price, and  		cannot influence that price through their own production behavior. In  		consequence, it is assumed that equilibrium in this market is determined  		primarily by the conditions of demand, not supply. (As a practical matter,  		characteristics of the firms supplying BUYDAYS to persons in the sample are not  		available, making estimation of a supply function almost impossible.)</p>
<p>The demand for BUYDAYS is represented formally in Equation (3):</p>
<table title="add"><tr><td nowrap="NOWRAP" scope="row">BUYDAYS  			 =  </td>
<td>c<sub>o</sub> + c<sub>1</sub>VA +  			 c<sub>2</sub>ADL + c<sub>3</sub>IADL + c<sub>4</sub>DXTOT + c<sub>5</sub>AGE +  			 c<sub>6</sub>SEX + c<sub>7</sub>RACE + c<sub>8</sub>LALONE + c<sub>9</sub>URBAN  			 + c<sub>10</sub>LINC + c<sub>11</sub>HINC + c<sub>12</sub>INFDAYS +  			 c<sub>13</sub>SUBDAYS + u<sub>3</sub></td>
<td>  (3)  </td>
</tr></table><p>The cs in Equation (3) are parameters to be estimated;  		u<sub>3</sub> is an error term.</p>
<p>It is hypothesized that persons with greater needs will demand more  		BUYDAYS (c<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>3</sub>, c<sub>4</sub>, c<sub>5</sub> &gt; 0);  		need for purchased care will be greater for persons who live alone  		(c<sub>8</sub> &gt; 0); less care will be demanded where prices are higher, as  		indicated by the URBAN variable (c<sub>9</sub> &lt; 0); and more care will be  		demanded by persons with higher incomes (c<sub>10</sub> &lt; 0, c<sub>11</sub>  		&gt; 0). The coefficients of sex and race (c<sub>6</sub> and c<sub>7</sub>) are  		uncertain a priori.</p>
<p>Prices calculated for persons purchasing BUYDAYS are not used in  		Equation (3) because they are not available for persons deciding not to  		purchase BUYDAYS but who could have. Since this would severely restrict the  		sample to only those persons with BUYDAYS (n=77), the variable URBAN is used as  		a proxy for price.</p>
<p>As argued above, a cash subsidy such as the VA AA/HB allowance enhances  		the income of recipients, who may then spend all or part of that additional sum  		on BUYDAYS (c<sub>1</sub> &gt; 0). The prices of substitutes (SUBDAYS and  		INFDAYS) have been omitted from the demand equation because of their relative  		unimportance.</p>
<p>INFDAYS and SUBDAYS appear in Equation (3) to account for the  		possibility that care from these sources substitutes for care purchased  		(c<sub>12</sub>, c<sub>13</sub> &lt; 0). This model explicitly assumes that  		individuals fill gaps in care with BUYDAYS after the level of informal care and  		subsidized, in-kind care from formal helping organizations has been  		established. Other models of home care markets which examine the possibility  		that decisions about SUBDAYS, INFDAYS and BUYDAYS are made simultaneously were  		estimated using three stage least squares. The results of those models did not  		confirm such simultaneity and are not presented.</p>
<p><i><b>5.2.2 Empirical Analysis of Home Care Markets</b></i></p>
<p>The results of the multivariate analyses (ordinary least squares  		regressions) of SUBDAYS, INFDAYS and BUYDAYS are reported in  		<a href="#table5-11">Table 5-11</a> (sample sizes differ because of missing  		values for some of the variables). The figures in <a href="#table5-11">Table  		5-11</a> indicate that the pattern of care received from the three major  		markets presented in <a href="#table5-7">Table 5-7</a> is confirmed when  		differences in socioeconomic and demographic factors between the two groups are  		controlled for, although the magnitudes change somewhat.</p>
<p>Persons in the VA group received 3.27 fewer days of in-kind care per  		week than persons in the comparison group. This is the equivalent of  		approximately 3.9 hours per week. Other variables indicating need and resources  		are probably not significant because the comparison sample, which represents 81  		percent of the entire sample, is comprised of only those persons in the LTC  		Survey who received at least some in-kind help from a helping organization: The  		results of the SUBDAYS equation estimation in <a href="#table5-11">Table  		5-11</a> imply that once a person is receiving in-kind care from a helping  		organization, additional levels of need (with the exception of living  		arrangement) do not result in more care from this source. This might mean  		either that persons who are eligible for SUBDAYS are relatively homogeneous  		with respect to need, or that care provided by helping organizations comes in  		</p>

</tr></table><p>caregivers; the coefficient for IADL is about double that for ADL,  		possibly indicating that, although informal caregivers provide both types of  		care to this relatively very frail and dependent population, they provide more  		IADL rather than ADL care. This relationship is stronger when all persons are  		considered, i.e., whether or not they received SUBDAYS (see the INFDAYS  		equation in <a href="#table5-12">Table 5-12</a>).</p>
<p>Persons who live alone receive about 4 fewer days of care from informal  		sources. Those persons who are less socially isolated (as measured by the TOUCH  		variable) receive significantly more care from informal sources. The  		coefficient for SUBDAYS in the INFDAYS equation is discussed in a separate  		section below.</p>
<p>Persons in the VA group purchase .586 more days of care per week (about  		3.8 hours per week) than persons in the comparison group (see the BUYDAYS  		equation in <a href="#table5-11">Table 5-11</a>). This makes up almost exactly  		for the fewer hours of subsidized, in-kind care they receive from helping  		organizations. ADL score is the only need variable which is a significant  		determinant of the level of BUYDAYS. Using the larger comparison group in the  		analysis (<a href="#table5-12">Table 5-12</a>), which includes a less frail  		group as well as those who receive SUBDAYS, it is apparent that the need for  		both types of care is important in determining the level of BUYDAYS. Both ADL  		and IADL coefficients are positive and significant.</p>

</tr></table><p>Persons with higher incomes purchase more days of care (although not  		significantly more), and the price of care (as measured crudely by the URBAN  		variable) does reduce the demand for care. Care received from informal sources,  		but not that received from helping organizations, does substitute somewhat for  		purchased care (one day of informal care reduces the amount of purchased care  		by only .092 days). The small coefficient may indicate that care from these  		sources may be more complementary than substitutes for persons with some  		informal care (i.e., that bought care is used to fill gaps in care).</p>
<p>As described in <a href="#cash">Chapter 3</a>, beneficiaries of the VA  		AA/HB allowance program received an average subsidy of about $185 per month, or  		$42.70 per week. At an average out-of-pocket price for bought care of $32 per  		day, this works out to 1.33 BUYDAYS per week, which is slightly greater than  		the mean number of BUYDAYS purchased by persons in the veteran sample (1.16  		days per week). Thus, beneficiaries of the VA program spend the equivalent of  		about 87 percent of their entire allowance on care. But compared to a similarly  		disabled comparison group, and controlling for differences in income, they  		bought only .586 days per week more (i.e., persons without an allowance also  		purchased care out of personal income). This implies that VA beneficiaries were  		given the means, but chose not, to purchase an additional six-tenths of a day  		of care (1.16 - .586) per week. These monies ($18 per week, or $80 per month)  		were presumably spent on things which brought the recipient a higher level of  		personal well-being. Also, these additional funds may have encouraged a greater  		supply of informal care to VA recipients than would otherwise be forthcoming  		(the difference in informal care received by the two groups was not, however,  		statistically significant): Although few recipients reported direct payments to  		informal caregivers for services rendered (9%), additional income available for  		the family to spend as it wishes may serve to encourage additional informal  		caregiving effort at the margin.</p>
<p><i><b>5.2.3 The Substitution of Public Resources for Private  		Effort</b></i></p>
<p>An interesting by-product of this analysis is the finding that  		subsidized, in-kind care from formal helping organizations does substitute for  		care provided by informal caregivers. The coefficient for SUBDAYS in the  		INFDAYS equation (<a href="#table5-11">Table 5-11</a>) implies that each day of  		care provided by a helping organization (the equivalent of slightly more than  		one hour) causes a drop of .178 days of care provided by informal caregivers.  		This coefficient is highly significant and was highly stable under many  		alternative specifications of the informal care supply equation, varying by no  		more than .02 days. The importance of the coefficient becomes evident when  		translated into hours of informal care: .178 days of informal care is the  		equivalent of approximately 1.02 hours of informal care (using hours per day of  		care information asked of persons in the VA Survey). Thus, each hour of  		subsidized care provided by a helping organization supplants approximately an  		hour of informal care--hour for hour, one for one.</p>
<p>This finding is not surprising when caregivers and care receivers are  		viewed as rational decision-makers responding to straightforward economic  		incentives. It is also a sign that programs of help, whether publicly funded or  		private, do accomplish at least one of the objectives they are designed for:  		they relieve the informal support networks burden of care in the  		short-run by supplanting informal care with formal services. Since both sources  		of care supply ADL and IADL care, it is likely that substitution occurs within,  		not across, types of help. Presumably, relief of informal burden in the  		short-run will encourage greater informal support over the long-run, so that  		dependent and frail care receives will be able to avoid or delay  		institutionalization. This analysis confirms only the first half of the  		proposition.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the findings reported in <a href="#table5-11">Table 5-11</a> are relevant only for persons who are  		receiving at least some position level of subsidized care from a helping  		organization. The estimates do not address the behavior of informal caregivers  		of persons who have not sought subsidized care from a helping organization,  		even though the persons they help may be eligible for such care. Because, in  		the short-run, some informal caregivers probably provide care beyond their  		long-term capacity to do so, it is likely that the greatest marginal rate of  		substitution of subsidized, in-kind care for informal care occurs when they  		have exceeded their burden threshold and seek outside help; that is, when the  		care receiver makes the transition from no SUBDAYS to some positive level of  		SUBDAYS. The INFDAYS equation estimated on all persons in the LTC comparison  		sample (n=3329) reported in <a href="#table5-12">Table 5-12</a> is an attempt  		to estimate the additional (actually initial) substitution effect of going from  		none of some SUBDAYS.</p>
<p>An additional variable, SUBNO, has been added to the list of independent  		variables in the INFDAYS equation which distinguishes persons who received some  		and no SUBDAYS. The coefficient of SUBNO implies that persons who did not have  		any subsidized help from a helping organization received .650, or approximately  		two-thirds more INFDAYS per week. Transforming this figure into hours, it is  		estimated that the first hour of subsidized care from a helping organization  		supplants about four (3.718) hours of informal effort. This may indicate either  		that some hours of informal care which were given up were not essential, or  		that the excessive burdens of high levels of informal care made informal  		caregivers relatively less efficient in providing those last marginal units of  		care.</p>
<p>The analytic results of the Channeling Demonstration are actually  		<b>very</b> supportive of these findings, despite the conclusions of the  		principals involved in the project which appear to ignore the large number of  		findings in their own analysis indicating wide-spread short-term substitution  		effects (Mathematica, 1985). In fact, findings of substitution effects are  		strong, significant and persistent at several levels of analysis.</p>
<p>Over and over again, findings of strong statistical significance (at  		five percent and one percent confidence levels) are reported, and then  		downplayed. Substitution effects were reported in the following areas: receipt  		of meal preparation and chores in the basic case management model, and receipt  		of meal preparation, housework, laundry or shopping, general supervision,  		delivery of prepared meals, and help with transportation under the financial  		control model, and the number of types of in-home care received and the  		presence and number of informal caregivers under the financial control model.  		Also, the magnitudes of the significant findings are consistent: a reduction in  		informal effort is apparently brought on by an increase of formal effort that  		is three, four or five times as large. Rather than ask why these effects are of  		this magnitude and what are the implications, the researchers conclude that  		there is little evidence of substitution and where it did occur, its effect was  		small in magnitude.</p>
<p>The key is that a period of caring intervention by a formal caregiver is  		not necessarily equivalent in intensity or duration to that of an informal  		caregiver. Implied coefficients of the effect of formal care on informal care  		in the Channeling Demonstration of 0.2 (5:1) to .033 (3:1) are similar to  		coefficients estimated in this study of about 0.18 (5.5:1). If for members in  		the Channeling sample the average period of informal caregiving is on the order  		of three to five times longer than that of a formal caregiver, then  		substitution not only exists but is perfect (i.e., one to one), and a different  		assessment of the intervention emerges: the basic model is ineffective because  		it does not relieve the burden of informal caregivers; the financial control  		model is effective in this regard, and has the potential, in theory, therefore,  		to encourage informal support over longer periods of time (the cost of this  		intervention, however, is another, more significant, concern).</p>
<p>Relieving the excessive burdens of caregivers is a legitimate public  		policy, whether or not it results in a net economic benefit. Rather than asking  		whether substitution exists, researchers should be asking what is its magnitude  		and what can be done to limit its detrimental effects on the family and  		society: that is, what is the most efficient way of subsidizing home care for  		disabled persons.</p>
<p><i><b>5.2.4 Acute Care Utilization</b></i></p>
<p>The findings so far have suggested that persons receiving a cash  		disability allowance receive about the same amount of help at home as persons  		receiving subsidized services in-kind from a helping organization, although the  		importance of the various sources of care differs significantly for the two  		groups. The VA group was somewhat more disabled than the LTC comparison group  		in terms of both ADL and IADL score, but findings regarding differences in  		needs were not conclusive. The question remains whether recipients of an  		allowance were worse off in terms of acute care needs and utilization.</p>
<p>The determinants of acute care utilization were estimated for six  		categories of care, controlling for a number of variables also likely to affect  		a persons consumption of care. In addition to the various variables  		representing need and personal resources that were used to explain the  		distribution of care received in home care markets, the equations describing  		the consumption of acute care also contain variables denoting whether the  		person had private hospital insurance (PVTHINS) and private insurance covering  		the services of physicians (PVTMDINS). The results are reported in  		<a href="#table5-13">Table 5-13</a>.</p>
<p>Reading across the six equations in <a href="#table5-13">Table 5-13</a>,  		it can be seen that the VA group compared with the comparison group of persons  		who had some subsidized help from a helping organization but not a cash grant,  		had 8.4 fewer hospital days (HDAYS) during the year prior to the interview,  		consumed 1.18 more prescription drugs (RX) in the previous month, and had .668  		fewer visits to a therapist (TV) during the previous month; the groups did not  		differ with respect to emergency room visits (ERV), MD visits (DV) and other  		doctor visits (ODV). Despite the fact that the VA acute care system is  		essentially free to qualifying veterans, rapid growth over the past decade in  		utilization of VA hospitals (see <a href="#section3.1.3">Section 3.1.3</a>) may  		have resulted in more efficient use of existing facilities through reduced  		lengths of stay and admissions per veteran. Prescription drug use probably is  		higher for the VA group because recipients of an Aid and Attendance Allowance  		are given drugs through the VA Medical System for no charge. Only two persons  		in the VA group had a stay in a nursing home during the 12 months prior to the  		interview, so it was not feasible to compare the two groups along this  		dimension of care received.</p>

</tr></table><p>Although the acute care equations are generally of low explanatory  		power, some estimated coefficients of certain variables are highly significant.  		The findings suggest that recipients of a cash disability allowance are no  		worse off than other persons with similar disabilities and chronic problems  		with respect to their use of acute care.</p>
<p><i><b>5.2.5 Relative Cost Efficiency of In-Kind Versus Cash Subsidies  		for Long-Term Care</b></i></p>
<p>Although a majority of persons in the VA sample were not capable of  		recalling or identifying the dollar amount of their monthly allowances (and  		such information was not available through data sharing agreements with the  		VA), analysis of all persons receiving an AA or HB allowance from the VA  		indicates an average amount of $185 (see <a href="#cash">Chapter 3</a>). This  		may be assumed to be the average direct per recipient cost of the program. The  		findings above suggest beneficiaries of this program are not worse off with  		regard to either acute or long-term care. Persons in the VA group are slightly  		more frail, but they may also receive more total care; if the data on hours are  		accurate, the VA group does receive more total hours of care per week. In  		general, then, it is probably safe to conclude that the disability allowance  		program has at least the same beneficial effects on recipients as the in-kind  		services program, and does not leave those persons in any way worse off.</p>
<p>The direct (non-administrative) cost of the in-kind services program per  		person per month is not readily discernable from the survey data, as the total  		cost of services to recipients was not queried. If the estimate of the number  		of hours per day for a SUBDAY described above is representative of actual care  		provided and received in this market, then persons receiving services in-kind  		receive approximately 16.8 more hours of subsidized care from helping  		organizations per month than persons in the VA group. If the direct additional  		costs of the two subsidies were the same (i.e., $185 per month), then this  		would imply that these 16.8 more SUBDAYS would cost approximately $11 per  		day--an unreasonably low figure for an average day comprised of  		both relatively inexpensive IADL services and relatively costly ADL services.  		It is likely that the mean monthly direct costs of in-kind services per  		recipient is a lot higher than $185; perhaps twice that much, and more. If this  		is true, then it is probable that for many persons, cash is a more efficient  		benefit than in-home in-kind transfers.</p>
<p>These costs are not, however, the total costs of the program. First,  		there are costs associated with the basic administration of the program. As  		discussed above, it is likely that mailing a check to a recipient is many times  		less expensive per recipient then the costs of supervising a staff of  		caregivers. Second, there are additional administrative costs in the form of  		screening of information gathering costs. As discussed above, it would be  		hypothesized that because the cash allowance is a more attractive benefit, more  		persons would come out of the woodwork to attempt to qualify for the benefit,  		thereby raising the costs of screening per recipient as well as the costs per  		recipient of giving benefits erroneously to persons who otherwise would not  		have qualified. Neither of these costs could be calculated in this study,  		although if should be pointed out that the second problem, the woodwork effect,  		is also a problem with persons desiring an in-kind benefit, although the degree  		of moral hazard is likely to be less. Thus, it is not possible in this study to  		conclusively determine whether one subsidy type is more cost-effective (in the  		short- or long-run).</p>
<h3>5.3 Summary and Conclusions</h3>
<p><i><b>5.3.1 Summary of Findings</b></i></p>
<p>The economic model used in this analysis provides a very robust  		framework for examining the issues. It is especially useful in distinguishing  		the sources of in-home care, providing motivation and a consistent rationale  		for the provision of services in each sector. The important phenomenon of  		short-term substitution becomes a logical manifestation of the forces acting on  		informal supports, as viewed in the context of rational caregivers facing a set  		of economic incentives.</p>
<p>One key measure of the relative efficiency of the cash allowance  		mechanism, from the beneficiarys point of view, is whether or not persons  		receiving cash have different utilization patterns for acute and long-term care  		services. Study results show that the VA group as a whole received similar  		levels of long-term care (measuring levels in hours of care) and were no worse  		off than the comparison group with regard to acute health care utilization. One  		potential criticism of cash allowance, that beneficiaries of cash payments will  		need more intensive acute and long-term care services because they will  		purchase an insufficient amount of needed services, is, thus, not supported by  		this study.</p>
<p>From the funding sources point of view (i.e., local, state, or  		federal agency), one key measure of a mechanisms efficiency is its  		cost-effectiveness. The overall costs of providing long-term care assistance  		through cash allowances versus in-kind services could not be compared. Relative  		administrative costs in particular, which include screening and monitoring  		expenditures, were not available. Nevertheless, evidence on hours of care per  		week and the direct (non-administrative) costs of the VA cash program suggest  		that the cash benefit may be the more cost-effective alternative for many  		beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Another key issue with regard to program efficiency is the substitution  		of subsidized, in-kind home care for that provided by the informal network. The  		substitution effect was found to be significant and approximately  		one-to-one.</p>
<p>The reader is cautioned that these results must be considered tentative  		and suggestive only. They are based on the comparison of two relatively small  		samples narrowly defined, which may not be representative of the disabled  		elderly population at-large. Nevertheless, the study represents a solid first  		step in examining an area in which so little has been done and so much more is  		needed.</p>
<p>Future research on this topic should focus on the following items:  		Better data sharing agreements with the Veterans Administration, which allow  		the sharing of critical information such as the amount and type of cash  		allowance, and a larger, more nationally-representative sample, should be key  		components of a follow-up study. In addition, the important issue of  		administrative costs should be examined in detail. If resources permit, the  		selection and collection of original data on a new comparison group should be  		undertaken. Key variables which were missing in the LTC comparison group data  		set, including hours of care provided and the cost of in-kind services, could  		then be collected. Finally, alternative specifications of the three market  		equations should be estimated; different models of the interactions among the  		three sectors should be tested using simultaneous equations estimation  		techniques.</p>
<p><i><b>5.3.2 Conclusions</b></i></p>
<p>Cash allowances appear to be a viable policy option with regard to the  		provision of long-term care assistance to the disabled elderly in the general  		population, as is demonstrated by the success of the Veterans Administration  		Housebound and Aid and Attendance Allowance Program. This mechanism could be  		incorporated into the Supplemental Security Income program, an approach similar  		to that used in the Colorado Home Care Allowance Program. It also could be  		offered as an option under the Section 2176 community care waivers, or perhaps  		under other government programs such as Medicare.</p>
<p>This study suggests that cash disability allowances are cost-effective  		mechanisms for assisting chronically impaired persons. They do so in a way that  		provides maximum self-determination and does not have society assume more  		responsibility. They are an important element of the spectrum of long-term care  		policy instruments that is missing in our present (non-VA) system of social  		assistance. They exist throughout the world, and should be given serious  		consideration in the U.S. The Veterans Administration has the experience to  		provide needed guidance.</p>

<ol><li>
<p><b>Purpose</b>. The purpose of this circular is to create an  			 awareness among VSD (Veterans Services Division) employees of the importance of  			 A&amp;A (aid and attendance) or housebound benefits and to explain the use of  			 VA Form 27-8944, Instructions for Applying for Aid and Attendance or Housebound  			 Benefits (see <a href="#exhibitA">exhibit A</a>). This form will be distributed  			 in the near future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p>As our aging veteran population expands, it is anticipated that  				  the impact on services by DVB (Department of Veterans Benefits) and DM&amp;S  				  (Department of Medicine and Surgery) will be critical. Both Departments are  				  committed to ensuring that an appropriate level of benefits is provided within  				  the law to all eligible veterans and beneficiaries as efficiently as possible.  				  Veterans benefits personnel must be increasingly aware of the opportunities to  				  serve the aging population, a group exceedingly at risk in terms of medical  				  problems and socio-economic concerns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medical problems and aging generally mean a less mobile  				  population, more housebound situations, and greater use of our telephone  				  service system. Therefore, effective communication by telephone and followup  				  mail becomes increasingly important in dealing with this segment of our  				  clientele. It also means an increase in special care for these people; e.g.,  				  nursing homes, senior citizen homes and residences, personal care facilities,  				  and hospices. Thus, more third parties (families and social service  				  personnel, for instance) will be seeking help on behalf of elderly veterans and  				  their dependents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recent history shows insufficient supporting information being  				  submitted to rating boards to enable full processing of housebound and A&amp;A  				  claims. It is incumbent on VSD personnel to clarify instructions to claimants  				  so that complete claims are received and less followup required, thus assuring  				  timely claims processing and reduction of claimant frustration.</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p><b>Counseling and Outreach</b></p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p>There are many eligible veterans and dependents drawing too  				  little pension or none at all because they are unaware of A&amp;A and  				  housebound benefits. The do not understand income limitations, are not  				  encouraged to file, do not remember these benefits if medical circumstances  				  change, or do not know what type of medical evidence or information is needed  				  to support their claims. Inquiries from or on behalf of pensioners or potential  				  claimants give VSD employees an excellent opportunity to provide information on  				  these two most important benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Counselors should be particularly alert to the higher income  				  limitations provided by A&amp;A and housebound benefits. There are many older  				  persons who have previously applied for pensions and been denied because income  				  exceeded limits at that time. They may not be aware that changed circumstances  				  could now make them eligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The unusual medical expenses provision of the law  				  should be thoroughly explained to all persons to whom it may apply. VBCs  				  should encourage claimants to keep track of all unreimbursed medical expenses  				  including medical insurance costs and/or medicare.</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p><b>Instructions</b></p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p>VA Form 27-8944 has been developed to guide counselors in  				  interview situations and to assist claimants in submitting complete  				  applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a recipient of a protected pension inquires about A&amp;A  				  or housebound benefits, VA Form 27-8944 may be used to explain the steps,  				  involved in applying. VA Form 21-2680, Examination of Housebound Status or  				  Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance, may also be used as a guide to  				  the types of medical evidence required by the VA, although it should not be  				  sent to the claimant. Although the type of medical evidence required is  				  critical to the A&amp;A and housebound claim, the claimant should be made to  				  understand that he/she does not have to incur the cost of a physical exam from  				  his/her private doctor or hospital. The VA can arrange for an examination at  				  one of its facilities if the information required is not readily  				  available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blocks applicable to the specific case should be checked and the  				  form mailed to the claimant with the appropriate forms and/or applications.  				  These include but are not limited to an income statement (VA Form 21-6897 for a  				  veteran or 21-4100 for a dependent) and a Statement in Support of Claim, VA  				  Form 21-4138, for election of benefits or any other supporting  				  statement.</p>

<p>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>NOTE: PLEASE READ VERY CAREFULLY</p>
<ol type="A"><li>
<p>DISABILITY COMPENSATION is paid for disability resulting from  			 service in the armed forces. An additional amount of compensation may be  			 payable for a spouse, child, and/or dependent parent when a veteran is entitled  			 to compensation based on disability(ies) evaluated as 30 percent or more  			 disabling. The additional benefit for a spouse is payable in a higher amount  			 when he/she is a patient in a nursing home or is so disabled as to require the  			 regular aid and attendance of another person.</p>
<p>DISABILITY PENSION is paid for permanent and total disability not  			 resulting from service in the armed forces. If the veteran is 65 years of age  			 or older and is not substantially gainfully employed, permanent and total  			 disability is presumed. Pension is paid only to veterans of wartime service,  			 or, of service on or after June 27, 1950 and prior to February 1, 1955, or,  			 during the period between August 5, 1964, and May 4, 1975. Additional amounts  			 of pension may be paid for a spouse and/or child(ren).</p>
<p>If you need information about the meaning of any question, contact  			 your nearest Veterans Administration Regional Office. If additional space is  			 needed for any item, use Item 40, Remarks, page 4 or number a  			 separate sheet of paper to correspond to the items you are answering and attach  			 the sheet to the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REPRESENTATION. You may be represented, without charge, by an  			 accredited representative of a veterans organization or other service  			 organization, recognized by the Administrator of Veterans Affairs, or you may  			 employ an attorney to assist you with your claim. Typical examples of counsel  			 who may be available include attorneys in private practice or legal aid  			 services. The services of a recognized attorney are subject to a maximum fee  			 limitation of $10, set forth in 38 U.S.C. 3404(C). If you desire  			 representation, let us know and we will send you the necessary forms. If you  			 have already designated a representative, no further action is required on your  			 part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HEARINGS You have the right to a personal hearing at any stage  			 of claims processing, either before or after a decision is made. This right may  			 be exercised with regard to an original claim, supplemental claim or with  			 regard to any subsequent action affecting your entitlement. All you need do is  			 inform the nearest VA office as to your desires, and we will arrange a time and  			 place for the hearing. You may bring witnesses if you desire and their  			 testimony will be entered in the record. The VA will furnish the hearing room,  			 provide hearing officials, and prepare the transcript of the proceedings. The  			 VA cannot pay any of your expenses in connection with the hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EVIDENCE - GENERAL If you have not previously filed claim,  			 furnish the separation forms you received from the armed forces. If you are a  			 pension applicant, 65 years of age or older, no medical evidence is necessary.  			 A statement from your doctor showing the extent of your disabilities should be  			 furnished with your application if you are under 65; if you are housebound or  			 if you require the aid and attendance of another person and are not a patient  			 in a nursing home. If you are a nursing home patient, you should furnish a  			 statement signed by an official of the nursing home showing the date of your  			 admission and patient status. Also, indicate in Item 40, Remarks,  			 that you are a nursing home patient and give the name and address of the  			 nursing home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REPORTING NET WORTH FOR PENSION FOR DISABILITY NOT RESULTING FROM  			 SERVICE NET WORTH - Pension cannot be paid if net worth is sizeable. Net worth  			 is the market value of all interest or rights in any kind of property except  			 ordinary personal effects necessary for daily living such as automobile,  			 clothing or furniture and the dwelling (single family unit) used as your  			 principal residence. Therefore, all other assets must be reported so that may  			 determine whether net worth prevents you from receiving pension  			 benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>INCOME LIMITS AND RATES OF PENSION. The rate of pension paid to a  			 veteran depends upon the amount of family income and the number of dependents,  			 according to a formula provided by law. Because benefit rates and income limits  			 are frequently changed, it is not feasible to keep such information current in  			 these instructions. Information regarding current income limitations and rates  			 of benefits may be obtained by contacting your nearest VA office.</p>
<ol><li>A higher rate of pension is payable to a veteran who is a patient  				in a nursing home or otherwise determined to be in need of regular aid and  				attendance or who is permanently housebound due to disability.</li>
<li>Pension rates are also increased for a veteran who served during  				the Mexican Border Period or World War I.</li>
</ol><p>IMPORANT</p>
<p>THRE ARE CERTAIN TYPES OF INCOME WHICH MAY BE EXCLUDED  			 IN DETERMINING THE INCOME COUNTABLE FOR VA PURPOSES. HOWEVER, YOU MUST REPORT  			 THE SOURCES AND AMOUNTS OF ALL INCOME BEFORE DEDUCTIONS FOR YOURSELF, SPOUSE,  			 AND DEPENDENT CHILDREN. WE WILL DETERMINE ANY AMOUNT WHICH DOES NOT COUNT.  			 INCLUDE ALL SEVERANCE PAY OR OTHER ACCRUED PAYMENTS OF ANY KIND OR FROM ANY  			 SOURCE. WHEN NO INCOME IS RECEIVED OR EXPECTED FROM A SPECIFIED SOURCE, WRITE  			 NONE IN THE APPROPRIATE BLOCK (ITEMS 36a THROUGH 39A). IF INCOME  			 FROM ANY SOURCE IS ANTICIPATED BUT THE AMOUNT IS NOT YET DETERMINED WRITE  			 UNKNOWN IN THE APPROPRIATE BLOCK. ATTACH SEPARATE SHEETS IF  			 ADDITIONAL SPACE IS NEEDED.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FAMILY UNUSUAL MEDICAL EXPENSES are amounts actually paid by you  			 during the calendar year for unusual medical expenses for which you are not  			 reimbursed by insurance or otherwise. You should report the total unreimbursed  			 amount you paid for medical expenses for yourself or for relatives you are  			 under an obligation to support. You may include premiums paid for health,  			 sickness or hospitalization insurance. In computing your income for pension  			 purposes, the VA will deduct the amount you paid for medical expenses if they  			 qualify for exclusion under the formula provided by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LAST ILLNESS AND BURIAL EXPENSES Your countable income may be  			 reduced by the amount of expenses of the last illness and burial of a spouse or  			 child paid by you at any time prior to the end of the year following the year  			 of death for which you were not reimbursed. Use Item 40, Remarks,  			 to report such expenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EDUCATIONAL OR VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION EXPENSES are amounts paid  			 for courses of education, including tuition, fees, and materials and may be  			 deducted from the respective incomes of a veteran and the earned income of a  			 child if the child is pursuing a course of postsecondary education or  			 vocational rehabilitation or training. If you or your school child(ren) paid  			 these expenses, report the total amounts paid, dated of payment, and state to  			 whom the expenses apply.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>IMPORANT: These instructions are numbered to correspond with the items  		on the application. If additional space is required, attach a separate sheet  		and identify your statements by their item numbers.</p>
<p>ITEMS 3A and 3B - The number entered in 3A, Veterans Social  		Security Number, should be your own social security number. In Item 3B enter  		your spouses social security number. These social security numbers are  		necessary for identification purposes.</p>
<p>ITEMS 14A and 14D inclusive - Retired Pay - A veteran may not receive  		full service retired pay and VA compensation at the same time. In the absence  		of a request to the contrary, filing of this application will constitute an  		election to receive VA compensation in lieu of the total amount of retired pay,  		or a waiver of that portion of retired pay equal in amount to the VA  		compensation. No special action will be required of you, as we will notify the  		retired pay division of your waiver if entitlement, to VA benefits is  		established. A claim should be filed regardless of whether you will elect to  		waive retired pay. Under existing law a military retiree must establish  		entitlement to VA compensation so that survivors may be entitled to certain VA  		death benefits.</p>
<p>ITEMS 15A and 15B - Disability Severance Pay - The full amount of  		disability severance pay received for the disability or disabilities for which  		VA compensation is payable will be recouped from that benefit.</p>
<p>ITEMS 16A and 16B - Lump Sum Readjustment Pay - Recoupment of 75 percent  		of readjustment pay you received will be made from any VA compensation  		payable.</p>
<p>ITEMS 17A to 21D inclusive - Marital Information - Complete information  		concerning all marriages entered into by either you or your spouse and the  		termination of such marriages must be furnished. Specific details as to the  		date, place and manner of dissolution of marriage must be included. If your  		spouse is also a veteran, include his/her VA file number (if known) in Item  		17F.</p>
<p>ITEMS 31C and 32C - Months Worked - the time actually worked should be  		stated. For example: If you worked full time for 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 months, you  		should so state. If you did not work full time each month you should state the  		months or parts of months you actually worked. For example: 2 months, 1 week, 2  		days.</p>
<p>ITEM 33A - Include market value of stocks, checking accounts, bank  		deposits, savings accounts and cash. If such assets are held jointly by you and  		your spouse, one half of the total value of these holdings should be reported  		for each of you.</p>
<p>ITEM 33B - Do not include the value of the single dwelling unit or that  		portion of real property used solely as your principal residence. On all other  		real estate reduce the market value by amount of the indebtedness thereon and  		further report only one-half of the net value when the real estate is held  		jointly between husband and wife.</p>
<p>ITEM 33C - Report the total market value of your rights and interest in  		all other property not included in Items 33A and 33B. Do not include value of  		ordinary personal effects necessary for your daily living such as an  		automobile, clothing and furniture. Include gifts, bequests and inheritances of  		all property other than cash.</p>
<p>ITEM 33D - Report all debts except mortgage(s) on real estate.</p>
<p>ITEM 33E - Report the total of Items 33A through 33C less 33D. This  		should be you NET WORTH.</p>
<p>ITEMS 34A to 35E - If you or your spouse have applied for social  		security, unemployment or workmens compensation or any disability  		benefit, show the expected payment in the appropriate column. If the amount or  		date of payment is not yet determined, enter the word unknown.</p>
<p>ITEMS 36, 37 and 38 inclusive - You should report under these items your  		expected total income for the periods covered. You must report total income of  		yourself and your dependents from all sources. When reporting income, report  		the total amount to which you are entitled before any deductions, not the  		amount you actually receive. Include as income all amounts received or expected  		as severance pay or accrued payments of any kind or from any source. If you and  		your spouse receive income from dividends, interest, rents, investments or  		operation of a business, profession or farm, which you own jointly, report  		one-half of the income as yours and one-half as your spouses. Report  		Social Security Benefits (Green Check) on Line B, and Supplemental Security  		Income (SSI) benefits (Gold Check) on Line E.</p>
<p>ITEMS 39A and 39B - You should report under these items the total amount  		of your final pay at termination of employment, not the amount you actually  		received, and the date you received this pay.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you furnish a copy of your latest award letter from Social  		Security stating the type and gross amount of your benefit, it will help us in  		our initial determination of the amount of VA benefits to be paid.</p>

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING INCOME STATEMENT</h3>
<p>READ VERY CAREFULLY, DETACH, AND RETAIN THIS SHEET FOR  		YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE. ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS FULLY OR ACTION ON YOUR CLAIM MAY  		BE DELAYED.</p>
<ol type="A"><li>
<p>PRIVACY ACT INFORMATION - No benefits may be paid under this program  			 unless this form is completed and returned as required by existing law (38  			 U.S.C. 506). The information requested by this form is considered relevant and  			 necessary to determine the maximum benefits to which you are entitled. The  			 information submitted may be disclosed outside the Veterans Administration only  			 as permitted by law. Disclosure of Social Security number(s) of those for whom  			 benefits are claimed is requested under the authority of Title 38, U.S.C. and  			 is mandatory as a condition to receipt of pension (38 CFR 1.575). Social  			 Security numbers will be used in the administration of veterans benefits in the  			 identification of veterans or persons claiming or receiving Veterans  			 Administration benefits and their records, and may be used to verify Social  			 Security entitlement (including amounts payable) with the Social Security  			 Administration and, for other purposes where authorized by both Title 38,  			 U.S.C. and the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or, where required by  			 another statute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CUSTODIANS AND GUARDIANS - If you are making this statement as a  			 Custodian or Guardian of a veteran who is incompetent or incapable of acting in  			 his/her own behalf, furnish information applying to the veteran and his/her  			 spouse, not yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RETIREMENT AND/OR ANNUITY BENEFITS (PART I) - Check the type (Item  			 6) of any retirement or annuity benefits you or your spouse receive or expect  			 to receive during this or the next calendar year. Enter the  			 <b><i>annual</i></b> amounts in Part II. In Item 8 report the  			 <b><i>monthly</i></b> amount of any retirement or disability social security  			 (green check) or railroad retirement benefits you or your spouse  			 receive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ANNUAL INCOME (PART II) - The total amount of all income received  			 and expected should be reported for all persons for whom benefits are claimed.  			 Include as income all amounts received and/or expected as severance pay or  			 other accrued payment of any find, or of any source. If income from two or more  			 sources should be reported on the same line, list each amount separately and  			 clearly indicate the source on a separate sheet of paper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JOINT INCOME - If you and your spouse receive income from dividends,  			 interest, rents, investments or operation of a business, profession or farm,  			 which you own jointly, report one-half of the income as yours and one-half as  			 your spouses income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NET WORTH (PART III) - Net worth is the market value of all interest  			 or rights in any kind of property other than the ordinary personal effects  			 necessary for daily living (such as an automobile, clothing, or furniture and  			 the dwelling (single family unit) used as a principal residence). If you and  			 your spouse own any such other property jointly, one-half of the market value  			 of these holdings should be reported for each of you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PROMPT NOTICE: Notify us immediately if there is <b>any</b> change  			 in the income or net worth for you or for those for whom you receive benefits,  			 and of any change in your marital or dependency status (Resulting changes in  			 rates of benefits may be effective immediately. In some cases an overpayment  			 may result which is subject to recovery.)</p>

<p>May we introduce you to Project Hope.</p>
<p>Recently, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded a grant to  		the Center for Health Affairs to Project Hope. They will conduct a study of  		what has been termed constant attendance allowances. The VAs  		two separate allowances called housebound and aid and attendance are the only  		known public programs in the United States which fit the definition of  		constant attendance allowances. The additional monies we might pay  		are for those whose disabilities may keep them essentially confined to their  		household or for those who need the rather constant care of other persons.</p>
<p>Through the results of this study, the VA as well as other public or  		private agencies will better understand the existing programs and will be able  		to develop future policies which support persons who are severely disabled and  		may have limited income. We at the VA are cooperating fully with Project Hope  		and wholeheartedly endorse the study.</p>
<p>As a part of the study, representatives of Project Hope wish to visit  		with some of the people who are currently receiving housebound or aid and  		attendance benefits as a part of their nonservice-connected disability pension  		or survivors pension. You are one of the persons they may wish to  		visit.</p>
<p>Your participation is strictly voluntary and will not affect in any way  		the benefits you receive. All information relating to income, personal care,  		etc. will be kept in strict confidence. Project Hope representatives will  		clearly identify themselves, will limit the interview in the home as much as  		possible, and will use the information only to help all of us more fully  		understand the benefits and their use.</p>
<p>Will you please consider being a participant? Our understanding of the  		physical and financial needs of our beneficiaries will help us better structure  		future programs and benefits in such a way that they best serve the people they  		are designed to serve.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this letter and assisting in this important  		study.</p>

<p>Dear Friend:</p>
<p>Project HOPE was best known in the early 1960s for the S.S. HOPE, the  		worlds first peacetime hospital ship. Today, with the support of the  		Veterans Administration (VA), the Project HOPE Center for Health Affairs is  		working to find ways to better meet the needs of older Americans. An important  		part of our work is a study which will involve personal interviews with  		participants in the VA Housebound and Aid and Attendance Allowance Program as  		well as selected persons who provide care for these participants. We would  		greatly appreciate your cooperation by volunteering to be interviewed in your  		home for approximately one hour by a HOPE Center staff member. Your interview  		responses will be kept strictly confidential--the VA and other government  		agencies will <b>not</b> have access to information on any one person.</p>
<p>Participation in this study is strictly voluntary; however, your  		cooperation is very important because we need to interview a large number of  		veterans receiving either the Aid and Attendance or Housebound Allowance.  		Through your cooperation we will be able to help other older Americans by  		applying what we learn from this study to better meet their needs. Please fill  		out the enclosed response form and mail it back to Project HOPE by April 27,  		<b>1985</b>. Use the enclosed envelope for return; no stamp is needed. We  		greatly appreciate your cooperation.</p>
<p> Sincerely,</p>

<p><a name="note11" id="note11">As</a> for ADLs, the simple summing of IADLs does  			 not take into account the varying degree or severity of burden among the  			 different categories. The IADL sum is meant only to provide a rough estimate of  			 the relative degree of IADL impairment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note12" id="note12">As</a> mentioned in the methods section, unmet need  			 measurements were not identical for the two groups. For the VA group, the  			 question on unmet need not only asked what activities a persons needed (but did  			 not receive) assistance with (as was asked in the LTC Survey), but what  			 activities a person <b>wanted</b> assistance with. Therefore, it should be  			 noted that the two populations are being compared with an explicit  			 understanding of the limitations of this variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note13" id="note13">These</a> data were not collected on the LTC Survey  			 and no comparison between groups can be made.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note15" id="note15">As</a> noted in the analysis plan, a significant  			 percentage (67 percent) of the VA group did not know what type of allowance  			 they were receiving. Therefore, the usefulness of this data is  			 limited.</p>

<p><a name="note16" id="note16">See</a> analysis plan for details (e.g., data  			 sources, composition of group) on total VA population of non-service connected  			 pension beneficiaries who are receiving an AA or HB allowance.</p>
