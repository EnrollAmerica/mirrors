<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<h3>1. Purpose of the Study</h3>
<p>The Developmental Disabilities Act of 1984 required the Department of  		Health and Human Services (HHS) to submit a report to Congress on improving  		services to mentally retarded and other developmentally disabled (MR/DD)  		persons. That report, prepared by the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation (ASPE), Office of Social Services Policy, recommended the  		establishment of an intradepartmental Working Group to develop cost effective  		Federal policy options for enhancing independence, productivity, and community  		integration for MR/DD people.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to provide information to the Working Group  		on the impact of Federal programs and policies on state policies regarding  		community-based services (CBS) for MR/DD people. The objective of the  		investigation and analysis was to develop an understanding of the factors which  		influence state policy choices and the environment that is created for  		implementing Federal policies and programs at the state level. The study  		identifies those factors, especially those relevant to Federal policy, which  		either encourage or inhibit the development of services that promote autonomy  		and integration for MR/DD people and minimize inappropriate  		institutionalization.</p>
<h3>2. Methodology</h3>
<p>This report presents the results of an in-depth review of six state  		MR/DD service systems. To obtain an understanding of the elements which play a  		critical role in state policy, decisions regarding the degree of emphasis to be  		placed on CBS, it was decided to focus on the two ends of the CBS "continuum."  		Colorado, Michigan, and Nebraska (hereafter referred to as high-CBS emphasis  		states) were selected as states which have developed extensive CBS systems.  		Illinois, Texas, and Virginia (low-CBS emphasis states) provide the  		perspectives of states which continue to rely heavily on institutional  		services. Factors used to classify states in relation to their relative  		emphasis on CBS included: the distribution of expenditures between CBS and  		large public residential facilities (PRFs); the population in PRFs and small  		(15 beds or less) community residential facilities (CRFs); and trends in the  		reduction of the population in PRFs. State characteristics, such as population  		size and geographic location, also were considered in the state selection  		process.</p>
<p>Data collection and analysis emphasized discussions with key policy  		makers and program operators in each of the six states, as well as a review of  		relevant documents and reports supplied by the state informants. A profile of  		each state system was developed to serve as the primary instrument of analysis  		for a cross-state comparison.</p>
<h3>3. Major Determinants of State Policies</h3>
<p>The analysis of state MR/DD service systems reveals that state policy  		decisions and the state's overall emphasis on CBS are the results of the  		interaction between a complex array of factors specific to individual state's  		political and MR/DD service systems and the requirements and incentives imposed  		by Federal programs and policies. Although Federal policy is not the primary  		influence on state policy decisions, it does play a fundamental role in the  		financing and delivery of MR/DD services on the state level.</p>
<p>Colorado, Nebraska, and Michigan demonstrate a strong philosophical  		commitment to CBS, and have translated that philosophy into concrete policy.  		Michigan's orientation toward CBS reflects, in part, a traditionally strong  		commitment to human services. Advocates for CBS in Nebraska and Colorado were  		able to articulate the importance of CBS in terms of their states' conservative  		political values which emphasize individualism, independence, and local  		control. The high level of philosophical commitment in these three states  		created an environment conducive to CBS development. The three high-CBS  		emphasis states also benefited from the presence of strong, well-organized  		advocacy for community services. Several respondents in the low-CBS emphasis  		states cited the lack of effective advocacy as barrier to the development of  		CBS.</p>
<p>Although a political commitment to CBS and the presence of able and  		dedicated individuals are essential to the development of CBS, these factors  		are not sufficient for such development. A variety of other internal and  		external factors also appear to influence whether and how CBS develops in a  		particular state. For example, although community-level service delivery  		systems and a high degree of community involvement appear to be crucial to CBS  		implementation, their presence does not guarantee CBS development.</p>
<p>The health of a state's economy also is an important factor affecting  		state support for MR/DD services, especially in the Initial stages of the move  		toward an emphasis on CBS. Respondents in two of the three high-CBS states  		reported that the major expansion of CBS coincided with periods of economic  		prosperity in the state. Economic difficulties can have one of two effects on  		CBS development: scarcity of resources may encourage a state to consider less  		costly alternatives to institutional care; and, conversely, a shortage of funds  		may prevent a state from developing new services. Financial issues are a major  		concern, especially for the low-CBS-emphasis states which are struggling with  		pressures to expand CBS while maintaining service quality in large PRFs.</p>
<p>Federal policy has been critical to the development of CBS, but factors  		internal to individual states shape the nature and degree of Federal influence.  		For example, the ability to use Federal funds to finance CBS was an enabling  		factor for the three high CBS states--the availability of Title XIX funds and  		the Title XX Social Services Block Grant made CBS development possible.  		However, faced with the same alternatives, other states chose to continue to  		rely on institutional services. States' responses to the original Medicaid  		Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded (ICF-MR) regulations  		illustrate another aspect of Federal influence: in two of the three high-CBS  		states, the regulations were explicitly cited as an additional impetus for the  		depopulation of PRFs; in the three low-CBS states, the investments in PRFs  		associated with complying to Federal standards are seen as an important barrier  		to CBS development.</p>
<h3>4. Implications for Federal Policy</h3>
<p>State perspectives on the impact of Federal policy focused on: the  		limited availability of funding; the relative inflexibility of federally funded  		programs; ambiguities and inconsistencies across the myriad of Federal programs  		serving the MR/DD population; and the perceived absence of clear and consistent  		policy and leadership on the Federal level. In general, state respondents were  		likely to describe Federal policies and programs, with the exception of the  		Home and Community Based Care waiver, as barriers to the development of  		individualized, integrated, nonmedical service models. This tendency is  		partially due to the heavy dependence among five of the six states examined on  		the ICF-MR program and other Medicaid funding to finance MR/DD services.  		Respondents in all of the states supported CBS objectives, such as increasing  		independence and productivity for MR/DD people, but felt that overall Federal  		policy and programs (especially ICF-MR) are oriented toward facility-based,  		medical/institutional models.</p>
<p>State responses to specific Federal policy changes are difficult to  		predict. However, several themes emerge from respondents' perceptions of  		current Federal programs and suggestions for future policy changes:</p>
<ul><li>States would be receptive to changes which would increase their  		  flexibility to use Federal dollars for CBS, but would be reluctant to accept  		  reduced Federal financial participation (FFP) in exchange for increased  		  flexibility.</li>
<li>A combination of the various Federal-funding streams would probably  		  be attractive to states, although interagency turf battles at the state level  		  might develop.</li>
<li>Some type of preferential funding for CBS would probably be favorably  		  received if such changes incorporate incentives for future expansion of CBS  		  rather than penalties for choices made in the past.</li>
</ul><p>The potential for Federal policy to encourage a greater emphasis on CBS,  		as well as the development of service models which facilitate community  		integration and independence for MR/DD individuals, is significant. State  		respondents repeatedly stressed the need for a clear, unequivocal Federal  		commitment to CBS, accompanied by programmatic guidelines and funding  		mechanisms which are consistent with that philosophical commitment.</p>
<p>Federal policy changes can perhaps make the greatest impact in states  		such as Virginia, Illinois, and Texas. These states want to expand CBS and have  		already begun to do so, but the size of their institutional populations and  		their relative lack of CBS experience will hinder expansion efforts. Federal  		involvement in technical assistance and service system development, in addition  		to financial assistance and strong leadership could be highly effective in  		increasing community service options for MR/DD people.</p>
<h2><a name="chapI" id="chapI">I. OVERVIEW OF STUDY</a></h2>
<p>The analysis of Federal and state policies affecting services to  		mentally retarded and other developmentally disabled (MR/DD) persons recently  		conducted by Macro Systems, Inc. (Macro), and its subcontractor, Systemetrics,  		was designed to assist the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation (ASPE) in chairing the Working Group on Policies Affecting MR/DD  		Persons. The background, objectives, and methodology of this study are  		described in this chapter.</p>
<h3>1. Background</h3>
<p>The Developmental Disabilities Act of 1984 called for a Report to  		Congress on Policies for Improving Services to Mentally Retarded and Other  		Developmentally Disabled Persons Under Title XIX of the Social Security Act.  		The Office of Social Services Policy, ASPE, prepared the report in consultation  		with other departmental agencies, including the Office of Human Development  		Services (HDS) and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), as well as  		two other Federal agencies: the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative  		Services, Department of Education, and the National Council on the Handicapped.  		The report was transmitted to Congress on January 21, 1986.</p>
<p>The report identified four goals for increasing the independence,  		integration, and productivity of this population: (1) increasing incentives for  		community living; (2) improving standards for the Medicare Intermediate Care  		Facilities for the Mentally Retarded (ICFs-MR); (3) meeting the needs of  		adults; and (4) improving coordination and cooperation. In an effort to address  		these goals, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said it would  		examine options which reduce incentives toward inappropriate  		institutionalization and provide states with greater flexibility to provide a  		continuum of services while establishing workable cost controls.</p>
<p>ASPE recommended the establishment of an intra-agency Working Group to  		conduct a systematic examination of policies related to mentally retarded and  		other developmentally disabled people and to develop cost-effective policy  		options. Areas to be addressed by this Working Group included the high cost of  		the ICF-MR program and its medical and institutional orientation; the shift to  		smaller facilities and the use of Medicaid home and community-based service  		waivers; concern about health and safety and enforcement of standards;  		controversy over support for educational and vocational services; and various  		options for restructuring the financing of services.</p>
<p>The Secretary concurred with the recommendation and a Working Group,  		chaired by ASPE, was established. The Working Group is conducting a systematic  		examination of policies related to this population and is developing policy  		options for the Secretary. Specifically, the Working Group is considering  		cost-effective options which will enhance the productivity, independence, and  		integration of developmentally disabled people. Emphasis is being placed on  		policies which could enhance self-sufficiency and encourage access to community  		living arrangements.</p>
<h3>2. Study Objectives</h3>
<p>The overall goal of this study is to provide information to ASPE and the  		Working Group to assist them in the delineation and assessment of policy  		options being considered for recommendation to the Secretary. One component,  		conducted primarily by Systemetrics and reported in other documents, focused on  		the analysis of existing data on the impact of current Federal policy with  		respect to the major Federal programs financing services to the MR/DD  		population, in particular the Medicaid program. This component has attempted to  		provide the Working Group with an overview of the relationship between the  		structure of these financing programs, the manner in which services are  		delivered, and how much they cost, as well as an analysis of programmatic and  		cost implications of alternative financing and delivery systems.</p>
<p>The component conducted by Macro focused on state perspectives regarding  		organizational, political, regulatory, and other factors which encourage or  		inhibit community-based services (CBS) for MR/DD individuals. State perceptions  		about the influence of Federal policy on state development of CBS received  		particular attention. The study was not limited to a review of Federal policy  		influence, however, but rather was designed to gain a better understanding of  		the bases for states' MR/DD policy decisions and the context in which Federal  		programs and policies operate. The analysis of state perspectives is being  		provided to ASPE and the Working Group to assist them in their assessment of  		proposed policy options, including the projected impact on state policies in  		further development of CBS for MR/DD people, especially services that meet  		Federal policy goals of promoting the population's independence, integration,  		and productivity.</p>
<p>The analysis of state perspectives is summarized in this report.  		Detailed information on the six states visited in developing this analysis is  		presented in the <a href="stapersp.htm#appendA">Appendix</a> volume which accompanies this  		report.</p>
<h3>3. The Approach</h3>
<p>The approach to our analysis of state perspectives entailed four  		components:</p>
<ul><li>Review of national trends in state MR/DD systems</li>
<li>Consultation with knowledgeable individuals</li>
<li>Selection of six states for in-depth review</li>
<li>Plan for data collection and analysis</li>
</ul><p>Our activities in these areas are highlighted in this section. </p>
<p>(1) <b>Review Of National Trends</b></p>
<p>Literature with information on state MR/DD systems was reviewed to  		identify national trends in such key areas as expenditures for MR/DD services;  		use of the ICF-MR Program; use of the Medicaid Home and Community-Based Care  		(HCB) Waiver; and overall community service configurations. Three sources were  		particularly helpful:</p>
<ul><li><b>An Analysis of Medicaid's Intermediate Care Facility for the  		  Mentally Retarded (ICF-MR) Program</b> (Lakin, et al., 1985)</li>
<li><b>Persons with Mental Retardation in State-Operated Residential  		  Facilities: Years Ending June 30, 1984 and June 30, 1985 with Longitudinal  		  Trends from 1950 to 1985</b> (Lakin, et al., 1986)</li>
<li><b>Public Expenditures for Mental Retardation and Developmental  		  Disabilities in the United States: State Profiles (Second Edition)</b>  		  (Braddock, et al., 1986)</li>
</ul><p>A copy of our general bibliography may be found in the  		<a href="stapersp.htm#appendC">Appendix</a>. Additional information was obtained from  		review of such "fugitive" literature as technical assistance reports of the  		National Association of State Mental Retardation Program Directors and an  		informal survey on state use of the ICF-MR program, which included the  		following: public and private sponsorship; numbers of clients and numbers of  		facilities with more than 15 beds vs. 15 beds or less; and projected reaction  		to the proposed Community and Family Living Amendments (CFLA), then being  		considered by the 99th Congress.</p>
<p>(2) <b>Consultation With Knowledgeable Individuals</b></p>
<p>Early in the study, we consulted with several knowledgeable individuals  		to obtain guidance in the development of the plan for data collection and  		analysis. In addition to the ASPE Work Group and fellow investigators Brian  		Burwell (Systemetrics) and Charlie Lakin (University of Minnesota), we  		consulted with representatives of major interest groups, including the National  		Association of State Developmental Disability Councils, the National  		Association of State Mental Retardation Program Directors, the National  		Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, the American Public  		Welfare Association/State Medicaid Directors, and the National Association of  		Private Residential Facilities for the Mentally Retarded. We also consulted  		with Federal officials knowledgeable about state programs and the states'  		response to Federal policies, in particular representatives of the  		Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) and HC FA.</p>
<p>The discussions with knowledgeable individuals focused on four  		areas:</p>
<ul><li>Data sources for national trends and state-specific information</li>
<li>Criteria for selecting the six states for in-depth review</li>
<li>Suggested states</li>
<li>Data collection strategies</li>
</ul><p>Their guidance was of considerable value in the development of  		recommendations on states to be visited and the plan for data collection and  		analysis. The prior consultation with some of the national organization  		representatives also may have been helpful in gaining access to some of the key  		informants at the state level.</p>
<p>(3) <b>State Selection</b></p>
<p>The approach to analysis of state perspectives included in-depth review  		of MR/DD systems in six states and the influences on CBS development. To focus  		more sharply on the understanding of state choices in CBS development, it was  		decided to divide the reviews evenly between states with extensive CBS emphasis  		and states which continued to rely more on services in large institutions and  		had relatively little CBS emphasis. Factors used to identify states in relation  		to their emphasis on CBS included: proportionate expenditures for CBS vs.  		(usually large) public residential facilities (PRFs); trends in reduction in  		PRF population; and relative numbers of small (15 beds or less) community  		residential facilities (CRFs).</p>
<p>Although CBS emphasis was the primary selection criterion, a variety of  		additional factors were considered as follows:</p>
<ul><li><b>Population</b>--A range in total size of state population was  		  considered; however, states with extremely large and extremely low populations  		  were avoided.</li>
<li><b>Geographic Region</b>--A mix in geographic regions of the United  		  States was sought.</li>
<li><b>Use Of The HCB Waiver</b>--Both waiver and nonwaiver states were  		  included.</li>
<li><b>MR/DD State Authority</b>--A mix in state approaches to  		  administration of its MR/DD system was sought, in particular the use of  		  substate MR/DD authorities vs. a centralized system.</li>
</ul><p>The study team's knowledge of current trends in state MR/DD systems and  		observations from knowledgeable individuals were used to assess ways in which  		states under consideration were representative of the overall nationwide mix.  		The six states selected in consultation with ASPE as a result of this  		assessment were:</p>
<ul><li><b>High CBS Emphasis</b>: Colorado, Michigan, and Nebraska</li>
<li><b>Low CBS Emphasis</b>: Illinois, Texas, and Virginia</li>
</ul><p>It should be emphasized that these designations are relative; i.e., this  		is not to say that Illinois, Texas, and Virginia are without CBS for their  		MR/DD citizens or that they are not moving to place more emphasis on CBS. As  		described in the following chapter, it is clear that these three states are  		actively pursuing strategies to develop an expanded community service system.  		Relatively speaking, however, they currently rely more extensively on large  		congregate institutions for MR/DD care than do Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska,  		and other strong CBS emphasis states.</p>
<p>(4) <b>The Plan For Data Collection And Analysis</b></p>
<p>The plan for data collection was to gain understanding of state MR/DD  		system influences and state perspectives on Federal MR/DD policy through review  		of descriptive reports and documents, for example, state MR/DD budgets, and  		discussions with key informants. The informants included people in the  		following positions, or their designees, as appropriate to the individual  		states:</p>
<ul><li>MR/DD state agency director</li>
<li>State mental health (MH) agency director where MR/DD is part of  		  combined MH/MR department</li>
<li>Director of special education services</li>
<li>Director of state Medicaid agency or coordinator of Medicaid  		  long-term care program</li>
<li>Director of vocational rehabilitation services and/or supported  		  employment program</li>
<li>Director of the state Developmental Disabilities Council</li>
<li>Director of the state DD Protection and Advocacy agency</li>
<li>Representative(s) of the substate MR/DD authorities</li>
<li>Director of the state Association for Retarded Citizens</li>
<li>Director of the association of parents and other advocates for the  		  maintenance of PRFs</li>
<li>Representative(s) of the private providers</li>
</ul><p>The study team's discussions with the informants were generally held  		person-to-person, as planned; telephone consultation was used for followup and  		to talk with those we were unable to meet with during our site visit. We also  		were fortunate in having Peg Porter, the ASPE delivery order officer, accompany  		us on two of the six visits.</p>
<p>The discussions were tailored to reflect the individuals'  		responsibilities in the state's MR/DD system. To obtain perspectives on the  		overall influences, however, and the degree of consensus on Federal policy  		perspectives, we attempted to cover the following topics with virtually all  		informants:</p>
<ul><li>Characterization of the state's degree of emphasis on community-based  		  vs. state institution services</li>
<li>Operational definition of community-based services</li>
<li>Range of state-supported services available in the community, both  		  residential and nonresidential (e.g., case management and off-site habilitation  		  programs)</li>
<li>Service administration responsibilities, including relevant  		  interagency agreements</li>
<li>Characteristics of MR/DD clients participating in CBS, and any  		  significant differences between the CBS and PRF client populations</li>
<li>Gaps in the CBS system</li>
<li>Financing mechanisms for CBS, including use (if any) of the Medicaid  		  HCB waiver and service development funding</li>
<li>Financing of state PRFs and other system costs</li>
<li>Major influences on MR/DD expenditures</li>
<li>Cost controls on CBS programs</li>
<li>Quality assurance mechanisms affecting CBS</li>
<li>Factors which have contributed to the expansion of CBS; barriers to  		  CBS development and how they might be overcome</li>
<li>Short- and long-term goals for CBS and factors affecting their  		  implementation</li>
<li>Federal policy changes that would assist the state in achieving these  		  objectives</li>
</ul><p>The key informants who provided information on these topics in each  		state are listed as part of the state profiles found in the separate  		<a href="stapersp.htm#appendA">Appendix</a>, as well as the state-specific documents used.  		The full text of the discussion guide also is included in the  		<a href="stapersp.htm#appendD">Appendix</a>.</p>
<p>Information from the key informants and the documents provided by the  		informants were used to prepare a profile of each state's MR/DD system and a  		synthesis of perspectives on Federal policy and other influences on the state's  		development of community services for MR/DD individuals. The draft profile was  		sent to each key informant in the respective state for review and comment.  		Their clarifications, and, in some cases, additional information, are reflected  		in the state profiles found in the Appendix and in the discussion of state  		perspectives in this report.</p>
<p><b>The Plan For Analysis</b></p>
<p>The approach to our analysis of state perspectives focused on the need  		to provide information to ASPE and the Working Group that would be useful in  		the development and assessment of cost-effective policy options. The four major  		areas selected for analysis are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Characteristics which differentiate high-CBS from low-CBS states</li>
<li>Major influences on state CBS emphasis/how CBS has developed</li>
<li>Influence of Federal policies on CBS development to date </li>
<li>Probable state responses to the kinds of changes in Federal MR/DD  		  policy being discussed by the Working Group</li>
</ul><p>The influence of Federal Medicaid policies--policies either real or  		perceived--was, understandably, a major focus, along with the potential  		response to changes in the Medicaid program, given its dominance in financing  		MR/DD services. Perspectives on other Federal programs were included. However,  		less information was generally available to the study team on programs other  		than Medicaid, especially those that are generally administered at the local  		level (e.g., use of HUD 202/Section 8 funds in combination with client (SSI)  		payments).</p>
<p>The descriptions of the policy options being developed by the Working  		Group include coverage of five areas: (1) organization and administration; (2)  		client eligibility implications; (3) service array and delivery systems; (4)  		the financing approach, including potential cost-sharing; and (5) quality  		assurance strategies. Our analysis of possible state reactions to changes in  		Federal policy is designed to address these same areas, as well as an  		assessment of the likely effect on states' overall movement toward the goal of  		enhanced productivity, independence, and community integration of MR/DD  		individuals.</p>
<h2><a name="chapII" id="chapII">II. SUMMARY OF STATE PROFILES</a></h2>
<p>The six states selected for the study exhibit significant variation with  		regard to the degree of emphasis on CBS, the range of services provided at the  		community level, the structure for service delivery, and the financing of CBS.  		<a href="stapersp.htm#exhibitII1">Exhibit II-1</a>, following this page, illustrates  		several features which describe the states' service systems:</p>
<ul><li>Size of the MR/DD population residing in various living arrangements  		  (e.g., PRFs, small CRFs, etc.)</li>
<li>Definition of CBS</li>
<li>Use of the ICF-MR program to finance CBS</li>
<li>Use of the Section 2176 HCB Waiver and other Title XIX options</li>
<li>Activity in supported employment and family support services</li>
<li>Existence of a community-level MR/DD authority</li>
<li>Extent of private sector involvement</li>
</ul><p>These features are discussed throughout this chapter in relation to  		current MR/DD service systems, influences on the development of current  		systems, and goals for future CBS development.</p>
<h3>1. How High-Low CBS-Emphasis States Differ</h3>
<p>The three high-CBS emphasis states appear to share at least the  		following characteristics:</p>
<ul><li>A strong philosophical commitment to CBS, with an emphasis on maximum  		  integration and independence for the MR/DD individual</li>
<li>Broad-based support for the expansion of CBS</li>
<li>Extensive CBS already developed</li>
<li>Investment in CBS and depopulation of PRFs rather than major capital  		  investments in PRF improvements</li>
</ul><p>The low-CBS emphasis states generally illustrated the converse of these  		characteristics, as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Lack of coherent support for CBS</li>
<li>Considerable investment in PRFs</li>
<li>Strong and organized support for congregate care</li>
<li>Relatively few CBS alternatives</li>
</ul><p>Despite the presence of a community service network in two of the three  		low CBS states--both Texas and Virginia have a statewide system providing  		services at the local level--their <b>relative</b> degree of CBS development  		and emphasis on CBS vs. large congregate care facilities is noticeably less  		than that found in the high-CBS emphasis states.</p>

<li><b>Litigation</b>--Litigation apparently is not necessarily  		  associated with strong CBS development.

It  		  seems more likely that the <b>absence</b> of litigation reflects the lack of  		  strong advocacy for deinstitutionalization and CBS development, as in Illinois  		  and Virginia.</li>
<li><b>Use of the ICF-MR program</b>--As can be seen in the exhibit on  		  state MR/DD system characteristics, there are different patterns across the six  		  states. (For example, Nebraska has not used the ICF-MR program for small CRFs  		  at all, while Michigan has used it extensively.) In general, however, the  		  low-CBS states use the ICF-MR program for <b>larger</b> facilities and place  		  more <b>overall reliance</b> on the ICF-MR program than the high-CBS  		  states.</li>
<li><b>Use of the HCB waiver</b>--Involvement in the HCB Waiver  		  opportunities is not necessarily correlated with high interest in CBS. The  		  waiver has not been used by Michigan and Nebraska, and has been used by  		  Illinois and Texas.</li>
</ul><p>Examples of specific state characteristics are highlighted in the  		following section. </p>
<h3>2. State Characteristics</h3>
<p>(1) <b>MR/DD System Administration</b></p>
<p>The lead agency in each state's MR/DD system is considered to be the  		state MR/DD agency. In none of the six states is this agency a cabinet-level  		department. In four states, the MR/DD authority is part of a department  		encompassing mental health and mental retardation, with MR/DD programs  		administered by a separate entity within the department; in Colorado and  		Nebraska, the MR/DD program agency is located within a department of  		institutions. These configurations are typical of states nationwide.</p>
<p>The six states are similar to each other and to other states in the  		complex division of responsibility among various state and substate agencies  		for various components of the MR/DD system. For example, the Virginia system  		includes the following major actors:</p>
<ul><li><b>Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation (DMHMR)</b>
<ul><li>Administration of the PRFs </li>
<li>Planning, policy-setting, and budget development</li>
<li>Funding and performance agreements with 40 local Community  				Services Boards (CSBs)</li>
<li>Payment of non-Federal share of ICF-MR costs from its budget</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Community Service Boards</b>
<ul><li>Provide six core services (emergency case, in- and outpatient  				services, residential care, day support, and prevention/intervention) to  				mentally ill, MR/DD, and substance abusing individuals</li>
<li>Provide minimum of 10 percent of program costs (primarily done  				through contributions of county and other local governments from local tax  				dollars)</li>
<li>Plan and design services to be operated directly or contracted  				Quality assurance</li>
<li>Other services/functions as locally determined</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Department of Medical Assistance and Services (State Medicaid  		  Agency)</b>
<ul><li>Administration of the ICF-MR program</li>
<li>Monitoring of the ICF-IMR program, including annual inspection of  				care and utilization review for each resident in each facility</li>
<li>Authority to decertify individual clients and deny payment for  				services</li>
<li>Training and technical assistance for DMHMR personnel and ICFMR  				operators</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Department of Health</b>--Licenses and inspects the ICFs-MR</li>
<li><b>Department of Education and Local School Districts</b>
<ul><li>Operates special education programs for DD children ages 2-21  				years</li>
<li>Developing new initiative for transition from special education  				to vocational programs</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Department of Rehabilitative Services</b>
<ul><li>Administers traditional vocational rehabilitation services  				program, including services to some MR/DD individuals</li>
<li>Collaborating with DMHMR and a state university to demonstrate  				supported employment (an Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation  				Services (OSERS) grant)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Virginia Council on Development Disabilities</b>
<ul><li>Prepares state plan for services to the DD population, Federal DD  				definition</li>
<li>Stimulates development of program strategies</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Department for Rights of the Disabled</b>
<ul><li>Designated DD Protection and Advocacy agency</li>
<li>Also advocates for needs of disabled citizens who do not meet  				Federal DD definition (e.g., people becoming disabled after age 22) </li>
<li>Administrative agency where the Council on Developmental  				Disabilities is found</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>A chart illustrating the Virginia system follows this page as  		<a href="stapersp.htm#exhibitII2">Exhibit II-2</a>. At the state as well as the Federal  		level, it is clear that developing and maintaining a coherent community service  		system presents major challenges in philosophical and political leadership,  		blending disparate funding streams, and coordinating programs which cut across  		multiple authorities.</p>
<p><b>Decentralized Authority</b></p>
<p>Further contributing to the complexity is the role of substate MR/DD  		authorities in all of the states visited except for Illinois. The  		responsibilities for these local authorities are generally similar to those  		described above for the CSBs in Virginia. With the exception of Colorado's  		Community Centered Boards (CCBs), local authorities which are independent  		private 501C3 corporations, the substate authorities are related in varying  		degrees to local governments, usually counties. Members of the governing boards  		of local MR/DD authorities are usually appointed by county or other local  		government officials. In addition, local governments are frequently required to  		contribute to local program budgets.</p>

</tr></table><p>In all five states with local authorities, it was agreed that there is  		tremendous variety among areas as to the array of available services, program  		priorities, clients served, local financial support, and program quality, even  		when statewide guidelines are in place. State MR/DD agencies in both Colorado  		and Michigan are attempting to exercise more control over local authorities,  		primarily through fiscal measures. Respondents in Nebraska, Texas, and Virginia  		did not report significant challenges to local authority. In all five, however,  		it is apparent that the state's ability to influence CBS development is limited  		by the degree of autonomy available to the local MR/DD authorities responsible  		for CBS programs.</p>
<p><b>Mental Retardation vs. MR/DD</b></p>
<p>Throughout this report, we have referred to the MR/DD population and  		service system--i.e., services to people with mental retardation and/or other  		developmental disabilities, with diagnoses such as autism, cerebral palsy, and  		epilepsy. Based on the current Federal definition of developmental  		disabilities, the MR/DD population also includes children with a wide array of  		conditions affecting their development such as ventilator- and other  		technology-dependent children, and children who have experienced head or spinal  		cord trauma. The central concept of the Federal definition is that it is based  		on the person's <b>functional</b> level rather than on his or her  		<b>diagnosis</b>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The term "developmental disability," as defined in the Developmental  		  Disabilities Act (P.L.98-527), means a severe, chronic disability of a person  		  which--</p>
<ol type="A"><li>is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination  			 of mental and physical impairments;</li>
<li>is manifested before the person attains age 22;</li>
<li>is likely to continue indefinitely;</li>
<li>results in substantial functional imitations in three or more of  			 the following areas of major life activities:<br /><ol type="i"><li>self-care,</li>
<li>receptive and expressive language,</li>
<li>learning,</li>
<li>mobility,</li>
<li>self-direction,</li>
<li>capacity for independent living,</li>
<li>economic sufficiency; and</li>
</ol></li>
<li>reflects the person's need for a combination and sequence of  			 special, interdisciplinary, or generic care, treatment, or other services which  			 of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and  			 coordinated.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>With the exception of the federally-funded state DD Councils and state  		DD Protection and Advocacy Programs, however, few state agencies use the  		Federal DD definition for service eligibility; in fact, none of the six states  		visited used the Federal definition. In four of the six states--Michigan,  		Nebraska, Texas, and Virginia--the lead state agency is specifically the  		<b>mental retardation</b> authority, and its responsibility does not extend to  		other developmental disabilities. Similar limits are in place at the community  		level in those states as well, with services to people with other developmental  		disabilities the exception rather than the rule--at least for services  		administered by the local MR authority (i.e., services that are available to  		people with other developmental disabilities are generally provided through  		special education, crippled children's services, Medical Assistance, etc.).</p>
<p>The implication of limiting service eligibility to those who are  		mentally retarded is that people who have other developmental disabilities may  		receive a less comprehensive range of services.</p>
<p>Definitions used for determining ICF-MR eligibility also differ from  		both the Federal DD definition governing state DD planning and the Protection  		and Advocacy requirements. Still other definitions are used in classifying the  		special education population and in determining eligibility for vocational  		rehabilitation programs. The key difference between the state and Federal  		levels, however, appears to be that of MR vs. MR/DD, as well as the common  		policy of states and local authorities to include in the service system mildly  		retarded people who would not necessarily meet the Federal DD definition,  		especially with its emphasis on severity. It also is our understanding that  		such differences between Federal and state population eligibility are commonly  		found throughout the MR/DD system.</p>
<p>(2) <b>Expenditures</b></p>
<p>The six states visited, like most states across the country, have  		increased their expenditures for MR/DD services and have increased the  		proportion of total MR/DD expenditures that support CBS as shown in  		<a href="stapersp.htm#exhibitII3">Exhibit II-3</a> and <a href="stapersp.htm#exhibitII4">Exhibit  		II-4</a>. Nationwide, public expenditures (adjusted for inflation) rose 46  		percent from 1977 to 1986, from $3.32 billion to $4.83 billion, not including  		local government funds. Expenditures for community services during this period  		rose 141 percent in constant dollars, while institutional expenditures rose  		only 14 percent. Although community expenditures in 1986 were still below 50  		percent of total MR/DD expenditures, this percentage rose from 25 percent to  		over 41 percent between 1977 and 1986, despite the major expansion of the  		ICF-MR program for services in PRFs.</p>

Although the three low states have increased CBS  		expenditures significantly from 1977-1986, as well as increasing the proportion  		of total MR/DD expenditures used to support community services, this proportion  		in all three was still below the national average of 41.4 percent: Illinois  		with 38.0 percent of expenditures going to CBS; Virginia - 21.5 percent, and  		Texas - 17.6 percent. In contrast, more than 50 percent of the public MR/DD  		expenditures in all three of the high-CBS emphasis states were for community  		services.</p>
<p>It should be noted that these totals generally do not include local  		government and other community-level expenditures as noted in Braddock (1986)  		from which these exhibits are adapted. (Such data are not routinely collected  		and reported by state MR/DD agencies.) Estimates from knowledgeable informants  		in Colorado were that CCBs, local governments, and other local funds provide 27  		percent of the: resources for community services. Extensive local support is  		not necessarily correlated with high-CBS emphasis. For example, counties and  		other local governments in Virginia provide a minimum of 10 percent and as much  		as 50 percent of local CSB budgets for MR and other community mental health  		services. County governments in Nebraska and Michigan also are responsible for  		a portion of the costs of services to county residents in PRFs, although this  		is not common throughout the nation. Concerns about any potential increases in  		local government contributions for MR/DD services were raised by several  		informants because of the recent loss of the General Revenue Sharing  		program.</p>

</tr></table><p><b>The ICF-MR Program</b></p>
<p>All six states participate in the ICF-MR program, as do nearly all  		states nationwide. The significant differences between the high- and low-CBS  		emphasis states are in their use of the ICF-MR program for medium and large  		(more than 15 beds) and small (15 beds or less) facilities, as illustrated in  		<a href="stapersp.htm#exhibitII6">Exhibit II-6</a>. Neither Colorado nor Nebraska uses the  		15-bed or less ICF-MR program because policymakers in these two states feel  		that the ICF-MR model, even in a small setting, is too institutional. Michigan  		has used the program extensively for its AISMR residences, but plans to convert  		many to non-ICF-MR residences under the HCB waiver program. Michigan's use of  		the Alternative Intermediate Services (AIS)-MR model has been targeted to  		seriously disabled MR individuals. The three low-CBS<i> </i>states have not  		used the small ICF-MR program extensively; unlike the Colorado and Nebraska  		examples, the relative lack of small ICFs-MR in Texas, Virginia, and Illinois  		does not reflect the development of non-ICF-MR community residences or  		philosophical opposition to the "medical" model. However, officials in these  		three states indicated that the 15-bed or less ICF-MR program will probably be  		the area of fastest growth in community residential programs in the immediate  		future.</p>

</tr></table><p>The use of the ICF-MR program for larger facilities also varies between  		the high- and low-CBS states, with placements averaging 36.6 per 100,000 in  		Colorado, Michigan, and Nebraska vs. an average of 64.5 per 100,000 in  		Illinois, Texas, and Virginia. The greater use of the ICF-MR program for large  		facilities in the low-CBS states also is reflected in the higher per 100,000  		population averages in the ICF-MR program overall, with an average of 43.3  		ICF-MR residents per 100,000 in the high-CBS states vs. 68.4 per 100,000  		average in the low-CBS states. It should be noted that these data do not  		include MR/DD people in non-ICF-MR Medicaid-certified nursing homes, a  		significant factor in states like Illinois where 3,000 such people have been  		identified.</p>
<p>(3) <b>Services</b></p>
<p>A comprehensive array of services to MR/DD individuals cuts across many  		agencies and responsibilities. The six states we visited, although varying  		considerably with each other and within the states themselves as to the degree  		of CBS development and availability, all included the following services.</p>
<ul><li><b>Residential</b>
<ul><li>Large congregate care institutions </li>
<li>Small-medium congregate care facilities </li>
<li>Small family-sized CRFs</li>
<li>Semi-independent living units (i.e., some supervision  				provided)</li>
<li>Mix of public and private ownership, and mix of for-profit and  				not-for-profit among the private providers</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Habilitation Programs</b>
<ul><li>As part of residential services (daytime, evening, or both)</li>
<li>Offsite day programs for people living in residential facilities  				or in their own homes</li>
<li>Prevocational programs (May be considered part of vocational or  				educational services)</li>
<li>Adult activity programs (May be considered part of vocational or  				educational services)</li>
<li>Offsite programs generally provided by public or private  				not-for-profit agencies</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Vocational Services</b>
<ul><li>Assessment and counseling (through state Vocational  				Rehabilitation (VR) services or MR/DD)</li>
<li>Vocational training (general preparation or specific) preparation  				for competitive employment</li>
<li>Sheltered employment--All but moderately/mildly disabled persons  				are still likely to be limited to sheltered workshops and work activity  				programs, even in more progressive states</li>
<li>Various models of supported employment</li>
<li>Mix of public and private not-for-profit providers, mostly  				private</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Education</b>
<ul><li>Special education services for various age ranges and with mixed  				levels of integration of more severely involved students</li>
<li>Relatively limited adult education</li>
<li>Widespread use of early intervention/infant stimulation in most  				states, either through education or local MR/DD service system</li>

</ul></li>
<li><b>Case Management</b>
<ul><li>Available to both families and individual clients</li>
<li>Generally a mandated service or nearly so</li>
<li>Usually the responsibility of the local MR/DD authority</li>

<li>State SSI supplement (40 states) </li>
<li>Advocacy</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>The tremendous growth in MR/DD services, especially at the community  		level, has been associated with families abilities to work with local and  		state officials to develop opportunities for MR/DD young people. In many cases,  		families initiated community programs to provide alternatives to placement in  		state institutions. Since most MR/DD individuals never were placed in state  		facilities, however, the real impact of CBS growth has been in the promotion of  		the development of each individual's potential for independence.</p>
<p><b>How Service Configurations Vary Among States</b></p>
<p>Services in the three high-CBS states are different from those found in  		the low-CBS states as follows:</p>
<table><tr><td scope="col"><font><b> Issue </b></font></td>
<td scope="col"><font><b> High CBS Emphasis (CO, MI, NE)  			 </b></font></td>
<td scope="col"><font><b> Low-CBS Emphasis (IL, TX, VA)  			 </b></font></td>

</tr><tr><td scope="row"><font>  			 Deinstitutionalization </font></td>
<td><font> Early commitment to  			 reduce PRF population </font></td>
<td><font> Relatively late in  			 efforts to reduce PRF population </font></td>
</tr></table><p>The emphasis on CBS in-service programs is illustrated by Colorado's  		plans to expand options that are considered even more likely to promote  		individual development than the present system. The community residential  		system serves approximately 2,000 people in a variety of settings: follow-along  		supervision, minimum and moderate supervision group homes, intensive  		developmental group homes, social/emotional group homes, and behavior  		management group homes. Under the HCB Waiver, Colorado is adding Personal Care  		Alternatives (PCAs) to this repertoire. The objective of the PCA program is to  		allow the DD individuals to establish a <b>home</b> in the community rather  		than having to move as they "progress" through a series of facilities. Three  		models are being used, with staffing and support varied to meet individual  		needs. The host home model employs a family to have a DD person live in their  		home. In the peer companion and independent apartment models, the client lives  		with a disabled or nondisabled person and receives the necessary degree of  		support services. The PCA program is available to clients with a wide range of  		disability levels, including the severely and multiply handicapped.  		Simultaneously, the state Division of Developmental Disabilities is working  		with other agencies and the local MR/DD authorities for significant expansion  		of supported employment programs. In contrast, the low-CBS states are still  		thinking primarily in terms of large (8-15 person) group homes as the way to  		meet CBS objectives, although Texas has implemented policies limiting ICF-MR  		development to six-bed facilities.</p>
<p>High-CBS states also differ from low-CBS states in their use of the  		Medicaid program for CBS overall; Nebraska has chosen not to use Medicaid for  		CBS, while Michigan has used It extensively to expand community services, and  		Colorado has used the waiver to maintain growth in its CBS. In contrast, the  		low-CBS states have primarily used the ICF-MR program, and have focused on  		funding larger congregate facilities as illustrated in <a href="stapersp.htm#exhibitII1">Exhibit II-1</a> above.</p>
<p>Other service system characteristics, however, are found to a varying  		degree among the six states regardless of CBS emphasis. All are placing  		increased emphasis on supports to families and supported employment  		initiatives. There also is no general correlation between CBS emphasis and  		private sector involvement, with the exception of the influence of large  		congregate care providers in the low-CBS states.</p>
<p><b>Major Service Caps</b></p>
<p>There also was considerable uniformity across the six states in their  		identification of gaps in the MR/DD service system. The major gaps mentioned  		include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Services for youth requiring special education, especially day  		  programs/supported employment</li>
<li>Services in rural areas</li>
<li>Services for more challenging clients (even where some are available,  		  more are needed)</li>
<li>Programs to enable technology-dependent children to remain in their  		  own homes (model waiver not sufficient to meet demand)</li>
<li>Age-appropriate programs for elderly DD people</li>
<li>In the four MR (i.e., not MR/DD) states; services for people with  		  other developmental disabilities</li>
</ul><p>The primary difference between high- and low-CBS states was that most  		informants in Illinois, Texas, and Virginia described <b>across-the-board</b>  		gaps in community services, as well as gaps in relation to particular  		population subgroups.</p>
<p>(4) <b>Quality Assurance</b></p>
<p>Responsibilities for quality assurance in the state MR/DD system are  		typically divided among several agencies, reflecting the diverse  		responsibilities for the administration of service programs. For example, in  		Texas, quality assurance responsibilities involve the following actors:</p>
<ul><li><b>Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation (TDMHMR)  		  </b>
<ul><li>Oversight of local community MH/MR program</li>
<li>Monitoring and quality assurance in the state schools and  				community programs</li>
<li>Monitoring of non-ICF-MR residential facilities</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Community Mental Health and Mental Retardation Centers</b>
<ul><li>Oversight of service provided at the local level based on  				performance contract with TDMHMR</li>
<li>Governance provided by Center Boards of Directors</li>
<li>Monitoring of individual client programs by case managers (also  				provided by case managers in state PRF outreach programs in areas without a  				center)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Department of Human Services</b>
<ul><li>Promulgating regulations for the ICF-MR program </li>
<li>Application of financial sanctions against ICF-MR providers</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Texas Department of Health</b>
<ul><li>Certification of state PRFs and licensing of all non-PRF  				ICFs-MR</li>
<li>Inspections of care for residents of PRFs/all ICFs-MR</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Texas Planning Council for Developmental Disabilities</b>--Service  		  Evaluation</li>
<li><b>Texas Rehabilitation Commission</b>
<ul><li>Oversight of vocational rehabilitation services</li>
<li>Quality controls in administration of the Supplemental Security  				Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) programs</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Texas Education Agency</b>--Oversight of special education  		  services provided by the Independent School Districts</li>
<li><b>Early Childhood Intervention Program</b>--Oversight is provided by  		  a parent representative and representatives from four state agencies: TDMHMR,  		  Department of Health, Texas Education Agency, and Department of Human  		  Services</li>
<li><b>Advocacy, Inc. (Designated DD Protection and Advocacy Agency)</b>
<ul><li>Legal and protective advocacy services for individuals</li>
<li>System advocacy</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Additional oversight is provided by the judicial system in ongoing  		monitoring of the implementation of the consent decree of the <b>Lelsz V.  		Kavanaugh</b> suit mandating deinstitutionalization of three Texas PRFs;  		Association of Retarded Citizens (ARC)Texas has been involved actively in the  		litigation, and attempts to monitor Its compliance as well as to call the  		state's attention to other quality issues.</p>
<p>The Texas quality assurance profile is fairly typical of states in  		general as well as the six states visited, although states vary in specific  		divisions of responsibility among agencies and in mechanisms for monitoring  		non-ICF-MR community residences, with relatively few states having a  		comprehensive system of formal licensure of non-ICF-MR group homes. In many  		states, some DD people also live in "foster homes"--more accurately described  		as board and care homes, usually operating on a proprietary basis and housing  		several mentally disabled individuals--which are licensed and monitored by the  		public social services agency. As required by the Keyes Amendment, states  		specifically must provide assurances of systematic monitoring of board and care  		homes with more than one SSI recipient who have designated the  		operator/proprietor as representative payee.</p>
<p><b>The Case Management Debate</b></p>
<p>In Texas and two other states, issues were raised regarding the  		effectiveness of case management in quality assurance. Typically, a case  		manager's responsibilities include the monitoring of program services to be  		sure that: the individual client is receiving needed services as have been  		arranged (and presumably tailored to meet individual program goals); services  		are meeting basic standards of quality; and changes in providers are made as  		appropriate to respond to changing needs of the individual, or when It appears  		that a current provider is unable to meet those needs. The issue that has  		arisen is the question of <b>conflict of interest</b> when the case management  		is provided by the same local MR/DD authority that provides or administers the  		services. Informants in Texas, Nebraska, and Colorado noted pressure on the  		state to <b>separate</b> case management functions from the local CBS agencies,  		based on the premise that client interests cannot be adequately protected by  		case managers who work for and with the providers whose interests may conflict  		with the client's--for example, retaining a higher functioning person in a more  		sheltered setting than necessary because he/she is easier to work with (and  		therefore also less costly) than more disabled clients. Illinois officials  		indicated that they plan to move to an independent case management system,  		rather than continuing to contract for case management with providers of other  		services. Advocates for the present system, however, argue that case management  		responsibilities to the individual are kept paramount and that their being part  		of the overall agency benefits the clients by having better case manager access  		to and influence on program services. The resolution of this issue was noted as  		a factor likely to affect future CBS development by several respondents.</p>
<p>A related issue in quality assurance through case management is the  		ability to control provider reimbursement. Case managers have relatively little  		ability to determine reimbursements in the states visited or in states in  		general, especially in systems where the local case manager is not defined as  		the single point of entry to publicly supported services. For example, in most  		of the states visited, individual families can place DD relatives in private  		Medicaid facilities (generally large congregate care facilities) without going  		through the local assessment and case management system. In three of the states  		visited there were tensions between administrators of these facilities and the  		local MR/DD authority as to oversight responsibilities, with the large  		facilities tending to recognize only the traditional Medicaid quality assurance  		mechanism.</p>
<h3>3. Major Influences on Community Service System  		Development</h3>
<p>Informants in all six states described an array of factors which had  		influenced CBS development--both incentives and barriers--in their respective  		states. There also were extensive consensus within individual states as to  		which factors had been significant and what their influence had been. For  		example, although many of the key informants in Nebraska placed themselves at  		the forefront of the move to develop community services beginning in the late  		1960s, there was strong consensus that the following factors contributed to  		Nebraska's leadership in CBS development:</p>
<ul><li>Involvement of parents and community members in the early stages of  		  CBS development</li>
<li>A strong, well-organized Association for Retarded Citizens</li>
<li>Leaders in the field of community services, both theory and practice,  		  who are involved in Nebraska</li>
<li>Support from elected officials on both the state and local  		  levels</li>
<li>Ability to articulate a value-based statement of what mental  		  retardation services should be</li>
<li>Structural factors:
<ul><li>Small state population</li>
<li>Simple political system (unicameral legislature)</li>
<li>Small financial investment in the institutional system</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Availability of funding for CBS development
<ul><li>Title XX funds</li>
<li>State funding of startup costs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strong and widespread philosophical commitment to CBS</li>
</ul><p>A lawsuit filed in the early 1970s was considered to have made some  		contribution to CBS development, but informants noted that the litigation came  		after Nebraska had made a commitment to CBS and had developed a framework for  		financing and delivering those services through the 1969 inter-local Agreement  		Act. The only major factor identified as a barrier to CBS expansion was the  		state's recent economic difficulties. Despite these problems, however, support  		for CBS is strong enough that the mental retardation services budget received a  		slight increase in the last legislative session even as budgets for nearly all  		other state services were cut.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, informants' descriptions of major influences in  		low-CBS emphasis states tended to focus more on inhibiting factors along with  		incentives. Although resource constraints were identified as an issue, many of  		the factors cited by informants as having inhibited CBS development had more to  		do with philosophical commitment and the state's political environment. For  		example, there was general consensus among the Texas informants that the  		following factors had been barriers to significant growth in CBS services:</p>
<ul><li>The legislature has been reluctant to fund human services and for  		  MR/DD services; available resources have not been adequate to fund both  		  institutional and community services.</li>
<li>Several respondents cited the conservative political ideology which  		  emphasizes independence, family privacy, and limited government as a major  		  barrier to community services.</li>
<li>The low level of public awareness has been an obstacle. Because there  		  is little experience with community services In Texas, the public and many  		  members of the legislature do not believe community services will work.</li>
<li>Opposition from state school superintendents who have influence with  		  the legislature and from Parents Associated for the Retarded of Texas (PART),  		  the pro-institution parent group.</li>
<li>Fears that reducing the size of state schools will mean lost jobs for  		  state employees, with severe economic consequences in areas where the state  		  school is a major employer.</li>
<li>Several respondents commented that the institutional bias of the  		  ICF-MR program continues to encourage Texas to emphasize institutional  		  services.</li>
<li>The absence of a reliable Federal funding stream for community-based,  		  nonresidential programs.</li>
</ul><p><b>Federal Program And Policy Influences</b></p>
<p>Nearly all informants described Federal programs and policies, along  		with other factors, as important influences in the development of the state's  		MR/DD system. The Medicaid program, particularly the ICF-MR component, was the  		most frequently mentioned influence, reflecting the extensive use of the  		program to support residential and related services. The significant variety in  		the ways the six states have used the Medicaid program to finance MR/DD  		services reflects the individual state's approach to MR/DD services and the  		Medicaid program in general, rather than program designs dictated at the  		Federal level. Differing rates of use for large facilities illustrate this  		trend. It also should be noted that although the Federal financial  		participation (FFP) in Medicaid is attractive to states, and candidly cited by  		several informants as a major factor in program design, states have not chosen  		to take advantage of all the Medicaid funding that is already available, such  		as funding for small community residences or for day programs under the clinic  		services option. A few informants specifically noted concerns about the  		Medicaid program's open-ended feature in relation to expanded obligation of  		<b>state</b> resources for the non-Federal share.</p>
<p>The major influences of the ICF-MR program included the following:</p>
<ul><li>Program requirements for PRFs forced states to raise standards, lower  		  staffing ratios, and improve physical plants. High-CBS states tended to use  		  depopulation and CBS development as part of these initiatives, while low-CBS  		  states were likely to have focused more on PRF improvements.</li>
<li>Existing private facilities were converted to ICFs-MR, especially  		  large congregate care facilities in the low-CBS states of Illinois and Texas.  		  (Although some smaller CRFs were converted in Michigan, Illinois, and Texas,  		  this was not done on a major scale as has occurred in a few other states, most  		  notably New York and Pennsylvania).</li>
<li>Recent influence of the "look behinds" appeared to refocus attention  		  on the need to maintain standards or risk loss of FFP. Even though the "look  		  behinds" were sometimes painful for state officials, and led to some concern  		  that required investments in PRFs and other large facilities would divert  		  resources from CBS expansion, nearly all key informants described them as a  		  positive influence.</li>
</ul><p>The Section 2176 HCB Waiver was considered to have been a major  		influence in three of the six states, cutting across the CBS continuum. In  		Colorado, the Waiver was credited with having preserved the CBS expansion  		momentum at a point when the state's economy was in recession; as noted above,  		Colorado has used the Waiver to develop its PCAs model and to convert small  		ICFs-MR to non-ICF-MR CRFs. (Michigan plans to use its proposed Waiver  		similarly.) Illinois and Texas officials indicated that despite their inability  		to implement the Waiver at the full level approved, it has been instrumental in  		stimulating CBS development and in demonstrating the effectiveness of CBS. It  		should be noted that the three remaining states all plan to use the Waiver in  		the future, specifically to expand CBS availability.</p>
<p>Only one of the states has used other options of the Medicaid program  		extensively in its CBS system. Michigan covers some offsite day programs under  		the clinic services option, is developing coverage for case management as a  		discrete service, and has worked with the community mental health services  		system to ensure that these local MR/DD authorities are certified as Medicaid  		providers (all but one of the 55 local authorities are so certified). Michigan,  		along with Texas, also has obtained a model, or "Katie Beckett" waiver for  		services to severely disabled children; however, this was not considered a  		major influence.</p>
<p>The availability of client SSI funds was not mentioned frequently, but  		was identified by some informants in high-CBS states as a factor in CBS  		development. This was particularly the case in the high-CBS states, where SSI  		contributions from clients have been used in combination with Section 8 rental  		subsidies to finance non-ICF-MR alternatives. The Title XX/Social Services  		Block Grant (SSBG) program was a major .influence on the development of the  		Nebraska CBS system because of the availability of financing that could be used  		flexibly to meet needs defined at the local (Regional Governing Board) level.  		Title XX/SSBG also was used in Illinois and Texas (low-CBS states) to expand  		CBS in the late 1970s early 1980s. For example, Illinois spent an average of  		over $25 million in SSBG funds per year on MR/DD community services for the  		three years 1979-1981. Currently, however, all three states have reduced their  		use of Title XX/SSBG, and its influence is minimal.</p>
<p><b>The Developmental Disabilities Act</b></p>
<p>All six states have active Councils on Developmental Disabilities,  		funded through the Federal DD Act grant program. Informants reported varying  		degrees of involvement of the Councils in promoting CBS and advocating for more  		integrated and individualized services. Requirements for inter-agency  		cooperation in DD planning were noted in providing information on the strengths  		of Council activities, but not singled out as having had a major influence. It  		was clear that the Federal DD definition requirements for the Council and State  		Protection and Advocacy Agency had not been a major influence in the four  		states which focus on mental retardation rather than MR/DD. Some DD Council  		representatives in low-CBS states noted the political-reality limitations on  		their ability to push for major changes such as the reforms contained in the  		community and Family Living Amendments (CFLA). An informant in one state  		reported that the DD Council's endorsement of the CFLA proposed in the 98th  		Congress was deeply resented by a major private provider of MR/DD congregate  		care services who opposed CFLA and was able to generate thousands of letters to  		the governor protesting the Council's action.</p>
<p><b>Programs Not Administered By HHS</b></p>
<p>Informants in all six states noted the impact of P.L. 94-142, the  		Education for All Handicapped Children Act, in the expansion of community  		services. Although implementation of P.L. 94-142 has not always meant the  		degree of integration or "mainstreaming" that some had envisioned, there was  		general consensus that the program has led to expanded opportunities for MR/DD  		children and young adults, as well as preventing institutionalization. There  		also was consensus across the states that the success of P.L. 94-142 was  		placing major strains on the adult MR/DD service system, as young adults "age  		out" of special education and find no programs available. Waiting lists of  		"aging out" students were noted as a major issue in all six states.</p>
<p>There was lack of consensus on the influence of federally supported VR  		programs in CBS development. VR agency representatives tended to describe  		programs as reaching significant numbers of MR/DD people in the community,  		while most other informants indicated that VR programs seldom served more  		severely handicapped MR/DD clients (one VR agency representative presented this  		perspective in consonance with other informants in the state). The influence of  		the Independent Living program was noted by officials in only two states,  		perhaps because it was seen as serving the non-MR disabled population in  		systems where the primary focus is on mental retardation.</p>
<p>The Federal supported employment initiative was noted by several  		informants in each state. Four of the six states--two of three in each  		category--have grants from OSERS to develop supported employment services, as  		noted in <a href="stapersp.htm#exhibitII1">Exhibit II-1</a> on state characteristics.  		Interest in supported employment was also expressed in Nebraska and Texas, the  		two states without OSERS grants, especially by representatives of the  		Association for Retarded citizens. Federal leadership from the Administration  		on Developmental Disabilities and OSERS in promoting supported employment  		seemed to be helpful to states in developing initiatives at the state level. On  		the other hand, some informants, and other MR/DD system representatives,  		expressed considerable skepticism regarding the feasibility of supported  		employment as a major vocational service objective despite its attractiveness.  		The major questions involved responsibility for long-term costs, recruitment of  		employers in rural areas or areas of high unemployment and declining economy,  		and program effectiveness for severely and multiply disabled individuals.</p>
<p><b>Other Influences On State MR/DD System</b></p>
<p>The primary influence on the development of CBS cited by informants in  		the high-CBS states was the broad-based support and philosophical commitment to  		community services. Virtually all informants in the three states believed this  		support and commitment to have resulted in state legislative appropriations for  		CBS, significant depopulation of PRFs, pro-CBS litigation, and widespread CBS  		development that was generally supported the community level. Informants in all  		three high-CBS states identified an informal coalition of parents, advocacy  		organizations, political leaders, and CBS providers who, along with  		policymakers in the state MR/DD agency, had helped shape the MR/DD system.</p>
<p>In contrast, the lack of such coalitions or their relative weakness was  		noted by informants in the three low-CBS states as a major factor in the  		relative lack of CBS development. At the same time, informants in these states  		reported that there continues to be strong political support for large MR/DD  		institutions, both PRFs and large private facilities. In Texas, for example,  		several of the PRFs, or "State Schools," are located in rural areas where they  		are a primary source of employment and support for the local economy; state  		legislators representing these areas understandably resist efforts that could  		lead to PRF closure. Private providers have also wielded considerable  		influence. For example, private providers and the nursing home lobby in Texas  		were successful in persuading the legislature to pass a law mandating that HCB  		rates be limited to a rate that is less than the average reimbursement rate for  		community ICF-MR providers; some informants felt this had hampered  		implementation of the Waiver.</p>
<p>Informants across all six states cited the states' economy as a major  		factor in shaping their MR/DD systems. Five of the six states--all but  		Virginia--reported significant economic problems which have increased the  		difficulties of financing CBS development. Informants noted various ways that  		this influence is felt, including pressures to obtain maximum FFP, (conversely)  		to <b>limit</b> FFP in order to avoid state match demands, to defer new  		initiatives, and to avoid demonstration program grants which are seen by some  		as likely to leave the state with an obligation to continue the support when  		the demonstration funds cease. The negative effect of the state's economic  		difficulties on CBS development was clearly stronger in the low-CBS states,  		where political strength is still developing, and less influential in the  		high-CBS states. As noted above, despite extreme problems in the economy,  		Nebraska's appropriations for CBS have continued to increase even as most other  		programs have been cut back.</p>
<p>The availability of resources for new service development was cited as a  		significant factor in most states. Some high-CBS states found ways to help  		substate MR/DD authorities and local providers develop services, for example,  		by appropriating special funds to cover startup costs (Nebraska), or by making  		additional funds available to local authorities. Texas has developed a major  		capacity-building initiative through its "Prospective Payment System" which  		makes $55.60 per day available to the local mental retardation authority for  		each client who returns to the area from a state PRF. Overall, however, the  		<b>lack</b> of startup funds was more frequently reported as a barrier,  		especially in low-CBS states. Several informants expressed concerns regarding  		their state's ability to maintain quality care in PRFs while simultaneously  		developing major expansions in community services.</p>
<p>The relationship between the state Medicaid and MR/DD agency was noted  		as a factor in all six states as well. Information in the three high-CBS states  		reported generally good working relationships and an overall consensus on  		Medicaid program objectives in relation to MR/DD individuals. For example,  		respondents in Michigan reported that the Department of Mental Health (the lead  		state MR agency) and the state Medicaid agency have worked together effectively  		on developing Medicaid-financed MR services. Moreover, views in the two  		agencies about appropriate goals for MR/DD services appeared to be compatible.  		Similar relations and a growing consensus had reportedly developed recently in  		one of the three low-CBS states. Informants identified this as having  		contributed to such activities as small ICF-MR development and effective use of  		waivers to expand CBS. In the other two low-CBS states, informants noted  		disagreements between the MR/DD and Medicaid agencies regarding areas such as  		target population, degree of medical orientation, and use of the Waiver. For  		example, in one state, the ICF-MR target population considered appropriate by  		the Medicaid agency was MR/DD individuals with significant health care needs,  		while several other Informants saw the need to serve a wide range of MR/DD  		individuals in the ICF-MR program, emphasizing habilitation rather than medical  		care.</p>
<p>Finally, informants in all six states reported several examples of  		intrastate variety that Influences their respective MR/DD systems. Many  		informants noted that rural areas have particular difficulties in meeting CBS  		development objectives, even when support is not the issue, due to lack of  		financial and programmatic resources. In contrast, community services in  		metropolitan areas and/or around universities were reported to be much more  		extensive and progressive, in both high- and low-CBS states. All states  		reported major differences in the availability of financial support from local  		governments and other local sources; where minimum local match is required,  		political support and commitment has meant contributions well above the minimum  		in some areas, and correspondingly better services.</p>
<p>In all but Illinois the considerable autonomy of local MR/DD authorities  		also has contributed to significant variation within states regarding CBS  		design and availability. Not surprisingly, several informants reported tensions  		between states and local MR/DD authorities, and in some cases with local  		governments, regarding state control vs. local autonomy. Another local autonomy  		issue cited as a factor in two of the three low-CBS states was local zoning  		authority. Several informants in these states reported that in the absence of  		legislation at the state level that restricts local zoning practices which  		discriminate against CRFs, community opposition was strong enough to use  		restrictive zoning rules to keep CRFs out.</p>
<h3>4. MR/DD System Goals</h3>
<p>There was general consensus within individual states and across the six  		states on goals for their MR/DD systems, regardless of where they are  		currently:</p>
<ul><li>Expanded development of community services, especially in integrated,  		  normalizing settings</li>
<li>Significant increases in supports to families and avoidance of  		  out-of-home placement</li>
<li>Continued reduction of PRF populations</li>
<li>Development of supported employment programs</li>
<li>Improvements in quality assurance efforts</li>
</ul><p>The objectives for implementation of these goals varied, however, in  		relation to the state's efforts to date. Informants in high-CBS states tended  		to identify objectives such as closure of state PRFs and total or nearly-total  		PRF depopulation; small noninstitutional community alternatives for severely  		and multiply-handicapped MR/DD individuals or people with "challenging  		behaviors;" preference for non-ICF-MR models for community residences, such as  		Colorado's PCAs; and supported employment as a significant alternative to  		sheltered employment. Informants in the low-CBS states, especially Illinois and  		Texas, were more apt to describe such objectives as expanded group home and  		small ICF-MR development, gradual PRF depopulation, and meeting widespread  		needs for vocational and day programs. Although some informants in these states  		advocate the same kinds of objectives as those described in the high-CBS  		states, these views tended to be in the minority, with the exception of  		supported employment. There also was a greater tendency in low-CBS states for  		informants to see congregate care as a desirable alternative for more severely  		disabled individuals, with the more integrated services targeted primarily to  		individuals with mild or moderate disabilities. In addition, informants in  		high-CBS states were more apt to focus on <b>client</b>-based service  		development, while informants in low-CBS states tended to identify  		<b>facility</b> development needs.</p>
<p>There was considerable emphasis in all six states on cost-effectiveness  		as a major objective in MR/DD services. From the state perspective, this  		sometimes included pressures to seek FFP to support services, in particular  		through the Medicaid program. Several informants, however, including state  		officials, expressed the hope that states could work with the Federal  		Government to use the Medicaid program cost effectively to tailor services to  		meet individual needs and to avoid expensive out-of-home placements.  		Representatives in all six' states noted that state MR/DD budgets are  		scrutinized in detail by both the executive agencies and the legislature for  		cost containment strategies.</p>
<p>There also was a sense of optimism in three low-CBS states regarding  		their CBS development goals. State agency representatives and other informants  		in these states described an assessment of the current situation as "the time  		being ripe" for support to develop an expanded CBS system. These assessments  		were generally based on such factors as support from the governor, improvements  		in relations among involved agencies, and a sense that it is MR/DD's "turn" for  		attention and support in the legislature.</p>
<p>It should be noted that there were a range of opinions in all six states  		as to the appropriate MR/DD system goals and the strategies by which goals  		should be implemented. Each of the six states has an association of pro-PRF  		parents and advocates who object to plans that would include total PRF  		depopulation. Each state has some large facility private providers who advocate  		continued support for congregate care and sheltered workshop providers who feel  		threatened by pressure to convert services to supported employment. Tensions  		between advocates for noninstitutional, integrated services for MR/DD  		individuals and those who see a major continuing need for institutions and  		other traditional service models were expected to continue in all the states  		visited. The primary difference between the high- vs. low-CBS states was the  		relative strength of the two perspectives.</p>
<h2><a name="chapIII" id="chapIII">III. FEDERAL POLICY PERSPECTIVES</a></h2>
<p>Most of the informants had perspectives to offer on Federal policy.  		Their comments focused on two areas: (1) how Federal policy influences or has  		influenced their state's MR/DD system; and (2) what changes in Federal policy  		would be helpful to the state in expanding CBS development. In this chapter, a  		summary of these perspectives are followed by a brief analysis of how states  		might be expected to respond to changes in Federal policy of the kind being  		considered by the Working Group.</p>
<h3>1. State Perspectives on Federal Policy Influences</h3>
<p>Federal policies were seen by state informants as one of several  		influences on MR/DD systems. This section presents a summary of views on  		Federal policy influence in promoting an overall orientation toward community  		MR/DD services, and influence on the system's administration, client  		eligibility, services, financing, and quality assurance.</p>
<p>(1) <b>Influence On CBS Orientation</b></p>
<p>To date, Federal policy appears to have had minimal influence in  		promoting an emphasis on community services. The notable exception has been the  		Medicaid HCB Waiver program, which was cited by several states as significant  		in their CBS development and expansion efforts. The small ICF-MR program had  		been a major factor in support of CBS development in three of the states.  		However, two of the three, both high-CBS states, are in the process of reducing  		the use of the program through the Waiver, Colorado has in fact completed its  		conversion of small ICFs-MR to non-Medicaid facilities. The influence of the  		Developmental Disabilities Act and other Federal programs in promoting greater  		emphasis on CBS is unclear. Although several examples of pro-CBS activities of  		DD Councils were cited, it was not clear to what extent these activities had  		been shaped by Federal program requirements or in turn had been a major  		influence on state MR/DD systems, as DD Council influence was not cited as a  		factor in CBS development by the informants.</p>
<p>Several aspects of the ICF-MR program and the availability of FFP were  		primarily perceived to have discouraged CBS. For example:</p>
<ul><li>The original ICF-MR standards and the more recent "look-behind"  		  effort encouraged large investments in capital improvements in PRFs and  		  subsequent pressure to continue using PRFs.</li>
<li>Pressure to maximize FFP encourages use of ICFs-MR even if other  		  residential programs would be more appropriate for clients when the  		  alternatives would require 100 percent state financing.</li>
<li>ICF-MR regulations promote the use of large facilities because of  		  economics of scale--some physical plant and staffing requirements make small  		  ICFs-MR economically infeasible.</li>
</ul><p>The Individual context of each state, however, appears to have been a  		major factor in determining response to FFP. For example, all three of the  		high-CBS states chose to depopulate PRFs and develop CBS as a major strategy  		for meeting ICF-MR standards and retaining FFP for their PRFs; the three  		low-CBS states, given the same options, chose to emphasize investments in  		PRFs.</p>
<p>Federal policies In special education, in particular the implementation  		of P.L. 94-142, also were seen as having promoted CBS orientation, although  		several informants noted differences in the degree to which MR/DD students,  		especially those with multiple handicaps, were Integrated with their  		nondisabled peers. There also were noticeable differences among the states  		regarding age ranges covered through the education system and services  		provided, given the latitude provided to the states in designing their approach  		to P.L. 94-142 implementation. The primary impact cited across the six states  		was the growing pressure to expand community services to meet the needs of  		special education students leaving school, and the increased activism of  		parents whose expectations have been raised regarding alternatives to  		institutionalization or total dependency on family members for activities and  		assistance.</p>
<p>The Supported Employment initiative was seen as promoting CBS  		development as well. The demonstration, training, and technical assistance  		opportunities were generally regarded as helpful in enhancing CBS orientation.  		It should be noted, however, that interest in supported employment was tempered  		in most of the states by observers who questioned its feasibility on a large  		scale.</p>
<p>(2) <b>Influence On Service Organization And Administration</b></p>
<p>Federal policy was not considered a significant influence on the states'  		service organization and administration. Two exceptions noted were in the  		restriction of program responsibilities to the designated state Medicaid  		agency, and the difficulties in some states in developing consensus between the  		MR/DD and Medicaid agencies on how the Medicaid program can best be used for  		services to MR/DD individuals.</p>
<p>It should be noted that there are no Federal policies with extensive  		requirements for MR/DD service organizations and administration comparable to,  		for example, requirements in the Older Americans Act for both State Units on  		Aging (SUAs) and area agencies in aging (AAAs). The DD Act requirements for  		state DD Council composition and related state plan requirements, however, are  		somewhat analogous to the policies governing SUAs. As noted above, however, the  		Council's influence on the state system as a result of these policies is  		unclear.</p>
<p>(3) <b>Influence On Client Eligibility</b></p>
<p>The primary Federal policy on client eligibility that was cited  		repeatedly was the requirement under the Medicaid program that limits  		eligibility to people in institutions, either because of parent-deemed income  		provisions or because needed services could only be reimbursed by Medicaid if  		provided as part of an ICF-MR program. Informants in all six states noted that  		families who wanted to keep even severely disabled relatives at home were  		frequently unable to do so because of the lack of resources and the  		ineligibility for Medicaid. It should be remembered that only two of the states  		have used the Medicaid Clinic services option to support habilitation services,  		with MR/DD adults in the other four states therefore having essentially no  		access to Medicaid services other than covered physical health care, unless  		they live in an ICF-MR or are served under the HCB Waiver.</p>
<p>The Federal DD definition appears to have had little effect on client  		eligibility. The primary service system in four of the six states is a mental  		retardation rather than a MR/DD system. In addition, it was clear from  		discussions with state informants that many of the mentally retarded  		people--primarily adults--who are already in the service system are mildly  		retarded individuals who may or may not meet the Federal DD definition.</p>
<p>Eligibility issues were raised by some informants regarding the  		interpretation of "need for active treatment" and of criteria for the SSI and  		the SSDI programs. The questions raised were generally focused on consistency  		in interpretation and the need to understand the relevant Federal policies  		rather than the impact of the policies themselves. Informants indicated that it  		was still too early to see if eligibility problems in the disability review  		process have been addressed with the recent changes. Finally, it should be  		noted that states have different eligibility criteria for different components  		of their MR/DD systems, with some components being more strongly influenced by  		Federal policy than others. For example, despite some differences among state  		agencies' administration of the Federal SSI and SSDI disability review  		programs, the eligibility for these programs is strongly influenced by Federal  		policy. In contrast, there are many MR/DD programs run by state agencies with  		little or no FFP, in which states set eligibility criteria virtually without  		Federal policy influence. The overall MR/DD service system includes many  		components with minimal Federal funding or regulation, such as the Michigan  		Family Support subsidy program. Even where Federal eligibility criteria exist,  		latitude in their interpretation frequently contributes to differences among,  		and even within, states as to who is served.</p>
<p>(4) <b>Influence On Services</b></p>
<p>The ICF-MR program is the primary influence on the services being  		provided to MR/DD individuals. The emphasis on active treatment and the  		definitions of covered services were given mixed reviews by the states. On the  		positive side, most informants felt the <b>concept</b> of active treatment (as  		opposed to custodial care) was helpful in designing services, as is the  		emphasis on individual program planning. Restrictions against coverage of  		educational and vocational program services, especially when narrowly  		interpreted, were seen as having a negative effect on services design. Several  		respondents also noted the current confusion over the definition of active  		treatment. The policies permitting optional standards for ICFsMR under 16 beds  		were not mentioned as significant in shaping services.</p>
<p>The Federal policy Influence on <b>who</b> provides services appears to  		be minimal. Although Medicaid requires freedom of choice and that providers  		meet various standards to be certified, current policies do not seem to have  		affected the mix of public and private providers, for-profit and not-for-profit  		providers, or the level of competition; the extent and nature of private sector  		involvement has been shaped primarily by the individual state's policies and  		regulatory environment. For example, in three of the states, concerns were  		expressed that the state Medicaid agency's certification of large for-profit  		congregate care facilities was in conflict with goals for integrated community  		services.</p>
<p>(5) <b>Influence On Financing</b></p>
<p>The primary Federal policy influence on financing has been the  		availability of FFP. It was clear that FFP is a factor in how states finance  		their MR/DD system, but clearly not the only factor or even necessarily the  		major factor. Even when Federal income maintenance funds provided to  		individuals are included, Federal funds represented less than 54 percent of  		MR/DD public expenditures--not including special education--in four of the six  		states. When SSI and SSDI are excluded, all six states fall below 50 percent  		use of FFP for their MR/DD system.</p>
<p>The Federal policy influence in rate-setting methodologies, primarily  		relevant to the Medicaid programs, was not explored. Concern was raised in  		general that some Medicaid policies increase program costs, as noted above. The  		HCB and model waivers were generally seen as more cost effective ways to  		finance services, although some informants noted financing constraints within  		the waiver regarding the interpretation of cost comparison formulas.</p>
<p>(6) <b>Influence On Quality</b></p>
<p>Federal policy was widely considered to have a strong influence on  		program quality in the ICF-MR program, especially with the "look-behind"  		surveys. State ICF-MR review processes also influenced quality. However, the  		"look-behinds" also were a source of tension in some states over  		<b>interpretations</b> of Federal policy. Other Medicaid quality assurance  		efforts were mentioned by some informants such as the activities of the  		Regional Office (Region V) in reviews of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and  		Intermediate Care Facilities (ICFs) in Illinois which led to the identification  		of 2,800 to 3,000 inappropriately placed DD nursing home residents.</p>
<p>Other Federal policy influences on program quality and quality assurance  		mechanisms were not identified, although undoubtedly the DD Protection and  		Advocacy program, Section 504, P.L. 94-142, and other civil rights protections  		are a factor. States vary in the divisions of responsibility for quality  		assurance seemingly without regard to Federal policy requirements, with the  		exceptions of the state Medicaid agency designation.</p>
<h3>2. Implications for Federal Policy</h3>
<p>The analysis of state perspectives on the factors which influence their  		MR/DD systems and their implementation of CBS development objectives revealed  		various implications for Federal policy. Informants in all six states were  		forthcoming in their discussions of Federal policy influences, changes in  		Federal policy that were considered helpful to CBS development, and policies  		that they thought would inhibit such development. There was considerable  		consensus on these perspectives within individual states and across the six  		states. Although the description of the potential state responses to changes in  		Federal policy is, of necessity, speculative in nature, the relative degree of  		consensus on policy perspectives may indicate that the projected responses  		summarized at the end of this section are on target.</p>
<p>(1) <b>Federal Policy Perspectives</b></p>
<p>Informants across the six states, including advocates for institutional  		and congregate care within the services continuum, were interested in Federal  		policy changes that would help their state expand its community services  		system. Most informants were particularly interested in policies that would  		promote the following: services which emphasize natural homes or homelike  		residences well integrated into the community; supports to families; and a full  		range of habilitation, education, developmental, and vocational services. There  		was widespread support for the following principles:</p>
<ul><li><b>Increased flexibility to states in the ways Medicaid can be used  		  to support community services</b>
<ul><li>In-home services to severely disabled children that would not be  				dependent on model waiver procedures</li>
<li>Coverage of appropriate educational and vocational program  				services (e.g., supported employment)</li>
<li>HCB Waiver either continued indefinitely or made a regular  				optional program (although some informants were concerned that fiscally  				conservative policymakers would be <b>less</b> likely to pursue the HCB  				approach If It was for an optional program)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Maintain or expand FFP</b>
<ul><li>Expand FFP availability for low-CBS states needing to develop  				services, at least over a short-term transitional period</li>
<li>Stabilize FFP/increase state's ability to predict how much FFP  				will be available</li>
<li>Some support for Medicaid "cap" in exchange for significant  				Increases in flexibility, despite opposition from advocacy groups to loss of  				entitlement and open-ended funding</li>
<li>Some support for lower FFP rates for PRFs and other large  				facilities, support not limited to CBS advocacy groups, especially in low CBS  				states, as a necessary Incentive to shift emphasis to CBS</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Federal leadership</b>
<ul><li>Clarification/strengthening of support for CBS, especially in the  				Medicaid program</li>
<li>Articulation of CBS goals and philosophy across Federal  				programs</li>
<li>Clarification throughout the Federal-state Medicaid partnership  				network regarding the ICF-MR program and ways in which it differs from other  				long-term care services under Medicaid</li>
<li>Shift from facility basis to client basis</li>
<li>Reduction of conflicting program requirements/eligibility  				criteria between such programs as SSI/SSDI, vocational rehabilitation, special  				education, and Medicaid</li>
<li>Support for services through the VR program that are more  				responsive to the needs of MR/DD individuals</li>
<li>Continuing strong Federal presence in quality assurance</li>
<li>Consistency among Regional Offices in program monitoring and  				interpretation of Federal policy</li>
<li>Administrative consolidation within HCFA for MR/DD programs and  				policies</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Greater emphasis on cost-effective support to families that help  		  avoid unnecessary institutionalization</b></li>
<li><b>Technical assistance</b>
<ul><li>"State-of-the-art" services</li>
<li>Manpower training in new technologies</li>
<li>Training for surveyors and quality assurance program  				administrators</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>The Federal policy features accorded the strongest support and broadest  		consensus were increased flexibility and support for noninstitutional community  		alternatives, increased emphasis on help to families, strong Federal  		leadership, and maintenance/expansion of FFP.</p>
<p><b>Policies That Could Inhibit CBS Development</b></p>
<p>Informants in both high- and low-CBS states were generally optimistic  		that the kinds of Federal policy changes under consideration could be helpful  		in promoting CBS goals. Informants cited changes, however, which they  		considered likely to have a negative effect on CBS expansion. These included  		the following:</p>
<ul><li><b>Capped FFP</b>--Although some informants expressed willingness to  		  consider a cap in exchange for greater flexibility, others expressed concern  		  that capped FFP for MR/DD programs could result in declining FFP over time, as  		  has happened with Title XX/Social Services Block Grant funding.</li>
<li><b>Reduced FFP</b>--Informants in all six states expressed concern  		  that FFP for MR/DD services should not be reduced, especially given the  		  precarious position of the state economies.</li>
<li><b>Elimination Of The HCB Waiver</b>--All six states are in support  		  of the kinds of flexibility offered by the HCB Waiver and are concerned that  		  its elimination would impede further CBS development.</li>
<li><b>Increased Fragmentation</b>--Some informants recommended that  		  policies which target services to specific population subgroups be  		  avoided.</li>
<li><b>Condemnation Of Congregate Care</b>--Informants in low-CBS states,  		  where large congregate care providers and/or PRFs have considerable political  		  support, were concerned that policies which seem to condemn large MR/DD  		  facilities would increase resistance to CBS development. Others in these  		  states, however, indicated that the evidence on the merits of community  		  services in smaller integrated settings required policy approaches that clearly  		  favor this approach.</li>
</ul><p>The Informants' primary concern was that trends toward increased  		flexibility and Individualized programming be continued without loss of Federal  		support. </p>
<p>(2) <b>How States May Be Expected To Respond To Changes In Federal  		Policy</b></p>
<p>The analysis of state perspectives, in particular of the observations of  		informants in the low-CBS states, provided some indication as to how states may  		respond to changes in Federal policies affecting MR/DD service systems. Perhaps  		the most significant point emerging from the review of state perspectives is  		the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was a strong general consensus that merely "tinkering" with  		  Federal MR/DD policies will have little effect on states' ability to expand  		  community-based services and to promote models that emphasize integration,  		  productivity, and independence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>State responses to the kinds of changes in Federal policy under  		consideration by the Working Group that were further suggested by the analysis  		are summarized in the following.</p>
<ul><li><b>Overall emphasis on community services</b>
<ul><li>States will welcome Federal actions that facilitate expanded CBS  				with state policymakers, including philosophical direction, FFP, and technical  				assistance.</li>
<li>Low-CBS states in particular would be able to use Federal  				leadership in promoting CBS growth by:
<ul><li>Giving CBS supporters more "ammunition" (Federal standards,  					 Federal policy statements, FFP that was available for CBS, etc.)</li>
<li>Direct assistance in CBS development (demonstrations,  					 technical assistance, fiscal incentives, support for CBS system development,  					 etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is not clear, however, if even radical changes in Federal  				policy would "turn around" a state which was determined to cling to large PRFs  				and other large congregate facilities (i.e., more determined than the low-CBS  				states visited for this study).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Administration</b>
<ul><li>Effects on MR/DD system administration--overall division of  				responsibility and centralization vs. decentralization--are likely to be  				minimal unless new policies prescribed particular structures. Since there is  				considerable variety among states, as well as considerable history,  				prescriptive requirements would not be well received.</li>
<li>States would generally support increased discretion in the  				governor's ability to delegate authority for some MR/DD aspects of the state's  				Medicaid program. This option would be particularly helpful to states in which  				the Medicaid long-term care program is .predominantly oriented to the needs of  				the frail elderly.</li>
<li>States would welcome changes that brought more consistency in  				goals, target population, and specific requirements across such Federal  				programs as Medicaid, SSI and SSDI, Developmental Disabilities, Vocational  				Rehabilitation, Special Education, and Adult Basic Education. These efforts  				could be useful to states and communities In planning and monitoring their CBS  				systems and in developing more cost-effective service strategies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Client Eligibility</b>
<ul><li>The effect of Federal policy changes on client eligibility would  				depend on the use of <b>mandatory</b> client populations as well as the  				particular criteria selected. In states which do not generally include services  				to people with developmentally disabilities other than mental retardation, at  				least through the primary MR system, Federal mandates to include the full range  				of developmental disabilities would present significant problems in financing  				and system development.</li>
<li>States are currently serving many mentally retarded people in  				their service systems, primarily adults, who may not meet DD definitions that  				focus on severity and/or inability to achieve gainful employment. If such  				clients were no longer eligible for services supported by FFP, many states  				could be expected to raise objections. This would be a particular problem in  				low-CBS states in which most of the people currently in their CBS system are  				higher functioning individuals; a major cutback in available FFP for these  				clients would mean other state resources would have to be used for this  				population rather than for new services for the moderately and severely  				disabled clients still in the PRFs.</li>
<li>Most states also are already providing some services to families,  				including parent training, infant stimulation, respite care, Information and  				referral, and subsidy payments. Although some FFP Is being used, primarily  				through the HCB Waiver and P.L. 94-142 programs, most of these efforts are  				supported by state and local funds. A change in Federal program eligibility  				would therefore have more effect on the <b>financing</b> of services to DD  				people in their own homes, rather than change the overall scope of the  				population being served.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Expenditures</b>
<ul><li>State's expenditures on their MR/DD systems are likely to be much  				more influenced by the state's economy than by Federal policy.</li>
<li>Even if considerable new FFP were available, It Is unreasonable  				to assume that states will automatically increase their overall MR/DD  				expenditures or necessarily jump at FFP (although a few might be expected to do  				so). Most states are concerned about match requirements, open-ended  				obligations, and building up constituency expectations beyond what the state  				can afford in a period of economic difficulty. This is borne out by the  				observation that many states have not used Medicaid options for MR/DD services  				that are already available.</li>
<li>Low-CBS states, especially those with troubled economies, may be  				unable to expand CBS and maintain quality PRF services simultaneously without  				short-term transitional assistance.</li>
<li>Demonstration project funding may be helpful in supporting CBS  				innovations that can then be used as models throughout the MR/DD systems.  				Low-CBS states in particular may benefit from programs that validate community  				service models, such as small CRFs and vocational programs that integrate  				severely disabled adults into the community.</li>
<li>Short-term demonstration project funding may be unattractive to  				some states if policymakers fear it establishes a level of support that the  				state will be unable to maintain after the demonstration funding is over.  				Demonstration funds that can be used for capacity building and system  				development might be useful to low-CBS states where key officials object to the  				usual kinds of demonstration grants.</li>
<li>Many states are likely to use the HCB Waiver to expand CBS and  				alternatives to ICFs-MR. Changes in the HCB Waiver program, such as  				simplification of procedures and time-limited short-term developmental cost  				increases, would make the waiver even more useful, especially to low-CBS  				states.</li>
<li>State SSI supplements are a major component of state-expenditures  				for CBS, especially in states which use non-Medicaid alternatives for community  				residences. States may be expected to raise this issue in response to policies  				which would pressure states to shift to non-Medicaid CRFs.</li>
<li>State reactions to cost-sharing requirements will probably be  				mixed. Many states provide nearly all MR/DD services at no cost to  				participants, including family members, regardless of ability to pay.<sup><font><a href="stapersp.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup> This is particularly true for  				families of adult MR/DD individuals whose freedom from financial responsibility  				for PRF and other service costs has been won in several states through the  				courts and hard-fought lobbying efforts. If cost-sharing were optional, states  				might be faced with difficult political battles with parents and other  				advocates. Mandatory cost-sharing provisions might be implemented with less  				political difficulty at the state level; however, the mechanics of cost-sharing  				and its monitoring would be seen as extremely difficult <b>administratively</b>  				in most states. Nevertheless, there is some state interest in cost-sharing as  				an appropriate strategy in financing community services.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Services</b>
<ul><li>States could be influenced to raise the portion of MR/DD  				resources devoted to community services, especially if Federal policy changes  				are significant in shifting emphasis and support to CBS. Low-CBS states will  				probably require additional resources during the transition period to  				accomplish this, however, as they generally lack the CBS "infrastructure" to  				build on.</li>
<li>Reductions in PRF population can be accelerated somewhat in  				low-CBS states, especially through combination of CBS growth and PRF  				depopulation incentives and help with system development. Some low-CBS states,  				however, are likely to continue their focus on expanded CBS for those who have  				never been in the institutions, especially in the absence of litigation on  				other strong pressures to deinstitutionalize.</li>
<li>Services to families are likely to continue to expand, with or  				without major Federal policy changes. Federal policy will be significant in the  				extent to which states are able to expand family support more rapidly, and in  				their ability to capture FFP for these programs.</li>
<li>States will be more likely to develop small non-ICF-MR CRFs if  				provisions like those currently found in the HCB Waiver are in place.</li>
<li>Significant growth in the availability of vocational services and  				adult education programs is likely if reimbursement for these services under  				Medicaid extends beyond those covered by the COBRA amendments. Implementation  				also may present states with major turf battles as the MR/DD, Medicaid, VR, and  				education agencies sort out fiscal and administrative responsibilities.</li>
<li>Increased emphasis/FFP availability could result in more  				providers being Involved and more choices available to consumers and payors.  				Because of the differences among states in their regulatory environment and  				degree of public vs. private dominance of the MR/DD system, however, the  				effects on provider makeup can be expected to vary considerably from state to  				state.</li>
<li>States will welcome increased flexibility in the use of FFP, and  				can be expected to use this flexibility for more cost-effective services. At  				the same time, increased state flexibility could mean that some states will  				pursue goals other than those preferred by Federal policymakers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Quality assurance</b>
<ul><li>Most states can be expected to welcome strong Federal leadership  				in community services policy and to use it to gain support for CBS  				initiatives.</li>
<li>States generally can be expected to support a continuing strong  				Federal presence in quality control, as in the "look-behinds," provided that  				quality assurance standards are clearly defined and communicated throughout the  				system on a timely basis.</li>
<li>Major increases in state oversight requirements (for example,  				mandatory licensing of all providers receiving FFP under an HCB-like approach)  				would require extensive changes in many state systems, and also could increase  				costs significantly.</li>
<li>Requirements that permitted only a single quality assurance (QA)  				organizational structure would cause difficulties in states with other models.  				For example, a mandatory separation of case management from service provision  				and administration would require extensive changes in states that currently  				require local MR/DD authorities to provide case management. At the same time,  				recognition of the issue of separation of oversight from services  				responsibilities might be useful to states in meeting appropriate goals for  				quality assurance, for example, if states were required to include independent  				program monitoring as a part of their QA system.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>*          *          *          *</p>
<p>Based on our analysis of influences on state MR/DD systems, it is clear  		that no single Federal policy approach will automatically lead to  		implementation of policy objectives for optimal productivity, independence, and  		integration of developmentally disabled people in their respective communities.  		States with relatively little CBS emphasis to date and with strong support for  		congregate care in large MR/DD facilities are likely to need considerable  		assistance--Federal leadership in the articulation of policy goals, FFP  		incentives for community services expansion, and technology transfer of  		cost-effective CBS program design--if their MR/DD systems are to progress  		significantly toward CBS policy goals. Federal policy also is one of several  		factors influencing state MR/DD systems. Although its influence can be  		considerable, it will continue to be limited in relation to the states  		overall policymaking context. It also is unlikely that current Federal policy  		approaches emphasizing devolution of authority to the states will be reversed  		in favor of prescriptive requirements for MR/DD service systems. Finally, it  		should be noted that state MR/DD policies are not implemented uniformly across  		the respective states; the influence of Federal policy on MR/DD services is  		further limited by the constraints on state-level control of its system at the  		community level, especially in states with decentralized MR/DD authority.  		Within these recognized limitations, however, Federal policy and programs can  		make a major contribution in CBS development. The six states reviewed in this  		analysis of MR/DD perspectives were clearly supportive of Federal leadership in  		MR/DD policy, and of an improved Federal-state partnership in cost-effective  		service systems. Their appreciation of being consulted by the Working Group  		through the activities of this study was indicative of the potential for a  		collaborative approach to implementation of MR/DD Federal policy goals.</p>

<h3>COLORADO MR/DD SERVICE SYSTEM</h3>
<h4>I. Overview</h4>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>Colorado has a population of 3.2 million. There is a large urban  		concentration in the Denver area, but the state also has many isolated rural  		areas. Colorado has recently had significant economic and population growth,  		but is currently experiencing severe economic problems. The state has  		traditionally been politically conservative.</p>
<p><b>System Characteristics</b></p>
<p>Colorado's MR/DD service system places strong emphasis on community  		based services. The statement of philosophy of the lead state agency for DD  		services cites normalization, integration, personal autonomy, and  		individualization as guiding principals. The general consensus among  		respondents was that Colorado has made substantial progress in  		deinstitutionalizing the DD population and in establishing community-based  		services.</p>
<p>Colorado's service delivery system is characterized by a high degree of  		decentralization and local autonomy. Most services are funded through the state  		Division for Developmental Disabilities, but are developed and administered by  		local service entities--the Community Centered Boards (CCBs).</p>
<p>Colorado uses Title XIX extensively for both institutional and community  		services. However, ICF-MR supports only the PRFs and six large private  		facilities. All other Medicaid-supported DD services are financed through the  		HCB Waiver.</p>
<p><b>Issues in Community Service Development</b></p>
<p>Although Colorado's MR/DD service system is oriented toward community  		services, there are number of issues to be resolved for the further expansion  		of community-based services. The major issues include:</p>
<ul><li>An overall lack of resources at both the state and local levels</li>
<li>Conflict about the appropriate roles of the various actors in the  		  system</li>
<li>Inadequate community services for hard to serve clients</li>
<li>Inadequate family support</li>
</ul><p><b>Federal Policy Perspectives</b></p>
<p>Most recommendations for Federal policy changes focused on Medicaid  		reform:</p>
<ul><li>Nearly all respondents expressed strong support for CFLAs</li>
<li>Several respondents suggested making waiver services optional  		  services under the state Medicaid plan</li>
<li>In general, respondents want Medicaid to be more flexible in meeting  		  individual needs</li>
</ul><h4>II. Service System Profile</h4>
<p><b>Major Actors in the MR/DD Service System</b></p>
<p><i><b>Division For Developmental Disabilities (DDD)</b></i></p>
<p>DDD, located within the Department of Institutions, is responsible for  		the operation of the 3 state PRFs (Regional Centers), planning and policy  		development, and funding of the CCBs--the local service entities. The agency  		performs annual quality assurance reviews of CCBs and must designate providers  		as "Approved Service Agencies" (ASAs) before they can receive state funds. DDD  		also contracts directly for a limited number of community-based programs.</p>
<p><i><b>Developmental Disabilities Planning Council</b></i></p>
<p>The DD Council, also located in the Department of Institutions, is  		responsible for developing the state DD plan, analysis of issues and programs  		affecting DD services, and fostering interagency cooperation and coordination.  		In addition, the DD Council provides some seed money for innovative projects,  		but does not concentrate on funding or providing direct services.</p>
<p><i><b>Department Of Education--Special Education Services</b></i></p>
<p>Colorado requires the public school system to provide special education  		services to all handicapped children ages 5 to 21. The state Special Education  		Services Division oversees local school districts' special education programs,  		provides technical assistance and funding, and develops policy. Special  		Education Services also is involved in interdepartmental efforts to expand  		supported employment initiatives and to improve support services for the  		transition from special education to adult life.</p>
<p><i><b>Department Of Social Services (DSS)</b></i></p>
<p>The Bureau of Medical Programs within DSS is responsible for  		administration of the private ICF-MR program and rate-setting for the PRFs  		(which are ICF-MR certified). DSS also administers other programs such as  		foster care that affect DD individuals.</p>
<p><i><b>Division Of Rehabilitation</b></i></p>
<p>The Division of Rehabilitation, within the Department of Social  		Services, provides rehabilitation and vocational services for handicapped  		individuals, including the MR/DD population. Rehabilitation is placing  		increasing emphasis on serving severely disabled individuals. The Division also  		is heavily involved in supported employment initiatives.</p>
<p><i><b>Department Of Health</b></i></p>
<p>The Department of Health surveys and licenses all residential programs  		for the MR/DD population--PRFs, ICFs-MR, nursing homes, and community  		residential facilities--on an annual basis. DDD and the Department of Health  		conduct joint surveys of community residential programs.</p>
<p><i><b>Community Centered Boards (CCBs)</b></i></p>
<p>The 22 CCBs are nonprofit, quasi-governmental bodies responsible for  		providing services to the MR/DD population. CCBs are the single point of entry  		into the DD system. State law in essence gives CCBs a "franchise" to provide  		services in individual catchment areas and requires them to do planning and  		provide case management. Most also provide services directly, in addition to  		contracting with private sector providers. The balance between direct contract  		services varies greatly among CCBs. There also are no uniform requirements as  		to their board composition and governance structure; each is an independent  		501C3 corporation. CCBs are responsible for monitoring and quality assurance of  		their own and contracted programs.</p>
<p><i><b>Interagency Cooperation</b></i></p>
<p>Nearly all respondents reported that cooperation at the division level  		is excellent; most attributed this to strong leadership from division  		directors. For example, DDD, the DD Planning Council, the Division of  		Rehabilitation, and Special Education have worked closely together to develop  		the Rocky Mountain Training Institute which will train providers to develop  		supported employment initiatives. However, some respondents indicated that  		cooperation between DDD and the CCBs, and between CCBs and private providers,  		is not as effective.</p>
<p><i><b>Association for Retarded Citizens (ARC) - Colorado</b></i></p>
<p>The ARC in Colorado acts as an advocate for mentally retarded  		individuals on both the local and state level. Local ARC chapters are not  		extensively involved in service delivery, but have chosen to concentrate on  		advocacy activities.</p>
<p><b>Institutional Services</b></p>
<ul><li>DDD operates 3 Regional Centers for DD individuals:
<ul><li>All are ICF-MR certified.</li>
<li>Current census is 923 (5/5/87).</li>
<li>Population in the Regional Centers has declined from  				approximately 1,600 in 1976</li>
<li>DDD plans to reduce the Regional Center population to 835 by  				September 1987.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Six private ICFs-M R:
<ul><li>Approximately 346 DD people reside in private ICFs-MR. </li>
<li>Average size is 58 beds, with a range of 40-87 beds.</li>
<li>Providers are both for-profit and non-profit.</li>
<li>Private ICFs-MR contract directly with DSS and are licensed by  				the Department of Health.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nursing homes:
<ul><li>In 1986, 510 DD people resided in general purpose nursing homes.  				</li>
<li>A 1984 DDD study found that approximately 68 percent of DD people  				in nursing homes were inappropriately placed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Most respondents agreed that clients served in institutional settings  		  are generally those considered harder to serve than those served in the  		  community:
<ul><li>Approximately 88 percent of clients in PRFs have multiple  				handicaps. In comparison, only 33 percent of CCB program clients have multiple  				handicaps.</li>
<li>Residents of the PRFs are more likely than community DD residents  				to have medical problems or emotional/behavioral disorders.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><b>Community Services</b></p>
<p>Most community-based services are provided through CCBs, either directly  		or by contract with other ASAs. DDD also contracts directly with some providers  		for community services.</p>
<p><i><b>Community Residential Programs</b></i></p>
<p>The community residential system serves approximately 2000 people in a  		variety of settings: follow-along supervision, minimum and moderate supervision  		group homes, intensive developmental group homes, social/emotional group homes,  		and behavior management group homes.</p>
<p>Personal Care Alternatives (PCAs) are waiver-financed residential  		services. The objective of the PCA program is to allow DD individuals to  		establish homes in the community rather than having them "progress" through a  		series of facilities. There are three PCA residential models, with staffing  		varied to meet individual needs. The host home model employs a family to have a  		DD person live in its home. In the peer companion and independent apartment  		models, the client lives with a disabled or nondisabled person, and receives  		the necessary degree of support services.</p>
<p><i>Foster Care</i></p>
<ul><li>Approximately 130 DD children live in DDD-funded foster homes.</li>
<li>Approximately 415 DD children live in DSS-funded foster care. This  		  number includes both voluntary and court-ordered placements. DDD and DSS would  		  prefer not to serve DD children in the regular foster care system.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Non-Residential Services</b></i></p>
<p><i>Respite Care</i></p>
<ul><li>Respite care services include short-term living arrangements to deal  		  with family or provider crises, as well as periodic family relief.</li>
<li>Several respondents reported that respite services are limited.</li>
</ul><p><i>Case Management</i></p>
<ul><li>Recent legislation designated case management as an entitlement for  		  all DD people.</li>
<li>CCBs are the designated case management provider and must provide a  		  determination of eligibility and development of an Individual Habilitation  		  Plan.</li>
<li>Case management services are funded by DDD, but CCBs claim that they  		  provide case management to more people than they are funded for.</li>
</ul><p><i>Supported Employment</i></p>
<ul><li>Supported employment is currently the major priority for vocational  		  programs for MR/DD people. DDD has set a statewide objective that 25 percent of  		  the persons served in adult day services be served in supported employment by  		  January 1988.</li>
<li>DDD, the DD Council, Special Education Services, and the Division of  		  Rehabilitative Services have worked together to develop the Rocky Mountain  		  Training Institute. Initially funded through Rehabilitation and DDD, the  		  Institute will train providers, educators, and employers to expand supported  		  employment services. Colorado has been approved for an OSERS grant to continue  		  the project.</li>
</ul><p><i>Early Childhood Intervention</i></p>
<ul><li>The Department of Education oversees services to more than 3000  		  preschool-aged handicapped children and their families.</li>
<li>In FY 1985, 640 children participated in the infant stimulation  		  program, and 1035 DD children participated in the preschool program. DDD  		  currently funds the early childhood program (services are provided through  		  CCBs), but the Governor has designated the Department of Education as the lead  		  agency to implement P.L. 99-457. DDD expects to transfer authority for the  		  early childhood program to the Department of Education next year.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Family Support</b></i></p>
<p>Respondents indicated that in-home services and other supports to  		families are very weak. Family support is currently limited to a project which  		includes 50 families. </p>
<p><b>General Financing and Service Development Issues</b></p>
<p><i><b>Financing Of Community Services</b></i></p>
<p><i>Federal Funds</i></p>
<ul><li>Medicaid is the major source of Federal funding for MR/DD services.  		  Medicaid funds community based services through the HCB Waiver.</li>
<li>SSI payments and other Federal income transfer payments provide an  		  average of approximately 21 percent of program costs for community residential  		  programs.</li>
</ul><p><i>State Funds</i></p>
<ul><li>DDD's FY 86 budget devoted approximately 65 percent to community  		  services.</li>
<li>FY 86 combined state and Federal expenditures for community services  		  were approximately $51.7 million.</li>
<li>State expenditures for community services were $38 million in  		  FY86.</li>
<li>Between FY 1977 and FY 1986, Federal and state expenditures for  		  community services increased by 57 percent in constant dollars.</li>
</ul><p><i>Local/CCB Funds</i></p>
<ul><li>The CCB match requirement for state funds is 5 percent. However, on a  		  statewide basis, CCB and local funds provide approximately 27 percent of funds  		  for community services.</li>
<li>Some CCBs receive county or municipal funds, and also may supplement  		  state dollars with fundraising, foundation grants, United Way funds, etc. There  		  is tremendous variety among CCBs in funding sources and percentage of local vs.  		  state funds.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>ICF-MR Program</b></i></p>
<p>In FY 1985, approximately 1000 clients resided in ICF-MR facilities  		(including the three Regional Centers). State and Federal ICF-MR expenditures  		were approximately $47 million. Colorado does not use the ICF-MR program to  		finance small community residences.</p>
<p><i><b>Home And Community Based Care Waiver (HCB)</b></i></p>
<p>Colorado has pursued the waiver aggressively. Several respondents  		reported that the initial effect was the refinancing of small ICFs-MR, which  		were converted to Waiverfinanced facilities. Services financed under the Waiver  		include case management, habilitative day and residential programs, respite  		care, personal care, and non-medical alternatives. DDD reports that it will  		soon "reach the limit" with the Waiver; further expansion of Waiver-financed  		services will be limited to people leaving the Regional Centers. The state will  		no longer be able to use the Waiver to address the needs of people on community  		waiting lists.</p>
<p><i><b>CBS Development Costs</b></i></p>
<p>DDD does not provide initial capital funds, so CCBs or private providers  		must usually find money to cover startup costs. However, capital costs are  		usually factored into the reimbursement rate. One respondent suggested that  		funding development costs would tend to encourage dependence on segregated,  		facility-based service models.</p>
<h4>III. Experience With and Development of CBS</h4>
<p><b>Development of CBS in Colorado</b></p>
<p>Community services and the CCBs originally started during the 1960s as  		alternative schools for DD children and sheltered workshops for DD adults. The  		CCBs developed expertise in serving the MR/DD population and were available to  		develop new services when Colorado began to deinstitutionalize DD people from  		the Regional Centers. In addition, services available through the CCB network  		enabled the majority of DD people to remain in their home communities.</p>
<p>In response to the 1975 ICF-MR regulations, DDD chose to reduce the size  		of the Regional Centers' population rather than invest all resources in the  		institutions. The current array of community services was expanded to meet the  		needs of clients coming out of institutions. However, extensive physical plant  		improvements were required to bring the Regional Centers into compliance with  		the regulations.</p>
<p>Several factors played an important role in encouraging the development  		of community services in Colorado. The state's conservative political ideology,  		emphasizing ideals of individualism, family strength and independence, and  		local autonomy, complemented the move to CBS. Community service advocates have  		been able to effectively connect the goals of community services for MR/DD  		people with the state's broader value system. The favorable economic  		circumstances of the 1970s also contributed to the development of CBS. The  		economic climate has worsened, but respondents felt that the need to develop  		low-cost alternatives will continue to encourage community services.</p>
<p><b>Current Emphasis on CBS</b></p>
<p>The consensus among respondents was that Colorado has made significant  		progress in developing and operating community services. Client and budget data  		support these perceptions. Although Colorado has developed a wide array of  		community-based services, interviewees did point out areas where improvement is  		needed, including:</p>
<ul><li>There are waiting lists for residential services in all areas of the  		  state.</li>
<li>Young adults who have left special education programs have difficulty  		  gaining access to services.</li>
<li>Most respondents agreed that appropriate community services for  		  medically fragile clients are inadequate. Several respondents expressed concern  		  about the adequacy of backup services and medical care for severely disabled  		  clients in community settings.</li>
<li>Many community providers, to date, do not have personnel who are  		  trained to deal with behaviorally disturbed clients. People with challenging  		  behaviors are the major source of requests foe admission to the state operated  		  Regional Centers.</li>
<li>Several respondents noted that respite care and family support  		  services are "in their infancy."</li>
<li>The quality and comprehensiveness of services varies greatly  		  throughout the state.</li>
</ul><p><b>Goals for CBS/Issues to be Resolved</b></p>
<p>Nearly all respondents cited similar objectives for the further  		development of community-based services in Colorado. The state will continue to  		reduce the population in the regional centers, with a long-term goal of phasing  		out the Regional Centers. Most respondents agreed that future development  		should emphasize nonfacility-based services such as personal care alternatives,  		supported employment, and family support services. Support for  		nonfacility-based services was based on both programmatic and fiscal interests.  		Avoiding capital investments in facilities and promoting the use of generic  		services may reduce program costs. Developing services which are tied to client  		needs rather than to facilities will allow greater flexibility and  		individualization of services. Cost containment and individualization of  		services were both cited as important goals.</p>
<p>Although most respondents were in agreement about the major goals for  		Colorado's MR/DD system, there was some debate about the most appropriate  		methods for implementing the goals, as well as about the appropriate roles and  		responsibilities of the various actors involved in the system. For example,  		several respondents questioned the independence and effectiveness of  		CCB-provided case management because of CCBs' major role in direct service  		delivery. There also seems to be tension between private providers and CCBs  		(e.g., over CCB control of admissions to private facilities).</p>
<h4>IV. Federal Policy Perspectives</h4>
<p><b>Incentives and Barriers</b></p>
<p>Colorado has been successful in using Title XIX funds to develop and  		operate community-based services. The availability of the HCB Waiver enabled  		and encouraged the state to expand community residential programs. By using the  		waiver so extensively, Colorado has avoided some of the problems other states  		have experienced in using ICF-MR to fund small residential programs. However,  		respondents cited a number of Federal policy problems which act as barriers to  		community services, including:</p>
<ul><li>Current Medicaid policy offers families financial incentives for  		  out-of-home, institutional placements.</li>
<li>Medicaid does not have an overall MR/DD policy: ICF-MR program  		  requirements do not reflect the true service needs of the population.</li>
<li>One official noted that the "guerilla warfare" between HCFA and the  		  states is unproductive and does not offer a good environment for planning or  		  delivering services.</li>
</ul><p><b>Policy Recommendations</b></p>
<p>Many suggestions for Federal policy changes focused on reform to make  		Medicaid funding for MR/DD services more flexible and oriented toward  		Individual needs. For example:</p>
<ul><li>Nearly all respondents expressed qualified support for the CFLAs as a  		  means to correct the institutional bias in the ICF-MR program.</li>
<li>Several respondents suggested creating a unit in HCFA specific to DD  		  and community services.</li>
<li>A few respondents would favor a block-grant approach to funding MR/DD  		  services. However, support for this approach was tempered by concerns about the  		  possibility of future budget cuts.</li>
<li>Several respondents suggested making the services that are available  		  through the HCB Waiver optional services under the state Medicaid plan. This  		  suggestion is motivated by concerns about the temporary nature of the  		  Waiver.</li>
</ul><p>In addition to suggesting changes in the Medicaid program, respondents  		also commented on broader policy issues which require a strong Federal role.  		For example:</p>
<ul><li>Consistency in eligibility, service definitions, and program  		  standards across all programs is needed.</li>
<li>Federal attention to the broader issues of health insurance coverage  		  for disabled people will be helpful.</li>
<li>Respondents also emphasized the need for national policies on  		  disability issues and in support of community integration for DD people.</li>
</ul><h4>V. Summary</h4>
<p><b>General Observations</b></p>
<p>Colorado clearly has made a definite commitment to community services:  		all respondents were in accord with the ideals of community integration for DD  		people. The development of community services was greatly aided by the ability  		of advocates to link their cause with the state's political value system.</p>
<p>The degree of decentralization and high level of local autonomy have  		been important features of Colorado's MR/DD system. The current trend appears  		to be toward a greater degree of central control. DDD has become more  		directive, as well as more stringent with the monitoring process, and seems to  		be attempting to ensure consistency of goals and service quality throughout the  		state. However, CCBs' resistance to central control may be increasing,  		particularly regarding the separation of case management from service delivery.  		CCBs want to continue to provide services directly and do not wish to serve as  		a planning or case management agency.</p>
<p><b>Federal Policy Implications</b></p>
<p>Colorado's extensive use of Title XIX to fund community services  		presents opportunities for Federal policy to influence the future development  		of the community services system. Because Colorado's policy and, to a great  		extent, actual programs are consistent with the objective of community  		integration and independence for MR/DD people, the influence of Federal policy  		could be to encourage Colorado to continue in the direction it has already  		taken and to stimulate the development of those community services (e.g.  		respite care and family support) which are not in place. However, the  		independence and diversity of the CCBs could limit the ability of Federal  		policy to influence actual community-level program implementation in  		Colorado.</p>

<h3>ILLINOIS MR/DD SERVICE SYSTEM</h3>
<h4>I. Overview</h4>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>Illinois has a population of 11.4 million with large urban areas  		surrounding Chicago and St. Louis, MO. The state has major industrial  		development, but a large part of the state is rural. Illinois economy has  		been adversely affected by both the farm crisis and the decline of the  		industrial base.</p>
<p><b>Major System Characteristics</b></p>
<p>Illinois MR/DD system places strong emphasis on congregate  		care--large public residential facilities, large private ICFs-MR, and nursing  		homes. Illinois uses Title XIX to finance the majority of residential services  		through ICF-MR and, to a lesser extent, the Waiver.</p>
<p>The service delivery system is centralized; there is no statewide local  		service entity or MR/DD authority. Regional offices of the state MR/DD agency  		have been closed as part of the agencys austerity program. Private  		providers, both non-profit and proprietary, play a key role in service  		delivery.</p>
<p><b>Issues in Community Service Development</b></p>
<p>Respondents agreed that the major problem in Illinois MR/DD system  		is an overall lack of appropriate community-based services, including all types  		of services and for all types of clients. There are several major barriers to  		the development of a more extensive network of community-based services: the  		high level of investment in large residential facilities; the political  		influence of private providers and nursing home operators; and the  		institutional bias of the ICF-MR program. The availability of the Waiver has  		provided some incentives for community services development, but Illinois has  		not used it extensively.</p>
<p><b>Recommended Policy Changes/Federal Policy Implications</b></p>
<p>The majority of policy recommendations and observations focused on  		Medicaid reform to encourage the development of community-based services.  		Respondents most often suggested using ICF-MR reform as an incentive for states  		to increase community services rather than as a punishment for states who have  		not already done so.</p>
<p>There is potential for Federal policy changes to have an effect in  		Illinois because of the centralized decision making structure and the state's  		dependence on the ICF-MR program to fund services.</p>
<h4>II. Service System Profile</h4>
<p><b>Major Actors in the MR/DD Service System</b></p>
<p><i><b>Department Of Mental Health And Developmental Disabilities  		(DMHDD)</b></i></p>
<p>DMHDD is responsible for the administration and operation of the nine  		state-owned institutions for the developmentally disabled. DMHDD also manages  		the contracts for all privately-operated, DMHDD-funded programs, including  		residential and day programs. The Department recently eliminated regional  		offices which were previously responsible for contract administration and case  		management for some clients; DMHDD's central office has assumed these  		responsibilities. Policy development, budget preparation, and overall quality  		assurance also occur at the state level within DMHDD.</p>
<p><i><b>Governor's Planning Council On Developmental  		Disabilities</b></i></p>
<p>The DD Council is administratively located within DMHDD, but is  		effectively independent and relates primarily to the governor's office. The  		Council includes representatives from: the general public; DMHDD; the  		Departments of Public Aid, Public Health, and Rehabilitative Services; Children  		and Family Services, the State Board of Education; and the Division of Services  		to Crippled Children. DDPC is primarily responsible for policy analysis,  		advocacy, and interagency coordination around issues such as supported  		employment and transition for young adults aging out of special education. The  		Council also is actively involved in providing technical assistance to DD  		providers regarding preparation for HCFA look-behinds.</p>
<p><i><b>Department Of Public Aid (DPA)</b></i></p>
<p>DPA administers a variety of programs affecting MR/DD people. DPA's  		Bureau of Long-Term Care is responsible for rate-setting and Inspection of Care  		for all ICFs-DD (Illinois' term for ICFs-MR), ICFs, and SNFs. (The Department  		of Public Health is responsible for licensing of all ICFs-DD and SNFs/ICFs.)  		DPA also administers services that are not specifically directed toward the DD  		population, but which are important programs for MR/DD people (e.g. SSI).</p>
<p><i><b>Department Of Rehabilitative Services (DORS)</b></i></p>
<p>DORS provides rehabilitation services to the entire disabled population  		based on the degree of functional impairment and the potential for independent  		employment. DORS is the administering agency for Federal Vocational  		Rehabilitation (VR) funds. However, vocational rehabilitation is only one  		component of DORS programs and VR funds make up only about one-third of the  		agency budget. Other divisions include Home Services, Services to Children, and  		Services to the Blind. DORS works with public school special education  		programs, beginning with students at about age 15, to provide independent  		living training and work experiences. DORS also is involved in the supported  		employment initiative.</p>
<p><i><b>Other State Agencies</b></i></p>
<p>The Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) and the Division  		of services to Crippled Children (DSCC) also provide services relevant to the  		MR/DD population--licensing of residential facilities, foster care, and medical  		services.</p>
<p><i><b>Local Government Involvement</b></i></p>
<p>There are three possible mechanisms through which county governments may  		become involved in MR/DD services: "377 Boards" for public health services;  		"553 Boards" for services for "mental deficiency;" and 708 Boards for community  		mental health services. Formation and funding of these boards is optional. From  		a statewide perspective, the role of the county service boards is very limited.  		However, county service boards are significant in some areas of the state,  		especially in the southern, rural counties. The local government role in direct  		service provision is limited by requirements that a county service board  		"spin-off" programs to other providers after the startup period.</p>
<p><i><b>Interagency Cooperation</b></i></p>
<p>Respondents reported that the various state departments and agencies are  		involved in many joint projects and planning processes. For example:</p>
<ul><li>DORS and DMHDD are working together on supported employment, and also  		  are working to clarify responsibilities regarding vocational services.</li>
<li>DMHDD, DORS, and the State Board of Education are cooperating to  		  improve transition services for students graduating from specially  		  education.</li>
<li>DDPC and DPA provide joint technical assistance services for DD  		  facility operators.</li>
<li>DDPC, DMHDD, and the State Board of Education operate pilot early  		  intervention projects for DD children younger than 3 years.</li>
<li>Respondents indicated that DPA's goals for the ICF-MR program are not  		  always consistent with other agencies goals (e.g., regarding community  		  Integration and least restrictive environment) </li>
</ul><p><i><b>Private Sector Involvement</b></i></p>
<p>Private sector providers--both proprietary and non-profit--are an  		integral part of the Illinois' MR/DD service system. Nearly all services  		outside the PRFs are provided through private facilities and agencies. Local  		ARC chapters are frequently involved in service operation and ARC-Illinois  		often is perceived as a provider representative rather than primarily as a  		client advocacy organization.</p>
<p><b>Institutional Services</b></p>
<p>DMHDD operates nine public residential facilities which range in size  		from 100 to 800 beds. The state-operated institutions serve a total of  		approximately 4,500 clients. All beds are either ICF-MR or SNF certified. In  		addition to the 9 PRFs, approximately 4,200 clients reside in large private  		ICFs-DD. Most PRF beds are ICF-MR certified, but several facilities, both  		public and private, were temporarily decertified on look-behinds. DMHDD  		decertified one PRF voluntarily. (The Department of Public Health is  		responsible for licensing and certification of ICFs-DD and nursing homes. DPA  		conducts Inspections of Care.)</p>
<p>Approximately 3,000 DD people live in SNFs and ICFs. According to the  		DDPC, approximately 2,800 of these nursing home residents are inappropriately  		placed and are not receiving the necessary habilitative services. SNF-Pediatric  		facilities serve 1,000 clients, some of whom are over the age of 22. Severely  		disabled children also reside in Child Care Institutions which range in size  		from 50 to 100 beds. Approximately 600 DD children live in these facilities,  		which are licensed by DCFS and funded by DMHDD.</p>
<p>Most respondents indicated that residents of both public and private  		institutions are generally hard to serve clients with severe mental  		retardation, multiple handicaps, behavior disorders, or dual diagnosis of  		mental illness and mental retardation. However, some severely disabled and hard  		to serve clients are participating in community programs, and several  		respondents noted that many institutional residents could be served in the  		community. Although Illinois has not yet been able to significantly reduce the  		population in large institutions, DMHDD personnel pointed out that they have  		been able in recent years to prevent admission of children to the state  		operated facilities.</p>
<p><b>Community Services</b></p>
<p><i><b>Residential Services</b></i></p>
<p>Although Illinois has developed a range of residential and  		non-residential services on the community level, the emphasis--in terms of both  		expenditures and client placements--is clearly on institutional settings.</p>
<p>The range of options and number of clients residing in less restrictive  		community settings has increased significantly over the past decade. Community  		residential programs funded by DMHDD include:</p>
<ul><li>Home Individual Programs (HIPs) serve no more than 2 clients in each  		  program. In FY 1987, approximately 160 clients resided in HIPs.</li>
<li>Community Residential Alternatives (CRAs) are group homes for no more  		  than 8 adults. CRAs serve approximately 700 clients.</li>
<li>Community Living Facilities (CLFs) are large group homes which serve  		  an average of 20 adult clients. CLFs serve a total of approximately 700  		  clients.</li>
<li>Childrens Group Homes, facilities of 5 to 10 beds, serve  		  approximately 100 DD children.</li>
<li>Supported Living Arrangements serve more than 1,000 DD people.</li>
<li>Special Home Placements--foster care homes for adults and children  		  serve approximately 100 DD people. One of the fastest growing areas is ICFs-DD  		  for 15 or fewer people. Approximately 400 clients currently reside in small  		  ICFs-DD. DMHDD personnel reported that 400 new beds in the ICF-MR &lt; 15  		  category are under construction and another 200 are awaiting Certificate of  		  Need approval.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Non-Residential Services</b></i></p>
<p><i>Case Management/Case Coordination</i></p>
<p>DMHDD funds case management services for approximately 8,600 clients  		through 72 provider agencies throughout the state. With the exception of only  		one agency, all case management providers operate other services for DD people  		as well. DMHDD plans call for movement toward an independent case management  		system.</p>
<p><i>Day Programs</i></p>
<ul><li>Developmental Training I and II programs (DT I and DT II) provide  		  training in functional skills for daily living, and also provide functional  		  skills training. DT I and DT II are funded by DMHDD, DPA, and local education  		  agencies, and serve more than 1,200 DD clients.</li>
<li>Vocational Development programs involve time-limited services  		  directed toward placing clients in competitive employment. Vocational  		  Development, funded by DMHDD and DORS, serves approximately 2,400 DD  		  people.</li>
<li>Regular Work programs offer sheltered employment for clients who are  		  judged to require a high degree of supervision. DMHDD and DORS fund Regular  		  Work programs for approximately 6000 clients.</li>
<li>The supported employment demonstration project funded through DORS  		  serves approximately 300 adults throughout the state. DMHDD also funds  		  supported employment projects.</li>
</ul><p><i>Home Services</i></p>
<p>DORS administers a Home Services program for people with disabilities,  		including some MR/DD people. Services include personal care aides, home health  		aides, nurses, and respite care. The program serves disabled people from birth  		to age 60 with the objective of allowing people to remain in their own homes.  		State general revenue funds support the Home Services program.</p>
<p><i>Respite Care</i></p>
<p>DMHDD funds approximately $4 million In respite care services through  		general funds and the Medicaid waiver.</p>
<p><i>Family Support</i></p>
<p>DMHDD funds client and family support services for approximately 7,000  		DD people and their families.</p>
<p><i>Early Intervention</i></p>
<p>DMHDD, the DD Council, and the State Board of Education operate early  		intervention programs for 6,500 DD children from birth to age 3. </p>
<p><b>General Financing Service Development Issues</b></p>
<p><i><b>ICF-MR Program</b></i></p>
<p>Illinois depends heavily on Title XIX for funding residential services.  		ICF-MR funds PRFs, large/medium sized private ICFs-DD, and small private  		ICFs-DD. Illinois ICF-MR, ICF, and SNF rates are among the lowest in the  		nation. HCFA look-behinds have found significant deficiencies, particularly in  		regard to lack of active treatment, in Illinois facilities--both public and  		private. However, most respondents described the look-behinds as "the best  		thing that could have happened." After HCFA personnel identified areas and  		facilities with serious deficiencies, the possibility of decertification and  		loss of Federal funds spurred the legislature to appropriate the funds needed  		to correct the deficiencies.</p>
<p><i><b>Waiver Experience</b></i></p>
<p>Illinois implemented its HCS Waiver in FY 1985. The primary purpose of  		the Waiver was to begin to reduce the population in state operated  		institutions. Illinois has been unable to use its Waiver to the extent  		anticipated; the Waiver was approved for 1,500 people but currently serves only  		648 people. Respondents offered several explanations:</p>
<ul><li>Zoning problems at the local level</li>
<li>Public resistance to community residential programs</li>
<li>Lack of startup funds and technical assistance</li>
</ul><p>Services provided under the Waiver:</p>
<ul><li>DT I and DT II</li>
<li>Case management</li>
<li>Respite care</li>
<li>A variety of residential options: Special Home Placements, CLFs,  		  CRAs, and HIPs</li>
<li>Habilitation services</li>
</ul><p>Although the Waiver has not been used to the fullest possible extent,  		respondents from DMHDD felt that it has been beneficial:</p>
<ul><li>Some people have moved out of the institutions.</li>
<li>Providers have gained experience serving more disabled clients.</li>
</ul><p>Illinois has applied for a renewal of its Waiver. The new Waiver will  		provide case coordination, deinstitutionalization, and relocation of people in  		SNFs and ICFs. DD people living in their family homes also will be  		eligible.</p>
<p>One respondent commented that it will be difficult to get people out of  		SNFs, ICFs, and large ICFs-DD with the Waiver because the reimbursement rates  		in these facilities are so low that the cost of community services for these  		clients would be higher than costs in ICFs-DD and nursing homes, and the Waiver  		requires cost saving or cost neutrality on an individual basis.</p>
<p>The Division of Services to Crippled Children administers a waiver for  		medically fragile, technology dependent children. This waiver provides home  		health and other services as an alternative to hospital or SNF care for  		approximately 60 severely disabled children.</p>
<p><i><b>CBS Development Costs</b></i></p>
<p>In general, DMHDD and Title XIX do not cover initial capital costs, so  		potential providers must finance initial startup costs through other means (e.  		g. bank loans). However, reimbursement rates do include the costs of repayment  		of such loans.</p>
<h4>III. Experience with/Development of CBS</h4>
<p><b>Development of CBS in Illinois</b></p>
<p>All respondents characterized Illinois as a "congregate care state" and  		agreed that Illinois has not made significant progress in establishing a  		comprehensive and extensive network of community-based services for MR/DD  		people. Most of the development that has occurred has been limited to a few  		areas of the state. However, the HCB Waiver did provide some impetus and a  		framework for CBS development:</p>
<p>Respondents attributed Illinois' failure to develop CBS to a variety of  		factors:</p>
<ul><li>Lack of a strong philosophical commitment to community services at  		  either the state or community level</li>
<li>Lack of unified, grassroots advocacy for community services--families  		  have not pushed for community services</li>
<li>No Federal court involvement (although the ARC and other advocates  		  are now considering a possible class action suit)</li>
<li>Strong opposition from pro-institution parents, unions,  		  communities</li>
<li>Influence of a very strong and effective provider lobby</li>
<li>Absence of a local delivery system, and no tradition of local  		  government involvement in human services</li>
<li>General lack of resources--budgetary priorities have been in other  		  areas</li>
</ul><p>Most respondents felt that some of these problems were beginning to  		lessen, creating a better environment for expanding community services. For  		example, the leadership at DMHDD is committed to the development of more  		community services.</p>
<p><b>Gaps in CBS</b></p>
<p>The general consensus among respondents was that the major gap is an  		<b>overall</b> lack of appropriate community services for the MR/DD population,  		rather than any <b>particular</b> services. Several respondents noted that even  		when an array of services is available at the community level, gaining access  		to services is difficult because there is no single point of entry into the  		system. Specific problem areas mentioned include:</p>
<ul><li>Residential options of all kinds</li>
<li>Case management/coordination</li>
<li>Day programs--especially for young adults exiting special  		  education</li>
<li>Programs for hard-to-serve clients (e.g. behaviorally impaired and  		  dually diagnosed)</li>
<li>Great variation throughout the state in quality and availability of  		  services</li>
<li>DMHDD and DPA eligibility criteria do not all include all nonmentally  		  retarded DD individuals</li>
</ul><p><b>Goals for CBS/Issues to be Resolved</b></p>
<p>Most respondents agreed that the major goals for the future development  		of CBS include:</p>
<ul><li>Implementation of a service model with independent case management as  		  the core</li>
<li>Expansion of case management services</li>
<li>Expansion and improvement of supported employment, family support  		  services, and transition from school to work</li>
<li>Relocation of MR/DD people in SNFs and ICFs</li>
<li>Compliance with Federal ICF-MR standards</li>
</ul><p>Factors that will affect the achievement of these goals include:</p>
<ul><li>The ability of advocates to broaden the base of public support</li>
<li>Obtaining necessary resources, in particular the legislature's  		  support for CBS appropriations and initiatives</li>
<li>Ability of agencies to work together</li>
<li>A state legislative mandate for community services</li>
<li>The state's economy</li>
</ul><h4>IV. Federal Policy Perspectives</h4>
<p><b>Incentives and Barriers</b></p>
<p>Several respondent's expressed the view that ICF-MR's bias toward  		institutional settings (e.g., restrictive standards for small facilities) has  		encouraged Illinois to continue to rely on large public and private facilities.  		The degree to which the institutional nature of the Illinois ICF-MR program  		results from Federal requirements or DPA interpretations of those requirements  		was unclear. The expenditures required to meet ICF-MR standards and implement  		plans of correction, as well as the high level of financial and emotional  		investment in congregate care facilities, act as a barrier to developing  		community services. In addition, the political strength of the provider and  		nursing home lobby has discouraged Illinois from expanding community-based  		services. Respondents felt that the waiver has been helpful in providing an  		incentive for community services.</p>
<p><b>Policy Recommendations</b></p>
<p>Most suggestions for Federal policy changes pertained to Medicaid  		reform:</p>
<ul><li>Nearly all respondents acknowledged that supporting CFLA or any other  		  option that would reduce money spent on institutional care would be politically  		  difficult because of the high level of investment in institutions and the  		  strength of the provider and nursing home lobby.</li>
<li>Most respondents suggested establishing some type of differential  		  reimbursement for community services, creating an incentive to expand community  		  services.</li>
<li>Several people stressed that Federal policies which are punitive or  		  state that congregate care is wrong would only succeed in mobilizing opposition  		  to community services.</li>
<li>Several respondents would support separation of MR/DD services from  		  the rest of Medicaid.</li>
<li>DMHDD and DPA personnel suggested that HCFA finalize the new ICF-MR  		  standards and make a clear statement supporting the use of Title XIX for small  		  facilities. Another interviewee suggested that habilitation be defined to  		  include vocational services.</li>
</ul><p>Other comments on Federal policy included:</p>
<ul><li>Eligibility definitions should be more consistent across programs and  		  should be clarified.</li>
<li>Programs should not be separated by disability--this only creates  		  competition for limited resources among disability groups.</li>
<li>Long-term planning for programs with any amount of Federal financial  		  participation is often difficult because state agencies do not know what their  		  appropriation will be from year to year. The official who made this comment  		  suggested that the level of FFP be guaranteed when programs are  		  authorized.</li>
</ul><h4>V. Summary</h4>
<p><b>General Observations</b></p>
<ol><li>Illinois' dependence on large institutions and the political strength  		  of community service opponents will continue to slow the development of  		  community services. Significant change is unlikely to occur without some  		  external encouragement.</li>
<li>Although Illinois has long-standing emphasis on large facilities, the  		  system has started to move toward community services. All respondents were very  		  supportive of the concepts of community integration, individualized services,  		  etc. With the exception of the supported employment initiative, interest seems  		  to be focused on facility-based services and the ICF-MR program.</li>
<li>The centralized nature of the service delivery system may increase  		  the state's opportunities to implement major policy changes.</li>
</ol><p><b>Federal Policy Implications</b></p>
<ol><li>The heavy use of Medicaid provides opportunities for Federal policy  		  to influence change in Illinois. The absence of a strong local government role  		  is problematic: Federal policy decisions would not be diluted by another level  		  of implementation/interpretation, but the lack of local community input into  		  and ownership of programs could impede effective service delivery.</li>
<li>Federal policy changes which threaten to reduce FFP, or explicitly or  		  implicitly condemn the choices Illinois has made, will probably not be helpful,  		  and will only succeed in raising opposition.</li>
<li>The strong support for HCFA look-behinds underlines the importance of  		  an effective Federal "watchdog" role.</li>

<h3>MICHIGAN MR/DD SYSTEM</h3>
<h4>I. Overview</h4>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>Michigan has a population of approximately 9 million with a large urban  		concentration around Detroit. The state has significant rural and agricultural  		areas, but also Is heavily industrialized. Michigan's economy was severely  		affected by the recession of the early 1980s and has not completely  		recovered.</p>
<p><b>Major System Characteristics</b></p>
<p>Michigan's MR/DD system is frequently described as a national leader in  		the area of CBS. The state has reduced the population of DD Institutions from  		12,000 to approximately 1,650 since the late 1960's. State policy supports  		service delivery in the least restrictive setting and Michigan has undertaken  		innovative, state-funded efforts to assist families with members who have  		disabilities.</p>
<p>Although the Michigan system is characterized by a high degree of  		decentralization--most community services are provided by county-level mental  		health authorities, the lead state agency the Department of Mental Health (DMH)  		plays a strong role in guiding the development and implementation of community  		service policy.</p>
<p>Medicaid is crucial to Michigan's CBS system, providing funding for the  		remaining large public residential facilities and a network of small ICFs-MR,  		and through the clinical services program (part of the state plan) for day  		programming. Michigan has two model waivers and has applied for a HBC Waiver  		which will finance MR/DD services not available under the current state  		Medicaid plan.</p>
<p><b>Issues in Community Service Development</b></p>
<p>Although Michigan has been a leader in developing an extensive system of  		CBS, most respondents agreed that the system must be expanded to provide  		adequate and appropriate services to all MR/DD people in need. Moving toward a  		greater emphasis on integrated settings and individualized services is a major  		goal. The state's ability to obtain a HBC Waiver and to maintain the current  		level of financial support will be the major issues for community services in  		Michigan.</p>
<p><b>Federal Policy Recommendations</b></p>
<p>The majority of respondent's suggestions for Federal policy changes  		concerned Medicaid reform and efforts to alter the institutional bias of  		Medicaid long-term care funding. Informants also commented that a greater  		degree of Federal leadership on issues such as housing, transportation, and  		income maintenance for people with disabilities, and improved coordination of  		services and policymaking among various state and Federal agencies, would be  		helpful.</p>
<h4>II. Service System Profile</h4>
<p><b>Major Actors in the MR/DD Service System</b></p>
<p><i><b>Department of Mental Health (DMH)</b></i></p>
<p>DMH is the lead state' agency providing services to persons with mental  		illness, mental retardation, and some developmental disabilities. DMH's primary  		responsibilities include:</p>
<ul><li>Administration and operation of the eight Regional Centers for  		  Developmental Disabilities (CDDs)</li>
<li>Policy and budget development</li>
<li>Funding and oversight of community mental health programs</li>
<li>Monitoring of ICF-MR certified facilities</li>
<li>Ensuring protection of client rights through the Office of Recipient  		  Rights (ORR)</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Community Mental Health Boards (CMHBs)</b></i></p>
<p>The 55 local CMHBs operate services for persons with mental illness and  		developmental disabilities who live in their home communities. Local CMHBs may  		encompass a single- or multi-county area. Members are appointed by county  		commissioners and must include a variety of community representatives as well  		as county commissioners.</p>
<ul><li>Most CMHBs serve as the single point of entry into the DMH-funded  		  MR/DD service system.</li>
<li>In general, DMH provides 90 percent of funding for CMHB services.  		  County contributions and private fund-raising make up the remainder; however,  		  some residential services are completely funded by DMH.</li>
<li>DMH must approve new CMHB services prior to funding.</li>
<li>The quality and level of MR/DD service varies among CMHBs and depends  		  heavily on individual counties' ability and willingness to provide the local  		  match. CMHBs can only receive the amount of state funds they can match.</li>
<li>Currently not all CMHBs receive 10 percent of their funding from the  		  counties. However, all CMHBs are moving toward a funding structure of a minimum  		  of 10 percent local match funds. In addition, some CMHBs contribute more to the  		  gross program than the 10 percent match. The "excess" local funding is usually  		  used for local priority programs.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Department Of Social Services (DSS)</b></i></p>
<p>DSS is involved in the MR/DD service system through the administration  		of a variety of entitlement programs which benefit DD individuals (e.g., the  		state SSI supplement program, AFDC, General Assistance, foster care for adults  		and children, and adult community placement for people who are not DMH/CMHB  		clients). DSS plays a key role in the community service system through the  		Adult Foster Care (AFC) program. Licensure standards for AFDC homes provide the  		statutory base for the community residential system. DSS also is the single  		state Medicaid agency, administering Title XIX funds through the Medical  		Services Administration (MSA). MSA's activities related to MR/DD services  		Include:</p>
<ul><li>Development and administration of Medicaid waivers</li>
<li>Administration of the state Medicaid plan, including the Mental  		  Health Clinic Services Program, which pays for nonresidential community  		  services for DD people</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Developmental Disabilities Council</b></i></p>
<p>The DD Council is administratively located in DMH. Its membership is  		appointed by the Governor and includes persons with developmental disabilities,  		relatives or guardians of DD people; representatives from DMH, DSS, Michigan  		Rehabilitative Services (MRS), the Department of Public Health (DPH), the  		Department of Education, and the Department of Management and Budget, and  		representatives of local agencies and nongovernmental organizations. The DD  		Council's major responsibilities include:</p>
<ul><li>Advocacy with state agencies, the legislature, and the Governor. The  		  DD Council focuses on systems advocacy rather than individual client  		  representation.</li>
<li>Funding of innovative service development through grants. For  		  example, the Council funded demonstration grants for family support services  		  projects form which practice experience and data were drawn to create the state  		  family support services and family support subsidy programs.</li>
<li>Analysis and policy development also are necessary activities.</li>
</ul><p>The. DD Council also has Regional Interagency Coordinating Committees on  		Developmental Disabilities (RICCs) which provide input to the Council and work  		toward service coordination and problem resolution on the local level.</p>
<p><i><b>Department Of Education--Special Education Services</b></i></p>
<p>Michigan law requires special education services for all handicapped  		individuals from birth through age 25. The primary functions of Special  		Education Services are funding and setting and enforcing standards. Local  		school districts provide services, either directly or through contact with  		neighboring school districts or the Intermediate School District (ISD). The 57  		ISDs, which are combinations of several local school districts, are primarily  		responsible for the development of a plan for the delivery of special education  		services within their boundaries. The ISD also is responsible for monitoring  		and data collection, and may provide direct services.</p>
<p><i><b>Michigan Rehabilitative Services (MRS)</b></i></p>
<p>MRS is located in the Department of Education and is the state  		administering agency for Federal VR funds. MRS has emphasized rehabilitation,  		training, and placement of disabled people in competitive employment, but also  		now is providing leadership for supported employment initiatives as the  		recipient of an OSERS-supported employment grant.</p>
<p><i><b>Michigan Protection And Advocacy Service (P and A)</b></i></p>
<p>P and A is an independent advocate, responsible for ensuring the rights  		of DD and MI people in Michigan. The agency plays a key role in quality  		assurance and monitoring of the MR/DD service system, receiving enough state  		general fund support to make this a viable function. P and A activities  		include:</p>
<ul><li>Continuous service monitoring--P and A can resort to administrative  		  action and litigation to resolve service inadequacies and protect the rights of  		  disabled people.</li>
<li>Acting as a catalyst for legislative and administrative action, and  		  interagency coordination. For example, P and A investigations and Involvement  		  were critical in the development of a DMH/DSS policy preventing the admission  		  of disabled children to nursing homes without going through the Community  		  Mental Health (CMH) system for assessment and evaluation, and exploration of  		  alternative services.</li>
<li>Conducting training and technical assistance for judges and attorneys  		  regarding guardianship laws and alternative sentencing for DD juveniles.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Interagency Cooperation</b></i></p>
<p>Respondents gave mixed reports about the effectiveness of interagency  		coordination. Cooperation between DMH and DSS/MSA (the state Medicaid agency)  		has reportedly been highly successful and instrumental in the development of  		the current array of services. Informants also cited the Michigan Interagency  		Task Force on Disability, DSS/DPH interagency agreements on nursing home  		inspection, licensure, and accreditation, and joint DMH and Department of  		Education efforts on supported employment as examples of interagency  		cooperation. However, a few respondents indicated that there is conflict  		between DMH and the Department of Education regarding the use of segregated  		special education facilities. Relationships between DMH and some CMHBs are  		periodically strained by disagreement over the degree to which DMH should be  		involved in the actual implementation of services at the community level. In  		addition, there is frequently conflict between CMHBs and their county funding  		sources.</p>
<p><i><b>Private Sector Involvement</b></i></p>
<p>Private non-profit agencies are involved in the MR/DD service system  		throughout the state, operating day, vocational, and residential programs. DMH,  		policy prevents residential facilities from being owned and operated by the  		same agency. Private sector providers also are involved outside the DMH/CMH  		system through DSS foster care and voluntary programs, and through non-profit  		vocational services programs which provide employment.</p>
<p><i><b>ARC Michigan</b></i></p>
<p>The Michigan chapter of ARC has played an important role in the  		development of the state's CSB system. Local ARC chapters have operated  		community programs; however, most chapters are reducing their involvement in  		direct service delivery in an effort to strengthen their roles in advocacy and  		monitoring. The ARC obtained a grant from DMH to train parents and other family  		members of MR/DD people to monitor community-based programs. Local ARC chapters  		and the state chapter also have been major participants in SS1/DI training,  		supported employment initiatives, and community integration projects.</p>
<p><b>Institutional Services</b></p>
<p>DMH operates eight Regional CDDs which currently serve approximately  		1,650 residents. The CDD census has declined from more than 12,000 at its peak  		in the late 1960's.</p>
<ul><li>All CDDs are ICF-MR certified.</li>
<li>The DPH is responsible for licensing and certification of CDDs.</li>
<li>DMH is responsible for monitoring and inspection of care.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Nursing Homes</b></i></p>
<ul><li>Private providers operate six SNF-MR facilities with an average size  		  of 25 to 150 beds. These facilities are regulated by DMH, and admissions must  		  be approved by DMH on the basis of functional assessment criteria developed by  		  DPH.</li>
<li>Five nursing homes have closed since 1980. The population in SNF-MR  		  facilities has declined from 1,400 in 1980 to approximately 600 in 1987.</li>
<li>DMH plans call for phasing out SNF/MR facilities and moving residents  		  to less restrictive settings.</li>
<li>DMH and DSS have developed an interagency policy which prohibits the  		  admission of children to nursing homes without going through CMHB assessment  		  and placement process.</li>
</ul><p>Most respondents were in agreement that clients remaining in the PRFs  		are not significantly different from those living in the community. One  		informant commented that clients in the CDDs, for the most part, are there  		because "their turn hasn't come up yet." DD people in nursing homes--and some  		client in CDDs--were acknowledged to have intense medical needs, but  		respondents pointed out that many community programs are serving clients with  		high medical needs successfully. DMH has been able in recent years to prevent  		the admission of children to CDDs.</p>
<p><b>Community Services</b></p>
<p><i><b>Residential Services</b></i></p>
<p>CMHBs and DMH operate a variety of community residential options for DD  		individuals ranging from scattered site, semi-independent living arrangements  		to intensive supervision group homes. Many residential programs are contracted  		by DMH to private sector providers and, in a few cases, to CMHBs. Other  		residential programs are contracted or operated by CMHBs. All residential  		programs which were initiated after 1981 are supported by 100 percent state  		funds. Community residential programs which were in operation before 1981 are  		supported by 90 percent state funds and 20 percent local funds. DMH funds  		residential programs at four levels:</p>
<ul><li>Level I: Semi-independent living arrangements</li>
<li>Level II: Group homes for clients who need a higher degree of  		  supervision, with an emphasis on daily living skills and social skills for  		  independence</li>
<li>Level Ill: Residential facilities for client with a greater degree of  		  impairment--1,000 beds</li>
<li>Level IV: Residential programs for clients who are multiply  		  handicapped or severely impaired, and require a high degree of personal care  		  assistance</li>
<li>The DMH/CMH community residential system also includes specialized  		  residential programs such as programs for autistic children and clients with  		  behavior disorders.</li>
<li>The community residential system has a capacity of approximately  		  4,600 beds.</li>
</ul><p>Alternative Intermediate Services (AIS) are ICF-MR certified facilities  		of four to eight beds which are licensed by the DPH as ICFs-MR and by DSS as  		child care institutions or adult small group foster homes. AIS homes were  		originally developed for placement of clients being moved out of institutions.  		Residents are adults and children who are severely disabled.</p>
<ul><li>AIS homes are privately owned. DMH holds a long-term lease and  		  usually contracts the operation of the program to a non-profit agency other  		  than the home's owner.</li>
<li>AIS home contracts are administered through CDDs. DMH plans to  		  transfer this responsibility to CMHBs which are capable of administering the  		  AIS programs in their service areas.</li>
<li>There are approximately 1800 AIS beds. </li>
</ul><p><i>DSS Residential Services</i></p>
<p>The community residential services provided through DSS (the state  		Social Service agency) and the community-based mental health system are based  		on an adult foster care licensure statute which was enacted in the early 1970's  		and has been amended occasionally since that time. All community residential  		programs must be licensed as foster care homes. Licensure, inspection, and  		monitoring are all handled by state regulatory staff housed in DSS, separate  		from the Adult Community Placement Program which handles placement, case  		management, and protective services for adults in permanent placement who are  		not DMH/CMH clients. Residential placements for DD adults are frequently made  		in Adult Foster Care homes which provide room, board, and a low level of  		supervision. AFC home residents also may participate in CMHB day programs. AFC  		homes are financed through client SSI payments.</p>
<p><i><b>Non-Residential Services</b></i></p>
<p><i>Case Management</i></p>
<ul><li>Case management services are mandated only for those clients in DMH  		  or CMH supported residential placements. DSS requires quarterly contact with  		  Adult Community Placement workers for SSI recipients.</li>
<li>CMHBs may provide case management for clients in all their programs,  		  not just residential facilities.</li>
<li>DMH is responsible for case management for people in CDDs and AIS  		  homes.</li>
<li>Michigan plans to add case management to the state Medicaid plan.  		  Medicaid coverage for case management should increase its availability.</li>
</ul><p><i>Medicaid Mental Health Clinic Services</i></p>
<ul><li>The program includes almost all adult day treatment, habilitative  		  training, and work activity programs for DD and mentally ill clients in those  		  CMHBs which are certified Medicaid providers. (Only one is not.)</li>
<li>Services for DD people include: diagnosis and evaluation;  		  interdisciplinary treatment planning; psychological testing occupational and  		  physical therapy; day programs; speech, language, and hearing therapy;  		  individual and group therapy; crisis intervention; health services;  		  transportation; and medication review.</li>
<li>Services must be provided under the clinical supervision of a  		  Medicaid billable professional (e.g., physician or occupational  		  therapist).</li>
<li>The Mental Health Clinic Services program was originally financed  		  under the Medicaid waiver, but the state Medicaid plan was amended in 1986 to  		  include these services.</li>
</ul><p><i>Supported Employment</i></p>
<ul><li>Michigan has an OSERS grant for supported employment which involves  		  DMH, MRS, Special Education, and the DD Council. The agencies estimate total  		  annual expenditures of $2.6 million for supported employment.</li>
<li>The DD Council also is awarding grants to public and private  		  non-profit agencies to set up supported employment projects and has committed  		  approximately one-third of its supported employment allocation to assist the  		  state interagency initiation.</li>
<li>A report by Western Michigan University estimated that approximately  		  840 people are currently involved in supported employment.</li>
</ul><p><i>Vocational Rehabilitation Services</i></p>
<ul><li>MRS estimates that about 5,000 DD people were placed in competitive  		  employment last year. Many of these people are young adults leaving special  		  education programs.</li>
<li>MRS has tended to focus on time-limited services oriented toward  		  competitive employment, but is now increasing its emphasis on supported  		  employment and services to the severely disabled population.</li>
<li>In FY 1986 MRS was not able to spend its entire Federal VR  		  appropriation because, among other factors, funds needed for the state match  		  were not available.</li>
</ul><p><i>Family Support</i></p>
<p>In 1983, Michigan initiated the Family Support Subsidy program which  		provides nonmeans-tested cash payments to families with disabled children  		(severely multiply impaired, severely mentally impaired, or autistic) under the  		age of 18. Families with an annual income less than $60,000 are eligible to  		receive the subsidy which is based on the level of Federal SSI payments. There  		are no restrictions on how the money is spent.</p>
<ul><li>As of January 1987, approximately 2,700 families were eligible for  		  and receiving the subsidy.</li>
<li>Annual expenditures for the subsidy program are approximately $8  		  million.</li>
<li>State dollars provide 100 percent of the funding for the  		  program.</li>
</ul><p>In 1983, following a series of family support demonstration projects,  		DMH allocated $2 million to CMHBs for the statewide expansion of family support  		services to assist in the preservation of families and to delay or prevent  		out-of-home placements. Age and disability are not restricted as in the Family  		Support Subsidy program. Currently family support services are financed by more  		than $4 million in state general funds.</p>
<p>In addition, nine Independent Living Centers are currently operating in  		Michigan. Services offered to adults with handicaps include information and  		referral, peer counseling, independent living skills training, and  		self-advocacy skills training. However, the Independent Living Centers are not  		a major resource for the mentally retarded population, mainly serving DD people  		who are not mentally retarded and people with later on-set physical  		handicaps.</p>
<p><b>General Financing and Service Development Issues</b></p>
<p><i><b>ICF-MR Program</b></i></p>
<p>CDDs are ICF-MR certified</p>
<ul><li>There are eight CDDs with a total of approximately 1,650 beds</li>
</ul><p>Alternative Intermediate Services</p>
<ul><li>Michigan uses ICF-MR extensively to support community residential  		  facilities, especially for the more severely impaired population.</li>
<li>AIS program was developed as a result of the decision to reduce the  		  population in CODs.</li>
<li>DMH is now dissatisfied with the model. At the time it was developed.  		  the AIS model was progressive, but DMH officials now feel that it is too  		  restrictive and too medical in nature.</li>
<li>DMH and MSA respondents did not report any current problems with  		  look-behinds.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Waiver Experience</b></i></p>
<ul><li>Michigan originally applied for and had approved the 1915(b) Medicaid  		  case management waiver, including clinic services for the mentally ill and  		  MR/DD populations. Application for the waiver was in part motivated by the need  		  to retain as much Federal funding as possible for people coming out of the  		  institutions.</li>
<li>After the initial waiver period, HCFA did not approve a renewal  		  because of issues related to demonstration of cost-effectiveness and coverage  		  of habilitation services for DD people. HCFA agreed to allow clinic services as  		  an amendment to the state Medicaid plan.</li>
<li>Michigan has applied for a HCB Waiver which, if approved, will cover  		  additional DD services not included in the Clinic Services program. If the  		  application is approved, DMH plans to decertify a number of AIS facilities and  		  fund them through the Waiver.</li>
<li>DMH, DSS, and DPH also have model waivers--"Katie Beckett" waivers  		  limited to 50 clients--to serve severely disabled clients and  		  technology-dependent children.</li>
</ul><p>Overall, Michigan is very dependent on Title XIX for funding community  		services and has been extremely successful in making Medicaid and ICF-MR work  		in the community. This success can be at least partially attributed to  		effective cooperation between DMH and DSS.</p>
<h4>III. Experience with/Development of CBS</h4>
<p><b>Development of CBS in Michigan</b></p>
<p>Michigan began to reduce the population in its large institutions in the  		early 1970's. The Plymouth Center class action lawsuit led to a far-reaching  		consent decree mandating deinstitutionalization. Michigan also established the  		CMHB system in 1964, creating a local level service delivery system. Also,  		Michigan's response to the 1976 ICF-MR regulations was the decision to develop  		the AIS program and to reduce the population in CDDs, rather than upgrade the  		CDDs.</p>
<p>Informants listed several factors which contributed to Michigan's  		development of CBS:</p>
<ul><li>Michigan has traditionally been very progressive in human services.  		  One respondent described the state as "people-oriented."</li>
<li>Advocacy for community services by families, the ARC, and other  		  advocacy organizations has been strong and effective.</li>
<li>One respondent commented that the effort to establish community  		  services occurred when the state had the economic resources to support the  		  effort. Michigan experienced a severe recession in the late 1970s and early  		  1980s, but was able to maintain the commitment to community services because  		  service systems had already been established.</li>
<li>Leadership from DMH, the governor, and legislature played a key role.  		  Informants cited examples of a "forward-thinking" DMH director during the  		  1960s, a supportive governor who was in office for 14 years, and the current  		  governor, now in his second term.</li>
<li>Although unions are powerful in Michigan, public employee opposition  		  to reducing the population of the PRFs has not been a major barrier. This may  		  be partially the result of the state's efforts to offer other state employment  		  and retraining to dislocated workers.</li>
</ul><p><b>Current Emphasis on Community Services</b></p>
<p>Michigan has made a clear policy commitment to CBS. Serving DD people in  		their home communities is assumed to be the standard, not an extraordinary  		situation. Most out-of-home, residential placements are made-in  		non-institutional settings, although residential programs may not always  		achieve ideals of community integration. Currently state policy is trying to  		move toward a greater emphasis on individualized services and support to  		families.</p>
<p><b>Gaps in Community Services</b></p>
<p>The consensus among respondents was that although Michigan has been  		successful in developing a wide range of community services for MR/DD people  		and moving people out of institutions, the system does not serve everyone in  		need adequately and appropriately. For example, approximately 1,700 DD people  		remain in CDDs; DMH personnel pointed out that the community-based system does  		not yet have the capacity to serve all DD people who have never been in  		Institutions, much less those who are still there. In addition, the level and  		quality of services available varies tremendously throughout the state,  		depending on Individual CMHBs interest in DD services and counties' ability and  		willingness to fund services.</p>
<p>Specific problem areas include:</p>
<ul><li>Residential services for adults living with aging parents, as well as  		  adults living at home for whom greater independence is appropriate</li>
<li>Services for young children with high health care needs</li>
<li>Age-appropriate services to young adults who have left school</li>
<li>Respite care--one informant commented that improvements in respite  		  care could be the most important service for families</li>
<li>Case management</li>
<li>Supported employment and vocational services</li>
<li>Family support services</li>
<li>Lack of public transportation--a major barrier to community  		  integration and community employment</li>
<li>Access to general health care and health insurance </li>
</ul><p><b>Goals for CBS/Issues to be Resolved</b></p>
<p>In general, respondents agreed on the service goals and policy  		directions Michigan should pursue. The most important long-range objectives are  		to develop the capacity to provide adequate and appropriate service to all DD  		individuals in need, to improve cooperation and coordination in the service  		system, and to equalize the level and quality of service across the state.  		Specific goals include:</p>
<ul><li>Expanding supported employment to offer the opportunity to all DD  		  people who want to participate</li>
<li>Expand residential services, but not using the AIS model</li>
<li>Improve interagency coordination around the transition issue</li>
<li>Expand family support services, especially respite care</li>
<li>Reduce the use of segregated special education facilities</li>
<li>Maintain an ongoing effort to prevent institutionalization</li>
<li>Improve the scope and quality of services in those geographic areas  		  which have not been progressive or lack resources</li>
<li>Broaden the base of public support and coordinate advocacy activities  		  among interest groups</li>
<li>Develop services aimed at improving social skills for community  		  integration and skills for independent living</li>
<li>Increase the role of clients and their families in monitoring and  		  planning future program models.</li>
</ul><h4>IV. Federal Policy Perspectives </h4>
<p><b>Incentives/Barriers</b></p>
<p>State agency personnel commented that although there are some problems  		with Medicaid, Michigan has generally been able to use Title XIX funds to  		pursue its goals. Michigan's success in using Medicaid to support community  		services was partially attributed to good relationships between DMH and MSA and  		with HCFA regional office personnel. However, respondents did state that  		Federal Medicaid policy does impose some barriers to expansion and improvement  		of CBS:</p>
<ul><li>ICE-MR focuses on facilities--"bricks and mortar"--not individual  		  service needs.</li>
<li>Medicaid does not always allow reimbursement for services in the  		  community that are paid for If the client is in an institution.</li>
<li>Medicaid does not readily fund less intrusive services.</li>
<li>Use of Title XIX funds adds to the administrative burden and imposes  		  an unnecessary medical/professional bias on some services.</li>
</ul><p>Regarding Federal policy In general, respondents noted that the majority  		of Federal funds for disabled people focuses on maintaining dependence rather  		than fostering Independence.</p>
<p><b>Policy Recommendations</b></p>
<p>The majority of respondents' suggestions for changes in Federal policy  		focused on Medicaid funding; comments dealt with general Medicaid reform issues  		and regulatory issues:</p>
<ul><li>Nearly all respondents expressed strong support for CFLA.</li>
<li>Several Informants suggested that ICF-MR should change to a  		  habilitative rather than health care model and that HCFA should establish an  		  office to focus on habilitation and community services, perhaps for all  		  disability groups.</li>
<li>Several respondents recommended that discussions regarding Medicaid  		  reform should not focus on the institutional model as the reference point in  		  terms of service and cost comparisons.</li>
<li>Informants also commented that Medicaid reform along the lines of  		  CFLA should recognize the differences among states--i.e., that some states have  		  not yet developed an extensive system of community services and will need more  		  time and financial and technical assistance to do so.</li>
<li>DMH personnel suggested that Medicaid reform proposals should not  		  assume that greater state flexibility will automatically lead to cost  		  increases. These respondents pointed out that some states do not take advantage  		  of the flexibility that is already available.</li>
<li>Respondents wanted more consistency among regulations, HCFA central  		  and regional offices, and program auditors.</li>
<li>DMH personnel opposed regulations requiring small ICFs-MR to comply  		  with the same staffing requirements as large facilities, as well as  		  requirements for a minimum of 4 people living together to receive Title XIX  		  long term care funding.</li>
</ul><p>Other suggestions:</p>
<ul><li>Create SSDI work incentive paralleling changes for SSI.</li>
<li>Improve enforcement of P.L. 94-142 standards.</li>
<li>Strengthen Federal role regarding standards and availability for  		  housing and transportation.</li>
<li>Increase Federal encouragement of coordination among state agencies  		  (e.g., similar to the requirements for supported employment grants).</li>
<li>Increase Federal support for maternal and child health  		  services-primary prevention.</li>
<li>Clarify Federal regulations for Adult Basic Education (ABE) to  		  emphasize that severely disabled people are eligible for ABE services.  		  Respondents felt that states have sometimes interpreted the ABE program too  		  narrowly.</li>
<li>One informant commented that vigorous Federal and state oversight  		  will be especially important for CBS because the population and services will  		  be dispersed and difficult to monitor.</li>
<li>One respondent suggested that HHS and the Department of Education  		  should combine services for the handicapped because current programs and  		  policies are too fragmented.</li>
<li>Several informants noted that clear policy direction and strong  		  Federal leadership do help to "move the system" (e.g., Supported Employment  		  Initiatives).</li>
</ul><h4>V. Summary</h4>
<p><b>General Observations</b></p>
<p>An overall view of Michigan's MR/DD system shows the state's commitment  		to CBS. State policy supports clearly the concept of service delivery in the  		least restricted setting: most residential placements are made in  		noninstitutional settings; state funds are used in the Family Support Services  		and Subsidy programs to enable families to keep disabled children at home; and  		the CMHB system provides a mechanism for local level service delivery.</p>
<p>However, actual implementation does not always achieve stated policy  		goals: more than 1,600 clients remain in the DD institutional system; education  		services for severely disabled children are provided in segregated settings;  		and a DD person's access to adequate and appropriate service depends heavily on  		where he/she lives.</p>
<p>Although respondents concurred with the assessment of Michigan's MR/DD  		system as progressive, they readily offered criticisms and pointed out gaps in  		the service system. For example, several respondents expressed dissatisfaction  		with the AIS/MR model, and nearly all informants commented that Michigan needs  		to begin to develop more individualized community services and options for  		supported independence.</p>
<p><b>Implications for Federal Policy</b></p>
<p>Michigan's extensive use of Title XIX funds to support CBS offers  		opportunities for Federal policy to influence future developments in MR/DD  		services. Michigan does not need Federal encouragement or the threat of Federal  		penalties to emphasize community services. However, the state's need to  		increase Federal financial participation in ASR/DD services would allow Federal  		policy changes to accelerate the Michigan system's move toward goals of  		community integration and individualized services.</p>

<h3>NEBRASKA MR/DD SERVICE SYSTEM</h3>
<h4>I. Overview</h4>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>Nebraska has a population of approximately 1.6 million. There is a large  		urban concentration around Omaha in the Eastern part of the state. The overall  		character of the state is rural, with some very isolated areas. The economy is  		heavily dependent on agriculture and has suffered from the crisis in the farm  		economy. Nebraska has a unicameral legislature with only 49 members. The state  		has traditionally been fiscally and politically conservative.</p>
<p>The Office of Mental Retardation (OMR) estimates that approximately  		12,600 people in Nebraska meet the clinical definition for mental retardation.  		This figure does not accurately reflect the size of the population in need of  		services; not all individuals who would meet the clinical definition of mental  		retardation are in need of specialized services. In addition, the OMR estimate  		does not include the nonretarded, developmentally disabled population. Current  		data Indicate that approximately 4,600 people in Nebraska receive specialized  		mental retardation services.</p>
<p><b>Major System Characteristics</b></p>
<p>Nebraska's MR/DD system is characterized by a strong degree of emphasis  		on CBS. Deinstitutionalization and the development of CBS began in Nebraska in  		the late 1960's--much earlier than in other states. Unlike many other states  		which have been progressive in establishing CBS, Nebraska does not use ICF-MR  		for small residential facilities and has not implemented its HCB Waiver. The  		Nebraska system also is distinguished by its almost exclusive use of public  		sector providers. </p>
<p><b>Issues in Community Service Development</b></p>
<p>Although Nebraska has succeeded in developing an extensive system of  		CBS, several major issues will affect further progress:</p>
<ul><li>Ability to maintain the current level of funding in light of the  		  state's poor economy</li>
<li>Dissension regarding the need for changes in the current service  		  delivery structure</li>
<li>Efforts to establish a stronger emphasis on family support and  		  Individualized services</li>
<li>Expansion of eligibility criteria to include the nonmentally  		  retarded, developmentally disabled</li>
</ul><p><b>Federal Policy Perspectives</b></p>
<p>Most respondents' comments regarding Federal policy centered on Medicaid  		reform and the problems with the current ICF-MR program. Suggestions for  		Medicaid reform focused on the need for more flexibility and an individualized  		service orientation, rather than a facility orientation.</p>
<h4>II. Service System Profile</h4>
<p><b>Major Actors in the MR/DD Service System</b></p>
<p><i><b>Department Of Public Institutions (DPI)</b></i></p>
<p>DPI is responsible for the provision of services to mentally retarded  		and developmentally disabled individuals, mentally ill people, alcohol and drug  		abusers, ill and aged veterans, and visually impaired individuals. Services  		specific to mentally retarded individuals include the operation of Beatrice  		State Developmental Center and administrative oversight of the OMR.</p>
<p><i><b>Office Of Mental Retardation (OMR)</b></i></p>
<p>OMR is located within the Department of Public Institutions. Its primary  		mission is to coordinate and oversee the community mental retardation services  		system. Within that capacity, OMR carries out the following tasks:</p>
<ul><li>Development of systems plan, outlining long-term policy issues</li>
<li>Development of strategic plans, identifying goals and formulating  		  plans for achieving those goals</li>
<li>Development of budget proposal for legislature</li>
<li>Budget/program approval and funding of regional programs</li>
<li>Quality assurance and monitoring of regional programs</li>
<li>Limited degree of direct contracting for CBS</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Regional Governing Boards (RGB)</b></i></p>
<p>The six RGBs for mental retardation services are composed of county  		commissioner representatives from each of the counties contained in the region.  		The regions are responsible for the administration and operation of CBS for  		mentally retarded people in their regions. RGBs do not have taxing authority;  		budget requests are approved by the participating counties. Responsibilities of  		the regional programs include:</p>
<ul><li>Planning, policy setting, and budget development for community  		  services</li>
<li>Administration and operation of local programs</li>
<li>Monitoring and quality assurance</li>
<li>Although OMR nominally reviews and must approve regional budgets,  		  plans, and programs, the regions have considerable autonomy in program design  		  and implementation. Regions lobby the legislature directly for budget approval  		  and appropriations are made specifically for regional and local area  		  programs.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Department Of Social Services (DSS)</b></i></p>
<p>DSS's major role is the administration and operation of a number of  		entitlement programs which affect the MR/DD population. DSS also supervises a  		number of social programs which are not specifically directed toward the MR/DD  		population, but do serve MR/DD individuals. Specific responsibilities  		include:</p>
<ul><li>Administration of the ICF-MR program (the Department of Health is  		  responsible for licensure and certification of ICFs-MR)</li>
<li>Administration of Title XX funds</li>
<li>Licensing and monitoring of Adult Family Homes for mentally retarded  		  adults and foster homes for some mentally retarded children</li>
<li>Administration of the state SSI supplement program</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Governor's Planning Council On Developmental  		Disabilities</b></i></p>
<p>The Developmental Disabilities (DD) Council is located within the  		Department of Health. Its major functions are planning, systems advocacy, and  		service monitoring. The DD Council has volunteer advisory councils in each of  		the six regions which assist with planning, local advocacy, and grant  		evaluation. Other responsibilities include:</p>
<ul><li>Development of the DD plan which tries to identify areas of high  		  unmet need and devise innovative strategies for dealing with problem areas</li>
<li>Monitoring of legislative and regulatory changes which affect people  		  with disabilities</li>
<li>Funding of special projects</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Advocacy Group Involvement</b></i></p>
<p>ARC-Nebraska was instrumental in the initial development of CBS in  		Nebraska. The ARC remains a strong influence on policy decision in the state.  		The Mental Retardation Association of Nebraska favors maintaining Beatrice  		State Developmental Center and the ICFs-MR.</p>
<p><b>Institutional Services</b></p>
<p>Although Nebraska has developed a comprehensive network of CBS, more  		than 800 mentally retarded people reside in large, congregate care settings,  		which include:</p>
<ul><li>DPI operates the Beatrice State Developmental Center, an ICF-MR  		  certified facility serving approximately 470 residents.</li>
<li>Private ICF-MR providers:
<ul><li>Martin Luther Home Society operates one 146 bed ICF-MR. </li>
<li>Bethphage Mission operates two ICFs-MR with a total of 208  				residents.</li>
<li>Omaha Developmental Center is a 49 bed ICF-MR.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A total of 840 clients are ICF-MR residents.</li>
<li>A small number of mentally retarded people are served at the Nebraska  		  Psychiatric Institute.</li>
</ul><p>Respondents indicated that although there may be a higher proportion of  		severely disabled clients in the ICFs-MR, the community programs also serve  		many severely disabled individuals. A few respondents indicated that the  		institutional programs serve those people community programs are unable or  		unwilling to serve, such as:</p>
<ul><li>An increasing number of children are entering ICFs-MR because most  		  regional programs emphasize adults.</li>
<li>The regions serve mentally retarded individuals, not the overall  		  developmentally disabled population.</li>
</ul><p><b>Community Services</b></p>
<p><i><b>Residential Services</b></i></p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of community-based program are operated by the  		regions. The array of services varies from region to region, but programs fall  		into the following categories.</p>
<p><i>Supported Community Living</i></p>
<ul><li>Extended family homes include Adult Family Homes for mentally  		  retarded adults and foster homes for mentally retarded children. These homes  		  are licensed and monitored by DSS. Approximately 100 mentally retarded people  		  reside in extended family homes.</li>
<li>Semi-independent living arrangements serve approximately 360 clients  		  who need minimal supervision, but require some help with living skills.</li>
<li>Family support is provided to help maintain mentally retarded  		  individuals in their own homes.</li>
</ul><p><i>Assisted Residential Living</i></p>
<ul><li>Group homes for 10 or fewer people provide 24-hour care and  		  supervision.</li>
<li>Approximately 768 mentally retarded individuals live in 174 group  		  homes.</li>
<li>Nebraska does not use ICF-MR to fund small community-based facilities  		  services.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Non-Residential Services</b></i></p>
<p><i>Vocational Services</i></p>
<ul><li>Approximately 1500 mentally retarded people over the age of 16  		  participate in sheltered workshops.</li>
<li>Approximately 100 people are employed in work stations in  		  industry.</li>
<li>Approximately 1000 clients are employed in work training.</li>
</ul><p><i>Family Support</i></p>
<ul><li>In-home support services such as assistance and training with medical  		  equipment and personal care assistance</li>
<li>Respite care</li>
</ul><p><i>Case Management</i></p>
<ul><li>Regions employ case managers for all mentally retarded individuals  		  who request services; case managers are responsible for coordinating all needed  		  services.</li>
<li>Several respondents indicated interest in developing an independent  		  case management system.</li>
</ul><p><i>Education Services</i></p>
<ul><li>Nebraska requires local school districts to provide special education  		  services to all handicapped children from the date of diagnosis to age 21.</li>
<li>Local school districts bear most of the responsibility for serving  		  the school age population, regional programs tend to emphasize adult  		  services.</li>
<li>The Department of Education operates the Family Home Care program for  		  handicapped children who must be moved out of their home school districts for  		  educational reasons. The project locates and trains "foster" parents for  		  children who must attend school away from home. The Department of Education  		  pays for the residential costs once the home school district pay for  		  educational costs.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Community Service Providers</b></i></p>
<p>Although RGBS are permitted to provide services through contract, only  		Region VI uses the private sector extensively. (OMR contracts with several  		community service providers directly.) Respondents attributed Nebraska's  		decision to not to encourage private sector development to concerns that  		private providers would not put client interests ahead of business  		interests.</p>
<p><b>General Financing and Service Development Issues</b></p>
<p><i><b>Financing Of Community Services</b></i></p>
<p>Federal funds supply approximately 34 percent of expenditures:</p>
<ul><li>Title XX/Social Services Block Grant is the major source of Federal  		  funding for community services</li>
<li>Other Federal funds include SSI payments to individuals; education  		  funds, DD grants, Medicare payments for some individuals in hospital-certified  		  beds in Beatrice, and Medicaid payments for Medicaid-eligible MR/DD  		  individuals</li>
</ul><p>State funds supply approximately 45 percent of expenditures:</p>
<ul><li>State match for Title XIX funds is 43 percent</li>
<li>In FY84-85, state expenditures of approximately $10.2 million for IC  		  Fs-M R</li>
<li>State match for DD grant</li>
<li>State funds to private community providers</li>
</ul><p>State funding of regional mental retardation services:</p>
<ul><li>The legislature appropriates funds individually to regions and  		  counties.</li>
<li>Regional budget requests are based on a model which estimates program  		  costs on the basis of how much it costs to service high-, medium-, and low-need  		  clients.</li>
<li>In FY 84-85, state payments to regions were $19.6 million.</li>
</ul><p>County and local funds make up approximately 7 percent of total  		expenditures:</p>
<ul><li>Counties must make a contribution for residents in Beatrice.</li>
<li>County contributions to regional programs have decreased as a  		  percentage of total expenditures.</li>
<li>County contributions vary widely across the state.</li>
<li>County/local contributions are raised primarily through the property  		  tax.</li>
<li>Most regional programs charge fees on a sliding scale.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>ICF-MR Program</b></i></p>
<p>Nebraska has chosen not to use ICF-MR to finance small, community-based  		residential facilities primarily because of perceptions that the ICF-MR medical  		model of care was inappropriate for CBS. Therefore, Title XIX is not a  		significant funding source for CBS.</p>
<p><i><b>Waiver Experience</b></i></p>
<p>Nebraska applied for and received a Medicaid 2176 waiver for services to  		the mentally retarded population in 1984. However, the state never implemented  		the waiver. Respondents suggested two major reasons for the decision not to  		implement the waiver:</p>
<ul><li>Concern about obligating the state to higher Medicaid  		  expenditures</li>
<li>Administration concerns about the absence of effective state control  		  over regional programs</li>
</ul><p>Several respondents indicated that they would like to see the state  		develop a new waiver so that Medicaid funds can support community programs.</p>
<p><i><b>Community Service Development Costs</b></i></p>
<p>During the initial phase of community services development, the  		legislature appropriated special funds to cover startup costs. These funds are  		no longer available.</p>
<h4>III. Experience with/Development of CBS</h4>
<p><b>Development of CBS in Nebraska</b></p>
<p>Advocates and parents of mentally retarded people were responsible for  		Nebraska's development of CBS in the late 1960's. Nebraska was one of the first  		states to develop an extensive system of CBS. In 1969, the Nebraska legislature  		passed the Interlocal Agreement Act, establishing the current regional system  		and laying the ground work for state funding of CBS.</p>
<p>The Horacek v. Exon law suit, filed in the early 1970's, also  		contributed to the development of community services. The suit was dismissed in  		1984 on the grounds of the state's compliance with the consent decree. However,  		the lawsuit came along after Nebraska had made a commitment to CBS and a  		framework for delivering those services.</p>
<p>Respondents cited a variety of factors which contributed to Nebraska's  		progress and shaped policy directions:</p>
<ul><li>Involvement of parents and community people in the early stages of  		  development</li>
<li>Presence of a strong, well-organized ARC</li>
<li>Leaders In the field of community services were involved in  		  Nebraska</li>
<li>Support from elected officials on both the state and local  		  levels</li>
<li>The ability to articulate a value-based statement of what MR services  		  should be</li>
<li>Structure of the State
<ul><li>Small population</li>
<li>Simple political system (unicameral legislature)</li>
<li>Small financial investment in the institutional system</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Availability of funding for the development of CBS
<ul><li>Title XX funds</li>
<li>State fund for start-up costs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strong philosophical commitment</li>
</ul><p><b>Current Emphasis on CBS</b></p>
<p>The consensus among respondents was that Nebraska has made a strong,  		lasting commitment to CBS for the mentally retarded population. The commitment  		is reflected in both expenditures and client placements:</p>
<ul><li>Expenditures for community services are significantly higher than for  		  Institutional services.</li>
<li>Approximately 840 clients are in institutional settings; 2,400 are  		  served by community programs.</li>
</ul><p>Nebraska has maintained the level of funding for community services in  		spite of state economic problems. In the last legislative session, the mental  		retardation services budget received a slight increase; budgets for nearly all  		other state services were cut.</p>
<p><b>Gaps in Community-Based Services</b></p>
<p>Although all respondents agreed that Nebraska has made great strides in  		developing CBS, they also cited a variety of deficiencies in the service  		system, in terms of both service gaps and structural problems.</p>
<p>Service gaps:</p>
<ul><li>Waiting lists for residential and vocational services</li>
<li>Family support and respite care</li>
<li>Work training</li>
<li>Community integration services</li>
</ul><p>Some groups of individuals among the MR/DD population are not being  		served well:</p>
<ul><li>Multiply handicapped adults</li>
<li>Mentally retarded individuals with behavior problems</li>
<li>The elderly MR/DD people</li>
<li>Autistic individuals</li>
<li>Aging out population</li>
</ul><p>Several respondents cited problems with the current regional  		structure:</p>
<ul><li>The regional structure has become "Institutionalized."</li>
<li>The current system does not allow for meaningful monitoring and  		  oversight from the state level.</li>
<li>The types and quality of service and the population served vary among  		  the regions.</li>
<li>Several respondents felt that the lack of competition--the absence of  		  a strong private sector role--may reduce the quality of service.</li>
</ul><p><b>Goals for Community-Based Services/Issues to be Resolved</b></p>
<p>Respondents generally agreed that the primary challenge for Nebraska in  		the immediate future will be to develop services which are responsive to  		individual needs and provide support to families:</p>
<ul><li>Improve family support services</li>
<li>Develop services to help people with mental retardation participate  		  more fully in community</li>
<li>Improve case management (i.e., several respondents suggested that  		  case management should be separated from service provision)</li>
<li>Serve everyone in need in the most appropriate setting</li>
<li>Improve services to the severely disabled</li>
</ul><p>Nebraska's community service system was described by several respondents  		as "mature," but in need of some structural changes.</p>
<ul><li>The state has a high level of investment in the current system which,  		  according to some, inhibits its ability to respond to changing needs and  		  implement Innovative service approaches.</li>
<li>Some respondents felt that the current system does not focus on the  		  individual, and does not provide adequate support to families.</li>
<li>Accountability: ultimate responsibility for providing services is not  		  clearly articulated in statute.</li>
<li>The absence of a competitive private sector role gives RGBs a  		  "monopoly" on providing services.</li>
<li>OMR and the regional programs are mandated to provide services only  		  to the mentally retarded. There has been some discussion about expanding  		  eligibility to include all developmental disabilities.</li>
<li>A Medicaid waiver must be implemented.</li>
</ul><h4>IV. Perspectives on Federal Policy</h4>
<p><b>Incentives/Barriers</b></p>
<p>Some respondents expressed the view that the current ICF-MR program  		encourages the state to continue to support institutional care. Nebraska chose  		not use ICF-MR in the community because of the perception of the  		inappropriateness of the medical model.</p>
<p>Several respondents were dissatisfied with the HCFA look behind surveys.  		While supportive of the effort to ensure quality services, they offered  		criticisms:</p>
<ul><li>HCFA's attitude is not one of cooperating with state to improve  		  services, but is confrontational.</li>
<li>Active treatment requirements are unclear. </li>
</ul><p><b>Policy Recommendations</b></p>
<p>Although Nebraska does not use Title XIX for community services, many  		suggested Federal policy changes focused on Medicaid reform:</p>
<ul><li>Build more flexibility Into Medicaid so that Title XIX can be spent  		  in the community without the restrictiveness of the ICF-MR program</li>
<li>Make waiver services permanent optional service under the state  		  Medicaid plan</li>
<li>Create an MR/DD authority within Title XIX</li>
<li>Focus Title XIX on services rather than institutions/facilities</li>
<li>Pass CFLAs (a representative of MRAN opposed this)</li>
<li>Cover startup costs of community services</li>
</ul><p>A number of suggestions focused on vocational services and programs:</p>
<ul><li>Make definitions of disability consistent across Federal programs  		  </li>
<li>Make VR serve the MR/DD population</li>
<li>Bring OSERS and VR regulations closer together, possibly make VR the  		  primary referral agency for exiting special education students</li>
</ul><h4>V. Summary</h4>
<p>In general, Nebraska is very progressive; maintaining MR/DD people in  		the community is the rule rather than the exception. Although there is strong  		loyalty to the current system, people do seem willing to examine structural  		problems and do not appear to be complacent or satisfied with what they are  		doing. The Nebraska example demonstrates that the development of CBS is an  		ongoing process. However, the potential of extending the lessons of the  		Nebraska example are limited by the state's small size and homogeneity.</p>
<p>In addition to having one of the most decentralized MR/DD systems,  		Nebraska also has a system in which almost all services are in the public  		sector.</p>
<p><i><b>Implications For Federal Policy</b></i></p>
<p>Major changes in MR/DD services funded under Medicaid that would support  		innovative and nonmedical model services could be useful in enhancing the  		Nebraska system. Minor changes would probably have little effect.</p>
<p>The current system's emphasis on local (regional) autonomy and control  		limits the state's ability to ensure outcomes at the community level. OMR is  		also a very small agency, with less than 10 staff members.</p>

<h3>TEXAS MR/DD SYSTEM</h3>
<h4>I. Overview</h4>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>Texas is one of the nation's largest, most populous states, with a  		population of approximately 14 million. Approximately half the state's  		residents live in one of several large urban areas (Dallas, Fort Worth,  		Houston, and San Antonio). The state also has isolated rural areas, and  		population centers are separated by long distances.</p>
<p>Texas has traditionally been politically conservative, favoring limited  		government involvement in and expenditure for human services. In the past  		decade, the state experienced significant population and economic growth, but  		the economy has suffered from the recent slump in oil prices.</p>
<p><b>Major System Characteristics</b></p>
<p>The Texas MR system has relied heavily on large institutions and funding  		has not significantly emphasized CBS. Approximately 8,000 mentally retarded  		individuals are served in the 13 state schools (PRFs), while the community  		residential system, which includes private ICFs-MR of up to 200 beds, has a  		capacity of approximately 4,000 beds. Texas began to place greater emphasis on  		community services during the late 1970's, and this trend has been accelerated  		the past 3 years, partly as a result of the settlement of a major class action  		lawsuit against the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation  		(TDMFMR). Actual delivery of CBS is decentralized. Community Mental Health and  		Mental Retardation Centers, the local service authorities in most areas,  		contract with the state Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation to  		provide services on the community level.</p>
<p>The ICF-MR program provides the bulk of funding for residential  		services, both institutional and community based. In addition, Texas has a HCB  		Waiver, which will provide services for 450 clients.</p>
<p><b>Issues for Community Service Development</b></p>
<p>Texas' long standing dependence on large congregate care facilities acts  		as a major barrier to the expansion of community services. The high level of  		investment in the state school system and the rising costs of operating that  		system divert available resources from the development of new services at the  		community level. One respondent also suggested that because Texas has not had  		extensive experience with CBS, public opposition to community services for  		MR/DD people is a barrier. Legislators and members of the public may not be  		convinced that community-based MR/DD services will be safe and effective.</p>
<p>The state's traditionally low tax rates (there is neither a personal nor  		corporate income tax) and the current fiscal crisis limit the resources  		available for community services. Any decision regarding the development of CBS  		will be at least partially influenced by Texas' need to maximize FFP. The need  		to comply with the consent decree settling the Lelsz V. Kavanaugh class-action  		suit against DMHMR will also affect the development of CBS in Texas.</p>
<p><b>Federal Policy Perspectives</b></p>
<p>Most respondents' suggestions for Federal policy changes focused on  		Medicaid reform to alter the institutional bias-of the ICF-MR program.  		Informants commented that Texas will need both incentives for developing  		community services and disincentives for emphasizing institutional services to  		make significant changes in the way MR/DD services are developed. Several  		people also stressed that any major restructuring of .Medicaid long-term care  		funding (e.g., CFLA) should recognize that change in states like Texas will  		take time, and also should recognize that costs will be higher during the  		transition period. Other comments regarding Federal policy stressed the need  		for stronger Federal leadership and commitment to community services.</p>
<h4>II. Service System Profile</h4>
<p><b>Major Actors in the MMR/DD System</b></p>
<p><i><b>Department Of Mental Health And Mental Retardation  		(TDMHMR)</b></i></p>
<p>TDMHMR has primary responsibility for providing services to citizens  		with mental illness and mental retardation. The Department's authorizing  		legislation directs the agency to give priority to the most severely disabled  		population, particularly those at risk of institutionalization, and to  		emphasize alternatives to treatment in congregate care facilities. TDMHMR's  		activities and services for the MR population include:</p>
<ul><li>Administration and operation of the 13 state schools for the mentally  		  retarded</li>
<li>Administration of five state centers for the mentally retarded</li>
<li>Planning and policy development, including the development of ICF-MR  		  program policy in conjunction with the Texas Department of Human Services</li>
<li>Preparation of strategic plans and statewide goals and  		  objectives</li>
<li>Funding and oversight of local community MH/MR programs</li>
<li>Monitoring and quality assurance in the state schools and community  		  programs (MRAs)</li>
<li>Monitoring of non-ICF-MR residential facilities operated by local  		  Mental Retardation Authorities</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Community Mental Health And Mental Retardation Centers (CMHMR  		Centers)</b></i></p>
<p>The 31 CMHMR Centers are quasi-governmental bodies which provide  		community-based mental health and mental retardation services throughout Texas.  		TDMHMR has divided the state into 60 local service areas. Each local service  		area has a MRA which is either the local CMHMR Center or, in areas without a  		Center, an outreach program of one of the state schools. CMHMR Centers sign  		performance contracts with TDMHMR and provide services within the goals of  		TDMHMR plans, but they are accountable to their own boards.</p>
<ul><li>CMHMR Centers must provide a set of core services: case management,  		  diagnosis and evaluation, family support, and respite care.</li>
<li>TDMHMR provides most of the funding for CMHMR services; county,  		  municipal, and private funds make up the remainder.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Department Of Human Services (TDHS)</b></i></p>
<p>TDHS is involved in the MR/DD service system through the administration  		of a wide range of social service programs which benefit MR/DD individuals.  		TDHS is the single state Medicaid agency and jointly administers the ICF-MR  		program with TDMHMR. Responsibilities include:</p>
<ul><li>Setting reimbursement rates for ICFs-MR</li>
<li>Promulgating regulations in conjunction with TDMHMR for the ICF-MR  		  program</li>
<li>Administration of general social service programs such as income  		  assistance and services to families and children</li>
<li>Application of financial sanctions against ICF-MR providers</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Texas Planning Council For Developmental Disabilities</b></i></p>
<p>The DD Planning Council is located in the Texas Rehabilitation  		Commission (TRC). The Council does not provide services directly; its role is  		to facilitate the development of a comprehensive service delivery system for DD  		people. Primary responsibilities include:</p>
<ul><li>Public education about developmental disabilities</li>
<li>Advocacy with state agencies and the legislature</li>
<li>Policy development and analysis</li>
<li>Service evaluation</li>
<li>Facilitation of interagency coordination on issues of material  		  interest and agreement</li>
<li>Funding of research and demonstration projects, emphasizing  		  residential services and unemployment-related services. </li>
</ul><p><i><b>Texas Rehabilitation Commission (TRC)</b></i></p>
<p>TRC is the administering agency for both Federal VR funds and the DD  		Planning Council. Although the emphasis of TRC's VR-funded programs has been on  		time-limited services leading to competitive employment, the agency has also  		made efforts to emphasize services to the severely disabled population.  		Specific services relevant to the MR/DD population include:</p>
<ul><li>Extended Rehabilitation Services (ERS) for disabled people who cannot  		  be competitively employed</li>
<li>Independent Living Program</li>
<li>Deaf-Blind Program</li>
<li>Comprehensive Medical Rehabilitation Services for people with brain  		  and spinal cord injuries</li>
<li>Administration and processing of SSI and SSDI programs in Texas  		  (there Is no state supplement)</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Texas Education Agency (TEA)</b></i></p>
<p>Texas law requires special education services for handicapped children  		from age 3 through 21 (blind, deaf, and deaf-blind are eligible from birth  		through age 21). The local Independent School Districts (ISDs) provide direct  		special education services. TEA is responsible for oversight and monitoring,  		allocation of Federal funds, and providing technical assistance.</p>
<p><i><b>Texas Department Of Health (TDH)</b></i></p>
<p>TDH provides personal health care services through the Bureau of  		Maternal and Child Health and the Crippled Children's Bureau. The agency also  		is responsible for licensing, certification, and inspection of care for the  		state schools and all ICFs-MR.</p>
<p><i><b>Other Agencies</b></i></p>
<ul><li>Advocacy, Inc. is the state's DD protection and advocacy agency  		  mandated by the DD Act of 1984. Its responsibilities include legal and  		  protective advocacy services, system advocacy, and a Client Assistance  		  Program.</li>
<li>The Health and Human Services Coordinating Council's mission is to  		  serve as the primary agency for planning and coordinating health and human  		  services. Its responsibilities include research and policy analysis,  		  maintenance of a centralized data base on health and human services in Texas,  		  and information and referral sources.</li>
<li>The Council on Disabilities is responsible for developing a  		  long-range plan for all persons with disabilities and promoting the development  		  of statewide policies on disabilities.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Interagency Cooperation</b></i></p>
<p>Respondents reported that state agencies concerned with the DD  		population are involved in a variety of interagency efforts to Improve and  		coordinate services:</p>
<ul><li>TDMHMR, TRC, and TEA have a legislatively mandated interagency  		  agreement for cooperation in services for transition from special education to  		  adult services.</li>
<li>TEA has a separate Interagency Coordination Office created  		  specifically to work with the state schools and ISDs on the  		  deinstitutionalization of school-age children.</li>
<li>TDH, TDHS, TDMHMR, and TEA participate in the Early Childhood  		  Intervention Council which develops a state plan for early childhood  		  intervention and provides grants for direct services.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Advocacy Organization Involvement</b></i></p>
<p>The ARC-Texas is one of the primary advocates for community-based MR/DD  		services in Texas. The ARC has been actively involved in the <b>Lelsz V.  		Kavanaugh</b> case which is directed toward improving services in the state  		school system and has been an important factor in efforts to move people out of  		the state schools.</p>
<p>Parents Associated for the Retarded of Texas (PART) split off from the  		ARC and represents the pro-institution point of view. Most members are parents  		of state school residents. PART has been an effective advocate for the  		maintenance of the state school system.</p>
<p><i><b>Private Sector Involvement</b></i></p>
<p>Private sector providers play an important role in the nonstate school  		residential services systems. More than three-quarters of ICF-MR beds (outside  		the state schools) are operated and owned by private providers, including small  		non-profit organizations as well as large health services chains. The Texas  		Association of Private ICF-MR Providers (TAPP) is the primary representative  		for private ICF-MR facilities. Private sector involvement also includes  		charitable and private-pay facilities such as The Brown School and Mary Lee  		Schools. Many non-ICF-MR small group homes also are privately owned and  		operated.</p>
<p><b>Institutional Services</b></p>
<p><i><b>State Schools For The Mentally Retarded Operated By The  		TDMHMR</b></i></p>
<ul><li>Thirteen state schools range in size from approximately 350 to 1,000  		  beds.</li>
<li>Approximately 9,600 clients lived in the state schools in FY  		  1986.</li>
<li>Nearly all beds are ICF-MR certified.</li>
<li>The resolution and settlement of the Lelsz V. Kavanaugh suit mandated  		  a census reduction in three of the state schools.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Private Sector</b></i></p>
<ul><li>Private providers own and operate several large ICFs-MR which range  		  in size from 30 to 200 beds.</li>
<li>Two proprietary chain providers (Beverly and ARA Services) operate  		  large ICFs-MR.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Client Population</b></i></p>
<p>Several respondents commented that, in comparison with earlier years,  		the residents of the state schools are older and more severely impaired.  		Children and individuals functioning in the mild to moderate range have been  		priorities for deinstitutionalization. In general, children who are severely  		impaired are being cared for at home or in ICFs-MR. Approximately 250 people  		are on the waiting list for the state schools, but TDMHMR is not admitting new  		residents.</p>
<p><b>Community Services</b></p>
<p>Most CBS are provided through the 60 local service areas' MRAs, either  		CMHMR Centers or state school outreach programs. If a local MRA cannot provide  		needed services, TDMHMR may contract with another local agency or private  		provider. The range of services available at the community level has expanded  		in the last 3 to 4 years, partly In response to the Federal court-mandated  		deinstitutionalization effort.</p>
<p>In response to both the court case and the need to improve services in  		the state schools, the legislature appropriated funds for reducing  		client-to-staff ratios in the state schools. TDMHMR has used these funds to  		implement a program of financial incentives for CMHMR Centers--the Prospective  		Payment System.</p>
<ul><li>MRAs receive $55.60 per day for each client who returns to the local  		  service area from one of the state schools.</li>
<li>The payment does not have to be spent for services for  		  deinstitutionalized individual, but can be used to support the development and  		  operation of the MRAs' services In general. However, all services required in  		  the individual's program plan must first be provided.</li>
<li>The availability of these funds has stimulated the development of  		  services for both former state school residents and community residents who are  		  mentally retarded.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Residential Services</b></i></p>
<p><i>Community-Based ICF-MR Program</i></p>
<ul><li>TDMHMR and TDHS designate all non-PRF school ICF-MR facilities as  		  part of the community ICF-MR program.</li>
<li>There are a total of approximately 4,400 ICF-MR beds in the community  		  program; about 3,800 beds are privately provided.</li>
<li>The facilities range In size from less than 6 beds to more than 200  		  beds.</li>
<li>Since 1981, TDHS regulations have prohibited development of any ICFMR  		  with more than six beds. All growth In the ICF-MR program has been in this  		  category, although providers and TDHS agree that the model is not  		  cost-permissive at current reimbursement rates (i.e., providers cannot break  		  even at current rates).</li>
</ul><p><i>Non-ICF-MR Residential Facilities</i></p>
<ul><li>There are approximately 2,000 beds in non-Title XIX financed group  		  homes, operated by MRAs.</li>
<li>Group homes have been developed by CMHMR Centers, local ARC chapters,  		  and other private providers.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Nonresidential Services</b></i></p>
<p><i>Case Management</i></p>
<ul><li>Case management is a core service which MRAs are required to provide  		  for all mentally retarded clients returning from state schools in their local  		  service areas.</li>
<li>TDMHMR representatives commented that case management has Improved in  		  the last 2 years.</li>
</ul><p><i>Vocational Services</i></p>
<ul><li>Most CMHMR Centers operate their own vocational programs.</li>
<li>TRC operates the Extended Rehabilitative Services (ERS) program for  		  severely disabled individuals who can work but need continuous training and  		  supervision. The ERS program provides sheltered employment, transportation,  		  medical services, and assistive devices such as hearing aids and wheelchairs.  		  In some eases, ERS arranges community-based residential services. TRC operates  		  ERS programs in 11 cities throughout the state, including some services to  		  MR/DD people.</li>
<li>Supported employment has not yet been developed extensively.</li>
</ul><p><i>Family Support</i></p>
<ul><li>Family support is a core service required of CMHMR Centers.</li>
<li>A bill pending in the legislature would provide a $3,600 annual  		  subsidy for families with disabled children.</li>
</ul><p><i>Education Services</i></p>
<ul><li>Special education is required for children ages 3-21; direct services  		  are provided by local ISDs.</li>
<li>Early Childhood Intervention Program (ECI):
<ul><li>The program was created in 1981 by the legislature to identify  				and provide services to children from birth to age 6 who are developmentally  				delayed or who are at risk of a developmental delay.</li>
<li>The ECI program is overseen by representatives from TDMHMR, TDH,  				TDHS, and TEA, as well as parent representative. </li>
<li>ECI programs are funded by grants awarded by the ECI Council;  				programs must provide educational programming, therapeutic treatment, case  				management, and parent counseling.</li>
<li>Sixty-two programs were funded in FY 1986. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><b>General Financing and Service Development Issues</b></p>
<p><i><b>ICF-MR Program</b></i></p>
<ul><li>Texas has used ICF-MR extensively for small facilities.</li>
<li>ICF-MR facilities and clients are categorized by levels of care which  		  are based on an individual's 1.Q., ABL, health status, and ambulatory status:
<ul><li>Level I--Clients are mildly to moderately retarded.</li>
<li>Level V--Clients are moderately to severely retarded.</li>
<li>Level VI--Clients are severely to profoundly retarded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>TDHS establishes payment rates for the community ICF-MR program on a  		  cost-based prospective reimbursement system. The reimbursement rate is based on  		  the median cost level reported by all facilities in previous years.</li>
<li>Reimbursement rates vary by level of care. Current rates:
<ul><li>Level I facilities: $55.62 per day per client</li>
<li>Level V facilities: $46.56 per day per client</li>
<li>Level VI: $55.84 per day per client</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Payment rates do not reflect differences in facility size or  		  location. Although regulations only allow development of facilities smaller  		  than six beds, the reimbursement rate does not account for the higher cost of  		  operating a small facility.</li>
<li>Reimbursement rates for state schools are much higher than rates for  		  the community program:
<ul><li>Level I: $74.76 per day per client </li>
<li>Level V: $93.83 per day per client </li>
<li>Level VI: $103.57 per day per client</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><i><b>Waiver Experience</b></i></p>
<ul><li>Texas' 1915(c) HCB Waiver was approved in 1985. The Waiver was  		  developed jointly by TDMHMR and TDHS.</li>
<li>The Waiver finances the Intermediate Community Services program which  		  operates on a cluster model which includes:
<ul><li>A core home which provides initial evaluation and respite and  				administrative services for all clients in the cluster.</li>
<li>In-home services to MR clients living in their own homes.  				Services Include case management, homemaker services, respite care  				habilitation, social services, nursing, psychological services, and  				rehabilitation.</li>
<li>Alternative residences for clients who live outside their family  				homes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Services are provided through 10 project sites with five more to be  		  announced In June 1987.</li>
<li>The Waiver was originally projected for 450 clients, but TDMHMR and  		  TDHS personnel do not expect to reach capacity within the initial 3-year Waiver  		  period.</li>
<li>Services are reimbursed at a rate of $45.90/day. Private providers  		  and the nursing home lobby helped to pass a law which limits the rate to less  		  than the average rate for community ICF-MR providers.</li>
<li>Texas also has model waiver for severely disabled people which  		  currently serves only 27 clients.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Community Service Development Costs</b></i></p>
<ul><li>TDMHMR has made some development funds available, but this is not an  		  ongoing effort.</li>
<li>The prospective payment program has contributed to expansion of  		  CBS.</li>
<li>The prospective payment program has caused some tension between  		  private providers and CMHMR Centers.</li>
</ul><h4>III. Experience with and Development of Community  		Services</h4>
<p><b>Development of Community Services in Texas</b></p>
<p>The consensus among respondents was that Texas has not yet made adequate  		progress in establishing a comprehensive network of community services.  		However, one informant commented that the state has "turned the corner" toward  		emphasizing community services as the primary source of care. Respondents  		listed a variety of factors which contributed to Texas' traditional orientation  		toward institutional care:</p>
<ul><li>The legislature has been reluctant to fund human services and for  		  MR/DD services available resources have not been adequate to fund both  		  Institutional and community services.</li>
<li>Several respondents cited the conservative political ideology which  		  emphasizes independence, family privacy, and limited government as a major  		  barrier to community services.</li>
<li>The low level of public awareness has been an obstacle. Because there  		  is little experience with community services in Texas, the public and many  		  members of the legislature do not believe community services will work.</li>
<li>Opposition from state school superintendents who have influence with  		  the legislature and from PART, the pro-institution parent group.</li>
<li>Fears that closure or downsizing of state schools will have a  		  negative effect on local economies.</li>
<li>Several respondents commented that the institutional bias of the  		  ICF-MR program continues to encourage Texas to emphasize institutional  		  services.</li>
<li>The absence of a reliable Federal funding stream for community-based,  		  nonresidential programs.</li>
</ul><p><b>Current Emphasis on Community Services</b></p>
<p>Most informants agreed that Texas is in a period of transition to a  		community service system. All respondents supported the ideals of normalization  		and community integration for the MR/DD population. Official policy statements  		now express a preference for service in the home community. A number of  		elements have precipitated this change and will continue to influence policy  		decisions in Texas:</p>
<ul><li>The Lelsz V. Kavanaugh case</li>
<li>TDMHMR Board policies which support community services</li>
<li>Availability of the Waiver, and the ability to use Federal funds in  		  the community</li>
<li>Advocacy and public education to reduce opposition to community  		  services.</li>
</ul><p><b>Gaps in Community Services</b></p>
<p>Respondents agreed that the most significant gap is a general lack of  		adequate and appropriate community services, rather than the absence of any  		specific services. Many mentally retarded people do not receive the services  		they need; TDMHMR has identified 1,600 people who are at risk of  		institutionalization and in desperate need of services. Although a general  		improvement in quantity and quality of services is the primary need,  		respondents did identify several areas of special need:</p>
<ul><li>DD individuals who do not meet the definition of mental retardation  		  are not eligible for TDMHMR services.</li>
<li>There is a lack of community settings for the severely  		  handicapped.</li>
<li>Day programs for MR/DD people in the community are needed.</li>
<li>Young adults completing special education programs have difficulty  		  gaining access to appropriate community services.</li>
<li>Quantity and quality of services is uneven throughout the state.</li>
</ul><p><b>Goals for CBS/Issues to be Resolved</b></p>
<p>The most frequently mentioned goal for community services was the  		improvement and expansion of CBS at all levels. Most respondents agreed that  		Texas should and will continue to reduce the population in the state schools.  		Specific goals include:</p>
<ul><li>Reduce the population of the state schools by 1,800 by FY 1991 (TD  		  MHM R Strategic Plan)</li>
<li>Develop 3,300 new community residential placements and an array of  		  nonresidential services by FY 1991 (TDMHMR Strategic Plan)</li>
<li>Develop services that emphasize community integration, support to  		  families, and the use of generic community resources</li>
<li>Improve vocational services, Including supported employment</li>
<li>Improve services for the transition from special education to adult  		  community life</li>
<li>Increase the Integration of special education programs into regular  		  education</li>
</ul><p>A number of issues must be resolved to implement these goals:</p>
<ul><li>Texas must find ways other than ICF-MR to use Medicaid funds to  		  support community services. Several respondents pointed out that the  		  legislature sees maximizing Federal funding as a major goal and Title XIX as  		  the only stable Federal funding stream for MR/DD services.</li>
<li>TDMHMR and the Texas Council of CMHMR Centers are working to develop  		  a methodology for equalizing state funding of CMHMR Centers.</li>
<li>One respondent commented that this is a "watershed year" for human  		  services in the state: if legislative support for community MR/DD services can  		  at least be maintained during the current fiscal crisis, this will indicate  		  that Texas has made a real commitment to community services.</li>
</ul><h4>IV. Federal Policy Perspectives </h4>
<p><b>Incentives/Barriers</b></p>
<p>Informants noted that Federal policy has had a significant influence on  		the development of Texas' MR/DD service system:</p>
<ul><li>The institutional orientation of ICF-MR and the availability of  		  Federal funds for institutional services has encouraged Texas to continue with  		  PRFs.</li>
<li>Availability of ICF-MR funding for small facilities has contributed  		  to the level of community residential service that has developed.</li>
<li>The categorical focus of Federal disability programs is an obstacle  		  to coordination of services and promotes the "turf battles" between state  		  agencies.</li>
</ul><p><b>Policy Recommendations</b></p>
<p>Many respondents' suggestions for Federal policy changes focused on the  		need to restructure the ICF-MR program to redirect resources to CBS. Several  		informants also commented on the need for stronger Federal leadership and  		oversight.</p>
<p><i><b>Medicaid Reform</b></i></p>
<ul><li>Respondents stated that some change in the institutional orientation  		  of the ICF-MR program is needed, <b>but</b> this change should be gradual and  		  should include funding of a transition period. State personnel stressed that  		  the transition to community services will take time and will require greater  		  financial resources for the initial startup period.</li>
<li>One informant suggested greater state flexibility with Title XIX:  		  states need to find a way to get beyond the entitlement concept so that they  		  can stay within fiscal restraints. A state should have the option to cap its  		  own program; this would be the only way Texas could take advantage of Medicaid  		  options currently available. </li>
<li>Another respondent commented that the legislature will probably be  		  unwilling to modify the state Medicaid plan (e.g., by adding case management or  		  services currently financed under the Waiver) without estimates of increased  		  eligibility and costs, and without some guarantees of cost controls.</li>
<li>ICF-MR funding should "debundle" services and shift to providing the  		  least intensive, least intrusive level of service appropriate to client  		  needs.</li>
<li>Clarify who should be eligible for ICF-MR, possibly make it  		  time-limited for higher functioning clients.</li>
<li>Clarify Title XIX regulations regarding vocational services and  		  active treatment. State personnel commented that even an unfavorable  		  clarification would be better than the current uncertainty about HCFA's recent  		  interpretations.</li>
</ul><p><i><b>General Policy Suggestions</b></i></p>
<ul><li>A stronger political commitment on the Federal level would be helpful  		  in persuading people in Texas that development of community MR/DD services  		  would be worthwhile.</li>
<li>Better enforcement of P.L. 94-142 is required.</li>
<li>A Federal mandate requiring states to look at disability globally  		  would help to encourage continuity and coordination.</li>
<li>Technical assistance should be provided to states to implement new  		  technologies; for example, complex medical or assistive devices.</li>
<li>Funding for training of personnel, particularly special education  		  teachers, should be expended.</li>
<li>One respondent commented that Federal leadership and guidance is very  		  helpful--when policy issues (this informant cited transition services for  		  special education students and programs for the deaf-blind) are emphasized at  		  the he Federal level, those issues get more attention at the state level.</li>
</ul><h4>V. Summary</h4>
<p><b>General Observations</b></p>
<p>Based on current observations of client placements and expenditures,  		Texas does not adequately emphasize community services. Although  		noninstitutional placements and in-home services are becoming more viable  		options for MR/DD people living in their home communities, 8,000 people  		continue to reside in the state schools. Deinstitutionalization will continue,  		but, given the large number of people in state schools and large ICFs-MR,  		combined with the low level of community alternatives, it will be a slow  		process.</p>
<p>Although the high level of investment in the state school system and the  		state's fiscal conservation regarding human services are major obstacles, Texas  		appears to be moving toward an emphasis on community services. For example,  		TDMHMR's Strategic Plan calls for a 20 percent reduction in the state school  		population by 1991; state law explicitly supports service In the least  		restrictive, most normalized setting possible; and all respondents expressed  		support for the concepts of community integration and individualized services.  		In addition, the existence of local MRAs and CMHMR Centers provides a framework  		for service delivery at the community level.</p>
<p><b>Federal Policy Implications</b></p>
<p>Texas is unlikely to be able to make major changes in Its MR/DD service  		system without external encouragement and financial and technical assistance.  		The state's heavy use of Medicaid to support both institutional and community  		services indicates that restructuring of the ICF-MR program to increase  		incentives for community services could be effective in accelerating the move  		toward a community-based system.</p>
<p>Respondents seem receptive to the idea of increased Federal influence in  		the development of community services, provided that Federal policy changes  		recognize the obstacles to Texas' development of community services and do not  		punish the state for choices made in the past.</p>

<h3>VIRGINIA MR/DD SERVICE SYSTEM</h3>
<h4>I. Overview</h4>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>Virginia has a population of approximately 5.9 million. Although  		Northern Virginia belongs to the metropolitan Washington area, the state does  		have a significant rural population. The Virginia Department of Mental Health  		and Mental Retardation estimates the base population in need of services at  		approximately 11,000. This figure does not include the nonretarded,  		developmentally disabled population.</p>
<p><b>Major System Characteristics</b></p>
<p>Virginia's MR/DD system relies heavily on institutional care and has not  		yet developed a comprehensive array of CBS. The system is characterized by a  		high level of decentralization; Community Service Boards (CSBs)--the local  		MR/DD service authority--are responsible for nearly all community-level  		services.</p>
<p><b>Issues for Community Service Development</b></p>
<p>The major barriers to expansion of CBS have been:</p>
<ul><li>The high level of investment in the institutional system</li>
<li>The absence of unified, effective advocacy for community  		  services</li>
<li>Opposition from parents of institutional clients and the general  		  public</li>
</ul><p>Virginia's ability to expand the CBS system will largely depend on the  		level of public awareness and legislative support. Most respondents expressed  		optimism about the changes for increasing support and funding for community  		MR/DD services.</p>
<p><b>Federal Policy Perspectives</b></p>
<p>Most respondents' suggestions for Federal policy reform reflected  		Virginia's need to meet rising institutional costs while also trying to  		establish and operate community services.</p>
<p>Specific observations included:</p>
<ul><li>ICF-MR's bias toward large facilities</li>
<li>The need for <b>incentives</b>, rather than threats for devveloping  		  community services</li>
</ul><h4>II. Service System Profile</h4>
<p><b>Major Actors in the Service System</b></p>
<p>The major agencies involved in providing services to the MR/DD  		population include the Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation  		(DMHMR), the Department of Medical Assistance and Services (DMAS), and the 40  		local CSBs.</p>
<p><i><b>DMHMR Responsibilities</b></i></p>
<ul><li>Administration and operation of the state's large public residential  		  facilities (PRFs) for the mentally retarded</li>
<li>Planning, policysetting, and budget development</li>
<li>Monitoring and quality assurance</li>
<li>Funding of the 40 CSBs (although DMHMR and the local CSBs sign annual  		  performance agreements, DMHMR has no line authority over the CSBs)</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Community Service Board (CSB) Responsibilities</b></i></p>
<ul><li>CSBs provide six core services defined by statute (emergency care,  		  in/out patient services, residential care, day support, and  		  prevention/intervention services) to mentally ill and MR/DD individuals, and  		  substance abusers. Only emergency services are mandated.</li>
<li>The state provides funds which range from 37 percent to 90 percent of  		  individual CSB budgets.</li>
<li>The local share of CSB budgets is raised from a mix of local property  		  taxes, client fees, and other contributions.</li>
<li>Individual CSBs have significant autonomy in planning, policy  		  setting, and service delivery. A local CSB can choose the services to be  		  provided, the method of service delivery, and, to a limited extent, the  		  population to be served. The CSB may either provide services directly or  		  through contract.</li>
<li>Monitoring and quality assurance also are CSB responsibilities. </li>
</ul><p><i><b>DMAS Responsibilities</b></i></p>
<ul><li>Administration of the ICF-MR program; DMHMR pays the non-Federal  		  match.</li>
<li>Monitoring of the ICF-MR program: the Department of Health licenses  		  the ICFs-MR; DMAS conducts an annual inspection of care and utilization review  		  for each facility and each resident, checking for active treatment and client  		  eligibility for ICF-MR; and DMAS can decertify Individual clients and deny  		  payment for services.</li>
<li>DMAS provides training and technical assistance for DMHMR personnel  		  and ICF-MR operators.</li>
</ul><p>Other important actors in the MR/DD service system include: the  		Department for Rights of the Disabled; the Department of Education; local  		school districts; the Department of Rehabilitative Services (DRS);  		ARC-Virginia; and Parents and Associates of the Institutionalized Retarded  		(P.A.LR.), a pro-institution advocacy group.</p>
<p><i><b>Interagency Cooperation</b></i></p>
<ul><li>DMHMR has formal interagency agreements on both the state and local  		  levels with DMAS and the DRS</li>
<li>Respondents from both DMHMR and DMAS reported that, in addition to  		  formal agreements, the actual working relationship between the two agencies has  		  improved in recent years.</li>
<li>One respondent described the status of interagency cooperation as  		  "working toward working together." He cited a new interagency agreement  		  involving 11 human service agencies which will enable the individual agencies  		  to understand more clearly what the other agencies do.</li>
</ul><p><b>Institutional Services</b></p>
<p>Virginia operates five state training centers for the mentally retarded  		with a total capacity of 3,000 beds. (The current census is slightly under  		capacity.) All beds are ICFMR or SNF certified. HCFA "look-behind" surveys  		recently forced the state to make large capital investments and staffing  		increases in the state facilities to comply with physical plant and active  		treatment requirements.</p>
<p><b>Community Services</b></p>
<p>Nearly all CBS are operated through the CSB system. As a result,  		services vary greatly throughout the state. CSBs have the option of contracting  		with the private sector, but respondents indicated that the use of private  		providers is limited.</p>
<p><i><b>Residential Services</b></i></p>
<p>CSBs operate more than 100 group homes for 12 or fewer people. CSBs also  		operate or contract for small ICFs-MR with a total capacity of 200 beds. The  		Department of Social Services operates "adult homes"--similar to foster  		homes--for mentally retarded adults.</p>
<p><i><b>Non-Residential Services</b></i></p>
<p>Non-residential CBS provided by CSBs Include case management, vocational  		training and supported employment, day treatment programs, and emergency  		services. Three CSBs are developing family support and respite care as pilot  		projects.</p>
<p>Approximately 3000 children participate in the infant stimulation  		program.</p>
<p>The DRS, DMHMR, and the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center at  		Virginia Commonwealth University are working together on a major supported  		employment project that is made up of the following:</p>
<ul><li>The project is funded through a 5-year grant from OSERS in the U.S.  		  Department of Education.</li>
<li>The emphasis of the supported employment programs is assisting  		  severely disabled people who have not previously been successful in competitive  		  employment.</li>
<li>The program uses a variety of models of supported employment  		  including the use of job coaches, placement of small groups of disabled people  		  in established industry, and the use of mobile work crews.</li>
</ul><p>Virginia requires local school districts to provide special education  		services for all handicapped children aged 2 to 21. Virginia's requirement for  		special education preceded P.L. 94-142.</p>
<p>The Department of Education has recently initiated a program to address  		the needs of handicapped students exiting special education. This program  		involves vocational assessments for students in the years prior to their  		leaving school in an attempt to prepare for transition to appropriate  		vocational programs.</p>
<p><i><b>Client Population</b></i></p>
<p>Approximately 7,500 people with mental retardation receive community  		services. The majority of people with mental retardation and developmental  		disabilities who are being served in community programs have never been in the  		large state facilities, and, in general, are less disabled than those in the  		state training centers. CSBs have traditionally regarded the residents of the  		training centers as a state responsibility, and MR/DD people living in local  		communities as CSB responsibilities. CSB representatives did not report any  		significant pressure from the state to serve people who are being de  		institutionalized.</p>
<p><b>General Financing and Service Development Issues</b></p>
<p>DMHMR reports that expenditures for institutional and community services  		total approximately $126 million. Of this total, $105 million supports the  		state-operated training centers. State funding for community services is $21  		million.</p>
<p><i><b>ICF-MR Program</b></i></p>
<p>Most state facility beds are ICF-MR certified (the rest are SNF  		certified). There is one privately operated 60 person ICF-MR, and approximately  		12 CSB-operated ICFs-MR for 16 or fewer people.</p>
<p>Clients are admitted to ICFs-MR on the basis of financial eligibility  		and a functional assessment. One respondent noted that financial eligibility  		criteria do not serve as a restraint on admissions to ICFs-MR; those who  		qualify on the basis of the functional assessment can nearly always qualify  		financially. Expenditures for the ICF-MR program total approximately $97  		million.</p>
<p><i><b>Waiver Experience</b></i></p>
<p>Virginia submitted a Waiver proposal in 1985, but HCFA did not approve  		the application. Respondents suggested several reasons for HCFA's disapproval  		and the state's decision not to pursue revisions:</p>
<ul><li>The high cost of the services proposed</li>
<li>The proposal became too complicated and was prepared under a great  		  deal of publicity--"it tried to be all things to all people"</li>
<li>Lack of effective cooperation between DMHMR and DMAS</li>
<li>Concern about the instability of the Waiver</li>
</ul><p>DMHMR and DMAS officials and other respondents indicated that some of  		the problems which plagued the development of the first Waiver proposal have  		been resolved. Virginia plans to submit a new Waiver proposal in 1987 or  		1988.</p>
<p><i><b>Community Service Development Costs</b></i></p>
<p>The costs of developing community services are usually financed through  		CSB operating or capital budgets. Although the state has provided some startup  		funds--usually allotted through an RFP process--DMHMR officials report that the  		level of state investment in community services is relatively low in comparison  		to investment in institutions.</p>
<h4>III. Experience With and Development of CBS</h4>
<p><b>Development of CBS in Virginia</b></p>
<p>Virginia established the framework for the delivery of CBS with the  		establishment of the CSB. The creation of the CSB system committed the state to  		a decentralized approach to the development of community services for the MR/DD  		population. The population of the large PRFs has declined from approximately  		4,500 to 3,000 over the past 10 years. Although the training centers currently  		admit clients, the overall census continues to decline.</p>
<p>Unlike many other states, Virginia has not had the impetus of either a  		major class action lawsuit or a strong network of pro-CBS advocates to expedite  		the development of community services. Virginia's limited progress in  		developing an extensive and comprehensive network of CBS was attributed to:</p>
<ul><li>The absence of a strong pro-CBS advocacy group</li>
<li>The high level of financial and emotional investment in the state  		  training centers</li>
<li>The influence of P.A.I.R.</li>
<li>A general lack of resources</li>
</ul><p><b>Current Emphasis on CBS</b></p>
<p>The consensus among respondents seemed to be that although Virginia is  		in a period of transition to a stronger emphasis on CBS, the state continues to  		rely heavily on large PRFs:</p>
<ul><li>DMHMR officials estimate that approximately 80 percent of state MR/DD  		  expenditures are for institutional services</li>
<li>Several respondents indicated that although the state has voiced a  		  commitment to community services, financial support has not followed yet. DMHMR  		  officials and several other respondents are optimistic about the legislature's  		  willingness to increase support for MR/DD services.</li>
</ul><p><b>Gaps in CBS</b></p>
<p>Interviewees reported that significant gaps remain in the community  		service system:</p>
<ul><li>Nearly all respondents cited the lack of affordable housing for the  		  MR/DD population as a major problem.</li>
<li>Case management, vocational services, and day treatment programs are  		  reportedly inadequate especially for the "aging out" population.</li>
<li>Respondents also indicated that children, dually diagnosed, medically  		  fragile and severely disabled clients, and autistic people are not served  		  well.</li>
<li>Some rural areas of the state lack the resources necessary to provide  		  all needed services.</li>
</ul><p><b>Goals for CBS/Issues to be Resolved</b></p>
<p>Future progress will be affected by:</p>
<ul><li>The level of public awareness of the needs of MR/DD people</li>
<li>The effectiveness of advocacy groups</li>
<li>The decentralized nature of the community service delivery  		  system</li>
<li>Legislative willingness to expand funding for MR/DD services</li>
<li>State of the economy</li>
</ul><p>Goals for community services:</p>
<ul><li>Meet the needs of MR/DD people who are not being served  		  adequately</li>
<li>Expand the range and level of services available in the  		  community</li>
<li>Improve services for severely handicapped individuals</li>
<li>Improve services for those in transition from special education to  		  adult life</li>
<li>Obtain a workable Title XIX waiver</li>
</ul><p>Issues to be resolved:</p>
<ul><li>Equitable allocation of state funds among CSBs</li>
<li>Shifting resources from operating budgets of state PRFs to  		  development and operation of community services through CSBs</li>
</ul><h4>IV. Perspectives on Federal Policy </h4>
<p><b>Incentives/Barriers</b></p>
<p>Respondents indicated that Federal policies impose several major  		barriers to community service expansion:</p>
<ul><li>The difficulty of using Medicaid funds to support community services  		  impedes progress in developing those services. Specifically, respondents cited  		  the regulatory bias toward large facilities and the inability to "make the  		  dollars follow the client" from institution to community.</li>
<li>The high cost of complying with Federal ICF-MR regulations limits the  		  resources available for community services. This is especially true of the  		  costs associated with complying with the results of the look-behind  		  surveys.</li>
<li>Complex Federal wage and hour laws pose problems for some,  		  less-sophisticated community providers.</li>
</ul><p><b>Policy Recommendations</b></p>
<p>The majority of suggestions about Federal policy changes focused on  		Medicaid reform:</p>
<ul><li>Offer incentives for increasing CBS rather than penalties for not  		  doing so. For example, one respondent suggested establishing higher Federal  		  matching rates for community services.</li>
<li>Modify regulations to correct ICF-MR's institutional bias.</li>
<li>Allow Medicaid funds to focus on the client and individual service  		  instead of on facilities.</li>
<li>Create a separate MR/DD authority within Medicaid.</li>
<li>Remove ICF-MR from Medicaid.</li>
<li>Change waiver requirements to cover the temporarily higher costs of  		  operating a dual institutional/community system.</li>
</ul><p>Other suggestions included:</p>
<ul><li>A tax incentive for parents of an MR/DD person to set aside money to  		  meet the future needs of their child</li>
<li>Federal efforts to help alleviate the shortage of affordable housing  		  </li>
</ul><p>Nearly all respondents stressed the need for the Federal Government to  		take a stronger leadership role in promoting community services for the MR/DD  		population.</p>
<h4>V. Summary</h4>
<p><b>General Observations</b></p>
<p>If judged on the basis of expenditures and available services, Virginia  		does not emphasize CBS for the MR/DD population. However, all respondents  		displayed strong interest in expanding the range of services available in the  		community. The major obstacles appear to be the heavy investment in  		institutions, and the difficulty of meeting rising institutional costs while  		trying to develop and operate community services.</p>
<p>The decentralized nature of the community service delivery system limits  		the <b>state's</b> ability to implement policy decisions.</p>
<p><b>Federal Policy Implications</b></p>
<p>Because Virginia has not used Title XIX to support CBS, minor changes in  		the ICF/MR program are unlikely to have a major effect on the array and  		availability of program services.</p>
<p>The reorientation of Title XIX to CBS, including reduced incentives to  		fund PRFs, has the potential to promote expanded resources to the CSBs for  		community services. A <b>permanent</b> HCB Waiver might be helpful in  		addressing concerns that the state would have to pick up Federal costs should  		the Waiver demonstration end.</p>
<p>The state is committed to the CSB system; however, the state's lack of  		control over the CSBs' decisions means that Federal policy changes which affect  		state incentives will not necessarily be translated into expanded/improved  		community MR/DD services.</p>
