</dl><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a> </h2>
<p>Researchers, policy makers, and the media have focused considerable  		attention on the problems of families and how some families are failing to meet  		the needs of their members. Much less attention has been paid to strong,  		healthy families, and the characteristics that make them successful.  		Understanding the "secrets" of strong families would be useful to clinicians  		and counselors as they plan intervention programs designed to help families.  		The extent to which the characteristics of healthy families are skills that can  		be taught has implications for policy development and intervention programs.  		Information on family strengths can also be useful to those seeking to improve  		family life. </p>
<p>The study of family strengths has been pursued by researchers from a  		variety of disciplines, including psychiatry, sociology, psychology, and  		family/marriage counseling. This paper will present an overview of this growing  		literature, focusing on four topics: </p>
<ul><li>the definition of strong families; </li>
<li>the characteristics of strong families as identified by various  		  researchers; </li>
<li>the operationalization of these characteristics; and </li>
<li>the methodological, policy, and intervention issues that the research  		  raises. </li>
</ul><p>A review of the literature on successful families suggests two general  		strategies that have been used to uncover the ingredients that make for family  		success. First, there is the study of family strengths per se. This is a body  		of research that looks at strong families in order to identify what makes them  		strong. Stinnett and DeFrain's work at the Family Strengths Research Project  		represents such a perspective. They focus on strengths. Alternatively, there  		are researchers who study healthy or normal families and the characteristics  		that differentiate them from their dysfunctional counterparts. These  		researchers often begin by examining problem families (such as those of mental  		patients) and contrasting them with healthy families. The work of Olson,  		McCubbin, Beavers, and Lewis illustrate this approach. </p>
<p>Research focusing on topics other than successful families is often  		relevant to the study of strong families. For example, research on family  		communication, time use in families, and conflict resolution among families and  		couples can help shed light on the processes within families that make them  		strong or that undermine their ability to be successful. This research can  		provide empirical support for hypotheses about the importance to family  		functioning of a given family characteristic. In addition, the constructs and  		measures developed in these more narrow and intense studies can potentially be  		adopted for use in broad assessments of the multiple factors that determine  		family success. This overview will focus, however, primarily on studies  		specifically on successful families research. </p>
<h2><a name="defining" id="defining">DEFINING A SUCCESSFUL FAMILY</a> </h2>
<p>Any attempt to understand the "secrets" of strong families must begin  		with an understanding of the definition of a successful family. A family can be  		identified as successful by the characteristics of the individual members, by  		the characteristics of the family interaction, or by the extent to which it  		fulfills certain functions considered to be the responsibility of the family.  		</p>
<p>One criterion for a successful family is that it is able to reproduce  		itself; i.e. to raise children who go on to establish stable and harmonious  		families themselves. This is, of course, a broad and somewhat circular  		definition that is difficult to apply at a given point because of the time  		involved in waiting for children to establish families of their own. A number  		of additional definitions are available for consideration. </p>
<p>Some researchers have approached the question of defining a successful  		family by developing models and perspectives about the functions of the family.  		The functions that have been used have tended to be psychological ones, rather  		than societal or economic functions of the family. For example, Lewis and  		colleagues, approaching the study of the family from a clinical perspective,  		use Parson's two cardinal tasks of a family to guide their research: "A family  		<i>ought</i> to raise children who become autonomous, and it <i>should</i>  		provide sufficient emotional support for stabilizing the parents' personalities  		and continuing their emotional maturation. To the extent a family accomplishes  		these tasks, it can be considered competent; to the extent it fails at one or  		both tasks, it can be considered less competent or dysfunctional" (Lewis and  		Looney, 1983, p. 4). Thus, a family is successful to the extent that it  		provides an environment appropriate for the development of child and parent  		alike. </p>
<p>Stinnett, coming from a family strengths research perspective, proposes  		that a successful or strong family "creates a sense of positive family  		identity, promotes satisfying and fulfilling interaction among members,  		encourages the development of family group and individual members, and is able  		to deal with stress" (Stinnett, 1979). This definition used by Stinnett differs  		from Lewis' in that it includes an element of satisfaction with family life in  		addition to positive individual outcomes. This difference has implications for  		operationalizing the definition, which will be discussed in a later section.  		</p>
<p>David Olson and colleagues propose that families should be able to: 1)  		"cope with stress and problems in an efficient and effective way;" 2) "have and  		use coping resources both from within and from outside the family;" and 3)  		"have the ability to end up being more cohesive, more flexible and more  		satisfied as a result of effectively overcoming stress and problems" (Olson,  		1986, p. 104). Their focus is on a family's ability to adjust, in the face of  		change or crisis, with an emphasis on the changes across the family life cycle.  		Their definition of a strong family is contingent on family interaction rather  		than the characteristics of the individual. </p>
<h2><a name="constructs" id="constructs">CONSTRUCTS</a> </h2>
<p>Based on various assumptions about what a strong family does,  		researchers have developed lists of particular <b>characteristics that are  		common among successful families</b>. The traits identified by some of these  		researchers are found in <a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a>. These represent a  		combination of structural and behavioral attributes of the family. Much of the  		research that went into identifying these characteristics was based on models  		of family functioning that point to specific areas of family dynamics that are  		critical to successful family functioning. </p>
<p>Despite some disparities, a perusal of <a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a>  		reveals <b>a number of similarities</b> across researchers. Thus, in spite of  		differences in discipline and perspective, there seems to be a consensus about  		the basic dimensions of a strong, healthy family. In an unpublished review of  		the literature, Judson Swihart identifies those characteristics of strong  		families that are most frequently mentioned by researchers. </p>
<p>These constructs, which are often interrelated and complex, will form  		the framework for the remainder of the discussion on the characteristics of  		strong families. These constructs are: </p>
<ul><li>communication </li>
<li>encouragement of individuals </li>
<li>commitment to family </li>
<li>religious orientation </li>
<li>social connectedness </li>
<li>ability to adapt </li>
<li>expressing appreciation </li>
<li>clear roles </li>
<li>time together </li>
</ul><p>In a later section, each of these constructs will be identified, defined  		and described briefly as it exists in strong, healthy families. In addition, a  		sample of the instruments used to measure it will be presented. First, we  		briefly describe several approaches to operationalizing what it means to be a  		strong or successful family. </p>
<h2><a name="measures" id="measures">MEASURES</a> </h2>
<h3>Identifying Strong or Successful Families</h3>
<p>In empirical research, criteria must be selected to use in identifying a  		strong family so a set of characteristics common to them can be assembled.  		Despite general agreement on the characteristics of strong families, the  		criteria that are used in a research study to differentiate between a  		functional and a dysfunctional family will depend on the perspective of the  		researcher and what s/he considers to be the functions of a family, and how  		s/he defines success. For example, is the education of children a family  		function or not? Is it more important to children to grow up to be happy or  		economically self-sufficient, or are both essential? Researchers have  		operationalized the concept of a strong family in a number of ways. </p>
<p>Some researchers identify strong families as those that are  		nonpathological or nonclinical (for example, Olson, Lewis, Beavers, etc.). That  		is, they study clinical and nonclinical families and then identify dynamics or  		characteristics which distinguish between the two. Thus, a strong family is one  		whose members are not seeking professional help, are not alcoholics, are not  		schizophrenics, etc. These researchers have developed models of family  		functioning based on different assumptions of what a family is supposed to do.  		They use these models to identify patterns of interaction that distinguish  		between well-functioning and poorly functioning families, based on the  		differences between clinical and nonclinical families. They describe the  		characteristics in terms of the way these families deal with certain issues  		(power, conflict, affective issues, etc.) </p>
<p>Other researchers, those studying family strengths per se, use a  		different method for distinguishing between strong families and weak families.  		In their research, Stinnett and DeFrain have selected strong families based on  		three assumptions: 1) "they would have a high degree of marital happiness;" 2)  		"they would have satisfying parent-child relationships;" and 3) "family members  		would do a good job of meeting each other's needs" (Stinnett and DeFrain, 1985,  		p. 9). </p>
<p>They identify strong families in their research in two ways. In an  		initial study, subjects were located through a nomination process. Most of the  		respondents for a second data collection project were volunteers responding to  		a newspaper ad requesting participants for a research project on strong  		families. Participants in both of these studies were screened using a  		self-report family and marital satisfaction scale. Those who scored very high  		were included in the study. Thus, for the most part, successful families have  		been operationalized as those people who are identified by themselves or others  		to be successful. The characteristics of these families are then studied. The  		nomination process has also been used by Lawrence Gary, in his study of the  		strengths of stable, black families (Gary et al., 1983). </p>
<p>A result of this type of research is the identification of a set of  		characteristics that families identify as important to family functioning,  		traits that make them a strong family. In their study of American Indian,  		black, Chicano, white, and Hmong families, Abbott and Meredith find a number of  		similarities across all these groups as to what parents consider to be traits  		of healthy families (Abbott &amp; Meredith, 1985). </p>
<h3>Measurement Strategies</h3>
<p>Researchers have devised a number of means to measure characteristics of  		family life. The methods range from large scale surveys to observation  		techniques. The assessments vary in scope from measures of total family  		functioning to the measurement of component constructs. Prior to reviewing each  		individual construct, the issue of "total family functioning" must be  		addressed. </p>
<p>Much research on family strengths and successful families has been in  		the assessment of total family functioning. In these inventories, the entire  		set of characteristics that are identified by the researcher to be important to  		the functioning of a successful family is built into one scale which measures  		"total family functioning." These instruments are often used as screening  		mechanisms for clinicians or as an identifier of a strong family for research  		purposes. That is, families who score high on this overall assessment are  		considered strong, successful families. </p>
<p>One such paper-and-pencil measure is Olson's Family Adaptability and  		Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES). This scale was designed specifically to  		test hypotheses derived from his Circumplex Model. The two main dimensions  		measured are cohesion and adaptability, which are operationalized in terms of  		measures of component constructs such as commitment, encouragement of  		individual members, time together, and social connectedness (Olson, 1982). </p>
<p>Moos' Family Environment Scale, another "total family functioning  		measure" consists of three subscales focusing on different dimensions of the  		family: relationship, personal growth, and system maintenance. Again, these  		dimensions are operationalized in terms of cohesion, expressiveness, conflict,  		control, organization, etc., and are assessed by having study participants fill  		out forms that describe their family (Moos and Moos, 1986). </p>
<p>The Beavers Timberlawn Family Evaluation Scale (BTFES) is an example of  		an observation technique for assessing total family functioning. A trained  		clinician observes a video tape of family interaction and assesses the family  		across several dimensions to achieve an overall family functioning measure.  		This measurement technique has been used by Lewis in studies of  		well-functioning working class blacks, as well as married couples making the  		transition to parenthood (Lewis and Looney, 1983; Lewis, 1989). </p>
<p>In the following sections, we will discuss component constructs and  		describe how they manifest themselves in successful families. Where possible,  		specific examples of instruments used to measure them will be identified. Of  		course these measures often are subscales of total family functioning  		instruments, such as those described above. </p>
<h3>Measures of Communication</h3>
<p>The presence of effective communication patterns is one of the most  		frequently mentioned characteristics of strong families (Swihart, 1988).  		Researchers characterize the communication patterns of strong families as  		clear, open, and frequent. Family members talk to each other often, and when  		they do, they are honest and open with each other (For example, Stinnett &amp;  		DeFrain, 1985; Lewis, 1979; Epstein, 1983; Olson, 1986). Indeed, the Circumplex  		Model, developed by Olson and colleagues, identifies communication as the  		facilitating dimension of a functional family. </p>
<p>Many people have studied communication patterns in the family and have  		used a variety of methods, including both observational and self-report survey  		instruments. Grotevant's work on the contribution of the family to identity  		formation in adolescents provides an example of observation work which links  		family communication patterns with positive individual outcomes. This study  		involved the observation of 121 families with a high school senior as they  		perform a decision-making task. In his work, Grotevant finds that individuals  		from families characterized by open and clear communication score higher on  		measures of self-esteem (Grotevant, 1983). </p>
<p>Barnes and Olson have developed a self-report instrument that focuses on  		the nature of communication during the often difficult period of adolescence.  		This inventory collects perceptions from three family members: both parents and  		the adolescent. In this instrument, respondents are questioned about "the  		amount of openness, the extent of problems or barriers to family communication  		and the degree to which people are selective in their discussion with other  		family members" (Olson et al., 1982, p. 34). </p>
<p>Swihart points out that communication skills are a particularly fruitful  		area in terms of intervention. Skill in communication and teaching families to  		communicate better has been a successful intervention technique and is the  		focus of many programs (Swihart, 1988). </p>
<h3>Measures of Encouragement, Appreciation and  		Commitment</h3>
<p>The next three characteristics are closely linked, and so will first be  		addressed as a whole, and then individually. The encouragement of individual  		members, expressing appreciation, and commitment to family are all affective  		aspects of family life that are closely related to a dimension identified by  		several researchers as cohesion. Olson defines cohesion as the feeling of  		closeness and attachment of family members to each other. The instrument he  		uses to measure this construct (FACES) consists of subscales that include the  		above three characteristics. Thus, Olson defines cohesion as a sum of, among  		other things, commitment, appreciation and support, and the encouragement of  		the individual within the context of the family (Olson et al., 1982). </p>
<p>Numerous researchers have identified the construct of cohesion as  		important, though sometimes with slightly different definitions. Furthermore,  		there have been a number of techniques developed to measure the construct. In  		addition to verbal self-report techniques, non-verbal techniques have been used  		to measure cohesion. For example, Feldman, in her study of changing perceptions  		of family power and cohesion across adolescence, had adolescents represent the  		amount of closeness between family members by placing figures on a board.  		Closeness was defined by how far apart members were placed in relation to each  		other. She used this as an indication of cohesion (Feldman and Gehring, 1988).  		</p>
<p>Although the summary concept of cohesion has been measured by a variety  		of techniques, measures of the component characteristics of encouragement of  		individual members, commitment to family, and expression of appreciation are  		much less common. </p>
<p>The <b>encouragement of individual members</b> encompasses a wide range  		of affective dimensions related to support, recognition and respect. Swihart  		reviews the basic concept as it manifests itself in strong families: "Strong  		families appreciated the uniqueness of each family member while cultivating a  		sense of belonging to the family. Individuals enjoyed the family framework  		which provided structure but did not confine" (Swihart, 1988, p. 3). Thus, the  		development of the autonomy of its members, within a supportive environment, is  		an important function of the family, and a characteristic of strong families.  		</p>
<p>Grotevant's observational study of family characteristics and adolescent  		development is relevant to this dimension. This study describes the form that  		this takes in families with successful identity formation of the children. He  		notes: "...these studies converge on the conclusion that both connectedness (as  		indicated by support, cohesiveness, and acceptance) and individuality (as  		indicated by disagreements) in family interaction are related to identity  		formation in late adolescence" (Grotevant, 1983, p. 231). Grotevant identifies  		the nature of the family interaction and provides evidence for the support of  		the importance of the encouragement of the individual as a characteristic of a  		successful family. </p>
<p>Stinnett describes <b>commitment to the family</b> as follows:  		"Commitment ... goes in two directions. Each family member is valued; each is  		supported and sustained. At the same time they are committed to the family as a  		unit. They have a sense of being a team; they have a family identity and unity.  		When outside pressures (work, for example) threaten to remove family from its  		top priority, members of strong families take action and make sacrifices if  		necessary to preserve family well-being" (Stinnett, 1986, p. 48). </p>
<p>"Delivering a high level of positive reinforcement to family members,  		day in and day out, doing things that are positive from the other person's  		perspective, just for their sake, not merely as a strategy for "buying their  		love," etc.", is Schumm's description of <b>appreciation</b> as an important  		characteristic of strong families (Schumm, 1986, p. 122). Measures of  		commitment to the family and expressing appreciation are most often found as  		subscales of family functioning scales, such as Moos and Moos' Family  		Environment Scale, or Stinnett and DeFrain's Family Strengths Inventory. Few  		instruments offer assessments of these constructs on their own. </p>
<h3>Measures of Religious Orientation</h3>
<p>Religious orientation is identified by many researchers as being an  		important component of strong families. Most researchers point out that  		religious orientation/spiritual wellness is not necessarily contingent on  		membership in any particular denomination, or on frequency of church  		attendance. Stinnett offers a sample of the various forms religious or  		spiritual wellness can take: "For many, the yearnings of their spiritual nature  		are expressed by membership in an organized religious body such as a church,  		synagogue, or temple. For others spirituality manifests a concern for others,  		involvement in worthy causes, or adherence to a moral code" (Stinnett, 1986, p.  		48). Thus, this construct has not always been defined in terms of measures of  		frequency of church attendance or adherence to a specific belief. Rather, the  		emphasis is that strong families are guided by an underlying moral or value  		system shared by all members. Subscales in a number of the self-report  		inventories designed to assess total family functioning measure this construct,  		in particular, Moos and Moos' Family Environment Scale and Olson's Enriching  		and Nurturing Relationship Issues, Communication, and Happiness Scale (ENRICH).  		Stinnett and DeFrain, in their Family Strengths Inventory, also assess this  		dimension. In the Family Environment Scale, respondents are asked to respond  		true or false to such questions as: "Family members attend church, synagogue,  		or Sunday school fairly often," and "We don't believe in heaven and hell" (Moos  		and Moos, 1986). </p>
<h3>Measures of Adaptability</h3>
<p>A family's ability to adapt to stressful and potentially damaging  		events, as well as to predictable life-cycle changes, has been identified as an  		important characteristic of strong families. Researchers note that ability to  		adapt is contingent upon a number of other characteristics common to strong  		families such as effective communication, affective involvement, external  		resources, etc. (for example, Stinnett and DeFrain, Lewis, Olson, McCubbin).  		This section focuses on family characteristics not yet discussed that have been  		linked to successful adaptation. </p>
<p>Like cohesion, adaptability is a major dimension identified by Olson's  		Circumplex Model. Indeed, much of his research focuses on the ability or  		inability of different families to overcome stress and crises. This concept can  		be broken down into several individual constructs. Among these are two of the  		nine characteristics of strong families on which this paper is focusing. First,  		a family's <b>social connectedness</b> affects its ability to seek external  		assistance in the face of problems. In addition, the <b>clear definition of  		roles</b> (in particular those related to the power structure) within the  		family is an important factor in its ability to adapt to changes. These will be  		addressed following a broader discussion of adaptability. </p>
<p>Adaptability, as a central dimension of the Circumplex Model, has been  		defined as "the ability of a marital or family system to change its power  		structure, role relationships, and relationship rules in response to  		situational and developmental stress" (Olson et al., 1989, p. 12). It is  		hypothesized that well-functioning families have modes of adaptation that are  		structured or flexible rather than rigid or chaotic. Olson qualifies this  		hypothesis in two important ways, which apply to both the adaptability and  		cohesion dimensions. First of all, in measuring these constructs, family  		members are asked to rate their families on both perceived and ideal  		situations. Thus, a level of satisfaction with current family dynamics is  		obtained. It is hypothesized that if all family members are satisfied with the  		family as it is, even though it may be considered extreme on either cohesion or  		adaptability, then the family will function effectively (Olson et al., 1989).  		</p>
<p>Second, Olson proposes that families at different stages in the life  		cycle (childless, with infants, with elementary school children, with  		adolescents, etc.) require different levels of cohesion and adaptability. That  		is, a level of cohesion that is functional in a family with an infant may not  		be once the child is an adolescent (Olson et al., 1989). </p>
<p>Olson uses the FACES self-report scale to measure the level of  		adaptability in the family. This is made up of questions developed to assess  		the family power, negotiation style, role relationships and relationship rules  		within the family. </p>
<h3>Measures of Social Connectedness</h3>
<p>Successful families are not isolated; they are connected to the wider  		society. One effect of such a connection is the subsequent availability of  		external resources, identified by researchers as important to effective coping  		by families. An intervention study by Cowan and Cowan offers support for the  		importance of social support in overcoming a stressful period in family life.  		In their research, they identified couples who were childless but planning to  		have their first child soon. This time period, the birth of a first child, is  		often identified as a particularly stressful one for families. Intervention  		consisted of group meetings at which couples discussed problems and issues  		pertinent to the arrival of a first child, and the husband-wife relationship.  		The authors provide evidence, based on comparisons to control groups receiving  		no intervention, that this form of social support was helpful in the partner's  		transition to parenthood (Cowan and Cowan, 1987). </p>
<p>One way to measure social connectedness is to ask families to identify  		those external resources available to them. For example, McCubbin's self-report  		F-COPES (Family Coping Strategies) Scale assesses the extent to which a family  		turns to friends, family, neighbors, and community resources when they are  		facing a crisis (Olson et al., 1982). In their study of stable black families,  		Gary and colleagues assessed this dimension by asking questions about  		respondents' participation in organizations in the community, as well as the  		presence of relatives in the area, and neighbors who were considered close  		friends (Gary et al., 1983). </p>
<h3>Measures of Clear Roles</h3>
<p>Many researchers identify clear role definition as an important  		characteristic of family functioning, and as essential for a family's ability  		to adapt to changing situations. With a clear, yet flexible structure in place,  		family members are aware of their responsibilities in and to the family.  		Consequently, in the face of crisis and problems, members know their roles. The  		McMaster Family Assessment Device (Epstein, et al, 1983), a self-report  		instrument, has a subscale that measures roles in the family. The authors note  		the nature of this aspect of family functioning: "[it] focuses on whether the  		family has established patterns of behavior for handling a set of family  		functions ... In addition, assessment of the roles dimension includes  		consideration of whether tasks are clearly and equitably assigned to family  		members and whether tasks are carried out responsibly by family members"  		(Epstein, et al, 1983). An eight-item subscale provides a measure of this  		construct. </p>
<p>Related to the concept of role definition is the issue of power. Who  		decides what and how it is decided are indicators of the role structure in the  		family. Within healthy families, there is a clear recognition that the parents  		are in charge. At the same time, parents are open to their children's input --  		the parents are rarely seen as authoritarian (Lewis, 1979, pp. 87-88). </p>
<p>Power and control have been measured by a number of techniques. In her  		study on adolescent's perception of power and cohesion in the family, Feldman  		uses a projective instrument to assess the power structure of the family.  		Subjects symbolically represent their family's power structure by elevating on  		blocks figures that represent individuals in the family. The relative height of  		the figures is taken to indicate the perceived ability of that member to  		influence other members (Feldman and Gehring, 1988). </p>
<p>In the Family Assessment Device described above, the nature of behavior  		control is assessed in terms of the "way a family expresses and maintains  		standards for the behavior of its members. Behavior in situations of different  		sorts is assessed as are different patterns of control" (Epstein, et al, 1983).  		This nine-item self-report subscale asks questions about family rules and  		expectations. A number of other self-report instruments have been designed with  		subscales that tap the power dynamics in the family, including Moos and Moos'  		Family Environment Scale. </p>
<h3>Measures of Time Together</h3>
<p>A final ingredient in family strength is spending time together.  		Researchers note that this includes quality as well as quantity of time.  		Self-report instruments assessing family functioning address this topic in  		terms of the quality of time spent together, and the extent to which families  		enjoy spending time together. Questions are asked about whether "family members  		like to spend their free time with each other" (Olson's FACES) and about  		"spending time together and doing things with each other" (Stinnett and  		DeFrain, Family Strengths Inventory). Detailed methodological work on this  		construct has been conducted by researchers interested in time use per se,  		which could be adapted for use in the study of successful families. </p>
<h2><a name="method" id="method">METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES</a> </h2>
<p>The following methodological limitations and issues must be considered  		in evaluating the study of family strengths and successful families: </p>
<p><i><b>The use of small and non-random samples. </b></i></p>
<p>Samples used in research on family strengths studies are often small and  		seldom representative of the national population or even of a known  		subpopulation. Studies on strong families by clinicians are also characterized  		by small, homogenous samples. For example, Beavers and Lewis studied 33  		families, the majority of which were white, Protestant, middle- to upper-class,  		biologically intact families with an oldest child in adolescence (Beavers,  		1977). Research using self-report surveys has a tendency to employ larger  		samples, but these are rarely representative. The majority of the 1,146  		families who participated in the study by Olson and colleagues, for example,  		were Caucasian and Lutheran (Olson et al., 1982). Stinnett and DeFrain have  		analyzed data from more diverse samples, but participant families were mostly  		self-selected. Few studies have focused on black, Hispanic, or low-income  		families. The extent to which one can generalize the findings of family  		strength studies to the population as a whole is limited by the nature of the  		samples. </p>
<p><i><b>The applicability of findings-based on white, middle-class  		families to other groups. </b></i></p>
<p>A review of the family strengths literature reveals that much of the  		work in this field has focused on white, and/or middle-class families. This has  		obvious implications for the ability to generalize the findings to the  		population as a whole, as well as to subgroups such as minorities and  		low-income families. Studies of minority families that are relevant to  		successful family research range from those which focus on minority families  		and attempt to identify their particular strengths, to those in which minority  		families and/or low income families are compared with white and/or middle-class  		families across a variety of dimensions. In the latter case, researchers often  		use models, constructs, and instruments that were initially developed using  		white middle-class samples to study successful minority and low-income  		families. </p>
<p>Building on an initial study of 33 intact white, middle-class families  		in which Beavers and Lewis identified a number of characteristics of successful  		families, Lewis and Looney conducted a study that compared this sample with a  		sample of 18 working-class black families. Although they hypothesized that the  		differences in socioeconomic status would translate into differences in family  		characteristics, they found that there were few differences between the  		competent families in both samples. For the most part, the same traits that  		characterized the most competent white, middle-class families were  		characteristics of well-functioning, working-class black families (Lewis and  		Looney, 1983). </p>
<p>Similarly, Abbott and Meredith studied family strengths across five  		groups. Their sample consisted of 210 white parents, 105 Chicano parents, 103  		black parents, 80 Hmong parents, and 57 American Indian parents. The two  		objectives of their study were to: 1) identify those characteristics considered  		critical to effective family functioning; and 2) assess the level of family  		strengths across the ethnic groups. They made use of family strengths  		inventories developed by Stinnett and DeFrain, Olson, Curran, and others. They  		found that parents across all five ethnic groups generally agreed on the traits  		of healthy families. However, they also found that the white and Hmong families  		achieved the highest scores on the assessment instruments, followed by blacks,  		Chicanos, and American Indians, respectively. </p>
<p>The researchers acknowledged that a weakness of the study is that the  		assessment instruments were created and standardized using white, middle-class  		samples, thus possibly affecting the validity of the scores for the minority  		families. In an attempt to compensate for this problem, the researchers  		conducted in-depth interviews with a subgroup of the sample. These interviews  		revealed that subjects from all five groups viewed the items on the scales as  		fair indicators of family strengths (Abbott &amp; Meredith, 1985). </p>
<p>Lawrence Gary and his colleagues conducted an exploratory and  		descriptive study of 50 black families identified by community groups to be  		particularly strong and stable (Gary et al., 1983). They sought to identify the  		critical factors and conditions that contribute to strong black family life, as  		well as their coping strategies. They found that the families in their sample  		possessed many of the same characteristics identified previously by other  		researchers in the field, such as Hill, Scanzoni, Royce and Turner, and  		Stinnett. (See <a href="#appendA">appendix A</a> for a list of the  		characteristics identified by these researchers.) </p>
<p>Other researchers have explored differences between white families and  		black or Hispanic families across specific dimensions of family life. For  		example, Vega studied cohesion and adaptability in Hispanic and Anglo families  		using Olson's FACES instrument. In this study, he found that there were no  		important differences between the low-income Mexican American and middle-income  		Anglo parents in their perception of levels of family cohesion and adaptability  		(Vega et al., 1986). </p>
<p>In summary, an important methodological weakness of successful families  		and family strengths research has been the homogeneity of samples. While the  		studies described above have used more diverse samples, they have used  		instruments and measures that were created and standardized, for the most part,  		on white, middle-class families. The development of measures sensitive to  		various subpopulations seems an important step if successful family research is  		to become more relevant to the population as a whole. </p>
<p><i><b>Use of measures based on a single family members' perceptions.  		</b></i></p>
<p>In a discussion of research issues related to the study of family  		interaction, Christensen and Arrington provide a number of methodological  		comments relevant to family strengths research. One is that a family is  		composed of individuals interacting. The study of families, they argue, should  		therefore use techniques that assess interaction dynamics rather than  		individual characteristics. In much family interaction research, however, the  		unit of observation (the parent) is often different from the object of study  		(the family). That is, frequently, studies of families are based on perceptions  		of one parent. Some researchers have taken care to develop and assess measures  		capable of being completed by multiple family members (Olson's FACES, for  		example). The difficulty then becomes designing appropriate methods for  		combining the scores of a number of family members to arrive at a "family  		score". </p>
<p>Findings reported by several researchers that members of the same family  		often score quite differently on family assessment measures further supports  		the importance of obtaining measures from multiple family members (Christensen  		and Arrington, 1987). For example, Schumm, in his study of family satisfaction  		among Anglos and Mexican Americans, found that using just the scores from the  		mothers results in different conclusions than if the scores of the fathers and  		adolescents are considered as well (Schumm et al., 1988). </p>
<p>In addition to only assessing one family member's perspective,  		Christensen and Arrington point out that often times, the actual items on a  		self-report instrument designed to assess the family focus on the individual  		rather than on the interaction in the family. For example, a survey question  		might find out how often one member argued with another, but assess nothing  		about the circumstances that led to the argument, or how it was resolved. The  		latter are important descriptors in terms of understanding the nature of family  		interaction (Christensen and Arrington, 1987). </p>
<p>Even assessment techniques that observe family interaction are not  		immune to the problem of individual versus family. Christensen and Arrington  		note: "Observational analyses focus on rates of behavior for each individual  		present ... the data tell us nothing about who criticized whom, what each  		person did to elicit criticism, or what each person did in reaction to the  		criticism" (Christensen and Arrington, 1987, p. 262). They note as an exception  		the techniques of Gottman and Patterson, who examine, based on observation of  		family interactions, the "likelihood that a particular behavior by one family  		member will lead to or follow a behavior by another" (Christensen and  		Arrington, 1987, p. 262). </p>
<p><i><b>The effects of family life-cycle stages. </b></i></p>
<p>Family strengths research often, though not always, fails to recognize  		the impact of various life-cycle stages on the characteristics of strong  		families. Research by Olson and colleagues, for example, which does explore the  		effects of life cycle stage, has suggested that the dynamics most conducive to  		well-functioning families can vary depending on the structure of the household.  		Power structures and communication patterns that are effective for families  		with infants and toddlers may differ widely from families with adolescents and  		young adults. What is functional at one stage may be dysfunctional in another  		(Olson et al., 1989). Researchers studying family strengths must bear this in  		mind as they design studies and interpret findings. </p>
<p><i><b>Intercorrelations among family strengths characteristics.  		</b></i></p>
<p>The nine characteristics identified by researchers as important to  		successful family functioning are often highly correlated. For example, the  		ability to adapt is frequently associated with effective communication skills  		and connectedness to society, or clear role definitions may be impossible to  		achieve in families lacking effective communication skills. Schumm proposes a  		model that addresses the relationships among various characteristics of strong  		families. </p>
<p>Schumm argues that, "to date it appears that most work associated with  		the topic of family strengths has focused upon the identification and  		specification of concepts rather than attempts to interrelate concepts. For the  		family strengths literature to move in the direction of genuine theory  		construction as opposed to purely conceptual work, it is critical that a  		beginning be made in terms of interrelating concepts in the family strengths  		literature" (Schumm, 1985, p. 5). In light of this, Schumm proposes an initial  		model of how family strengths fit together. He identifies a number of ways in  		which some of the six traits identified by Stinnett are interrelated. For  		example, he links appreciation and commitment to spending time together.  		Schumm's model is diagrammed in <a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a>. </p>
<p>Schumm's model of family strengths has a number of implications for  		intervention. It suggests that when determining intervention techniques, the  		interrelatedness of family characteristics must be considered. As Schumm points  		out, focusing on one family dynamic may not be helpful until other interaction  		characteristics are addressed. It may be that a family's communication problems  		actually reflect an underlying lack of time together or lack of expression of  		appreciation among family members. Thus, a family's participation in a workshop  		to improve communication skills may not be helpful because the main problem  		lies elsewhere, and until that area is resolved, movement along the dimension  		of communication will be difficult (Schumm, 1985). </p>
<h2><a name="issues" id="issues">ISSUES RELEVANT TO APPLICATION OF FINDINGS</a> </h2>
<p>In addition to methodological issues, there are two broad questions that  		need to be answered about family strengths research before we can tell how much  		this body of research can contribute to the improvement of family functioning.  		They are: </p>
<p><i><b>Are family strengths causative, or merely symptomatic?  		</b></i></p>
<p>If the family strengths constructs were measured in a representative  		sample of families, along with other demographic, socioeconomic, and  		psychological characteristics of family members, would the constructs be  		predictive of whether the family would still be together and still be  		functioning harmoniously five or ten years in the future? How much predictive  		power would the constructs add, <b>over and above</b> that provided by measures  		of current marital satisfaction, marital conflict, education, income, and other  		family social assets? As far as we can tell, this question has never been  		empirically tested. </p>
<p>A related issue is whether traditional theoretical perspectives do not  		provide a more parsimonious and powerful understanding of family dynamics. None  		of the work uncovered to date compares the predictive power of successful  		family models with the power of models generated from other perspectives. It  		does not appear that the complementarity of models has yet been considered.  		</p>
<p><i><b>How transferable are "family strengths" to families that are not  		functioning well? </b></i></p>
<p>Even if it is demonstrated that the family strength characteristics are  		strong and unique predictors of successful functioning, there is the important  		question of whether these characteristics can be taught to those in families  		that are not functioning well. It may be that the family strengths depend on  		individual characteristics of family members such as intelligence, flexibility,  		emotional stability, etc., that have a substantial genetic component or depend  		on early upbringing. Teaching strengths to individuals who are unintelligent,  		rigid, hostile, or unstable might well prove to be a daunting undertaking. On  		the other hand, carefully constructed programs that introduce new strategies of  		living to families with problems might result in improved childrearing and  		family interaction at relatively low cost. </p>
<p>Obviously, the transferability issue is a significant one if the family  		strengths research is to have important policy applications. Again, as far as  		we can tell, this question has been little tested or even addressed in the  		existing literature. In addition, there are questions of transferability across  		class and ethnic lines, and applicability to single-parent and other  		non-traditional families, which could be profitably addressed in future  		studies. </p>
