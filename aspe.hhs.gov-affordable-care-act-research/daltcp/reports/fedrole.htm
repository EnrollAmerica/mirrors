<p>In November 1990, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation (ASPE) assembled a panel of experts of varying backgrounds to  		discuss the potential goals and roles of the federal government in the long  		term care insurance market. The panel included representatives from the  		insurance industry, consumer groups, the National Association of Insurance  		Commissioners (NAIC), the Health Insurance of America (HIAA), and government,  		as well as persons with expert knowledge of long term care insurance, The  		participants included the following: </p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The risks of needing long term care are significant: nearly one- third  		of all persons who turned age 65 in 1990 will spend at least three months in a  		nursing home before they die, and over 20 percent will spend one year or longer  		in a nursing home.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note1">1</a></sup></font> At  		an annual cost of $30,000, a year in a nursing home can be a catastrophic  		expense. </p>
<p>Long term care insurance provides the elderly with an opportunity to  		reduce the risk of the potentially catastrophic costs of long term care. It  		reduces the risk by spreading the costs of long term care among all purchasers  		of insurance. Spreading the costs of long term care across all insurance  		purchasers reduces the financial risk of long term care to any single  		individual. As a result, the well being of both purchasers who incur the risk  		and those who do not incur the risk is increased. Purchasers who incur long  		term care costs pay less than they would have because they have insurance. The  		well being of purchasers who do not incur the risk is also increased because  		they know that if the risk does occur they will be protected by insurance. </p>
<p>There is a sharp contrast between the elderly's lack of insurance for  		long term care and their protection against the risks of acute care. As of the  		end of 1990, over 1.9 million long term care insurance policies had been  		purchased.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note2">2</a></sup></font> Although  		analysts estimate that between 10 and 40 percent of the elderly could afford to  		purchase long term care insurance, less than five percent have done so. In  		contrast, almost all elderly persons are protected from high acute care costs  		by Medicare insurance and most elderly have private Medigap insurance. </p>
<h3>Barriers to Insurance Coverage</h3>
<p>Both supply and demand barriers help explain the disparity between the  		number of persons who could afford long term care insurance and the number who  		have actually purchased it. Key factors limiting consumer demand for long term  		care insurance include (see <a href="fedrole.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a>): </p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Lack of Information</b> -- Many elderly underestimate the  			 likelihood of requiring long term care services and the potential cost of those  			 services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Misperception of Public and Private Programs</b> -- Many people  			 believe that the Medicare program covers long term care services, when in fact  			 Medicare accounts for less than two percent of nursing home expenditures. There  			 is also a misperception that retiree health plans or Medicare supplemental  			 insurance covers long term care services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Delayed Preparation for/Denial of Long Term Care Needs</b> --  			 Many persons do not think about preparing for long term care needs until they  			 are too old or disabled to purchase insurance. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Complexity of Product and Lack of Standard Terminology</b> --  			 Long term care insurance is a complex product that is rapidly changing as it  			 matures. Due to this evolution of the product and the absence of standard terms  			 it is often unclear how a particular product compares to other products.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Uncertainty Concerning the Value of Products</b> -- Some  			 consumers are reluctant to purchase long term care insurance because they are  			 not sure if the products will cover the types of care they may need in the  			 future. In addition, a general misunderstanding and mistrust toward all  			 insurance products inhibits demand. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Lack of Clarity of Benefit Triggers/Premium Increase  			 Provisions</b> - - Many policies contain vague language that make the  			 circumstances under which benefits will be paid unclear, as well as when and  			 how much premiums may increase over time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consumer Confusion/Dissatisfaction</b> -- Consumer confusion and  			 dissatisfaction caused by misperceptions, the complexity of the product,  			 rapidly changing product lines, unclear benefit triggers, and uncertainty  			 concerning the value of the product, increases indecision among those  			 considering long term care insurance and also increases the likelihood that  			 purchase decisions will be delayed in order to wait for future products to be  			 developed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Long Lag Time Between Purchase and Benefit Payment</b> -- The  			 substantial amount of time between the purchase of long term care insurance and  			 when benefits are likely to be paid means that consumers may want to spend  			 their current dollars on items with a more rapid benefit, such as Medigap  			 policies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Misleading Marketing Practices</b> -- Consumers have reported  			 problems with the marketing, sale, and payment of benefits of long term care  			 insurance. Misleading and fraudulent marketing practices, denial of claims,  			 premium increases, and policy cancellations by a few insurance companies have  			 resulted in some long term care insurance purchasers failing to receive  			 benefits. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Affordability</b> -- Many of today's elderly have low incomes and  			 therefore cannot afford long term care insurance premiums that average almost  			 $100 per month at age 65. However, most elderly do spend comparable amounts on  			 Medigap insurance. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Perception of Need</b> -- Some consumers with adequate  			 information and without confusion decide they do not need long term care  			 insurance because they have too few assets to protect or have family and  			 friends available to provide care. </p>

</ul></td>
</tr></table><p>On the supply side, the following factors constrict the number of long  		term care insurance policies available on the market: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Lack of Interest from Large Group Markets</b> - Unlike most major  			 health/life products sold, long term care insurance has yet to capture the  			 interest of many large group markets. These large markets would allow insurers  			 to spread risks and reduce advertising and overhead costs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Lack of Data</b> -- Most insurers do not have the claims  			 experience necessary to confidently price long term care insurance, which leads  			 to coverage limitations and conservative pricing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Uncertainty of Tax Status</b> -- The uncertain tax status of  			 benefit payments and premiums has inhibited the marketing of long term care  			 insurance products. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Inconsistent/Inappropriate and Rapidly Changing Regulatory  			 Standards</b> -- Regulatory standards vary across states, and insurers must  			 tailor their products to the regulatory provisions of each state. With the many  			 changes in regulatory standards in the past five years, insurers' cost of  			 developing products has increased. Also, some regulation modeled after Medicare  			 supplemental policies regulation may be inappropriate for long term care  			 insurance. </p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Current Regulation</h3>
<p>In order to address the barriers to demand, some states have undertaken  		consumer education efforts to address the lack of information on the risk of  		using long term care and the misperception of public programs. Some have also  		instituted counseling programs to reduce consumer confusion. </p>
<p>Most states have concentrated their efforts on regulation of long term  		care insurance products. Virtually all states have regulations against  		fraudulent and misleading marketing practices, guidelines for standardized  		language to reduce confusion, and reporting requirements for determining the  		equitability of premiums. In addition to these standards, every state has an  		insurance department that enforces these regulations. </p>
<p>Some argue that current regulation and consumer education efforts  		related to long term care insurance do not adequately protect consumers. Others  		contend that once the market matures and a large proportion of states institute  		the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) model standards  		(which are discussed in this report) that many of the current problems will be  		addressed. </p>
<h3>Potential Government Role</h3>
<p>Given the state role, what role, if any, should the federal government  		play in consumer protection and the regulation of long term care insurance? How  		should the federal government address the supply and demand barriers to the  		purchase of long term care insurance? By reducing or eliminating barriers to  		the long term care insurance market, the federal government could contribute to  		increasing the economic security of those who purchase long term care insurance  		and, to some extent, reduce public expenditures for long term care in the long  		run. </p>
<p>There are at least four major goals the federal government might pursue  		if the current regulatory and incentive structures are judged inadequate. These  		four goals, and possible courses of action, for the federal government in the  		long term care insurance market are described below (see <a href="fedrole.htm#figure2">Figure 2</a>). </p>
<p><b>Increase Consumer Awareness</b> -- By increasing consumer awareness  		regarding the risk of long term care use, the lack of third party coverage for  		the costs of such care and the availability of mechanisms, such as long term  		care insurance, to cover the cost of such care, the government could assist  		individuals to reach more informed decisions about how to plan for their future  		long term care needs. Increased consumer awareness would address the lack of  		information, misperception of public and private programs, delayed preparation  		for and denial of long term care needs, and some of the confusion experienced  		by consumers when considering long term care insurance purchase. The federal  		government could increase consumer awareness through: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Information provided through current consumer education programs  			 (e.g., by funding state counseling programs and/or disseminating information  			 through Area Agencies on Aging);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expanded beneficiary assistance programs and new information  			 campaigns; and/or </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nominal tax subsidies for the purchase of long term care insurance  			 that would help educate consumers as well as reduce the after-tax cost of  			 insurance. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Increase Insurance Coverage</b> -- Similar to the consensus  		developing concerning health insurance, the government may determine that  		Americans should have protection against the cost of long term care services  		and that the best mechanism for ensuring that protection is long term care  		insurance. Establishing a goal of increased long term care insurance purchase  		implies efforts to eliminate most of the barriers to the growth of the market  		discussed above. If the government determines that the purchase of long term  		care insurance by Americans is desirable, the federal government could increase  		the number of individuals who purchase long term care insurance by: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Increasing consumer confidence in the market through mandated and/or  			 encouraged requirements for policies; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assisting states in enforcement of regulations, data collection,  			 monitoring, and consumer education efforts; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assisting insurers by providing a reinsurance pool (a mechanism to  			 protect any one insurer from unusually high claims) or data; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launching a consumer education campaign; and/or </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clarifying the federal tax code that applies to long term care  			 insurance and/or offering tax subsidies for the purchase of long term care  			 insurance.</p>

<ul><li>
<p><b>The Financial Strength of Insurers</b> -- Many experts recommend  			 that one of the foremost factors to consider when purchasing long term care  			 insurance is the financial status of the insurer. Financially strong insurers  			 are more likely to be able to pay future product benefits. The federal  			 government could ensure that insurers are financially strong through: 1)  			 additional and uniform mandated and/or encouraged solvency requirements for  			 insurers; 2) assistance to states in enforcement of regulations and technical  			 expertise; and/or 3) assistance for, insurers by providing a reinsurance pool  			 to reduce the risk of offering products and product features where there is  			 little known about the risk. </p>

<p><b>Benefit Payments</b> -- One concern of consumers is that insurers  			 may not provide promised benefits. The federal government could ensure the  			 payment of benefits through: 1) efforts to maintain the solvency of insurers  			 through reporting requirements or other regulations, 2) mandated and/or  			 encouraged requirements, such as loss ratios; and/or 3) assistance to states in  			 preventing fraud, particularly in the enforcement of regulations. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Consistent Enforcement</b> -- Consistent enforcement of  			 regulations in all states would guarantee all purchasers of long term care  			 insurance a minimum level of protection, possibly increasing consumer  			 confidence and minimizing abuses. The government could ensure consistent  			 enforcement of regulations for long term care insurance through: 1) federally  			 mandated and/or encouraged requirements to which states must adhere; and/or 2)  			 assistance to states through funding or technical expertise. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The Sale of Only "High Quality" Products</b> -- By guaranteeing  			 that only "high quality" long term care insurance products are marketed by  			 insurers the federal government could protect consumers. This could be  			 accomplished by requiring that long term care insurance products meet rigorous  			 minimum standards or by providing a government seal of approval for those  			 products that meet certain standards. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Informed Consumers</b> -- Informed consumers are more likely to  			 be able to make decisions concerning long term care insurance products that are  			 in their best interest, as well as recognize misleading or inappropriate  			 marketing practices. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Establish Consistent Regulations</b> - Consistent regulatory  		requirements in all states would assist insurers in the marketing and  		development of long term care insurance products, as well as serve to increase  		insurance coverage and protect consumers. The government could establish  		consistent regulation for long term care insurance through federally mandated  		requirements or by encouraging states to adopt minimum standards similar to the  		approach used for Medicare supplemental insurance. </p>
<p>These goals and their corresponding roles are not necessarily mutually  		exclusive. However, some goals are conflicting. For example, if the goal of  		protecting consumers by ensuring that only "high quality" products are sold  		were adopted, increasing insurance purchase may be difficult because the  		products are likely to become more expensive as a result of these regulatory  		requirements. Also, some of the roles may bring about unwanted consequences.  		For example, establishing minimum regulatory requirements to boost consumer  		confidence and in turn increase insurance purchase could also have the effect  		of stifling product innovation and make premiums unaffordable for many. Any  		contemplated federal role must have goals and intentions weighed against likely  		outcomes and adverse consequences. </p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Long term care insurance provides the elderly with the opportunity to  		spread the potentially high costs of using long term care services among all  		purchasers of the product. Long term care insurance is a relatively new product  		and is therefore subject to a number of barriers to its growth. This discussion  		paper explores current regulatory mechanisms to protect consumers, addresses  		barriers to the growth of the market, and provides a more detailed discussion  		of the potential goals and roles the federal government may wish to pursue in  		the long term care insurance market. </p>
<h2><a name="current" id="current">I. CURRENT REGULATION</a></h2>
<p>Prior to discussing the potential roles the federal government may wish  		to pursue in the long term care insurance market, it is important to understand  		the current system of government regulation in order to make a determination as  		to whether the current system should change. Current long term care insurance  		regulation includes state regulatory efforts and model standards adopted by the  		National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note3">3</a></sup></font> </p>
<h3>A. Regulation of Private Long Term Care Insurance</h3>
<p>Like other insurance products, states are responsible for the regulation  		and monitoring of long term care insurance. There are three primary areas of  		state regulation: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Prior approval of policies generally based on a review of policy  			 readability, standardization of policy terms, and minimum benefit requirements;  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring marketing and business practices to protect consumers  			 from unfair or deceptive acts under unfair trade practice regulations; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Premium rate review/control and efforts to ensure solvency of  			 companies selling policies.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>State legislatures have great leeway in instituting minimum standards  		for benefits, financial reserves, solvency, loss ratios, and cancellation of  		policies, and in instituting other forms of regulation of long term care  		insurance products. Because it is a relatively new form of insurance, there is  		little uniformity in the regulation of long term care insurance across states.  		Insurers, therefore, must tailor their individual products to the regulatory  		provisions of each state. </p>
<p>Most states have based their regulation of long term care insurance on  		model standards developed by the NAIC. In 1986, the initial model act,  		developed by the NAIC in conjunction with the Department of Health and Human  		Services (DHHS) and consumer and insurance representatives, was endorsed by the  		NAIC. A model regulation followed a year later. The <b>model act</b> generally  		outlines recommended minimum requirements for long term care insurance in  		legislative language. The <b>model regulation</b> provides more specificity to  		implement the model act. For example, the model act requires that an outline of  		coverage in a standard format with basic descriptions and exclusions be  		delivered to all prospective applicants. The model regulation actually  		prescribes a standard format and content of the outline of coverage, including  		specific wording and presentation instructions. </p>
<p>The NAIC has attempted to balance the need for strong consumer  		protection with the need for innovation and flexibility in the development of a  		new product.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note4">4</a></sup></font> The Model  		Act's stated purpose is: </p>
<blockquote><p>.. to promote the public interest, to promote the availability of long  		  term care insurance policies, to protect applicants for long term care  		  insurance...from unfair or deceptive enrollment practices, to establish  		  standards for long term care insurance, to facilitate public understanding and  		  comparison of long term care insurance policies, and to facilitate flexibility  		  and innovation in the development of long term care insurance coverage.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note5">5</a></sup></font> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NAIC has reviewed the model act and regulation every six months  		(although it is not required to), and several versions have subsequently been  		issued. States do not necessarily amend their regulations as often as the NAIC  		updates the model act because state adherence to NAIC model legislation is  		<b>voluntary</b>. Also, some states only partially adopt the NAIC guidelines.  		Therefore, even in states that have adopted "the NAIC model act," the standards  		in place may differ from the <b>most recent</b> NAIC model act (December 1990).  		</p>
<h3>B. NAIC Model Standards</h3>
<p><a href="fedrole.htm#figure3">Figure 3</a> summarizes the major provisions of the  		NAIC model act and regulation and when each provision was instituted. The NAIC  		Standards currently contain the following protections as of December 1990: </p>
<p><b>Prior Approval of Policies</b> </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Preexisting condition exclusion periods of longer than six months  			 are prohibited. Also, in issuing replacement policies for similar benefits  			 preexisting conditions are prohibited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies may not exclude or limit benefits for persons with  			 Alzheimer's Disease (model regulation only).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies may not limit coverage to skilled nursing care nor provide  			 significantly more coverage for skilled care in a facility than coverage for  			 lower levels of care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies may not make nursing home or home care benefits contingent  			 on a prior hospital stay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conditioning eligibility for benefits provided in an institutional  			 care setting on the receipt of a higher level of institutional care  			 ("step-down") is prohibited. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimum standards for home health care benefits are prescribed if a  			 policy provides home health care services (home health care services are  			 distinct from post-confinement home health benefits), including prohibitions  			 against tying benefits for home care to the need for skilled nursing, covering  			 only services by registered or licensed practical nurses, or limiting coverage  			 to services provided by Medicare-certified agencies or providers (model  			 regulation only).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual policies must be guaranteed renewable -- which means that  			 policies may not be individually canceled due to the age or diminishing health  			 status of the insured. Group products must provide for continuation or  			 conversion of coverage.</p>

<p>Purchasers have a 30 day "free-look" period during which they may  			 return the policy for a full refund.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purchasers must be <i>offered</i> the opportunity to purchase a  			 product with inflation protection either in the form of annual increases, the  			 right to periodically increase benefit levels without requiring evidence of  			 health status, or a percentage of actual charges. Annual increases, as well a  			 periodic upgrades, should be compounded annually at a rate not less than five  			 percent (model regulation only).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post-claims underwriting (checking a policy holder's medical history  			 only after a claim is filed, instead of when the application is taken) is  			 limited by denying payment based on technicalities or omission of information  			 that was not requested on the application. Insurers must clearly inform  			 applicants that the policy can be invalidated it the information provided is  			 not correct and complete. For applicants age 80 and over, the insurer is also  			 required to obtain some form of documented medical assessment (report of a  			 physical, an assessment of functional capacity, physician's statement, or  			 medical records). Insurers must also keep records of policy rescissions and  			 report them to insurance commissioners (model regulation only).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A detailed and uniform outline of coverage must be delivered to all  			 prospective applicants for long term care insurance at the time of initial  			 in-person solicitation. Solicitations through direct response mailings must  			 provide an outline of coverage at least by the time the policy is delivered.  			 This outline should include a description of principal benefits and coverage; a  			 statement of principal exclusions, reductions and limitations; a statement of  			 terms under which the policy may be continued in force or discontinued,  			 including any provisions in the policy of a right to change premiums; a  			 description of terms under which the policy may be returned and premium  			 refunded; and a brief description of the relationship of benefits that do  			 increase to benefits that do not increase, including a graph over at least 20  			 years. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A "Shopper's Guide" approved by NAIC must be delivered to applicants  			 (model regulation only).<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note6">6</a></sup></font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurers must maintain information concerning lapsed and replacement  			 policies in relation to total annual sales for each agent and report these  			 figures annually for the 10 percent of agents with the greatest percentages of  			 lapses and replacements and for each company overall (model regulation  			 only).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurers must provide a copy of long term care insurance  			 advertisement to the State Insurance Commissioner for review or approval at the  			 Commissioner's discretion (model regulation only).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agents must demonstrate knowledge of long term care insurance by  			 passing a test and maintaining a license (model regulation only).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurers are required to adhere to the following marketing  			 standards: fair and accurate comparisons to other products; assure excessive  			 insurance is not sold; inform consumers that the policy may not cover all of  			 the costs of long term care, and provide written notice to prospective  			 policyholders of the availability of senior insurance counseling programs.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agents and insurers are prohibited against: 1) twisting (knowingly  			 misrepresenting or fraudulently comparing insurance policies or insurers to  			 convert. an existing policy or initiate a new policy); 2) high pressure sales  			 tactics; and 3) deceptive cold lead advertising (marketing which is not  			 represented as a solicitation) (model regulation only).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fines are permitted to be levied by State Insurance Commissioners  			 (the greater of three times any commission for a policy involved in a violation  			 or up to $10,000 per violation per agent and per insurer). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Included as an optional provision are regulations to limit agent  			 compensation in order to address marketing abuses that result from the large  			 difference between first year and renewal commissions. This provision is listed  			 as optional due to the lack of consensus on the extent of abuses and the  			 emerging nature of the long term care insurance market because many  			 replacements may be appropriate (model regulation only). </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Premium Rate Control and Solvency Requirements</b> </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Companies are required to have reserves and to meet an expected  			 premium-to-loss ratio of at least 60 percent for individual policies. The  			 expected loss ratio does not require that the target loss ratio be  			 demonstrated. Traditionally, premium-to- loss ratios have been used with health  			 and accident policies as a benchmark of a reasonable relationships between  			 premiums and benefits paid. The recommended interpretation of the loss ratio  			 for long term care insurance policies is based on factors designed to provide  			 latitude to the company. This is because long term care insurance policies are  			 not purchased primarily for immediate protection like accident and health  			 benefits, but rather for a need that normally occurs toward the end of the life  			 span, similar to life insurance. Also, long term care insurance policies have a  			 relatively small claims rate and are subject to variable lengths of nursing  			 home stays. Permitting additional factors not normally allowed in interpreting  			 loss ratios is intended to foster development of products and permit leeway for  			 the lack of claims experience. Regulators are permitted to take into account  			 such factors because of the need for adequate reserving of the long term care  			 insurance risk. Factors include: statistical credibility of incurred claims  			 experience and earned premiums; the period for which rates are computed to  			 provide coverage; experienced and projected trends; concentration of experience  			 within early policy duration; expected claim fluctuation; experience refunds,  			 adjustments or dividends; renewability features; all appropriate expense  			 factors; interest; experimental nature of the coverage; policy reserves; mix of  			 business by risk classification; and product features such as long elimination  			 periods, high deductibles, and high maximum limits. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NAIC will require companies to report loss ratios for long term  			 care insurance on both a calendar year basis and a cumulative basis by calendar  			 year duration for the policies in the state and nationwide beginning with the  			 claims experience for 1991 (1990 reporting is voluntary). This will assist  			 insurance regulators in tracking expected to actual results. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Information concerning the number of policies currently in force that  		meet the current NAIC standards is not available. In general, the top-selling  		policies <b>currently</b> offered meet the most recent NAIC standards. Most of  		the major companies in the long term care insurance market, those insurance  		companies selling the top 15 individual products that make up 75 percent of the  		market, market on a national basis. In general, these companies design a  		product that adheres to NAIC standards and then may alter the product on a  		state specific basis to conform to particular state provisions, which may be  		more or less stringent than NAIC standards. Although the majority of policies  		<b>offered</b> conform to recent NAIC standards, many of the policies <b>in  		force</b> were purchased prior to many of the 1988 improvements in the NAIC  		standards (i.e., three day prior hospitalization prohibition). </p>
<h3>C. The Capacity of State Insurance Regulators</h3>
<p>States differ in the level of regulation and the enforcement of those  		regulations. Before the development of the NAIC model, only a few states  		regulated long term care insurance specifically. By May 1991, all fifty states  		had statutes and/or regulations governing the benefits to be provided in a long  		term care insurance policy.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note7">7</a></sup></font> (See <a href="fedrole.htm#attach1">Attachment 1</a> and  		<a href="fedrole.htm#attach2">Attachment 2</a>). </p>
<p>Forty-two states have instituted some form of the model act or  		regulation approved by the NAIC. More states have conformed to the model act,  		which has more general provisions, than the model regulation. Twenty-three  		states have based their regulation on the NAIC model regulation. Most states do  		not have legislation or regulation in place that conforms to the most recently  		updated provisions of the NAIC model act and regulations (December 1990). For  		example, as of May 1991, only thirteen states prohibited post claims  		underwriting in accordance with the December 1989 requirements of the  		model.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note8">8</a></sup></font> Some lag between  		approval of model standards by the NAIC and state adoption of the standards is  		to be expected. The thirteen states prohibiting post-claims underwriting is up  		from five as of September 1990. In 1989, the then President of the NAIC  		indicated in Congressional testimony that he expected that more than 90 percent  		of the states would adopt standards at least equal to minimum model standards  		by 1991. </p>
<p>State insurance regulators generally review initial applications to sell  		a product, marketing materials, and periodic rate filings. Few states currently  		require actual loss ratios and other reporting requirements specifically for  		long term care insurance products on an annual basis to ensure enforcement of  		standards. Such reporting, on a state and national basis, has been made part of  		the NAIC annual statement beginning with reporting year 1991. State insurance  		departments rely heavily upon consumer complaints to identify problematic  		insurance companies and agents. According to the GAO, in 1989 most states used  		the insurance regulatory agency as the primary authority to enforce the  		marketing and sales standards. In all but two states (Alaska and Texas),  		regulatory agencies used the same examination and investigation staff for  		monitoring sales and marketing practices involving long term care insurance as  		for other types of insurance.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note9">9</a></sup></font> </p>
<p>Most states do not report consumer complaints against long term care  		insurance separately from other health-related products. According to a survey  		by the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project of George Washington University  		conducted during 1988 and 1989, consumer complaints were reportedly resolved in  		favor of the consumer most of the time.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note10">10</a></sup></font> The IHPP survey also found that: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Five states regularly published information for the public  			 concerning complaints against particular insurance companies and/or agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two states actively disseminated information about insurance company  			 loss ratios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twenty-two states regulated advertising by insurance companies by  			 requiring prior submission of advertisements and twelve states had taken  			 special action to regulate celebrity endorsements of private insurance  			 policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twenty-eight state insurance departments distributed literature on  			 long term care insurance and five more were developing guides on the topic at  			 the time of the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project survey. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twenty-three states operated toll-free telephone lines to assist  			 consumers with insurance-related questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seven states operated counseling programs to advise consumers  			 shopping for health or long term care insurance.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Significantly, the majority of the state insurance officials surveyed  		believed that their departments were hampered in conducting consumer education  		and protection activities by funding constraints (36 states) and/or staffing  		shortages (40 states). </p>
<p>The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Committee  		on Energy and Commerce contacted all 50 state insurance departments to learn  		about the departments' efforts in regulating long term care insurance. The  		Subcommittee's assessment was that "the majority appear to know little about  		what is going on in their states... and although they rely heavily on  		complaints to monitor companies selling long term care insurance, few have  		organized complaint gathering systems. Regulators lack clear actuarial  		standards and centralized data on companies and agents." The Subcommittee felt  		state insurance departments are "understaffed and under-informed, and their  		ability to resolve problems and willingness to reach out-of-state offenders is  		distinctly limited.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note11">11</a></sup></font> </p>
<p>Families USA, a consumer-oriented organization which focuses on the  		needs of elderly persons and their families, investigated the information  		available from state insurance commissioners in 20 states during 1989. Eight  		states were able to provide information specifically about nursing home  		insurance complaints. In some states, complaint information is not made  		available to the public. Of those states that could provide complaint  		information, Families USA reported that the quality of the data varied greatly.  		Pennsylvania, for example, could not provide any information about the nature  		of the complaints. Only a few states provided information on the outcome of  		complaints. None of the twenty states contacted had information on actual loss  		ratios of long term care insurance policies, or on the commissions agents  		earned on different policies.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note12">12</a></sup></font> </p>
<p>The Office of the Inspector General, DHHS, based on a recent review of  		enforcement efforts related to long term care insurance in a sample of states,  		concluded that:<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note13">13</a></sup></font> </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Long term care complaint data are incomplete and inconclusive;  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>States report little enforcement action against long term care  			 insurance companies and agents; and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strong laws and regulations will have limited effectiveness if they  			 are not adequately monitored and enforced.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Because the long term care insurance market is new and so dynamic, some  		of these findings are not surprising. A key question is how well the  		regulations will work in a mature market. </p>
<p>Some recent actions of the NAIC designed to address some of the  		enforcement deficiencies discussed above include: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>The NAIC will require the reporting of loss experience on an annual  			 basis beginning with experience for 1991 in March/June of 1992 (see  			 <a href="fedrole.htm#attach3">Attachment 3</a>). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NAIC collects regulatory actions taken by insurance departments  			 against agents for conduct which is in violation of state law or  			 regulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NAIC has also recently been operating a special activities data  			 base which permits states to share information and raise inquiries about  			 individuals and entities of insurance regulatory concern. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the NAIC has begun a national complaint data base that  			 states may participate in at their option. </p>
</li>
</ul><h2><a name="barriers" id="barriers">II. BARRIERS TO GROWTH OF THE LONG TERM  		CARE INSURANCE MARKET</a></h2>
<p>In order to define the appropriate role of the federal government in the  		long term care insurance market, one needs to understand current problems in  		the market, particularly barriers to the growth of long term care insurance  		coverage. These barriers can be divided into barriers affecting consumer demand  		for long term care insurance and barriers restricting the supply of the  		product. </p>
<h3>A. Barriers Affecting Consumer Demand</h3>
<p>The decision to protect oneself against the risk of needing long term  		care services is a personal one. Some persons are highly risk averse and will  		spend large amounts of money to try to protect themselves. They may buy  		products of little value out of fear. At the other extreme, some persons do not  		want to think about the possibility that they will become disabled enough to  		need long term care, particularly in a nursing home. Other consumers do not  		perceive a need for long term care insurance because they believe family or  		friends will be available and able to provide care. These individuals will  		probably not consider buying insurance even if they could get a good product at  		a reasonable price. The vast majority of the elderly, however, lie between  		these two extremes. For them, the basic decision is whether the future benefit  		is worth the sacrifice of using current income or assets to pay the premium or  		other fees. Complicating this decision is the uncertainty of whether the future  		benefit will actually be there when they need it. </p>
<p>There are a number of fundamental issues related to the decision to  		purchase long term care insurance that pose problems for consumers, including  		lack of information for decision making, the complexity of the product, rapidly  		changing product lines, the uncertain value of products, and other barriers.  		</p>
<p><b>1. Lack of Information/Misperceptions of Public Programs</b> </p>
<p>Many elderly persons do not realize that, after age 65, one out of three  		individuals will be in a nursing home for three months or more and that about  		one in five will be in a nursing home for a year or more. Thus, they  		underestimate the risk of needing long term care. Many elderly also mistakenly  		believe that they do not need to protect themselves against the risks of long  		term care because they think that Medicare or Medigap policies will cover the  		cost of a nursing home stay.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note14">14</a></sup></font> In fact, Medicare only covers short-term  		post acute care stays and Medigap policies do not cover long term care.  		Finally, some of the elderly do not understand the limits of Medicaid. They do  		not understand that they must spend nearly all their income and assets on care  		before they qualify for Medicaid assistance, and that even when Medicaid begins  		paying they still must contribute nearly all their income toward the cost of  		their care. At a cost of $30,000 per year, the potential cost of a nursing home  		stay is a significant financial expense to most elderly. </p>
<p><b>2. Delaying Purchase of Long Term Care Insurance/Denial of Long Term  		Care Needs</b> </p>
<p>Another problem facing consumers is that many persons do not think about  		purchasing long term care insurance until they are too old to purchase it at a  		reasonable price or too disabled to purchase it at all. Most companies do not  		sell initial insurance policies to persons over age 84. The decision to  		purchase long term care insurance involves admitting that there may be a time  		when one will not be able to care for oneself. This is often a difficult  		realization and one that is less likely to occur during one's working life,  		when long term care insurance premiums are lower. Older persons are also likely  		to have this realization thrust upon them by an illness or disabling condition  		when underwriting practices of insurance companies will most likely exclude  		them from being able to purchase long term care insurance. </p>
<p>It should be noted that even though purchasing long term care insurance  		products at younger ages reduces premium costs, it also carries a larger risk  		for purchasers because of the very long period between initial purchase and  		potential use. Purchasers in the employer market face increased risks in  		relation to: 1) benefit adequacy being eroded by inflation; 2) potential  		changes in the delivery system that make policy benefits obsolete; and 3)  		reductions in income that may cause a purchaser to lapse his or her policy.  		</p>
<p><b>3. Complexity of the Product and Lack of Standard Terminology</b>  		</p>
<p>Long term care insurance is a complex product that can take a number of  		forms. Policies offered can pay a per diem, which may or may not be indexed; a  		fixed percentage of charges; or a percentage of one's whole life insurance as a  		life-insurance rider. Determining whether or not a policy will adequately meet  		a person's long term care needs in terms of the amount of benefits paid and  		under what conditions the insurance benefit will be paid are dependent on a  		clear understanding of the terminology used in the policy, as well as an  		understanding on the part of the purchaser of when benefits are likely to be  		needed and how benefits and service costs (and the relationship between the  		two) will be affected by inflation over time. The different forms of the  		insurance and a lack of common terminology make it difficult for consumers to  		understand what they are buying and whether it will provide benefits when they  		need them. Long term care insurance can be more difficult for the elderly to  		understand than Medicare supplemental policies, which most purchase, because  		the product does not "wrap-around" the familiar Medicare program to reduce  		out-of-pocket health care costs in a concrete and immediate manner. Such a  		variety of policies and terms is likely to limit the ability of persons to do  		thorough comparison shopping. </p>
<p><b>4. Rapidly Changing Product Lines</b> </p>
<p>Contributing to the complexity of the decision to purchase long term  		care insurance are the rapid changes in the product lines companies have  		introduced in response to consumer demand and changes in NAIC regulations. The  		policies offered today differ considerably from those offered before 1987.  		Faced with uncertainties and lacking actual experience with an insured  		population, insurers initially tried to protect themselves against financial  		loss by imposing restrictions and limitations on what policies covered.  		Insurers typically tried to protect themselves against moral hazard by imposing  		high deductibles, focusing on skilled nursing care, requiring prior  		hospitalization before nursing home care, and only covering home care that  		followed a nursing home stay. To protect against adverse selection, insurers  		usually screened for health problems, did not sell policies to persons over age  		80, and did not provide coverage for preexisting conditions and most mental  		illnesses. To protect against the general uncertainty of the future, insurers  		typically offered only fixed indemnity benefits that did not increase with  		inflation, and often reserved the right to unilaterally cancel policies.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note15">15</a></sup></font> </p>
<p>The changes in products have been in response to consumer input and  		evolving regulatory requirements. These changes are product innovations that  		have improved consumer protection and benefits for purchasers. These changes  		have also contributed to the confusion of some consumers. </p>
<p>Many of the 1.9 million policies sold to date contain these older types  		of policy restrictions. Because long term care insurance is designed to be a  		lifetime, rather than an annual benefit, improvements in regulation and policy  		standards generally do not benefit persons who purchased insurance prior to  		when the improvements were instituted. Therefore, policies in force usually  		remain in force with the benefits purchased unless the purchaser upgrades to a  		more recent policy, in which case he or she is usually subject to underwriting  		provisions again and the current age-rated premium. Currently, someone  		replacing a policy also forfeits any equity built up in the previous policy.  		The NAIC is currently debating whether nonforfeiture standards should be  		enacted and has distributed an exposure draft on upgrades. An emerging policy  		issue is whether or not persons who hold these "older" policies should consider  		purchasing a more recent policy. </p>
<p><b>5. Uncertain Value of Products</b> </p>
<p>Many elderly persons may be able to afford long term care insurance  		premiums, but fear that after paying premiums for a long time the products will  		not cover the care needs related to their disability.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note16">16</a></sup></font> In essence, these persons wonder whether the  		policies are financially worthwhile and whether a product in its infancy will  		pay the long term care benefits promised. Some consumers may be waiting to see  		how the market performs or for future products to be developed. Some elderly  		also worry about whether their insurance company will still be in business when  		they need insurance. Many elderly misunderstand and mistrust insurance products  		in general. In addition, few long term care insurance policies offer  		"forfeiture" benefits which would allow consumers some financial return if they  		stop paying premiums after a number of years. </p>
<p><b>6. Lack of Clarity of Benefit Triggers/Premium Increase  		Provisions</b> </p>
<p>Some more recently marketed policies still have provisions which are  		unclear to some consumers. Some policies contain vague and one-sided language  		that makes it unclear under what conditions benefits will be paid and under  		what circumstances premiums may increase. For example, a few policies have  		"medical necessity clauses" with no explanation of what constitutes a medical  		necessity, aside from it being determined by the policyholder's physician; some  		policies with activities of daily living (ADL) triggers for benefits do not  		explain how it will be determined if a person has the necessary level of  		impairment (i.e., requiring someone to physically assist the disabled persons;  		requiring stand-by or supervisory assistance; or having a need for equipment to  		perform the ADL); and policies offering "level premiums" that are "guaranteed  		renewable" still may increase premiums as long as premiums are increased for  		all purchasers in a category. </p>
<p>Much of the policy language used today can give the purchaser the  		perception of being covered for services that may actually be denied payment  		when he or she files a claim. This is more of a problem for home care services  		than nursing home care. Based on a review of 44 long term care policies, the  		General Accounting Office observed that determining a policyholder's  		eligibility for benefits involves considerable judgment.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note17">17</a></sup></font> In light of this vagueness in policy  		language, it is unclear whether or not persons considering purchasing their  		first policy should wait a year or two in order to see what other improvements  		may be instituted. The risk of delaying purchase, though, is that they may  		develop a medical condition that could keep them from purchasing the policy of  		their choice at a later date. </p>
<p><b>7. Consumer Confusion/Dissatisfaction</b> </p>
<p>Some consumers are confused or dissatisfied with long term care  		insurance as the result of misperceptions, complex products, rapidly changing  		product lines, unclear benefit triggers, and uncertainty concerning the value  		of the product. Confusion often causes indecision among those considering long  		term care insurance and dissatisfaction with current policies prompts some  		potential purchasers to wait until the market has matured. </p>
<p><b>8. Long Lag Time Between Purchase and Benefit Payment</b> </p>
<p>The long lag time between purchasing long term care insurance and when  		benefits are likely to be paid creates additional problems for purchasers. This  		lag time, on average a 15 to 20 year period before nursing home use for a 65  		year old purchaser, provides an opportunity for inflation to erode benefits  		significantly, particularly if no inflation protection is purchased. The lag  		time is also problematic for purchasers who lapse their policy. Due to the  		delayed nature of the risk, long term care insurance policies build up a large  		amount of reserves, through premium payments and interest, in order to pay  		benefits. With current policies, when a purchaser lapses a policy, that  		built-up equity is forfeited. A survey conducted by the House Committee on  		Energy and Commerce found that for a sample of 24 companies that sold  		two-thirds of long term care insurance policies between 1986 through 1989, 37  		percent of purchasers had lapsed their coverage.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note18">18</a></sup></font> An HIAA survey found a 16 percent lapse rate  		for policies representing one-third of the market. (It should be noted that  		some "lapses" are to purchase more up-to-date policies.) </p>
<p><b>9. Misleading Marketing Practices</b> </p>
<p>Potential purchasers of long term care insurance must face the  		possibility that some dishonest and/or ignorant agents or insurance companies  		may use fraudulent and misleading marketing practices. Anecdotal evidence  		indicates that problems are more likely to be the result of agent ignorance  		than purposeful attempts to fraudulently market long term care insurance.  		Congressional hearings and investigations by consumer groups have revealed  		problems with the marketing, sale, and payment of benefits of long term care  		insurance. After, listening to fourteen sales presentations for long term care  		insurance, a reporter for Consumer Reports concluded that every sales agent  		misrepresented some aspect of the policy, the financial condition of the  		insurer, or the quality of the competitor's product. She also felt that not one  		sales' agent properly explained benefits, restrictions, and policy  		limitations.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note19">19</a></sup></font>  		Fraudulent marketing practices, denial of claims, premium increases, and policy  		cancellation have resulted in some long term care insurance purchasers failing  		to receive benefits they believed they had bought. </p>
<p>Specifically, some agents misrepresent their product as covering all  		long term care, when certain policy restrictions may mean that many services a  		disabled person may require are excluded. Convincing a client to replace a  		policy with a more expensive one without good reason, or "rolling", is a tactic  		used by some agents to increase commissions. However, it may be appropriate in  		some instances, for consumers to upgrade to new and better products. Another  		method used to increase commissions is selling duplicative or overlapping  		coverage, although with the indemnity nature of most long term care products  		"excess" insurance may not be a large problem, particularly if the policies  		purchased do not include adequate inflation protection. Also of concern is the  		falsification or failure to collect information on applications, which later  		causes a person's policy to be rescinded (clean- sheeting). High pressure or  		scare tactics have also been used by agents to sell long term care insurance.  		Finally, although prohibited under NAIC model guidelines, a couple of smaller  		companies check a policy holder's medical history only after a claim is filed,  		instead of when an application is taken. If the company discovers an  		undisclosed health condition within two years that would have led to the  		rejection of the application, the company may deny benefits, cancel the policy,  		or both. This practice is called post-claim underwriting. </p>
<p>HIAA contends that only a small number of insurance companies and agents  		engage in fraudulent and misleading marketing practices and would welcome a  		fair study to document any specific problems. Cases of such activity are the  		result of the lack of clarity in some product provision, regulations,  		inadequate education of agents, difficulties in enforcement, and possibly the  		structure of agent commissions that encourages new policies over renewals. </p>
<p><b>10. Affordability</b> </p>
<p>Many of today's elderly have low incomes and therefore cannot afford  		long term care insurance premiums that average almost $100 per month at age 65.  		However, most elderly pay similar levels of premiums of Medigap insurance. As  		improvements to the product are instituted, prices for long term care insurance  		are likely to increase. In the future, though, the increased financial  		resources of the elderly and the ability to purchase insurance at an earlier  		age should expand the market for long term care insurance. </p>
<p>As a comparison, affordability can be viewed in light of Medicare  		supplemental insurance policy costs and purchase rates. Approximately 70  		percent of the elderly have Medigap policies which cost an average premium of  		$70 per month. At age 65, the cost of long term care policy which covered four  		years of nursing home care at a constant rate of $80 per day, and home care at  		$40 per visit, with a 20-day deductible, averaged $1,135 per year in 1990, or  		about $95 per month; a difference of only $25 per month. Choosing a similar  		long term care insurance policy with benefits that increase over time costs an  		average of $116 per month at age 65 in 1990; a difference of over $45 per  		month. Much of the affordability issue involves a decision on how to balance  		the trade-off between depth of coverage for acute and long term care and price  		(i.e., is it necessary to have both long term care insurance and Medigap; if  		so, how much is affordable; if not, which is more important?) </p>
<p><b>11. Perception of Need </b></p>
<p>For some consumers the decision to purchase long term care insurance is  		not influenced by affordability, confusion or any of the other barriers  		discussed above, but rather a decision not to purchase long term care  		insurance. Some consumers do not perceive a need for risk pooling because they  		believe family or friends will be available and able to provide care. Others  		may decide that using accumulated assets to pay for care shortly before death  		is a preferable approach to financing long term care. Finally, still others may  		have sufficient income to afford premiums but too few assets to want protection  		through long term care insurance. </p>
<h3>B. Barriers Affecting Supply</h3>
<p>Offering a long term care insurance product can pose problems for  		insurers. There are a number of obstacles impeding insurers from entering the  		market, increasing their market penetration, and improving their products and  		marketing practices. Some problems specific to insurers include: lack of data  		for pricing the risk, an uncertain tax status, lack of a group market, and  		inconsistent regulatory standards. </p>
<p><b>1. The Lack of Data for Pricing Long Term Care Insurance</b> </p>
<p>Given the newness of the products and the lag time for insured claims  		data, almost all insurers have limited claims experience for the use of long  		term care services necessary to confidently price the product. Of particular  		concern to insurers is estimating the increase in service use as a result of  		moral hazard. Another area for which insurers lack data is the degree to which  		those buying long term care insurance do so because they are more likely to  		require services (adverse selection), and the best underwriting methods to  		curtail this adverse selection. This lack of data to predict long term care  		service use makes it nearly impossible for insurers to know if they are  		adequately pricing their products. </p>
<p>The lack of good data is compounded by the fact that long term care  		insurance companies enter into <b>long term</b> agreements with their residents  		and purchasers. There are significant uncertainties associated with pricing  		products which may not be used for up to 30 years (particularly for persons who  		purchase during their working years). Over this time horizon, small differences  		in mortality, interest rates, disability rates, or availability of nursing home  		beds can make a large difference in the ultimate cost of a policy. This  		uncertainty has led some insurers to limit their risks by obscuring the events  		which trigger benefits and by aggressive underwriting. In some cases, this  		uncertainty has understandably prevented suppliers from improving their  		products. </p>
<p><b>2. Uncertainty of Tax Status</b> </p>
<p>The uncertain tax status of long term care insurance benefits has  		inhibited the growth of the employer market. It is not clear whether benefits  		paid from long term care insurance will receive the same preferential tax  		treatment that accident and health insurance benefits currently receive.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note20">20</a></sup></font> Insurers and employers are  		also reluctant to widely offer long term care insurance in a group market,  		largely because of the uncertainty of the tax laws concerning the deductibility  		of long term care insurance premiums. Insurers would like the Congress or, IRS  		to clarify the treatment of long term care insurance so that it is treated  		similar to other accident and health insurance products. It appears that the  		IRS has deferred to Congress on the tax clarification issue. </p>
<p><b>3. The Lack of Interest from Large Group Markets</b> </p>
<p>Insurance companies have group markets for most major health/life  		products sold, including health insurance, disability insurance, and life  		insurance. Group markets, particularly employee-based groups, reduce  		advertising and overhead costs by providing a captured audience for the sale of  		an insurance product. Group markets also spread the risk over a larger  		population and reduce adverse selection. Having employers offer long term care  		insurance also "legitimizes" the product and would be expected to cause an  		upward shift in the demand curve for the product. </p>
<p>Long term care insurance currently does not have the advantage of having  		many group market participants or employer subsidies for premiums. In 1990, 105  		employers offered long term care insurance to almost 700,000 employees, plus an  		unknown number of spouses, retirees, and parents of employees, where the  		purchaser was responsible for the full cost of the policy. As of the end of  		1990, 135,000 policies were sold representing only seven percent of all  		policies sold.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note21">21</a></sup></font> </p>
<p><b>4. The Lack of Consistency in Regulations (and some inappropriate  		regulations) </b></p>
<p>As discussed earlier, insurance regulation is primarily a state  		responsibility and, as a result, the requirements that must be met by insurers  		offering long term care insurance vary from state to state. With a new product,  		such as long term care insurance, this variance may be desirable for producing  		innovative regulation to learn about problems and how to address them. But this  		situation can make it difficult for insurers to expand their market because  		often many different products must be designed to meet the requirements of each  		state. Stringent standards (i.e., high loss ratios, mandated benefits) imposed  		by some states to sell long term care insurance that may better protect  		consumers may also cause insurers to become unwilling to enter the market.  		Alternatively, in these highly regulated states, policy and entry prices may  		become so high as to significantly limit product marketability. A further  		effect of the rapid change in regulations over the past several years has been  		to increase the expense of developing products. </p>
<p>Also of concern to suppliers of long term care insurance products is the  		appropriateness of regulatory standards modeled after Medicare supplemental  		insurance regulation. Some standards used heavily in evaluating the fairness of  		Medigap premiums, such as loss ratios, may not be directly applicable to long  		term care products. In addition, current emphasis on strictly standardizing  		products and limiting the types of product offered could be considered  		inappropriate for a maturing market. </p>
<h2><a name="potential" id="potential">III. POTENTIAL FEDERAL ROLES IN THE  		LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE MARKET</a></h2>
<h3>A. Goals of the Federal Government</h3>
<p>The following are at least four potential goals of the federal  		government that could be pursued for the long term care insurance market if the  		current regulatory and incentive structures are judged inadequate: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Increase Consumer Awareness</b> -- By increasing consumer  			 awareness regarding the risk of long term care use, the lack of third party  			 coverage for and the costs of such care and the availability of mechanisms,  			 such as long term care insurance, to cover the cost of such care, the  			 government could assist individuals to reach well-informed decisions as to an  			 appropriate course of action to prepare for potential long term care needs.  			 Increased consumer awareness would address the lack of information,  			 misperception of public programs, delayed preparation for/denial of long term  			 care needs, and some of the confusion experienced by consumers when considering  			 long term care insurance. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Increase Insurance Coverage</b> -- Similar to the consensus  			 developing concerning health insurance, the government may determine that  			 Americans should have protection against the cost of long term care services  			 and the best mechanism for ensuring that protection is long term care  			 insurance. Establishing a goal of increased long term care insurance purchase  			 implies efforts to eliminate most of the barriers to the growth of the market  			 discussed above. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Protect Consumers</b> -- By protecting consumers who purchase  			 long term care insurance, the government could reduce consumer demand barriers  			 related to product complexity, benefit triggers, premium increases, the long  			 lag time between purchase and benefit payment, and marketing practices. The  			 government could protect consumers by ensuring: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>The Financial Strength of Insurers</i> -- Experts recommend  				  that one of the foremost factors to consider when purchasing long term care  				  insurance is the financial status of the insurer because financially strong  				  insurers are more likely to be able to pay the future benefits of the product.  				  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Benefit Payments</i> -- One concern of consumers is that  				  insurers may not provide promised benefits. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Consistent Enforcement</i> -- A consistent level of  				  enforcement of regulations in all states would guarantee all purchasers of long  				  term care insurance a minimum level of protection, possibly increasing consumer  				  confidence and minimizing abuses. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>The Sale of Only "High Quality" Products</i> -- By  				  guaranteeing that only "high quality" long term care insurance products are  				  marketed by insurers the federal government could protect consumers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Informed Consumers</i> -- Informed consumers are more likely  				  to be able to make decisions concerning long term care insurance products that  				  are in their best interest, as well as recognize misleading or inappropriate  				  marketing practices. </p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><b>Establish Consistent Regulations</b> -- Consistent regulatory  			 requirements in all states would assist insurers in the marketing and  			 development of long term care insurance products, as well as serve to increase  			 insurance coverage and protect consumers. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>There are six primary roles the federal government could establish in  		order to meet these goals (see <a href="fedrole.htm#figure4">Figure 4</a>): (1) maintain  		its current status of non-intervention; (2) mandating/encouraging minimum  		regulations and reporting requirements; (3) providing assistance to the states;  		(4) assisting insurers; (5) educating consumers, insurers and agents; and (6)  		clarifying the tax treatment of long term care insurance. Some roles could be  		accomplished in conjunction with other roles, depending on the level of federal  		involvement deemed necessary. </p>

</tr></table><h3>B. No Federal Intervention</h3>
<p>By not intervening in the long term care insurance market at the current  		time, the federal government would be accepting the NAIC standards and the  		state process of adopting those standards. It is expected that many of the  		problems facing consumers and insurers described in the previous section will  		eventually be taken up as issues for the model standards by the NAIC. As  		discussed earlier, all 50 states have statutes and/or regulations governing the  		benefits provided by long term care insurance policies. Forty-two of these  		states have regulations based on NAIC model guidelines, although not  		necessarily those most recently adopted by the organization. Proponents of the  		current regulatory mechanisms argue that innovation, local presence, regulatory  		experience, and technical knowledge along with accountability to residents of a  		state are necessary prerequisites for effective regulation best provided  		through the current regulatory system. </p>
<p>The NAIC has taken a leadership role in establishing and encouraging  		regulatory standards and reporting requirements for long term care insurance.  		The NAIC model is still evolving. In December 1990, the NAIC considered  		specific consumer protection issues, including: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Discontinuance and replacement</i> -- More explicit requirements  			 to determine whether a purchaser is replacing current accident and sickness or  			 long term care insurance policies, as well as further disclosure and consent  			 restrictions in such cases, were adopted. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Cancellation and nonrenewal</i> -- Insurance commissioner  			 authority to allow nonrenewal of policies in solvency situations was  			 eliminated. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Marketing Issues</i> -- Prohibitions against twisting (knowingly  			 misrepresenting or fraudulently comparing insurance policies or insurers to  			 convert an existing policy or initiate a new policy), high pressure tactics,  			 and cold lead advertising (marketing which is not represented as a  			 solicitation) were instituted. Penalties were also established. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Lapse Rates</i> -- Requirements for maintaining and reporting  			 data on lapses, by company and agent were approved. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Agent commission issues</i> -- An optional provision restricting  			 the level of commissions for initial sales versus renewals was recommended.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Issues expected to be adopted or at least proposed during the December  		1991 NAIC meetings are: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Adoption of enhanced inflation protection provisions including more  			 stringent requirements that policies including inflation protection be offered  			 to consumers, requiring level premiums for policies with inflation protection,  			 and the ability to make policies non-cancelable; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A draft of non-forfeiture provisions; and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consideration of proposals on rate stabilization in the form of an  			 annual or lifetime cap on percent increases permitted for premiums. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The NAIC has also published a "Shopper's Guide" which the model  		regulations require insurers to deliver at solicitation of the policy and is  		made available by state insurance departments. The "Shopper's Guide," along  		with the outline of coverage, and the newly enacted marketing standards are all  		recent improvements by the NAIC designed to enhance consumer protection and  		reduce some of the barriers to purchase long term care insurance discussed in  		the previous section. </p>
<p>Because it is difficult to anticipate every potential regulatory  		problem, advocates of no federal intervention believe that this option would  		allow adequate state flexibility to promote long term care insurance permit  		laboratories for innovations which may enhance the overall quality of long term  		care insurance and prevent the establishment of standards that would drive  		insurers from the market and/or make the product unaffordable. In addition,  		those in favor of maintaining state preeminence in the regulation of long term  		care insurance cite the lack of federal experience with the market as a barrier  		to fashioning workable solutions to regulatory issues. Also, organizations  		other than the NAIC may assist in the development of the long term care  		insurance market if there is no federal intervention. For example, the Society  		of Actuaries has made arrangements in the past to pool company data without  		identifying information to obtain better experience information for pricing  		purposes. </p>
<p>If states do not adopt the NAIC standards in a timely manner, the  		federal government may want to reconsider intervening in the long term care  		insurance market. In fact, in 1989 then President of the NAIC, Earl Pomeroy,  		stated in congressional testimony that he would not oppose federal intervention  		referencing the NAIC model if the states did not meet a two year timeline for  		instituting regulatory standards at least as stringent as the 1989 NAIC model  		for long term care insurance. </p>
<h3>C. Federal Regulation/Encouragement</h3>
<p>The NAIC's responsiveness to the evolving long term care insurance  		market does not guarantee that states are as responsive. As discussed earlier,  		most states have instituted minimum standards for long term care insurance  		which conform to earlier versions of the NAIC model which is to be expected  		while the model is still evolving. This has caused a lack of uniformity in  		requirements across states and unequal protection for consumers. Federal  		regulation/encouragement of certain requirements could serve to meet the  		potential government goals of: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Increased insurance coverage by boosting consumer confidence;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumer protection; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistent regulations. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>In April 1991, Senators Mitchell and Pryor (S.846) and Representative  		Wyden (H.R. 1916) introduced legislation to establish federal standards for  		long term care insurance policies. Previously, the federal government has  		become involved in state regulation of certain other markets when a need for  		standardization and uniformity in enforcement criteria due to abuses has  		presented itself. Two markets that are somewhat similar to long term care  		insurance are Medicare supplemental insurance policies and pensions. </p>
<p>Medicare supplemental insurance policies, often referred to as Medigap  		insurance, are designed primarily to pay deductible and/or coinsurance amounts  		for hospital, medical, and surgical expenses covered by Medicare. In 1980,  		section 1882 was added to the Social Security Act. This provision, commonly  		referred to as the Baucus amendment, was a response to marketing and  		advertising abuses in the sale of Medigap insurance to the elderly. The most  		common problems identified were: (1) marketing abuses; (2) inadequate  		information to permit an informed choice; and (3) inadequate policy benefits,  		especially with respect to premiums paid.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note22">22</a></sup></font> </p>
<p>The Baucus amendment defines minimum standards for policies that must be  		met before they can be marketed as certified Medicare Supplemental policies,  		The standards are contained in a model regulation approved by the NAIC in 1979  		and incorporated in section 1882 by reference, States could voluntarily adopt  		the standards and policies issued in those states would be deemed "certified."  		Insurers had the option, but were not required, to solicit certification from  		the Secretary of DHHS for policies issued in states that did not adopt the 1979  		NAIC standards. These standards include: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Requiring Medigap policies to cover Medicare's coinsurance amounts  			 within certain limits; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring that purchasers of a policy have a free look"  			 period, during which they may return an unwanted policy for cancellation and  			 receive a full refund of any premium paid; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standardizing many of the terms used in policies; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limiting the period for which coverage may be denied for preexisting  			 conditions; and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring cancellation and termination clauses to be prominently  			 displayed. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the Baucus amendment established loss ratio targets for  		Medigap policies that set a goal for the percentage of insurance premiums to be  		returned to policyholders in the form of benefits. Medigap policies must be  		expected to pay benefits at least equal to 60 percent of the earned premiums  		for individual policies and 75 percent for group policies. Finally, the Baucus  		amendment contains federal sanctions, consisting of fines and/or imprisonment  		for posing as a federal agent to sell Medigap policies, knowingly selling  		policies that duplicate coverage the individual already has, and selling  		supplemental policies by mail in states that have not approved, or are deemed  		not to have approved, their sale. Recent changes to the Baucus amendments  		increased the federal role, including requiring additional standards for  		policies and requiring that policies be issued in an approved state or be  		certified. </p>
<p>Long term care insurance is similar to Medigap policies prior to the  		Baucus amendments in that: the product offers a health- related insurance  		benefit; consumers often lack adequate information for decision-making;  		policies are subject to similar types of marketing abuses; it is unclear if  		premiums are fair given the benefits offered; and the regulation and  		enforcement of the market is a state responsibility. Key differences are: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>The maturity of the market</i> -- When mandatory federal  			 requirements were instituted, the Medigap market had been in existence a decade  			 longer than the current long term care insurance market; and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Long term care insurance purchases a prefunded benefit, as  			 opposed to an annual benefit</i> -- This means that a large amount of equity is  			 built up over the life of the long term care insurance policy, because benefits  			 that are used toward the end of the life of the policy are prefunded. It also  			 means that some of the loss ratio and solvency issues are different (this is  			 discussed in more detail in the following section). Finally, it means that  			 unless otherwise specified any improvements in regulatory requirements do not  			 affect policies purchased prior to the passage of the requirement. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Wrap-around to social insurance program</i> -- Medigap policies  			 are tied to a social insurance program in that they cover copays and  			 deductibles for Medicare. Long term care insurance is a freestanding policy not  			 related to a federal social insurance program and there is not general  			 agreement on the "best" set of benefits. Also long term care insurance is not  			 just sold to the population age 65 and over. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>One lesson learned from the Baucus amendment is that a federal mandate  		does not guarantee the expected results. Another lesson is that enforcement of  		regulatory standards is as important as the standards themselves. Most states  		have adopted Medigap insurance regulatory programs at least as stringent as the  		NAIC model referenced in the Baucus amendment, but certain aspects of the model  		have not been effective. For example, minimum loss standards for Medigap  		policies specified by the Baucus amendment are not as effective as they could  		be because they require plans to meet "anticipated" rather than actual loss  		ratios and also provide no enforcement mechanism. In 1987, the NAIC revised its  		model state legislation by requiring companies to file more comprehensive loss  		ratio information -- including monitoring of actual loss ratios. According to a  		General Accounting Office (GAO) report, about one-third of Medigap insurers  		representing 12 percent of premium volume, pay out less than 60 cents in  		benefits per premium dollar.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note23">23</a></sup></font> </p>
<p>The Congress became involved again in Medigap regulation in October 1990  		with the passage of the fiscal year 1991 budget resolution. The legislation is  		intended to protect the elderly from paying for unnecessary, duplicative health  		insurance. Under the legislation, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990  		(P.L. 101-508), either the federal government or the NAIC shall specify the  		provisions of up to ten standard private health insurance policies containing  		"a core group of basic benefits." The NAIC has revised standards that reflect  		the new federal provisions and most states have until July 30th to adopt these  		provisions. </p>
<p>The legislation changes the voluntary nature of certification for  		Medicare Supplemental policies by mandating certification to sell a product and  		including periodic reviews of state regulatory programs by the Secretary and  		state reporting requirements. It also establishes fines up to $25,000 and up to  		five years in prison for violations of the federal standards. The legislation  		calls for "uniform language and definitions" for benefits and a "uniform  		format" to be used in policies. An open enrollment period of six months (i.e.,  		no medical underwriting) for newly eligible Medicare beneficiaries was  		established. The reconciliation bill would also require insurers to pay Medigap  		benefits equal to at least 65 cents of every dollar received in premiums for  		individual policies and provide refunds if loss ratio requirements are not met.  		Nearly a decade after first requiring minimum standards for Medigap policies,  		the Congress felt that some of the standards were not effective and instituted  		stricter standards. </p>
<p>There are also certain similarities between the regulation of pension  		benefits and long term care insurance policies. The greatest similarities are  		that both types of benefits are funded over a long period of time and that the  		terms under which benefits can be paid can be complicated and confusing. To  		address these problems, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  		(ERISA) established certain minimum standards that pension plans had to meet.  		ERISA also established a mechanism to guarantee the security of worker benefits  		if a company terminated its pension plan. Since 1974, ERISA has been modified  		significantly and both its minimum standards and its benefit guarantee  		provisions have been tightened. </p>
<p>Due to this legislation and the minimum standards regulation the cost of  		adopting pension plans has increased. In addition, the ongoing regulatory costs  		have increased significantly. As a result, pension plan coverage rates have  		stagnated since ERISA's passage. ERISA's rules have also had the effect of  		shifting plan coverage from defined benefit plans, which are more heavily  		regulated, to defined contribution plans. In sum, ERISA's minimum standards  		legislation has addressed many of the plan abuses which were common before  		ERISA. However, ERISA's regulatory costs have been a major factor in the lack  		of increase in pension coverage over the last 15 years. </p>
<p>There are two areas in which the federal government could establish  		mandatory requirements or encourage voluntary state compliance (similar to the  		Baucus mechanism): 1) minimum reporting requirements; and 2) minimum standards  		to sell insurance. </p>
<p><b>1. Minimum Reporting Requirements</b> </p>
<p>Minimum reporting requirements for long term care insurance may provide  		a method of ensuring that consumers are treated fairly by insurers and/or a  		method of monitoring trends and developments in the long term care insurance  		market. The minimum reporting requirements discussed below have been suggested.  		</p>
<p><b>Loss Ratios</b> -- Expected loss ratios are generally requested by  		insurers when rate increases for a product are filed in order to assess whether  		premiums versus benefits under the increase will be fair to the consumer.  		Expected loss ratios included as a part of a rate filing do not necessarily  		reflect actual loss ratios of a product. There are number of alternative  		methods for calculating loss ratios. Simple annual loss ratios (claims incurred  		in a year as a percent of premiums paid in a year) are an inappropriate measure  		for determining the total value of long term care insurance unless it is  		reported for all years of a policy life because generally the same premium is  		paid over a number of years for a risk that grows over time. Therefore, the  		loss ratios using simple annual loss ratios would be very small in the initial  		years and very high in the later years of the policy life. Simple annual loss  		ratios, though, can provide a method of tracking actual to expected results in  		the short run. </p>
<p>A better measure of the overall adequacy of a premium rate are  		cumulative loss ratios which require that all liabilities for all years in  		which the policy will be in force be related to the premiums collected, taking  		into account accumulated investment income. Cumulative loss ratios are subject  		to the assumptions used in their calculation because the true cumulative loss  		ratio cannot be determined until a cohort of issues have all terminated.  		Reserves are sometimes used in calculations of loss ratios as an approximation  		of expected claims. The NAIC has adopted reporting forms on both a calendar  		year basis and a cumulative basis by calendar year duration for the policies  		(see <a href="fedrole.htm#attach3">Attachment 3</a>). Policy reserves are also to be  		reported but changes in reserves are not to be used in calculating the loss  		ratios. </p>
<p>Requiring insurers to meet actual loss ratios is a mechanism used with  		other health and accident insurance to ensure that purchasers are receiving a  		fair return for their premium dollar. Issues for potential federal regulation  		include: the most appropriate method for assessing loss ratios; assumptions to  		be used in the calculation of loss ratios; and requirements for reporting  		experience over time. Some argue that loss ratios should not be the primary  		regulatory measure for long term care insurance because of uncertainties  		related to claims experience, costs, and future liabilities (don't know results  		for 20 years), and that other measures to ensure fairness in premiums charged  		to the consumer should be instituted.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note24">24</a></sup></font> Federal involvement in requiring a minimum  		loss ratio would be usurping a traditional state role (as has been done in the  		Medigap market) but it may provide consumers with sufficient confidence to spur  		demand to increase insurance coverage. </p>
<p><b>Policy Lapses and Rescissions</b> -- As an indication of the  		relationship between policy lapses and rate increases and insurers' good faith  		efforts, some support requiring companies to report the number of policy lapses  		(purchasers voluntarily ceasing premium payments), changes in coverage for  		existing policy holders, and rescissions (insurance company will no longer  		cover purchaser). This information would provide indications of the effect of  		rate increases on policy holders, on whether companies were inappropriately  		marketing policies (rolling), and possible post-claims underwriting. Such  		information would assist policy makers and regulators in monitoring consumer  		protection efforts. The NAIC model requires much of this data to be collected.  		</p>
<p><b>Market Trends</b> -- By requiring insurers to report demographic and  		economic characteristics of long term care insurance applicants and purchasers,  		as well as information on claims experience (including denials), the federal  		government would be able to better monitor trends in the long term care  		insurance market. A better understanding of these trends would permit more  		informed policy-making related to long term care. Insurers are likely to object  		to such reporting on proprietary grounds. </p>
<p><b>2. Minimum Standards to Sell Insurance</b> </p>
<p>Imposing minimum standards which must be adhered to before a company can  		be licensed to sell long term care products or before specific products can be  		sold has been suggested as a method for standardizing products and facilitating  		comparison shopping. Minimum standards to sell insurance would provide a method  		of establishing the potential federal goal of consistent regulations.  		Establishing consistent minimum regulatory requirements would also guarantee  		that all policies sold in a state (including group policies) met a minimum  		requirement level.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note25">25</a></sup></font>  		The best method of establishing minimum standards would be one in which  		continual revisions are possible. </p>
<p>Many of the standards that could be instituted are contained in the  		current NAIC model. These standards include: no prior hospitalization  		requirement to receive benefits, not limiting coverage to or providing  		significantly more coverage for skilled care, limiting exclusion periods for  		preexisting conditions, prohibiting post-claims underwriting, prohibiting  		denial or limiting of benefits to persons with Alzheimer's Disease, prohibiting  		conditioning eligibility for benefits on having received a higher level of  		care, minimum standards for home health benefits, guaranteed renewability of  		policies, providing a "free-look" period, offering/requiring inflation  		protection, and providing an outline of coverage and a shopper's guide. Other  		standards that have been proposed include: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Mandating Non-Forfeiture Benefits (outright or as an option)</i>  			 -- One of the primary purposes of long term care insurance is to prefund for  			 the cost of services needed at the end of the life span. Often insurers set a  			 level premium that is higher than needed in the early years so that this amount  			 can be invested. This can lead to the accumulation of substantial assets. By  			 not requiring that the assets that are built up over the life of the policy be  			 returned to the purchaser, all equity is lost by failing to pay a premium. Some  			 analysts recommend that a "reduced paid up benefit, which continues a  			 lapsed purchaser's coverage but with reduced benefits, be required.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note26">26</a></sup></font> A problem with  			 non-forfeiture benefits is that such provisions are likely to further increase  			 the cost of long term care insurance. The NAIC is conducting a study of the  			 effect of non-forfeiture benefits on premiums and adopted an exposure draft at  			 its December 1990 meeting requiring non-forfeiture benefits be offered.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Disallowing Rate Increases for Policies With Fixed Benefits</i>  			 -- A "guaranteed renewable" clause may not be much of a guarantee if premiums  			 are allowed to increase such that purchasers lapse a long term care insurance  			 policy because they can no longer afford it. Accident and health insurance  			 premiums increase on a regular basis because they generally cover medical and  			 hospital services for which costs increase steadily. Most long term care  			 insurance policies have a fixed, or specified fixed indexed, indemnity benefit.  			 The amount paid to policy holders is not dependent upon the cost of services.  			 Some argue that allowing rate increases for fixed benefits is a transfer of  			 risk from the insurer to the policyholder.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note27">27</a></sup></font> On the other hand, given the uncertainty  			 regarding the effect of insurance coverage on long term care use and the  			 uncertainty surrounding the expected use of home care services, allowing  			 insurers to increase premiums based on information from additional claims  			 experience may not be unreasonable. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Clear Specification of Benefit Triggers</i> -- The minimum  			 requirements for receiving benefits based on contract language are often not  			 clear. Activity of daily living (ADL) benefit triggers do not always specify  			 how ADL impairment will be determined and what level of impairment (e.g.,  			 active human assistance, unable to perform) is required. Also, provisions to  			 cover policy holders with Alzheimer's Disease do not necessarily mean that  			 being diagnosed with the disease will trigger benefits. Most policies still  			 require Alzheimer's patients to meet the requisite ADL level, many of whom do  			 not have serious ADL limitations.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note28">28</a></sup></font> Requiring standard definitions and language  			 for benefit triggers has been proposed. The evolving nature of ADL definitions  			 and understanding may argue for a gradual, flexible standardization of language  			 in some cases. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Inflation Protection</i> -- Most long term care policies provide  			 fixed indemnity benefits, rather than benefits linked to costs or charges.  			 Because of the potentially long period between initial purchase of a policy and  			 its eventual use, the value of an indemnity benefit to the consumer can  			 deteriorate considerably. Most policies that offer an inflation adjustment,  			 offer either: 1) the option to periodically increase benefit levels at higher  			 premiums based on the attained age; or 2) a fixed increase each year, generally  			 based on some percentage of the original indemnity benefit amount that is  			 capped after a certain period of time (i.e., a policy that initially pays $100  			 per day in a nursing home would increase by $5 per year). The first option  			 means higher premiums in order to have benefits adjusted for inflation and the  			 second means potentially inadequate benefit levels if nursing home costs  			 increase at a rate faster than the fixed increase allowed under the policy. The  			 NAIC Model regulations specify that companies should offer the option of  			 benefits with at least five percent annually compounded benefits. Requiring  			 insurers to include "true" inflation protection, defined as benefits indexed  			 based on the compounded increases in long term care prices, with <b>all</b>  			 policies has been proposed. Such requirements increase an insurer's  			 uncertainty/risk and will likely increase premiums. At a minimum, including  			 some information concerning the effect of inflation on benefits versus the cost  			 of services over time in shopper's guides and policy solicitation material has  			 been suggested. A task force of the NAIC is currently examining this issue.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Home Care Benefits</i> -- Insurers are designing and pricing home  			 health care benefits based on even less information than is available on  			 nursing home prices and utilization. As a result, home health benefit  			 provisions are often limited. It is often unclear whether the consumer is  			 purchasing adequate home care benefits that will provide reimbursement when  			 services are required. Some have suggested that the federal government  			 establish minimum home care benefit standards and terminology to guarantee  			 legitimate home care benefits are provided in long term care insurance  			 policies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Standard Language/Terminology</i> -- Many of the terms and the  			 language used in long term care insurance policies are unfamiliar to consumers.  			 In addition, policies do not necessarily use the same terms in the same manner.  			 It has been suggested that the federal government establish standard  			 terminology for long term care insurance policies (i.e., ADLs, standard  			 assessment tools) to reduce confusion and facilitate comparison shopping by  			 consumers. Again, such standardization may be premature for some areas because  			 of the lack of consensus in the industry on standard practices. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The likely outcome of instituting minimum reporting requirements or  		standards to sell long term care insurance would be an increased measure of  		consumer protection through the monitoring of insurance practices and  		comparability of products which may in turn reduce consumer confusion, elevate  		consumer confidence and increase insurance purchase. On the other hand,  		requiring more reporting and minimum provisions of insurers would also likely  		increase long term care insurance premiums to some degree (to a greater degree  		if several minimum provisions are combined) which may have the effect of  		decreasing insurance purchase. Also, some argue that there isn't sufficient  		agreement on minimum policy provisions and standard terminology and that  		requiring such features may have the effect of stifling product innovation in  		an immature product market.<font><sup><a href="fedrole.htm#note29">29</a></sup></font> </p>
<h4>D. Providing Federal Assistance to States</h4>
<p>Providing federal assistance to states might facilitate meeting the  		goals of increased consumer awareness, protection, and insurance purchase.  		These goals could be served by assisting states in the enforcement of  		regulatory standards for long term care insurance. The federal government could  		provide funding for enforcement efforts and/or provide technical assistance.  		Such efforts could assist states in identifying and cracking down on companies  		that offer substandard products and are on shaky financial ground. </p>
<p>One form of technical assistance could be the establishment of a  		national data base of complaints against insurance companies and agents  		offering long term care insurance in which states would be required to  		participate. Such a centralized data base would permit the government and  		consumers to better track bad insurers and agents, particularly across states.  		Information could be provided to consumers on a request basis or in a regularly  		published document. The government could even establish fines or other  		deterrents of illegal business practices that could be enforced based on  		submitted and investigated complaints. It is probably advisable to allow the  		NAIC complaint system to become established prior to a federal role of this  		sort. Care must be taken in the construction and use of a complaint data base  		to avoid duplication of complaints and potential abuses. </p>
<p>Another possible federal role of assistance to states could be aiding  		states in instituting a system of public press releases on agent and company  		fines. An SRI study on Medigap regulations showed that such actions were  		effective in decreasing agent abuses. </p>
<p>The expected outcome of providing federal assistance to states would be  		increased consumer awareness and protection which may increase long term care  		insurance purchase. Such federal assistance would be less intrusive than  		mandated/encouraged minimum requirements. An important consideration in  		providing such assistance would be allocating scarce resources in an efficient  		manner. </p>
<h3>E. Federal Assistance For Insurers</h3>
<p>The federal government could institute a number of incentives for  		insurers to offer quality long term care insurance products. This would serve  		to accomplish the potential federal goals of increasing insurance purchase and  		protecting consumers. Some suggested incentives include: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Seal of Approval</i> -- A federal seal of approval for products  			 which meet some agreed upon standards (i.e., financial strength of company,  			 quality of product, claims payment record) could be established. Such a  			 voluntary certification strategy could embody current NAIC standards or provide  			 for more stringent standards dependent on whether the government wished to  			 attempt to increase the quality of coverage offered. Such an approach may have  			 problems of misrepresentation and confusion concerning the role of the federal  			 government in sponsoring or backing a policy. The evolving nature of the  			 product also presents a problem. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Reinsurance Pool</i> -- Insurers offering long term care  			 insurance are facing an unknown risk because they will not have a full cohort  			 of claims experience for another fifteen to twenty years. A federally sponsored  			 reinsurance pool to protect insurers from excessive risk might encourage  			 insurers to offer long term care insurance and reduce premiums as a result of  			 the reduced risk. Participation in a reinsurance pool could be conditioned upon  			 using federally approved criteria for policies, such as minimum benefits or  			 underwriting criteria. A federal reinsurance pool offers a mechanism for  			 instituting federal standards without preempting state regulation. This would  			 have the effect of expanding the potential population covered by long term care  			 insurance. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Promoting Group Purchase</i> -- Promoting group purchases of long  			 term care insurance could be an effective tool for screening products and  			 educating consumers. Group purchase could be encouraged through clarifications  			 of the tax code related to long term care insurance. (These clarifications are  			 discussed more fully in a later section.) The federal government could also  			 offer incentives for group purchase by allowing tax incentives similar to those  			 for health insurance. Bills introduced by Senator Cohen (S.314) and  			 Representative Rhodes include provisions to clarify the tax treatment of long  			 term care insurance and accelerated death benefits. The bill defines long term  			 care insurance similarly to the NAIC and also includes tax incentives for the  			 use of individual retirement accounts to pay long term care insurance premiums.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Many experts argue that federal assistance for insurers through a seal  		of approval process or a reinsurance pool is unnecessary. Efforts to promote  		group purchase, though, are considered an efficient method of increasing long  		term care insurance coverage. </p>
<h3>F. Federal Support for Consumer Education</h3>
<p>Some speculate that much of the lack of consumer interest in long term  		care insurance is the result of a failure to understand the risk of use of long  		term care services, the potential cost of the services, and current public long  		term care benefits. Increasing consumer education efforts would increase  		consumer understanding and "comfort levels" and may also increase the  		affordability of purchasing long term care insurance by lowering the initial  		age of purchase. Contributing to a lack of consumer interest is general  		confusion over what is being offered by long term care insurance and what  		constitutes a good buy. It may be useful for consumers to have an independent  		source of information concerning long term care insurance products. Finally,  		some elderly may be encouraged to purchase long term care insurance if they  		knew what the federal government was planning to do in terms of long term care  		benefits (i.e., whether or not a major social insurance program will be  		established). </p>
<p>The federal government could support the education of consumers by:  		providing funds to state counseling programs; sponsoring consumer awareness  		seminars; publishing a consumer's guide; running public service announcements;  		launching a nationwide information campaign (e.g., detailing what "long term  		care" services Medicare and Medigap do and do not cover); consolidating and  		standardizing information on long term care policies offered; developing some  		rule of thumb criteria for determining the need and appropriate benefit level  		for long term care insurance based on a consumer's financial resources and  		social support; and/or publicizing government intentions with regard to long  		term care policy. As discussed earlier, OBRA 90 included funding to states for  		counseling services to the elderly. </p>
<p>Federal support for consumer education is considered by many experts as  		the most appropriate and efficient initial role for the federal government in  		the long term care insurance market. Consumer education is expected to increase  		information and reduce misperceptions of public programs which would allow  		individuals to make better informed decisions. </p>
<h3>G. Federal Tax Clarification</h3>
<p>The insurance industry and financial planners recommend that the federal  		government clarify the treatment of long term care insurance in the tax code.  		Such clarification may increase insurance coverage by allowing insurers the  		increased marketing potential of tax advantages. Many purchasers operate under  		the assumption that long term care insurance benefits paid to a claimant are  		not taxable and premiums paid may be used in calculating the medical deductions  		for individual income tax purposes, but the IRS has not issued an explicit  		ruling on the matter. </p>
<p>Another area of tax uncertainty that could be clarified is whether or  		not long term care insurance may be treated similar to other accident and  		health insurance policies so that it could be included as an option in  		cafeteria plans (flexible benefits and flexible spending accounts) and employer  		contributions would be tax deductible. Being able to include long term care  		insurance under a cafeteria plan would mean that premiums could be paid with  		employee pre-tax income even if the employee paid the entire premium.  		Interpretation of an IRS private letter ruling implies that such arrangements  		would be permissible as long as a purchaser cannot receive cash payments from  		the policy, in which case cash nonforfeiture values (as opposed to reduced  		paid-up benefits) may be problematic. </p>
<p>An area for potential change to the tax code is two year full  		preliminary term reserving methods for long term care. Federal corporate income  		tax laws disallow expense deduction for reserves in the first two years of  		premium payments for long term care insurance policies. This tax policy reduces  		the incentive for companies to make reserve payments in the first two years of  		a policy, possibly resulting in higher premiums. This reserving method is  		stipulated because there is no uniformity among state requirements, although  		most states use this method. An undesirable effect may be to discourage  		products that are intended to be true level premium plans, with modest  		commissions and expenses, and sold in a manner expected to produce relatively  		low lapse rates. Further investigation into the effect of alternative reserving  		methods and their tax incentives should be encouraged. </p>
<p>With clarifications in these areas, insurers and agents could more  		confidently market potential tax advantages and also more aggressively become  		involved in the employer group market. In addition, some argue that offering  		some form of tax incentive for long term care insurance purchase would  		encourage the purchase of the product as well as serve as an effective means of  		education about the need for protection against the costs of long term care.  		</p>
<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">IV. CONCLUSIONS OF THE DEPARTMENTAL  		WORK GROUP ON CONSUMER PROTECTION AND REGULATION OF LONG TERM CARE  		INSURANCE</a></h2>
<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)  		assembled a panel of experts of varying backgrounds to discuss the potential  		roles of the federal government in the long term care insurance market. The  		panel included representatives from the insurance industry, consumer groups,  		the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and government, as well as  		persons with expert knowledge of long term care, particularly long term care  		insurance. (For a complete list of participants see <a href="fedrole.htm#attach4">Attachment 4</a>.) </p>
<p>Several potential steps for improving the long term care insurance  		market were agreed upon by the panel. Most members of the panel expressed  		concern about the "appropriateness" of long term care insurance purchase for  		some persons (e.g., not having persons who would qualify for Medicaid purchase  		insurance) and that quality insurers offer quality products. </p>
<p>The panel also agreed upon the following: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>The federal government needs to clarify the tax status of long term  			 care insurance products (although the panel did not agree upon the treatment of  			 two year reserves as an expense deduction). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federal government should provide additional beneficiary  			 assistance and counseling, particularly in terms of explaining the government's  			 role in long term care (Medicare and Medicaid program benefits) and the lack of  			 long term care benefits in Medigap policies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a need for an independent source of information concerning  			 the risk of long term care use and comparisons of long term care insurance  			 policies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capabilities in state insurance departments should be increased.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mandatory federal regulation of long term care insurance products  			 would likely stifle innovation. Although, widespread agreement has been reached  			 on some standards, such as prohibiting prior hospitalization requirements,  			 consensus has not been reached on other issues. For example, standard  			 definitions for benefit triggers for home care are currently being tested and  			 developed in the market by insurance companies but an accepted standard has not  			 emerged. As the market matures, the federal government should monitor the  			 progress of states in adopting NAIC model regulations for long term care  			 insurance and the adequacy of regulations in providing consumer protection  			 before acting. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Areas in which the panel did not reach consensus related mostly to  		standards that should be included in federally mandated regulations for long  		term care insurance should NAIC specifications and state enforcement be judged  		inadequate. These areas without consensus included: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Mandating non-forfeiture or reduced paid-up benefits to be included  			 in policies for purchasers who lapse. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring inflation protection in all policies, not just as an  			 option. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forbidding or limiting increases in premiums for indemnity policies.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifying uniform benefit triggers (e.g., definitions for ADLs).  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standardizing language and terminology used in policies. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Most of these issues are currently under review by the NAIC Long Term  		Care Insurance Task Force. </p>

<h2><a name="attach3" id="attach3">ATTACHMENT 3: NAIC LONG TERM CARE EXPERIENCE  		REPORTING FORMS</a></h2>
<h3>Explanatory Notes for the Long Term Care Experience  		Reporting Forms </h3>
<p>The purpose of the Long Term Care Insurance Experience Reporting Forms  		is to monitor compliance with a lifetime loss ratio standard. In general,  		policy duration loss ratios computed without the impact of the change in policy  		(active life) reserves are considerably below the lifetime standard in the  		early durations and considerably above the lifetime standard in the later  		durations. </p>
<p>The method chosen to measure compliance with the lifetime loss ratio  		standard is to compare the actual loss ratio being developed by calendar year  		durations to those anticipated in the latest policy form filing. Additional  		analysis is performed on a cumulative basis. A ratio of actual to expected loss  		ratios of 1.00 would be a rough indication that the experience is on track to  		produce the lifetime anticipated loss ratio. </p>
<p>Factors to be considered when interpreting the actual to expected ratio  		are: Actual persistency relative to assumed persistency, the distribution of  		business by issue age, elimination period and statistical credibility of  		experience. </p>
<p>The analysis of calendar year duration and cumulative loss ratio  		experience excludes the change in policy (active life) reserves. However,  		policy (active life) reserves are shown in order to indicate the change in the  		level of assets being allocated to fund possible future claims. The ratio of  		the sum of the incurred claims and the change in policy (active life) reserves  		to earned premiums should not be expected to reproduce the lifetime anticipated  		loss ratio however. Nor are they expected to be level by duration nor should  		they be used to measure the value of benefits to policyholders. This is because  		statutory policy (active life) reserves are based on assumptions different than  		the pricing assumptions and may utilize a "preliminary term" methodology which  		depresses the change in policy reserves during the preliminary term period and  		accelerates the change in policy reserves after the preliminary term period.  		</p>
<p>Because of the relatively small claim rates and variable nursing home  		stays, the statistical credibility of long term care insurance experience is  		lower than the amount of credibility assigned to similar amounts of experience  		on other types of health. This fact has an impact on the interpretation of  		statewide loss ratio data. It also has an impact on the decision to make upward  		or downward premium adjustments. </p>

<p>Cumulative anticipated experience over all calendar durations should  			 be calculated by accumulating, at the appropriate interest rate, the calendar  			 duration anticipated earned premiums and incurred claims until the end of the  			 experience period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actual earned premiums and incurred claims should be determined for  			 each calendar duration for each calendar year of issue starting with the first  			 year of issue. Total calendar duration experience should be obtained by adding  			 together the appropriate calendar duration results for each calendar year  			 starting with the first year of issue. Incurred claims for each calendar  			 duration for each calendar duration for each calendar year should be obtained  			 by discounting all appropriate claim payments and any ending claim reserve to  			 the mid-point of the calendar year of incurral.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cumulative actual experience over all calendar durations should be  			 calculated by accumulating, at the appropriate interest rate, the actual  			 calendar duration experience until the end of the experience period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The appropriate interest rate, as used in this reporting form, is  			 the valuation interest rate for contract reserves for health insurance  			 contracts as defined in the NAIC Model Minimum Reserve Standards for Individual  			 and Group Home Insurance Contracts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The experience period is from the inception of the policy form to  			 the end of the statement year. The experience is developed to the development  			 date. The development date is December 31 of the statement year. The statement  			 year is the calendar year reported upon by the Annual Statement which this form  			 supplements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of insured lives as of the end of the experience period  			 should be reported for each of the calendar year duration cells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The policy form cumulative actual to expected ratio is to be  			 calculated by dividing the ratio of cumulative incurred claims to the  			 cumulative actual earned premiums by the ratio of cumulative anticipated  			 incurred claims to cumulative anticipated earned premiums.</p>
