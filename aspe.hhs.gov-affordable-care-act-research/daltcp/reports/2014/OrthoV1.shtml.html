<p><b>Objective</b>: Test which of two alternative ways of implementing  		each of ten components of care management lead to better health outcomes in two  		participating special needs plans. The tested alternatives were routine care  		(services routinely provided before the study) or enhanced care (more intensive  		versions of the services) in provision of routine contacts, falls-risk  		screening, depression screening, member coaching, and care transitions  		management.</p>
<p><b>Study Design and Data</b>: An experimental design approach rarely  		used in health research--efficient orthogonal design--was used to assign each  		of 24 participating care teams to implement a different, pre-selected  		combination of routine or enhanced care for each of ten components, for a  		one-year period to the plan members whose care they manage (a total of 1,562  		members). The plans' claims data were used to measure members' service use and  		chronic conditions; enrollment files provided data on demographics. Fidelity to  		assigned component options was assessed using data from plan-administered  		tracking tool sheets filled out by care managers after each encounter and  		through discussions with care management staff. </p>
<p><b>Key Outcomes</b>: Health outcomes assessed were: (1) the number of  		inpatient admissions; (2) the incidence of readmission within 30 days of any  		discharge (including those for mental health problems) and within 30 days of a  		discharge from a stay for treatment of physical problems only; and (3) the  		number of emergency room (ER) visits. Fidelity outcomes were: (1) the  		proportion of members receiving the assigned option at least once; (2) the  		annualized number of times each component or option was provided per member;  		and (3) the proportion of members receiving the option at least as often as  		assigned. </p>
<p><b>Analysis Methods</b>: Regression analysis was used to estimate  		differences in outcomes between members receiving routine and enhanced care.  		All three outcomes were analyzed over the 1-6, 7-12, and the full 1-12 month  		follow-up periods for all members. Readmissions were analyzed for hospitalized  		members over the 1-12 month follow-up. Fidelity to assignments was analyzed  		using tracking tool data and interpreted in light of qualitative analysis of  		discussions with plan staff. </p>
<p><b>Select Results</b>: Over the full year of follow-up: (1) those  		assigned to more frequent contacts and medication reviews had 16 percent fewer  		ER visits; and (2) those assigned to use of the teachback method had 15 percent  		more ER visits. Fidelity analysis showed that few members in both the enhanced  		and routine care groups received at least the minimum number of services  		specified in the study protocol, likely reflecting various barriers to  		implementation. Furthermore, the number of significant differences was about  		what would be expected by chance for the 80 comparisons (two outcomes were  		analyzed for ten components for all members over three periods and two outcomes  		for ten components for hospitalized members). Thus, these few significant  		differences may be simply due to chance.</p>
<p><b>Conclusions</b>: The study findings suggest that only one of the  		interventions tested (more frequent routine contacts and medication review)  		appeared to have led to improved outcomes, but the lack of consistency of  		favorable findings across outcomes for this intervention, and the anomalous  		finding for the teachback method, make even this finding suspect. Three factors  		likely contributed to this paucity of significant results: (1) weak  		interventions; (2) limited implementation of the intended interventions; and  		(3) inadequate statistical power. However, despite the absence of significant  		differences in outcomes between enhanced and standard versions of intervention  		components, the programs did learn some important lessons. In some ways, the  		most important benefit of an orthogonal design study, as we have seen from the  		reaction of the participating plans, might be the clarification of expectations  		about interventions that it provides, rather than whether the enhancements  		produce better outcomes. When routine care is not well defined or when the way  		routine care is implemented differs across care managers, the clarity provided  		by the study can help standardize the care management intervention, leading to  		less variation in implementation across managers. Further, in our study,  		analysis of the fidelity to the intervention allowed participating plans to  		assess the degree to which components were carried out as specified, which can  		help the plan identify which areas of care management to focus on in their  		quality improvement efforts. The orthogonal design approach also encourages  		organizations to create a culture of learning by providing participants with a  		rigorous approach for testing out their new ideas. To maximize learning from  		orthogonal design studies, effort should be put into defining intervention  		changes that are expected to have a high likelihood of improving key outcomes,  		and to getting buy-in from the operational units to ensure that the planned  		interventions are faithfully implemented. To ensure the findings from the  		orthogonal design are true effects with actionable implications, studies need  		to have enough operational units (for example, care managers) to provide  		adequate power to detect modest size effects.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Evidence on best practices in care management for chronically ill  		Medicare beneficiaries offers few clear guidelines about what works best. Given  		the wide variation both within and across plans in how special needs plan (SNP)  		services are provided, it becomes important to identify how best to implement  		or improve intervention components rather than testing only the overall  		effectiveness of SNPs in general. In this study, we sought to understand which  		of two alternative ways of implementing each of several components of care  		management lead to better health outcomes in the two participating SNPs. We  		used an efficient orthogonal design that allowed us to simultaneously compare  		effectiveness of alternative approaches to implementing ten components of care  		management services. Efficient orthogonal designs have been used extensively in  		manufacturing, and in some health care organizations, but not in published  		health care evaluations. Such designs enable the testing of multi-component  		interventions and various ways of deploying each component, offering great  		potential as a tool for continuous improvement in health care quality.</p>
<p>We tested two alternatives--routine care (services routinely provided at  		the plans before the study) and enhanced care (more frequent or more intensive  		versions of the services)--for each of ten care components. The tested  		components included frequency-of-routine contacts; falls-risk screening  		frequency and referral to fall prevention programs; depression screening  		frequency, use of depression screening instruments, and mode of referral;  		member education and coaching strategies; and management of care transitions,  		including frequency of follow-up and use of protocols and tools.</p>
<h3>Study Design and Analysis Methods</h3>
<p><i><b>Randomization, Outcomes, and Data</b></i></p>
<p>The participants were: (1) care managers in Care Wisconsin and Gateway  		(in Pennsylvania) plans who implemented the interventions; and (2) the 1,562  		dually eligible noninstitutionalized members with disabilities or frail elderly  		who comprised these care managers' caseloads. We randomly assigned each of the  		24 care teams/care managers in the study (17 from Care Wisconsin and seven from  		Gateway) to implement a different, pre-selected combination of alternatives  		(routine care or enhanced care) for each of ten components, for one year. The  		care managers implemented the same intervention components for all of their  		members. </p>
<p>For each component, we analyzed whether members assigned to the enhanced  		care variant experienced different outcomes than those assigned to the routine  		care variant. Outcomes examined included: (1) the number of inpatient  		admissions for any reason; (2) the incidence of readmission within 30 days of  		any discharge (i.e., including those for mental health problems) and within 30  		days of a discharge from medical stays only; and (3) the number of emergency  		room (ER) visits. We focused on readmissions for members hospitalized at least  		once during the follow-up because members who were not hospitalized cannot be  		readmitted. The program ran from May 16, 2011, through May 15, 2012, and we  		measured impacts over this period. We received approval for the study from the  		New England Institutional Review Board. U.S. Office of Management and Budget  		approval was not required because Mathematica did no primary data  		collection.</p>
<p>To analyze the effectiveness of enhanced versus routine care, we used  		two sources of secondary data obtained from the participating plans: (1)  		de-identified claims data on members' service use and chronic conditions; and  		(2) de-identified data on members' demographic characteristics and risk level,  		as assessed by each plan. For the implementation analysis, we used data  		collected by participating plans via tracking tools to assess the care  		managers' fidelity to their assigned component options. We also conducted  		discussions with care management staff to understand how faithfully the  		components were implemented. </p>
<p><i><b>Impact and Implementation Analysis Methods</b></i></p>
<p>We used regression analysis to compare the outcomes for members  		receiving routine care to the outcomes for members receiving enhanced care,  		controlling for any pre-intervention differences between the two groups in  		members' and care managers' characteristics. All four outcomes were analyzed  		over these follow-up periods for all members: 1-6 months; 7-12 months; and the  		full 1-12 month period. Analyses of effects of components on readmissions were  		done for hospitalized members over the 1-12 month follow-up. Regression  		analyses controlled for member characteristics observed over the two-year  		baseline period (May 16, 2009, to May 15, 2011). </p>
<p>Implementation analysis is particularly important because a finding from  		regression analyses that routine and enhanced care options were equally  		effective in terms of observed health outcomes for a given component might be  		incorrect if such care was not fully implemented. If such analysis suggests  		that some planned intervention enhancements were not well-implemented, further  		assessment should be done to identify the barriers to implementation of those  		interventions. In June through August 2012 (between one and three months after  		the intervention period ended, but before the analysis results were produced),  		we held discussions with care management staff to get their views on why  		enhanced care may have been more effective than routine care for some  		components but not for others, and to identify implementation facilitators and  		barriers. Care managers were instructed to use the tracking tool form after  		each contact with the members to record which components were provided. Using  		this information, we assessed the fidelity to assignments by examining: (1) the  		proportion of members receiving the assigned option at least once; (2) the  		annualized number of times each component or option was provided per member;  		and (3) the proportion of members receiving the option at least as often as  		assigned. </p>
<h3>Study Findings and Discussion</h3>
<p><i><b>Descriptive Results</b></i></p>
<p>The population of members in the study was composed of older adults,  		included more women than men, and was largely Caucasian. The proportions living  		in rural versus urban areas were about equal. Gateway members were younger,  		less likely to be newly enrolled in the plan, and less healthy than Care  		Wisconsin members. Use of hospital and ER services was high at both baseline  		and follow-up--47 percent of members were hospitalized during baseline and 43  		percent were hospitalized during the follow-up period.</p>
<p><i><b>Findings</b></i></p>
<p>Even though outcomes were similar for those whose care managers were  		assigned to the enhanced version as for those assigned to the routine version  		for most of the ten care components, there were a few exceptions: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Requiring a higher minimum frequency of contacts and medication  			 reviews was associated with 16 percent fewer ER visits at the full year of  			 follow-up. Members assigned to enhanced care received slightly more contacts  			 and many more medication reviews (38 percent) than members assigned to routine  			 care. Care managers remarked that they had difficulties maintaining the more  			 frequent contact rates due to already high caseloads. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surprisingly, patients of care coordinators assigned to use the  			 enhanced ("teachback") coaching method had 15 percent <i>more</i> ER visits  			 than the routine coaching method at the full year of follow-up, a finding  			 possibly attributable to care managers' lack of familiarity with the teachback  			 method. Fidelity analysis showed that care managers assigned to teachback  			 provided less coaching to their patients, in terms of the percentage of  			 patients who received any coaching and the number of times they received  			 coaching. The effect on ER visits dissipated in the second six-month follow-up,  			 which might be due to care managers improving their teachback skills over  			 time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Results for outcomes measured over the periods of 1-6 months and  			 7-12 months were similar to those for the full period, suggesting that most of  			 the enhanced options neither influenced outcomes early on but then dissipated,  			 nor that they took several months to take effect. One exception is that  			 assigning members to more frequent falls-risk screenings with an instrument was  			 associated with a greater likelihood of readmission following a medical  			 discharge as compared to those assigned to routine care; at the second  			 six-month follow-up, the finding was reversed. These findings are most likely  			 chance variation in when these readmissions occurred rather than real effects  			 of opposite signs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Some findings of no difference in outcomes may be attributable to a  		failure to implement the enhanced care option in a manner that sufficiently  		distinguished it from the routine care option. For example, although the  		teachback method was qualitatively more intensive, the fidelity analysis showed  		that the enhanced and routine care groups received approximately the same  		number of post-discharge follow-ups, consistent with care managers reporting  		having difficulties conducting the second follow-up because calls were time  		consuming and members difficult to reach. Although post-discharge follow-up  		with an instrument and a checklist was qualitatively more intensive and  		reported as useful by care managers because it provided structure, care  		managers assigned to the instrument/checklist performed fewer follow-ups, so it  		is not surprising that we observed similar outcomes for routine and enhanced  		care groups on this component. </p>
<p>Despite the findings that outcomes were not better for the enhanced  		version of most of the components tested, the participating plans have  		nonetheless decided to adopt some of these enhancements. The plans' decisions  		to adopt these enhancements were made before the results on relative  		effectiveness of enhancements were available to them, and were therefore based  		solely on their experience with the options. Care management staff reported  		several important lessons learned from the study implementation. We found that  		both plans' care managers and leaders believed that use of the teachback method  		was a useful and appealing innovation; the two plans intend to train all care  		managers in the method before requiring its routine use. In addition, Care  		Wisconsin plans to implement the Patient Health Questionnaire Nine-Question  		Instrument for depression screening because it was shorter than the tools used  		at the plan before the study and because community clinicians were familiar  		with it. Care Wisconsin is considering training care managers in falls-risk  		assessment. Care Wisconsin has also developed a post-discharge tool similar to  		one used in the study and is considering adoption of a second post-discharge  		follow-up because of positive feedback from care managers and because both  		these enhancements are believed to be helpful to members. Gateway noted that  		the study introduced more structure in routine contacts, falls-risk screening,  		and care transitions management, which it considers to be valuable and intends  		to continue. In addition, the plan intends to train care managers in depression  		screening. For both plans, the study highlighted the need to track the services  		delivered by care managers.</p>
<p><i><b>Limitations </b></i></p>
<p>Several limitations in the study should be noted. Because only 24 care  		managers/teams participated in the study, only large differences in outcomes  		between routine and enhanced care options (22-32 percent of the mean outcome)  		were likely to be detected. Moreover, to obtain even this number of care  		managers, it was necessary to "pool" care managers from the two plans and  		estimate a single effect. We estimated intervention effects under the  		assumption that these effects were equal for the two plans after controlling  		for patient characteristics and plan-level differences in mean outcomes.</p>
<p>Members in the Gateway plan were not enrolled in care management for the  		full (one year) duration of the study, since members who reach their goals  		"graduate" from the program and cease to receive care management services. On  		average, members receive care management for 4-5 months. Therefore, it may have  		been even more difficult to detect differences between the tested options  		because 30 percent of the sample did not receive the interventions for long.  		Further, it is possible that exposure to intervention components for one year  		was not long enough for the measured outcomes to change, due to time required  		to learn how to implement a change in care management protocols effectively and  		for opportunities for preventing a hospitalization to arise. However, because  		we are analyzing a high-risk population and types of services that should show  		results relatively quickly, one year should be long enough for effects to be  		observed, if they are ever going to exist. </p>
<p>Given that we performed many comparisons between enhanced and routine  		care, it is possible that some findings resulted from chance. The number of  		significant differences was about what would be expected by chance for the 80  		comparisons (two outcomes were analyzed for ten components for all members for  		three periods and two outcomes for ten components for hospitalized members). A  		joint test of whether all enhanced versus routine care differences were zero  		could not be rejected, indicating that even the few statistically significant  		observed differences may have been due to chance rather than to the  		interventions. This indicates that as a group, enhanced components did not have  		a different effect on measured outcomes than routine practices. While this  		could be viewed as routine care being just as effective as the tested  		enhancements, the lack of significant findings may also be due to insufficient  		statistical power to detect what may have been modest-size favorable effects.  		Only impacts of 22-32 percent or larger were detectable with 80 percent  		power.</p>
<p>The findings from the implementation analysis of the tracking data may  		be flawed by incomplete reporting by the care management staff on their  		activities. Care managers at both plans experienced some difficulties  		integrating tracking sheets into day-to-day activities, which indicates that  		future studies should consider other ways to track fidelity, such as via  		electronic health records. In the related Brand New Day orthogonal design study  		that we conducted (reported elsewhere), the plan collected such information as  		part of the electronic health record. </p>
<p>Another major limitation was that for five of the components, the care  		actually delivered by care coordinators assigned to the enhanced care option  		did not differ meaningfully from the care delivered to those assigned to  		routine care. Thus, it is not possible to determine whether these intended  		enhancements of a given component would be more effective from the routine  		care. For two of the components, at least part of the reason for failure to  		deliver the assigned intervention appeared to be a lack of explicit,  		unambiguous descriptions of how the enhanced care was to be delivered. For  		example, conversations with care mangers revealed that there was confusion  		about how often to review a care plan (Component 6) and what is involved in a  		plan review, which is an important finding for the participating plans. The  		multiplicity of routine care practices and a lack of understanding of what is  		involved in these practices illustrate that sharp differences between studied  		options can be difficult to specify and explain to care coordinators.</p>
<p>For the other three components for which the enhanced care option was  		not implemented in a manner that distinguished it sufficiently from the routine  		care option, the problem was either that the enhancement was not implemented  		consistently or fully, or that routine care was more intensive when delivered  		than specified by the participating plans. However, while this situation makes  		it impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of the planned enhancement, it  		should be viewed less as a limitation than as an important finding that can  		inform the plans of needs to standardize routine care practices, and an  		opportunity to learn why planned enhancements were not enacted. The analyses in  		this report took an "intent-to-treat" approach in which component effects are  		computed by comparing outcomes of those assigned to the two options, regardless  		of whether or how thoroughly the options were actually delivered. Standard  		supervisory measures at the two plans were continued throughout the study, so  		that the components were tested in a "real-world" environment with the  		currently available resources, rather than in a strictly controlled setting.  		Follow-up discussions with care coordinators revealed several reasons for the  		lack of full implementation of the enhanced variants, such as high caseloads,  		difficulty tracking which components they had already provided to a given  		patient, and multiple organizational changes occurring during the study period  		that were unrelated to the study.</p>
<h3>Implications for Policy and Practice</h3>
<p>The study illustrates the potential of orthogonal design for improving  		the effectiveness and efficiency of care management programs if enough  		observational units, such, as care managers, are available. Orthogonal design  		combines the rigor of experimental design with the ability to produce rapid  		results on the effectiveness of several components in a single experiment. It  		accommodates planned testing of alternative approaches to multi-component  		interventions and permits practitioners and researchers to tailor interventions  		to the target population and test enhancements to routine care. Given that  		orthogonal design tests combinations of routine and enhanced care, there is no  		traditional control group; all members receive each component of care (e.g.,  		screening), but some receive it in a different style or intensity than had  		previously been used. Further, orthogonal studies are attractive because the  		care managers who implement the interventions all are engaged in testing new  		variations because each care manager implements some enhanced care and some  		routine care options. Care manager engagement is greatly enhanced if they are  		included in the development of the enhancements to be tested; this should  		always be a feature of orthogonal design studies of care management.</p>
<p>An important benefit of an orthogonal design study, as we have seen from  		the reaction of the participating plans, is enhanced clarity of expectations  		about how interventions are to be provided. Rather than implementing a broad  		model of care, care managers are told precisely how they are expected to  		implement each of the components of care management being tested. When routine  		care is not well defined or the way routine care is implemented differs across  		care managers, as is often the case, this structure itself can help standardize  		the care management intervention, leading to less variation in implementation  		across managers. Further, fidelity analysis allows participating plans to  		assess the degree to which components were carried out as specified, which can  		help the plan identify the areas of care management to focus on in their  		quality improvement efforts. While efforts to standardize care management  		interventions can be done without orthogonal design studies, conducting such a  		study forces plans to re-examine their processes of care and protocols, and can  		uncover unknown areas of confusion or misinterpretation concerning routine care  		and operations. The orthogonal design approach also encourages organizations to  		create a culture of learning by providing participants with a rigorous approach  		for testing out their new ideas.</p>
<p>This study also identifies some important difficulties with conducting  		orthogonal design studies in health care organizations. The types of variations  		in how care coordination is delivered studied here are likely to generate only  		moderate size effects on hospitalizations or ER use--that is, they are not  		strikingly different ways of delivering care coordination, but rather  		relatively minor twists. Furthermore, some of the interventions can only affect  		subsets of the enrollees (e.g., those with depression, those with a hospital  		admission), so the expected effect calculated over all enrollees is attenuated.  		To have adequate statistical power to detect such modest expected effects, a  		sizeable number of care coordinator units are needed because the variance of  		these outcomes across care coordinators is large. Without adequate power,  		statistically insignificant differences in outcomes between enhanced and  		routine versions of a care component cannot be taken as valid evidence that the  		routine (and typically less expensive) version of the intervention is just as  		effective as the enhanced version. Although the number of care coordinators  		(24) participating in this study exceeds the number used in some studies in  		other fields, it was not sufficient for this study due to the large variation  		in hospitalization rates and other key outcomes across coordinators. </p>
<p>The study also identifies how hard it can be to change the behavior of  		even dedicated health professionals. For each of the components, both the  		enhanced and routine care groups received the assigned component less often  		than specified in the study. Very few members received at least the minimum  		number of services (for example, contacts, post-discharge visits, screenings)  		as specified in the study protocol, and an even smaller percentage of members  		assigned to enhanced care received services at least as often as assigned. Even  		though this finding may have been due in part to under-reporting of services  		provided, the gap is so large that it seems likely that many patients did not  		receive the full complement of intended services, reflecting various barriers.  		The qualitative investigation of barriers to implementation is just as  		important for learning as estimation of the effects of the various  		enhancements.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Special needs plans (SNPs) were established in 2003 as part of the  		Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, with the goal  		of improving care for high-risk target populations of Medicare beneficiaries.  		There are three types of SNPs: (1) D-SNPs serving dual eligibles (those  		enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid); (2) C-SNPs serving beneficiaries with  		chronic conditions; and (3) I-SNPs serving beneficiaries residing in nursing  		homes (Health Net 2012). SNPs enrollment has more than doubled since 2006, with  		most members located in D-SNPs (Gold et al. 2011). </p>
<p>SNPs contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)  		to provide all covered Medicare services to beneficiaries with special needs in  		return for a monthly risk-adjusted capitation payment. Thus, SNPs have the  		incentive to engage in care management to help plan members reduce their need  		for expensive services, especially hospitalizations and emergency room (ER)  		visits (Grabowski 2009). SNPs are allowed to target enrollment to groups with  		distinct care needs and build a critical mass of beneficiaries with certain  		conditions, which allows them to tailor interventions to those members and  		conditions and helps them reduce hospitalizations and institutionalizations  		(CMS 2012). DSNPs use the flexibility of capitated payments to provide a mix of  		services and typically offered coordination activities, including assistance  		with care transitions, medication reconciliation, patient education, and  		patient assessment with respect to risk for hospitalization or nursing home  		placement (Schmitz et al. 2008; Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 2011).</p>
<h3>A. Background</h3>
<p>In a recent systematic review of complete models of care coordination  		programs, Au et al. (2011) determined that "no firm conclusions can be drawn at  		this time regarding what works best for whom in care coordination for adults  		with disabilities." In reviewing studies completed through 2010, the authors  		found only three high quality studies that identified effective programs. The  		first of these programs was Senior Care Options, an integrated Medicare and  		Medicaid managed care program for the elderly in Massachusetts that coordinated  		medical services, behavioral health services, prescription drugs, and long-term  		support services. This program produced a significant reduction in the rate of  		nursing home entry (Jen Associates 2008). The second was the Disease  		Coordinated Care for San Diego Seniors (ACCESS) Program, a guideline-based care  		management intervention for dementia featuring case management software and  		care recommendations provided to caregivers by care managers. This program  		achieved improvement in patient-reported health-related quality of life  		(Vickrey et al. 2006). In the third program, a treatment team for adults with  		severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) provided care management and access  		to a range of mental health and substance abuse services. This program achieved  		reductions in psychiatric inpatient admissions and hospital days (Mangrum  		2006). The above mentioned program targeted clients with co-occurring SPMI and  		substance use disorders. The dual-diagnosis treatment teams provided care  		coordination and access to a range of mental health and substance abuse  		services, including psychiatric services, individual therapy, and specialized  		groups tailored to client issues. Referring to the reviewed literature as a  		whole, the authors concluded that "information on specific features of [the]  		programs was frequently incomplete, or the features themselves were  		inadequately documented" (Au et al. 2011). </p>
<p>Even after rigorous evaluation methods (such as randomized trials) find  		a given intervention effective, programs often do not produce comparably  		favorable results when the intervention is repeated in other settings (due in  		part to differences in how the intervention was implemented). For example, in  		the last decade, several models of transitional care have been shown to be  		effective in reducing readmission rates (Naylor et al. 1999; Coleman et al.  		2006; Jack et al. 2009). However, less is known about how best to implement the  		various components. For instance, evidence shows that post-discharge follow-up  		helps reduce readmission rates, but there is little information about how  		quickly this follow-up visit needs to occur, how many times, and which  		protocols to use. Mahoney (2010) notes that the success of multi-component  		interventions depends on the features of the intervention, the methods used to  		engage patients and providers, and the target population for the intervention  		components, and illustrates this with findings from fall prevention  		studies.</p>
<p>SNPs vary greatly in their design and in the scope of services provided  		(Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 2011) due to the unique and varied needs  		of the beneficiaries and the diverse environment in which services are  		provided. Because great variation exists in how SNP services are provided, it  		is important to identify the effective intervention components, rather than  		focus on the effectiveness of an entire model of care. </p>
<p>Current evidence on best practices in care management for chronically  		ill Medicare beneficiaries offers some guidelines, but the results are  		suggestive, not conclusive, and may not be applicable to people with  		disabilities. Brown et al. (2012) showed that in randomized clinical trials,  		among 11 Medicare care coordination demonstration programs for beneficiaries  		with chronic illnesses, four decreased inpatient admissions in a high-risk  		subset of enrollees. The four programs that were successful in reducing  		hospitalizations differed from the seven unsuccessful programs on six key  		dimensions: (1) supplementing telephone calls to patients with frequent  		in-person meetings; (2) having an established relationship or opportunities for  		interaction with their patients' primary care providers; (3) acting as a  		communications hub for the providers seen by the patient; (4) delivering  		evidence-based education to patients, using motivational interviewing  		techniques or other proven behavior change approaches; (5) providing strong  		medication management, with more reliable sources of information about  		medications than simply patient self-reports; and (6) providing timely and  		comprehensive transitional care after hospitalizations. Although these features  		were found to be <i>correlated</i> with success, the authors were unable to  		ascertain the <i>causal</i> effects of intervention components because each  		program developed its own model. The key to designing the most effective--and  		the most cost-effective--package of care coordination services is to understand  		these building blocks and how to implement them. Efficient orthogonal designs  		that test the different ways of deploying each component of an intervention can  		be used to explore the best ways to operationalize complex interventions. </p>
<h3>B. About the Participants</h3>
<p>Participants in the study included care management staff and their  		noninstitutionalized members enrolled in two D-SNPs serving a general  		population with disabilities: (1) Care Wisconsin in Wisconsin; and (2) Gateway  		Health Plan in Pennsylvania.<sup><a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#note1">1</a></sup> Participants in  		the study were all members enrolled in care management at the two plans.  		Because there was such a small number of participating care managers at each  		individual plan, we randomized and analyzed the pooled set of care managers at  		the two plans--24 in total. Together, these 24 care coordinators served 1,562  		patients that were included in this study. </p>
<p>Gateway Health Plan is a large managed care organization that serves  		more than 305,000 Pennsylvanians. Gateway is a coordinated care plan with a  		Medicare contract and a contract with the Pennsylvania Medicaid program,  		serving members who quality for C-SNPs and D-SNPs (Gateway Health Plan 2012a).  		Gateway's D-SNP is one of the largest plans serving dually eligible members in  		the nation, with approximately 33,000 members across Pennsylvania (Gateway  		Health Plan 2012b). Assessments performed at intake separate members into two  		groups. Those considered lower risk receive services such as mailings,  		automated telephone calls, and outreach calls to ensure uptake of preventive  		health services, whereas several hundred high-risk members are served by seven  		care managers (five nurses and two social workers). Only these high-risk  		members receive care management services and are therefore a part of our study.  		During the study period, high-risk members were defined as those with the  		following diagnoses: (1) certain types of cancer; (2) head trauma; (3) chronic  		obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); (4) HIV; and (5) head injury or  		paralysis. At the time of the start of the study, about 700 members were  		enrolled in the care management program; therefore, the caseload was about 100  		members per care manager. Care managers provide telephonic care management to  		the high-risk members, as well as services such as regular contact, depression  		screening, and review of members' care plans. All members are assigned  		needs-based goals; those who achieve their goals "graduate" from the program  		and cease to receive care management services. The average member receives care  		management for 4-5 months before exiting the care management program. </p>
<p>Care Wisconsin is a nonprofit care management organization providing  		services for low-income, frail elders and adults with developmental or physical  		disabilities; it specializes in the integration of health and long-term care  		services (Care Wisconsin 2013). Through two programs, Family Care and  		Partnership, the plan serves more than 4,800 members across ten counties in the  		south-central region of Wisconsin, and has more than 340 full-time and  		part-time employees. At the start of the study, care management was provided  		both by phone and in person as part of the Partnership program. The care  		management services included assessments, goal setting and review of care  		plans, regular contacts with members, screenings for the risk of falls and  		depression, and assistance with the transitions between care settings. Each  		member receives care management services from an interdisciplinary team each  		made up of a nurse practitioner, a registered nurse, a social worker with a  		master's degree, and a service coordinator. The 1,200 members enrolled in Care  		Wisconsin receive care management services and are served by 17 care teams,  		with each team assigned approximately 80 members.<sup><a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#note2">2</a></sup> Members received medical services from the nurse  		practitioner in collaboration with the member's primary care physician (PCP)  		and primary care clinic. </p>
<h3>C. Roadmap to the Report</h3>
<p>In <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#component">Section II</a>, we review intervention  		components tested as part of the study. In <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#design">Section III</a>,  		we describe the study design and analysis methods. We present results from a  		quantitative impact analysis in <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#finding">Section IV</a>, and in  		<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#analysis">Section V</a> we present the results of the implementation  		analysis. Finally, in <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#discuss">Section VI</a>, we discuss our  		findings and conclusions.</p>
<h2><a name="component" id="component">II. INTERVENTION COMPONENTS</a></h2>
<p>The intervention components selected for the study were developed in  		close collaboration with participating plans. The aim of this collaboration was  		to select components that were grounded in research, were considered clinically  		meaningful, had the potential to improve outcomes for members served by SNPs,  		were of interest to the plans, and were feasible to implement. In addition to  		the in-person meeting held in October 2010 at the National Health Policy Group  		offices (home of the SNP Alliance) in Washington, DC, we engaged in weekly  		calls to seek feedback from the plans about how best to define the details of  		each tested alternative and how to instruct the care managers to implement each  		alternative. We used an iterative process to synthesize the comments and  		concerns from plans. This collaborative process yielded the final list of  		components to test.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we identified ten intervention components with two  		alternatives for each, one representing routine care at the plans and another  		representing enhanced care. Although we started with a long list of  		interventions, conversations with participating plans revealed interest in the  		following key areas of care management: (1) routine contacts; (2) screenings  		for depression and the risk of falls; (3) review of the member's care plan; (4)  		member coaching and education; and (5) management of care transitions from  		hospital to home.</p>
<p>Before the start of the study, we provided participating care managers  		with short documents that outlined their assignments (their combination of  		options). We also provided them with an implementation guide that included  		general information about the study such as study objectives, motivation, and  		outcomes analyzed as part of the study, and a detailed description of the two  		tested options for each of ten intervention components. We conducted several  		training sessions for the care managers during which we discussed the  		intervention components and the use of intervention tracking sheets, and  		answered care managers' questions.</p>
<h3>A. Description of Intervention Components</h3>
<p>We tested two alternatives for implementing the ten components of care  		management. Option <i>a</i> approximates routine care at the two plans, whereas  		Option <i>b</i> represents some enhancement over routine care. Because routine  		care differed somewhat between the two plans, the study protocol specified what  		routine care should be for the duration of the study. The tested options  		constitute <i>how</i> and not <i>whether</i> care management is provided. For  		ethical reasons, we did not test any options that would require a member to  		receive <i>less</i> care than he or she would have received in the absence of  		the study. Rather, we tested what approximates routine care against an enhanced  		version of a given service. In addition, care managers participating in the  		study were instructed not to withhold a service that they believed a member  		needed to receive. For example, if a given member was to receive a minimum of  		four routine contacts during the study according to her risk level, but her  		care manager believed that she needed additional contacts, the care manager was  		instructed to provide more contacts. In other words, both routine and enhanced  		care options provided guidance for the minimum service that needed to be  		provided, but care management staff continued to use their clinical judgment to  		provide services beyond the specified minimum. In <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableII.1">Table  		II.1</a>, we present a brief description of both tested options, and in  		<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#appendA">Appendix A</a>, <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableA.1">Table A.1</a>, we  		provide a more detailed description of routine practices. This description  		includes what we learned about routine practices both before the study, but  		also after the study, during conversations with plan staff. Below is a  		description of the enhanced care options for each intervention.</p>
<p>For the ten components, we studied options such as how often the  		component is provided, and which procedures or protocols are used for  		implementing it. The components we examined include routine contacts with  		members, screening for the risk of falls and referral to fall prevention  		programs, depression screening and referral, member education and coaching, and  		management of care transitions. For example, for the care transitions  		component, we tested the effectiveness of contacting members within three  		business days after discharge from an inpatient setting, versus an enhanced  		option that adds an additional contact within seven days of the first  		follow-up. Components are numbered from 1 to 11, skipping 8. Component 8 was a  		"dummy" component (one that was not specified or implemented). We were  		interested to see whether this dummy component would be found to be associated  		with as significant difference in outcomes, since no such difference should  		occur. Inclusion of this component in the analysis does not affect the  		estimates of impact of other components.</p>
<p><b>Frequency-of-Routine Contacts and Medication Reviews (Component  		1)</b>. An integral component of care management services is routine contacts  		between the care manager and member, during which the care manager assesses the  		member's health; helps the member manage his or her medications, appointments,  		and other health care needs; and coaches and educates the member. To explore  		whether more frequent routine contacts and medication review might improve  		member outcomes, enhanced care increased the required minimum frequency of  		contact and medication review (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableII.1">Table II.1</a>). Because  		the actual frequency of contact depends on members' needs, the minimum  		frequency specified was determined by the member's risk, which was assessed  		using data on the member's recent use of hospital and ER services and the  		number of chronic conditions they had. Plans update member's risk information  		on a quarterly basis. Care managers were instructed to use the most current  		information available at any time to determine whether a patient was high-risk  		or low-risk, which in turn determined the required minimum frequency-of-routine  		contacts they were to receive. For example, low-risk members are supposed to be  		routinely contacted at least once every three months at the two participating  		plans. As part of enhanced care Option <i>b</i>, we tested whether requiring  		contacts and medication review at least once every two months would improve  		member outcomes. Because Care Wisconsin provides some in-person contact, this  		intervention addressed overall frequency, taking into account both in-person  		and telephonic contact. Because additional in-person contacts are very resource  		intensive, the additional contacts introduced as part of the enhanced care  		option were intended to be mainly done over the telephone. Gateway provides all  		care management services telephonically.</p>

</tr></table><p><b>Screening for the Risk of Falls (Components 2 and 3)</b>. Many dual  		eligibles and members with chronic disabilities are at high-risk of falls that  		may decrease mobility, reduce socialization, and increase fear of future falls  		(Mahoney 2010). In enhanced care of Component 2, care managers were assigned to  		screen all members three times during the study, using a screening tool each  		time. The screening tool assessed risk based on 12 dimensions:  		dizziness/fainting, balance problems, sensory problems, medication risk,  		cognitive problems, environmental hazard concerns, gait and mobility problems,  		endurance problems/weakness, pain/joint problems, general risks, falls history,  		and medical problems. Upon administering the screening tool either in person or  		over the phone care managers were instructed to score it according to  		guidelines provided. As part of the routine care, care managers implemented  		screening for the risk of falls as-needed and did not use a formal screening  		tool. As part of Component 3, care managers were instructed to refer members at  		a moderate or high-risk of falls to a fall prevention program. Under routine  		care, care managers referred members identified as high-risk to available fall  		prevention programs, whereas under care managers assigned to enhanced care sent  		members an educational letter in addition to making referrals. The letters  		informed members of their level of falls-risk and included a pamphlet that  		outlined several common causes of falls, and illustrated some strategies for  		members to follow to help reduce the risk of falls. </p>
<p><b>Screening for Depression (Components 4 and 5)</b>. Depression is  		often found in chronically ill or disabled populations, and its symptoms may  		decrease members' ability to address health care concerns. As part of Component  		4, we examined whether use of a longer versus shorter depression screening tool  		produced better outcomes. Care managers assigned to routine care screened  		members for depression using the two-question Patient Health Questionnaire  		Two-Question Instrument (PHQ-2) tool, whereas those assigned to enhanced care  		used the Patient Health Questionnaire Nine-Question Instrument (PHQ-9). We  		hypothesized that use of a shorter instrument might allow care managers to  		screen more members. In Component 5, we investigated whether screening for  		depression more frequently and sending a letter with screening results to  		members' PCPs improved health outcomes. Under routine care, care managers  		conducted depression screenings at least once every six months, whereas care  		managers under Option <i>b</i> conducted depression screenings at least once  		every three months. Under enhanced care, care managers also sent a letter  		encouraging mental health follow-up to the primary care providers of members  		who screened positive for depression. The letters informed providers that their  		members had screened positive and included the score from the PHQ-2 or PHQ-9.  		All members screened positive for depression using any tool were referred for  		mental health intervention as per routine care.</p>
<p><b>Frequency of Review of Care Plan (Component 6)</b>. Care managers  		maintain care plans customized to each member, containing medical histories,  		health goals, and other items relevant to care management. The purpose of care  		plan reviews is to update health information and add, remove, or reorient  		goals, including personal experience goals, based on members' progress and  		emerging needs. Intervention Component 6 explored whether more frequent care  		plan reviews improved members' health outcomes. Care managers assigned to  		routine care reviewed care plans as-needed or per current protocol, which was  		described by the two plans prior to the start of the study as being less  		frequently than the enhanced care option (<i>b</i>) requiring review at least  		once per quarter.</p>
<p><b>Method Used to Coach and Educate Members (Component 7)</b>. We  		investigated whether assigning care managers to use the teachback method to  		instruct and coach members resulted in better health outcomes than relying on  		care managers' personal communication approach. Care managers assigned to  		Option <i>b</i> used the teachback method, which requires members to confirm  		understanding by repeating back instructions. The teachback method was  		developed by clinicians at the Iowa Health System as a test of how well a given  		concept is explained and understood. This method is intended to help service  		providers identify explanations and communication strategies most commonly  		understood by patients. The instructions should be clarified and repeated until  		the member is be able to correctly describe what they are going to do in their  		own words. Instructions about how to implement the teachback method were  		adapted from <a href="http://www.nchealthliteracy.org">http://www.nchealthliteracy.org</a>.  		Under routine care, care managers continued to assess members' understanding of  		instructions and coaching in the same way they had done so in the past. </p>
<p><b>Number of Post-Discharge Follow-Ups (Component 9) and Informing the  		PCP of Discharge (Component 10)</b>. Three intervention components addressed  		the management of care transitions, widely recognized as a particularly  		vulnerable time for members with chronic conditions. Care managers are well  		positioned to ensure members make a smooth transition to home from the  		hospital, a skilled nursing facility, or a rehabilitation facility.  		Intervention Component 9 explored whether more frequent contacts in the days  		following discharge helped reduce readmissions. Under enhanced care, care  		managers contacted members within 2-3 business days post-discharge and again  		within seven days of the first follow-up. Under routine care, care managers  		contacted members within three business days post-discharge. For both options,  		post-discharge follow-up could be conducted via telephone or in person and  		included a medication review. Because primary care providers often do not learn  		about a member's hospitalization in a timely manner, Component 10 explored  		whether outcomes improved if members' primary care providers were informed of a  		discharge both by letter and by telephone compared to being informed by letter  		alone. Routine care only required care managers to send written notification.  		Under enhanced care, care managers informed members' primary care provider of  		discharge by letter and also either spoke directly to office staff or left a  		voicemail message. </p>
<p><b>Formal Post-Discharge Follow-Up (Component 11)</b>. Post-discharge  		follow-up with a member is an essential component of transitional care (Naylor  		et al. 1999; Coleman et al. 2006; Jack et al. 2009). The goal of post-discharge  		follow-up is to ensure that there are processes in place to enable a successful  		recovery. For example, it is important that members understand their discharge  		instructions, make appointments with their PCPs, and take proper medications in  		proper doses. Intervention Component 11 was designed to test whether members  		who receive structured follow-up are less likely to be readmitted compared to  		those who receive informal follow-up. Care managers assigned to enhanced care  		used a structured checklist in conjunction with the CTM-3 instrument to guide  		their follow-up interviews with members. We adopted CTM-3 from Eric Coleman's  		Care Transitions Intervention (Coleman et al. 2006). The CTM-3 asks members if  		hospital staff took their preferences into account when planning for discharge,  		if the members have a good understanding of their post-discharge health  		management responsibilities, and if they understand the purpose for taking each  		of their medications. Care managers were asked to administer the CTM-3 before  		the checklist to learn of members' familiarity with post-discharge  		instructions, including prescribed medications and home activities. The  		structured checklist was intended to guide the care manager to cover the key  		topics, including medication management, medical care follow-up, and red flags  		(such as potential adverse drug reactions). Care managers randomized to  		enhanced care also engaged in a brief group discussion with their colleagues  		and supervisor about how to: (1) get the most out of each item on the  		checklist; (2) activate and engage the member; and (3) leave room for  		open-ended questions and active listening outside the structure of the  		checklist. Care managers assigned to routine care were asked to rely upon their  		routine follow-up strategies without using the checklist. </p>
<p>Note that several of the components tested are related to each other,  		which could result in interactive effects that could reduce or enhance first  		order effects. For example, we tested two fall prevention intervention  		components, two depression screening components, and three post-discharge  		components. The orthogonal design ensures that the estimates of the first order  		effects are unbiased--that is, half of the care managers assigned to Option  		<i>a</i> of Component 4, for example, are assigned to Option <i>a</i> of  		Component 5, while the other half are assigned to Option <i>b</i> for Component  		5. In some designs, the multiple components in a single area may make it more  		difficult to detect these first order effects, if interactive effects of the  		two components either offset or enhance the impacts. However, the number of  		care managers engaged in the study was sufficient to ensure that main effects  		of any component are confounded only with three-level and higher-order  		interactions of other components. We discuss this further in <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#design">Section III</a>. We also addressed this concern by testing for  		whether the effects of related components were jointly equal to zero. None of  		these tests indicated that these multiple components addressed to a particular  		aspect of care coordination were masking important effects.</p>
<h3>B. Hypotheses</h3>
<p>We expected that more frequent routine contacts and medication reviews  		with members would help care managers identify and address developing health  		concerns, and could therefore reduce inpatient admissions and ER visits. We  		expected more frequent and structured screening for the risk of falls was  		targeted at reducing ER use and possibly some admissions. We expected frequent  		and more formal depression screening of all members would allow care managers  		to identify members with a reduced capacity to address health care needs due to  		depressive symptoms. Identifying depressive symptoms might help prevent health  		care crises and reduce ER visits and readmissions. We also anticipated that a  		more frequent review of care plans would allow care managers to identify gaps  		in provided care, which might reduce use of hospital and ER services. Use of  		the teachback method was aimed at improving understanding of instructions and  		self-management, with a goal of reducing unnecessary readmissions and ER visits  		(<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableII.2">Table II.2</a>).</p>

</tr></table><p>Care transitions intervention components were aimed primarily at  		reducing readmissions, although they also might affect ER visits that occur  		soon after discharge from an inpatient setting. Two post-discharge follow-ups  		(rather than one) and keeping members' PCPs apprised of members' discharge may  		help to ensure that members understand discharge instructions, take proper  		medications at proper doses, and receive needed care, which in turn may reduce  		readmissions.</p>
<h2><a name="design" id="design">III. STUDY DESIGN AND ANALYSIS METHODS</a></h2>
<h3>A. Study Design</h3>
<p><i><b>1. Efficient Orthogonal Design</b></i></p>
<p>In this study, we simultaneously tested the comparative effectiveness of  		alternative ways of implementing multiple intervention components, using an  		efficient orthogonal design. This design is well-suited for evaluating and  		refining care management models for three reasons: (1) it allows the plan to  		specify the variation in how key components of the model are implemented,  		whereas such variation would otherwise occur haphazardly; (2) it can produce  		rigorous results about the effectiveness of several components of care  		management in a single study; and (3) if adequately powered, it allows  		evaluators to assess directly whether more resource-intensive components yield  		sufficient improvement in outcomes to warrant the investment. Compared with a  		traditional randomized control trial, orthogonal design allowed us to test  		several intervention components with fewer implementers. </p>
<p>We used a two-level efficient orthogonal design method in which we  		tested two alternatives for each intervention component: routine care (Option  		<i>a</i>) and enhanced care (Option <i>b</i>). We then used an algorithm to  		generate a specific set of combinations of <i>a</i>'s and <i>b</i>'s that  		constitute an orthogonal design for the number of intervention components to be  		tested. Combinations of different component options include sequences such as  		<i>aabaa</i>, <i>bbaaa</i>, <i>ababa</i>, and so on. Care managers were each  		randomly assigned to a specific combination of options. </p>
<p>Due to the random assignment of care managers to combinations of  		component options, the relative effect of Option <i>a</i> versus Option  		<i>b</i> for any intervention component can be estimated by simply comparing  		the mean outcomes for care managers assigned to <i>a</i> to the mean for those  		assigned to <i>b</i>. If no difference in outcomes is found between routine and  		enhanced care options for a given component, this finding is still very  		meaningful if the study has adequate statistical power. If intervention  		components were implemented as intended, a finding of "no difference" in  		outcomes for members who were assigned to receive Option <i>a</i> versus Option  		<i>b</i> indicates that the more intensive component did not show an  		improvement in outcomes over the less intensive component. A finding of "no  		difference" is an important one because it indicates that it may not be  		fruitful to adopt a more expensive option. However, a finding of no difference  		in outcomes between routine and enhanced care options might also happen if: (1)  		the routine care option was not sufficiently different from the enhanced care  		option specified by design at the outset of the study; and/or (2) the routine  		care option was not different from the enhanced care option as implemented.</p>
<p>The standard methods of computing statistical power for clustered  		designs in randomized controlled trials can be used to compute power for  		orthogonal designs. (See Zurovac and Brown [2012] and Zurovac et al. [2013] for  		an overview of orthogonal design methodology.) In clustered designs in which  		care managers are assigned to implement a given set of components for all of  		their members, power depends predominantly on the number of care managers (and  		not the number of members) involved in the study. In this study, we have  		limited power to detect differences between the two tested options--22-32  		percent of the mean--because only 24 care managers participated in the study.  		The precise power depends heavily on the variance in outcomes across care  		coordinators. We offer a more detailed discussion of when the finding of no  		difference can occur as well as a discussion of power in <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#finding">Section IV</a> (Study Findings) and <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#discuss">Section  		VI</a> (Discussion and Conclusions).</p>
<p>The key feature of these designs that ensures that the estimates are  		unbiased is orthogonality, meaning that the assigned combinations are  		independent of one another. In practice, this means that: (1) half of the care  		coordinators are assigned to Option <i>a</i> and half to Option <i>b</i> for  		each of the ten components being tested; and (2) of the care management staff  		assigned to Option <i>a</i> of Component 1, half are assigned to Option  		<i>a</i> and half to Option <i>b</i> for Component 2 and so on for all possible  		pairs of components. However, in efficient orthogonal designs, the effects of  		any single intervention component cannot be distinguished from the effects of  		some interactions of other components. The extent of such potential confounding  		depends on the number of care managers in the study relative to the number of  		components being tested. Because we used an efficient design (which means that  		the number of intervention components tested was large relative to the number  		of care managers), we were unable to estimate the interaction effects between  		components.<sup><a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#note3">3</a></sup> However, the number of care  		managers engaged in the study was sufficient to ensure that main effects of any  		component are confounded only with three-level and higher-order interactions of  		other components. The analyses in this report took an "intent-to-treat"  		approach in which component effects are computed by comparing outcomes of those  		assigned to the two options, regardless of whether or how thoroughly the  		options were actually delivered.</p>
<p><i><b>2. Randomization</b></i></p>
<p>In this study, 24 care managers were randomly assigned to implement a  		pre-specified combination of Options <i>a</i> or <i>b</i> for the ten  		intervention components (see <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#appendB">Appendix B</a> for more details  		on random assignment of interventions to each care manager). For example, care  		manager number 1 was assigned the combination <i>aabaaabbbab</i>. The  		combination contains 11 letters (denoting 11 options), one for each  		intervention component. The randomly assigned combinations of component options  		are in <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#appendB">Appendix B</a>, <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableB.1">Table  		B.1</a>.</p>
<h3>B. Data</h3>
<p>We used several data sources in this evaluation: administrative plan  		data, tracking tool data, and information obtained from discussions with care  		management staff. All member-level data sources were de-identified and  		contained only "mock" identifiers so that the members' data could be linked to  		care managers and intervention component assignments. </p>
<p>For the impact analysis, we used two sources of secondary data obtained  		from the participating plans: (1) de-identified claims data on members' service  		use and chronic conditions; and (2) de-identified data on members' demographic  		characteristics and risk level as assessed by each plan. We received final  		action claims for physician services and hospital use and dropped denied claims  		and laboratory claims from the construction of all variables. Laboratory claims  		were dropped because they were not needed for the construction of the analyzed  		outcomes or explanatory variables. It was important not to use laboratory  		diagnosis codes in the construction of chronic condition flags because these  		codes only denote what the laboratory tested, not whether a diagnosis was  		made.</p>
<p>We obtained one year of follow-up data that coincided with the period of  		implementation of the intervention components, May 16, 2011, through May 15,  		2012. We also obtained two years of baseline data, covering the period May 16,  		2009, through May 15, 2011. Data from the two plans were analyzed in the  		aggregate.</p>
<p>For the implementation analysis: we used data collected by the  		participating plans (using tracking tool sheets) to assess the fidelity to  		assigned component options and we conducted discussions with care management  		staff in order to understand how the intervention components were implemented.  		The tracking tools were designed to obtain information about provision of  		assigned components and options. In <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#sectionIII.D">Section III.D</a>,  		we further describe implementation analysis methods.</p>
<h3>C. Impact Analysis Methods</h3>
<p><i><b>1. Outcomes</b></i></p>
<p>We tested for differences in service utilization between members  		receiving routine care (Option <i>a</i>) and those receiving enhanced care  		(Option <i>b</i>). For the sample as a whole, we examined impacts on the  		following three outcomes: (1) number of inpatient admissions for any reason;  		(2) whether there was a readmission within 30 days of discharge (from medical  		stays and from any stay); and (3) number of ER visits. We examined impacts on  		readmissions for members hospitalized at least once during the follow-up, since  		members who were not hospitalized cannot be readmitted. We examined impacts of  		intervention components on outcomes over the 1-6, 7-12, and the full 1-12 month  		follow-up periods for all members. The program period spanned from May 16,  		2011, through May 15, 2012. Details for construction of each outcome are listed  		in <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableIII.1">Table III.1</a> below. </p>
<table border="1" title="TABLE III.1. Key Outcomes Analyzed in the Study"><tr><td colspan="2"><font><b><a name="tableIII.1" id="tableIII.1">TABLE III.1</a>. Key Outcomes Analyzed  			 in the Study</b></font></td>

</tr></table><p><i><b>2. Analyses</b></i></p>
<p>Before engaging in the analysis of impacts of enhanced care Option  		<i>b</i> over routine care Option <i>a</i> for each intervention component, we  		ran a test similar to a Heckman-Hotz test and graphed regression-adjusted mean  		outcomes for each care manager. In the results section, we show a brief  		descriptive analysis, including: (1) proportion of members who were randomized  		to each component option; (2) demographic characteristics of members enrolled  		in the study; and (3) use of hospital and ER services of enrolled members at  		baseline and at follow-up periods. Although we report results significant at  		the 10 percent level, we do not discuss or interpret these results in detail  		because they likely reflect noise in the data. For all statistical tests, we  		used a 5 percent level of significance. </p>
<p><b>Heckman-Hotz Test</b>. To assess whether the randomization was  		successful in ensuring the similarity of care managers at baseline, we ran a  		test similar to the Heckman-Hotz test in which we used regression analysis to  		assess whether outcomes (inpatient admissions and ER visits) measured one year  		before the study differed for those later assigned to routine care or to the  		enhanced care intervention option for each intervention component studied. As  		the intervention had not yet begun during that period, there should be no  		meaningful difference between the <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> groups in outcomes  		measured before the study. The regressions adjusted for all available  		member-level characteristics, including demographics (age, gender, race, rural  		or urban residence), chronic conditions, and mental conditions, as well as for  		outcomes measured two years before the study, from May 16, 2009, until May 16,  		2010. </p>
<p><b>Homogeneity Test</b>. Homogeneity is particularly important for  		efficient orthogonal designs because these designs often include relatively few  		observations (that is, care managers), so the results are particularly  		susceptible to outliers. Orthogonal designs assume that the implementers have  		relatively homogenous outcomes before the study; therefore, we assessed the  		similarity in outcomes for each care manager by computing regression-adjusted  		mean outcomes for each care manager. The outcomes were measured during the  		second year of the baseline period, from May 16, 2010, through May 16, 2011.  		Because the effects of differences among care managers in outcomes might be  		removed by regressors controlling for the measured differences between their  		members, we adjusted for all available member-level characteristics, including  		demographics (age, gender, race, rural or urban residence), chronic conditions,  		and mental conditions. Member-level observations were weighted by the inverse  		of the number of months enrolled in the plan.</p>
<p><b>Regression Analysis</b>. To test whether routine care (Option  		<i>a</i>) or enhanced care (Option <i>b</i>) of each component reduced the use  		of hospital and ER services, we used the follow-up data to compare the mean  		outcome over all members for care managers who provided Option <i>a</i> to the  		mean for members of those who provided Option <i>b</i>. In doing so, we used  		regression analysis with member-level data to achieve greater precision in  		estimates of intervention component effects and to control for any  		pre-intervention differences in member and care manager characteristics. The  		regressions produced robust Huber-White standard errors, which are robust to  		heteroskedasticity. We did not adjust for clustering because the estimated  		standard errors were more conservative without the adjustment. Member-level  		observations were weighted by the inverse of the number of months enrolled in  		the plan, which means that more weight was given to observations for members  		who were enrolled in the plan longer and thus had a greater exposure to the  		studied intervention components.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionIII.D" id="sectionIII.D">D. Implementation Analysis  		Methods</a></h3>
<p>To improve understanding of the impact analysis results, it is important  		to document how the components were implemented and to evaluate fidelity to the  		planned intervention. Discussions with participating care management staff were  		held in June-August 2012 (between one and three months after the intervention  		period ended, but before the analysis results were produced), to help explain  		why certain components were effective and others were not and to identify  		facilitators and barriers to implementation of any component options that were  		not implemented as planned. This is particularly important because a finding  		that routine care (Option <i>a</i>) and enhanced care (Option <i>b</i>) were  		equally effective for a component might lead us to conclude that the less  		expensive of the two options is just as effective as the more expensive one.  		However, if routine and enhanced care were not actually implemented fully, such  		an inference may be incorrect. </p>
<p><i><b>1. Analysis of Tracking Tool Data</b></i></p>
<p>Care Wisconsin plan helped design a paper tracking tool to help assess  		the fidelity to assigned intervention components. Care managers completed the  		tracking tool form after each contact with the members and recorded which  		components were provided. The tracking tool contained "bubbles," much like  		Scantron-style forms that care managers filled out to identify the component  		option provided during encounters. Plan staff transmitted de-identified data to  		Mathematica.</p>
<p>We analyzed the frequency with which intervention components were  		delivered and the fidelity to assignments by examining the following three  		measures: (1) proportion of members who received the assigned option at least  		once; (2) annualized number of times each intervention component or option was  		provided per member; and (3) proportion of members who received the option at  		least as often as assigned. In <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableIII.2">Table III.2</a>, we  		provide the details for construction of each of these measures. We also  		examined the percentage of members who refused a given component or option at  		least once. We analyzed the means for these three measures for the entire  		sample of members as well as individually for each plan. </p>

<p>Following the final day of implementation of the study, we conducted  		discussions with Gateway and Care Wisconsin care managers, care managers'  		supervisors, and plan leaders in order to understand how the components were  		implemented and which facilitators and barriers they faced. The secondary  		objective was to improve our understanding about how care management is usually  		delivered at each plan, apart from the study intervention components.</p>
<p>Although conversations were informal, we used a set of discussion  		questions to guide our discussions with the plan staff. In advance of  		discussions, we presented the staff at the plans with the list of questions.  		The questions covered five broad topics: (1) care management services at the  		plan; (2) the health care policy environment and how it affected the care  		management program during the study period; (3) study components; (4)  		challenges to implementing the study in general; and (5) standard practices at  		each plan and how they differed from study components. </p>
<p>We asked the care manager supervisors and plan leaders whether federal  		guidance or policy changes may have affected the care management program during  		the study period. We solicited staff input on challenges to implementing  		specific intervention components, and staff feedback on how intervention  		components may be used in the future. We asked how intervention components  		could be improved, what challenges were posed by each component, and what  		leaders thought about adopting study components in the future. We asked about  		challenges to implementing the study in general. In terms of the study's effect  		on care manager workloads, we asked whether organizational changes affected  		implementation, and solicited their thoughts on future participation in similar  		studies. Finally, we asked about standard practices at each plan and how they  		differed from study components. We inquired whether standard practices changed  		during the study and how the organization alters care management activities  		based on member risk levels. To fill our gaps in understanding how care  		management is delivered, we inquired about which services are provided and how  		and inquired about the roles and responsibilities of care managers. We also  		asked whether the study received organizational support, which aspects of the  		study were easy or difficult to implement, and how organizational changes  		affected implementation.</p>
<h2><a name="finding" id="finding">IV. STUDY FINDINGS</a></h2>
<h3>A. Quantitative Impact Analysis Findings</h3>
<p><i><b>1. Descriptive Statistics</b></i></p>
<p>We identified 1,562 dually eligible SNP members as the study population  		at the time the study commenced, on May 16, 2011. Care Wisconsin had 956  		members in the study, served by 17 teams of care managers, whereas the 606  		members at Gateway were served by seven care managers. The population as a  		whole was composed of older adults, contained more women than men, and was  		largely Caucasian; further, about the same proportion lived in rural and urban  		areas. Use of hospital and ER services was high both at baseline and follow-up,  		consistent with the high-need study population of dual eligibles with special  		needs. </p>
<p>As shown in <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableIV.1">Table IV.1</a>, 56 percent of the study  		population was over the age of 64, and nearly 71 percent were female. About  		three-quarters identified as Caucasian and 15 percent as African American.  		Members were similarly allocated between rural (46 percent) or urban (40  		percent) areas. Nearly 85 percent of participating members had been enrolled in  		a SNP for the entire baseline year; the more recent enrollees were evenly split  		between those enrolled for five or fewer months and those enrolled for between  		six and 11 months. As expected, the study population had a high incidence of  		chronic conditions, especially diabetes (43 percent), depression (35 percent),  		heart failure (27 percent), and COPD (25 percent). During the year before the  		study (baseline), 47 percent of members experienced an inpatient admission, 55  		percent had an ER visit, and 14 percent experienced a readmission within 30  		days of hospital discharge (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableIV.2">Table IV.2</a>). </p>
<p>Gateway members enrolled in the study were younger, less likely to be  		newly enrolled, and less healthy than those at Care Wisconsin. As seen in  		<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableIV.1">Table IV.1</a>, 39 percent of Gateway members were over  		the age of 64, compared to 66 percent of Care Wisconsin members. As might be  		expected of Care Wisconsin's older population, members there displayed higher  		incidence of Alzheimer's and cataracts than did Gateway members. These  		descriptive data showed that Gateway provides care management to a very  		high-risk population: its population was more likely to have all other chronic  		conditions we identified using claims data, including COPD, depression, and  		diabetes. Due to differences in member characteristics, the effects of  		alternative options may have differed by plan. Although we could not estimate  		the effects of alternative options for each plan individually, we controlled in  		regression analyses for which plan the observation came from. We estimated  		intervention effects under the assumption that these effects were equal for the  		two plans after controlling for patient characteristics and plan. Furthermore,  		Gateway members were more likely to have psychiatric health conditions,  		including depressive disorders, but much less likely to have Alzheimer's.  		Outcomes at baseline (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableIV.2">Table IV.2</a>) are largely in line  		with this assessment, as Gateway members averaged more than double the number  		of ER visits and inpatient admissions and had 2.5 times more readmissions to a  		hospital within 30 days of discharge.</p>

<p>Because orthogonal designs assume that implementers have relatively  		homogeneous outcomes before the study, we assessed the similarity in outcomes  		for the care managers by computing regression-adjusted mean outcomes for each  		of them. We graphically show mean outcomes for each care manager in  		<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#figureIV.1">Figure IV.1</a>, <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#figureIV.2">Figure IV.2</a>  		and <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#figureIV.3">Figure IV.3</a> for the number of inpatient  		admissions, ER visits, and proportion of members with medical readmissions  		(readmission for any reason following a medical admission).</p>
<p>At baseline, the members had an average of 1.07 inpatient admissions,  		marked with a blue-dotted line in <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#figureIV.1">Figure IV.1</a>. One  		standard deviation of the mean is marked with a green-dotted line. Overall,  		there were few outliers for member outcomes across care managers. To account  		for the few differences that we identified, the regression analyses in which we  		analyzed the relative effectiveness of enhanced care and routine care options  		controlled for care manager-level average outcomes at baseline. </p>

</tr></table><p>Many observations were close to the mean and were not as dispersed as  		one would expect if the underlying distribution were normal. There was one  		outlier that may be of concern, with an average of 2.6 admissions per  		member--double the mean for the group overall. However, that care manager, like  		other care managers whose members had many admissions, was from Gateway, such  		that differences seen in the graph below are mostly due to differences between  		the two plans rather than to differences between individual care managers. In  		other words, the care manager with 2.6 admissions per member does not stand out  		among the Gateway care managers as much as he or she does from the Care  		Wisconsin care managers. Thus, controlling for which plan a care manager comes  		from should account for this disparity. A similar pattern is observed for  		proportion of members with medical readmissions (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#figureIV.2">Figure  		IV.2</a>) and proportion of members with any readmissions (not shown).

</tr></table><p>These graphs show that variation in outcomes across care managers was  		large. Although the number of care coordinators (24) participating in this  		study exceeds the number used in some studies in other fields, it did not  		provide sufficient power for this study, due to the large variation in  		hospitalization rates across coordinators. Without adequate power,  		statistically insignificant differences in outcomes between enhanced and  		routine versions of a care component cannot be taken as valid evidence that the  		routine (and typically less expensive) version of the intervention is just as  		effective as the enhanced version.</p>
<p><i><b>3. Heckman-Hotz Test Results</b></i></p>
<p>We ran a test similar to the Heckman-Hotz test in which we assessed  		whether outcomes measured one year before the study (between May 16, 2010, and  		May 15, 2011) differed between members assigned to routine and enhanced care  		options for each studied intervention component. Given that the intervention  		had not yet begun during that period, there should be no meaningful difference  		in outcomes between the routine and enhanced care groups. With few exceptions,  		the results suggest no pre-existing differences in outcomes between routine and  		enhanced care groups. The number of inpatient admissions differed at the 5  		percent level of significance between members assigned to routine and enhanced  		care in Component 1, frequency of contacts. For readmissions following  		admissions for any reason, no component was associated with statistically  		significantly different outcomes. Detailed regression results are shown in  		<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#appendC">Appendix C</a>, <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableC.1">Table C.1</a>.</p>

</tr></table><p>The results presented in this section refer to the effectiveness of  		options as assigned; in other words, these results do not take into account  		that some options were not always provided as assigned. In  		<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#sectionV.A">Section V.A</a>, we analyze the fidelity to intervention  		components by using tracking tool data and discuss implementation in light of  		the feedback received from care managers. In <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#discuss">Section VI</a>,  		we briefly outline the impact analysis findings and interpret them based on the  		results of tracking tool analyses and findings from our conversations with care  		managers. </p>
<p>We found a statistically significant difference at the 5 percent level  		in outcomes between the routine care and enhanced care options for few  		components. There was no difference in the number of inpatient admissions  		between routine and enhanced care for any intervention component. We found  		fewer ER visits, on average, for members who were assigned to receive: (1) a  		higher (than the existing standard) minimum frequency for routine contacts and  		medication review; and (2) routine care practices for member education (rather  		than use of the more intensive teachback method).<sup><a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#note4">4</a></sup> We also found that the likelihood of medical  		readmissions was lower for members assigned to receive a more frequent care  		plan review. However, none of the three enhanced care options that focused on  		reducing readmissions (Components 9, 10, and 11) was found to be more effective  		than the routine procedures used by the plans. Sensitivity analysis showed that  		results did not change materially if any single care manager or care team  		assigned to provide intervention components was dropped from the analysis.  		(Results not shown.) Below, we discuss the findings by component in more  		detail.</p>
<p><i><b>5. Regression Analysis Results for Each Component</b></i></p>
<p><b>Frequency-of-Routine Contacts and Medication Reviews (Component  		1)</b>. Members who were assigned to receive a higher minimum number of routine  		contacts and medication reviews had fewer ER visits than those assigned to a  		lower minimum number. Members assigned to receive more frequent routine  		contacts and medication review averaged 1.7 ER visits, whereas those assigned  		to receive less frequent contacts had nearly two ER visits on average per  		person (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableIV.3">Table IV.3</a>). Therefore, by instituting a  		higher minimum frequency of contacts and medication review, the plan could  		reduce ER visits by 16 percent (p=0.03).<sup><a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#note5">5</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Falls-Risk Screening (Components 2 and 3)</b>. Members who were  		assigned to receive regular falls-risk screening with an instrument did not  		have different outcomes compared with those who were assigned to informal  		screening (done as-needed without an instrument). Similarly, members assigned  		to be sent a letter with screening results and a pamphlet on how to avert falls  		did not have different outcomes from those who were assigned not to be sent a  		letter.</p>
<p><b>Screening for Depression (Components 4 and 5)</b>. Members who were  		assigned to be screened for depression once every three months did not have  		different outcomes compared with those assigned to receive twice yearly  		screenings. Members for whom care managers were to use a nine-item instrument  		(PHQ-9) did not have different outcomes compared with those for whom a two-item  		instrument (PHQ-2) was to be used. </p>
<p><b>Frequency of Care Plan Review (Component 6)</b>. Members who were  		assigned to receive quarterly care plan reviews did not have different outcomes  		compared with members assigned care plan reviews as per routine practice (less  		frequent reviews). </p>
<p><b>Method Used to Coach and Educate Members (Component 7)</b>. Members  		assigned to receive routine care practices in coaching and educating had fewer  		ER visits than members assigned to receive the teachback method. During the  		follow-up year, members whose care managers used routine care practices while  		coaching and educating had an average of 1.67 ER visits, whereas those assigned  		to the teachback method had 1.94 ER visits (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableIV.3">Table  		IV.3</a>). This means that using routine practice (versus the teachback method)  		was associated with 14.9 percent more ER visits (p=0.045). Members assigned to  		routinely used practices did not have different admission or readmission rates  		compared with those for whom the teachback method was to be used. </p>
<p><b>Number of Post-Discharge Follow-Ups (Component 9)</b>. Members who  		were assigned two post-discharge follow-ups did not have better outcomes than  		those assigned one follow-up. </p>
<p><b>Informing PCP of Members' Discharge (Component 10)</b>. Members for  		whom care managers were assigned to inform the PCP of discharge via telephone,  		in addition to by letter, did not have better outcomes than those whose PCPs  		were to be informed via a letter.</p>
<p><b>Formal (versus informal) Post-Discharge Follow-Up (Component 11)</b>.  		Members who were assigned to receive a formal post-discharge follow-up with an  		instrument and a checklist did not have better outcomes than those assigned to  		an informal follow-up.</p>
<p><i><b>6. Regression Analysis Results at First and Second Six-Month  		Follow-Up</b></i></p>
<p>We also estimated the effect of components on all members at the first  		and the second six-month follow-ups to assess whether enhanced options may have  		influenced outcomes early on but then dissipated, or whether they took several  		months to take effect. We found a few statistically significant results at the  		5 percent level that appeared in one period or the other but not both (detailed  		results not shown). At the first six-month follow-up, members assigned to more  		frequent falls-risk screening with an instrument were more likely to be  		readmitted following a medical discharge than those assigned to routine care;  		at the second six-month follow-up, the enhanced care group was less likely to  		be readmitted following a medical discharge. The finding is most likely  		anomalous in that periodic falls-risk screening is not expected to affect the  		likelihood of readmission. </p>
<p>At the first (but not the second) six-month follow-up, members assigned  		to receive coaching with the teachback method had more ER visits than those  		assigned to routine practices, a finding that accords with the results for the  		year-long follow-up. It is possible that care managers improved their skills in  		using the teachback method over time. At the first (but not the second)  		six-month follow-up, more frequent care plan reviews were associated with a  		lower likelihood of readmission, in line with the findings for the year-long  		follow-up. </p>
<h2><a name="analysis" id="analysis">V. IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS</a></h2>
<h3><a name="sectionV.A" id="sectionV.A">A. Fidelity Analysis Using Tracking  		Tool Data</a></h3>
<p>Enhanced care options introduced more frequent provision of an existing  		service and/or practices that qualitatively enhanced care. In most cases, care  		managers assigned to enhanced care options were making several changes to their  		routine practices. Given the relative absence of statistically significant  		results, we assessed the extent to which care managers implemented the routine  		and enhanced care options as planned (as part of the study protocol); that is,  		care managers' actual routine care practices may differ from routine care  		practices as specified in the study protocol. Further, care managers might not  		have implemented enhanced care practices successfully. For example, we were  		interested to see whether routine care may have been more intensive and  		enhanced care less intensive than prescribed in the study protocol, which would  		lead to routine and enhanced options being too similar, that is, routine and  		enhanced care may not be meaningfully different from each other. We analyzed  		fidelity to interventions quantitatively by using tracking tool information and  		conducting qualitative discussions with plan staff. </p>
<p>We analyzed the fidelity to assignments by using: (1) the percentage of  		members who received the assigned option at least once (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.1">Table V.1</a>); (2) the annualized number of times each option  		was provided per member per year (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.2">Table V.2</a>); and (3)  		the percentage of members who received a given option at least as often as  		assigned (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.3">Table V.3</a>). We also computed the percentage  		of members who refused a given component or option at least once (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.1">Table V.1</a>). We tracked refusals only for falls-risk  		screening, depression screening, and post-discharge follow-up. Given that we  		analyzed outcomes for both plans in aggregate, and the same training procedures  		regarding the study were used for both plans, we focused on the fidelity to  		assigned intervention alternatives for both plans combined. Overarching lessons  		from implementation analysis are needed to interpret regression analysis  		findings, which also analyze the two plans together.<sup><a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#note6">6</a></sup> For more details on fidelity for each plan  		separately, see <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.1">Table V.1</a>, <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.2">Table  		V.2</a>, <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.3">Table V.3</a>, and <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#appendD">Appendix  		D</a>. </p>
<p>Following the final day of implementation, we conducted discussions with  		Gateway and Care Wisconsin care management staff and plan leaders, with the  		goal of understanding how the components were implemented and identifying the  		facilitators and barriers to implementation experienced by care managers. We  		reached all seven Gateway care managers and two leaders. Although we were  		unable to speak directly to care managers at Care Wisconsin, four leaders  		relayed care managers' feedback and provided their own perspectives. In  		<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#appendD">Appendix D</a>, we present detailed feedback we received  		about each tested alternative.</p>

<p><i><b>2. Falls-Risk Screening (Components 2 and 3) </b></i></p>
<p><b>Analysis of Tracking Tool Data</b>. Care managers assigned to provide  		three screenings per member per year screened twice as many members as those  		assigned to screen members as-needed (52.1 percent versus 25.9 percent). The  		screenings revealed that many members were at risk of falls; such members were  		referred to fall prevention programs (20.8 percent for routine care and 25.7  		percent for enhanced care) (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.1">Table V.1</a>).</p>
<p>Care managers assigned to screen members three times during the study  		performed 0.65 screenings compared with 0.36 screenings per member per year  		among those assigned to perform as-needed screenings. However, the number of  		screenings fell below the assigned three screenings per member per year (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.2">Table V.2</a>). Less than 2 percent of members underwent  		screening three times per year (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.3">Table V.3</a>).</p>
<p><b>Summary of Conversations with Care Managers</b>. Care managers at  		Gateway found the falls-risk screening instrument to be useful. Care managers  		at Care Wisconsin believed that the screening was redundant because the plan  		already provides similar service through other staff (i.e., not the care  		managers). Staff at Gateway found the letters to members burdensome to  		generate; staff at both plans did not believe that the letters impacted  		members' outcomes. </p>
<p><i><b>3. Screening for Depression (Components 4 and 5) </b></i></p>
<p><b>Analysis of Tracking Tool Data</b>. Approximately 62.5 percent of  		members assigned to twice yearly screening were screened for depression versus  		74 percent of those assigned to quarterly screening (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.1">Table  		V.1</a>). Approximately 64.3 percent of members assigned to screening with  		PHQ-2 were screened, and 58.1 percent of members assigned to be screened with  		PHQ-9 were screened.</p>
<p>Although care managers assigned to perform quarterly screenings  		conducted more screenings compared to care managers assigned to twice yearly  		screenings, the number of screenings fell short of the frequency specified in  		the study protocol; it was approximately 1.1 and 1.4 among those assigned to  		twice yearly and quarterly screening, respectively (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.2">Table  		V.2</a>). Care managers assigned to twice yearly screenings reached 27.4  		percent of members at least that often, whereas those assigned to quarterly  		screenings reached only 6.2 percent of members at least quarterly (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.3">Table V.3</a>). </p>
<p><b>Summary of Conversations with Care Managers</b>. Care Wisconsin  		leaders reported that they plan to adopt PHQ-9. Gateway care managers felt that  		depression screening was difficult for care managers without a background in  		mental health and that members sometimes experienced difficulty opening up  		about sensitive matters. Care managers believed that the depression screening  		component enabled them to identify and refer more members to appropriate care  		than before the study. Care managers did not believe that sending screening  		results letters to PCPs was effective.</p>
<p><i><b>4. Frequency of Care Plan Review (Component 6) </b></i></p>
<p><b>Analysis of Tracking Tool Data</b>. Care plan reviews were provided  		to a greater percentage of members than most other components, except routine  		contacts. Care managers assigned to a less frequent care plan review screened  		77.1 percent of members compared with 72.8 percent of members for care managers  		assigned to enhanced care (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.1">Table V.1</a>). Care managers  		assigned to perform more frequent care plan reviews provided fewer reviews than  		those assigned to perform a routine number of reviews, 2.6 versus 2.8 times per  		member per year (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.2">Table V.2</a>). Care managers assigned to  		provide quarterly reviews performed that many reviews for approximately 27.6  		percent of members (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.3">Table V.3</a>).</p>
<p><b>Summary of Conversations with Care Managers</b>. We learned from plan  		staff that the routine care guidance for the number of care plan reviews  		differed at the two plans (see <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#appendA">Appendix A</a> for details).  		Plan staff were confused about how often to review the care plan (for both  		routine and enhanced care) and what a review entailed. </p>
<p><i><b>5. Method Used to Coach and Educate Members (Component 7)  		</b></i></p>
<p><b>Analysis of Tracking Tool Data</b>. The proportion of members who  		received the teachback method was much lower than the proportion of members for  		whom care managers adhered to routine coaching methods, 39.3 percent versus  		74.5 percent (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.1">Table V.1</a>). Care managers used the  		teachback method 1.3 times per member per year and routine coaching practices  		3.7 times per member per year (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.2">Table V.2</a>). Additional  		analysis of tracking tool data showed that only about 6 percent of members  		received the teachback method when routine care was assigned (results not  		shown). </p>
<p><b>Summary of Conversations with Care Managers</b>. Care managers and  		leaders at the plans liked the teachback method very much, although some care  		managers experienced difficulty in using the method. Others reported that the  		teachback method improved communication with members. Given that the routine  		coaching method for some care managers was the teachback method, such care  		managers recorded use of the routine method when they in fact relied on the  		teachback method.</p>
<p><i><b>6. Number of Post-Discharge Follow-Ups (Component 9) </b></i></p>
<p><b>Analysis of Tracking Tool Data</b>. We found that 38.5 percent of  		discharged members assigned to one post-discharge follow-up received at least  		one follow-up compared to 31.1 percent of those assigned to two follow-ups (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.1">Table V.1</a>). Paradoxically, care managers assigned to two  		follow-ups provided fewer follow-ups per member than did those assigned to one  		follow-up--0.45 versus 0.75 follow-up per member discharged per year (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.2">Table V.2</a>). Only 2.7 percent of members assigned to two  		follow-ups received at least that many (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.3">Table V.3</a>).</p>
<p><b>Summary of Conversations with Care Managers</b>. Care managers and  		plan leaders believed that the additional follow-up was useful in theory even  		though some care managers found it difficult to conduct the second follow-up  		because calls were time consuming and members difficult to reach. </p>
<p><i><b>7. Informing PCP of Members' Discharge (Component 10) </b></i></p>
<p><b>Analysis of Tracking Tool Data</b>. PCPs were informed of members'  		discharge for about 40 percent of discharged members regardless of whether the  		care manager was assigned to provide notification by telephone and letter or by  		letter only (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.1">Table V.1</a>). PCPs were notified of a  		discharge slightly more times by telephone--0.80 versus 0.74 times per member  		per year (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.2">Table V.2</a>). Care managers notified PCPs by  		telephone and letter and by letter only for every discharge for a similar  		proportion of members, 21.6 percent and 23.2 percent, respectively (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.3">Table V.3</a>).</p>
<p><b>Summary of Conversations with Care Managers</b>. Although care  		managers notified PCPs of members' discharge, they did not believe that such  		notification added value to members' health.</p>
<p><i><b>8. Post-Discharge Follow-Up with and Without an Instrument and  		Checklist (Component 11) </b></i></p>
<p><b>Analysis of Tracking Tool Data</b>. Approximately 31.8 percent of  		members received follow-up without an instrument and checklist (routine care)  		compared to 24.7 percent who received follow-up with an instrument and  		checklist (enhanced care) (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.1">Table V.1</a>). Care managers  		provided fewer post-discharge follow-ups per member to those assigned to  		enhanced care than to those assigned to routine care, 0.41 and 0.60 per member  		per year, respectively (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.2">Table V.2</a>).</p>
<p><b>Summary of Conversations with Care Managers</b>. The study prompted  		plans to develop and incorporate into their routine care a checklist inspired  		by the one used in the study. Care Wisconsin care managers felt that the CTM-3  		should be administered before, rather than after, member discharge from the  		hospital.</p>
<h3>B. Implementation Analysis: Care Managers' Feedback on  		Implementation Challenges</h3>
<p>Plan leaders and care managers also provided feedback on study  		implementation, including implementation challenges in general (for example,  		the effect of the study on care manager workloads) as well as the influence of  		organizational changes on study implementation. In addition, they provided  		feedback on how local, state, or federal initiatives or policy changes may have  		affected the study.</p>
<p><i><b>1. Lessons Learned</b></i></p>
<p>Plan staff reported that the study enabled learning and improvements,  		namely: (1) the study facilitated learning and improvements; and (2) staff at  		both plans recognized the need to track provision of intervention  		components.</p>
<p><b>The Study Facilitated Learning and Improvements</b>. The study  		prompted Care Wisconsin to adopt some of the processes and tools used in the  		study. Care Wisconsin leaders reported that the falls-risk screening as part of  		the study prompted them to consider training care managers in falls-risk  		assessment. (As part of routine care at Care Wisconsin, a nurse performs an  		in-person evaluation of mobility, safety, and functional status on each member.  		Falls-risk screening by care managers would be done in addition to the  		screening by nurses.) Care Wisconsin will adopt the PHQ-9 for depression  		screening in routine care going forward because care managers were more  		comfortable with a nine-item instrument compared to lengthier instruments used  		at the plan before the study, and felt the two-item PHQ-2 alternative was too  		limited. Care Wisconsin has developed a care transitions intervention that  		includes use of a structured checklist similar to the one implemented as part  		of the study. In addition, the plan is considering adoption of a second  		post-discharge follow-up as routine practice.</p>
<p>The study introduced additional structure to care management processes  		at Gateway. Gateway leaders stated that they plan to adopt structured processes  		for the provision of care management activities. For example, under routine  		practice, care managers use clinical judgment regarding when to contact members  		and which topics to discuss during contacts. Intervention Component 1, by  		contrast, instructed care managers on how often to contact members based on  		member risk and required them to include medication reviews during every  		contact with members. Similarly, falls-risk screening is routinely done for  		some members as deemed necessary by care managers and without following a  		specific protocol, whereas the study introduced formal screening with an  		instrument over prescribed intervals (quarterly). Care managers were receptive  		to the more structured processes and shared the opinion of the leaders that  		more structure would be useful. Gateway leaders also noted that they are  		considering providing additional training to care managers to help them better  		assess members' depression. </p>
<p><b>Staff at Both Plans Recognized the Need to Track Provision of  		Intervention Components</b>. Both plans employed a tracking sheet for care  		managers to complete every time they contacted a member and every time they  		provided a given intervention component. After the year-long implementation,  		staff at the two participating plans noted that spreadsheets would have  		provided a better structure to track provision of intervention components than  		the tracking sheets developed for this study because spreadsheets could be used  		by care managers to track which members were due for a given intervention.  		Gateway care managers believed that using a spreadsheet to track timing and  		activities would have been a superior alternative to the tracking sheets. At  		Care Wisconsin, some care managers did successfully institute a  		spreadsheet-based tracking system. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Feedback About Study Implementation</b></i></p>
<p>Plan leaders and care managers found that: (1) study implementation  		became easier over time, in terms of both implementing intervention components  		and completing a tracking sheet; (2) buy-in of care management staff was  		essential for the success of the study; (3) plans were able to successfully  		transition new staff to replace care managers who left the plan; and (4) there  		were higher-than-expected costs associated with study implementation.</p>
<p><b>Implementation Became Easier for Staff Over Time</b>. Plans found  		that burdens placed on staff due to study implementation decreased over time as  		support systems were put in place. Leaders indicated that study-specific  		workload was manageable after the first few months of the study.</p>
<p>Care managers at both plans experienced some difficulties integrating  		tracking sheets into day-to-day activities, albeit for different reasons. At  		Gateway, care managers sometimes forgot to fill out tracking sheets after  		speaking with members. Three care managers at Gateway described the tracking  		sheet process as burdensome and indicated that it reduced productivity. In  		contrast, care managers at Care Wisconsin got used to using the tracking tools  		and found them easy to complete. </p>
<p>Staff at both plans developed strategies to help care managers with  		implementation. Gateway required care managers to fill out tracking sheets in a  		cubicle dedicated to study activities. Gateway involved a project manager to  		assist staff with activities such as generation of letters to member and PCPs,  		completion of tracking sheets, and facilitating communication with Mathematica.  		Similarly, Care Wisconsin involved a staff member to help with the scanning of  		tracking tool sheets and to communicate with Mathematica research staff.  		Leaders indicated that they should have planned for dedicated project  		management time at the beginning of the study.</p>
<p>To monitor when service provision was due, some care managers at both  		plans developed informal ways of logging which members received a given  		alternative. Leaders at both plans found that feedback from care managers was  		very important in developing the informal tracking system; they noted that they  		should have sought the feedback from care managers earlier in the process. A  		Care Wisconsin leader felt that tracking spreadsheets helped care managers with  		implementation. </p>
<p><b>Buy-In of Care Management Staff was Essential for Success of the  		Study</b>. Leaders worked to earn buy-in from concerned staff by discussing  		intervention component feasibility and familiarizing staff with the study.  		Although leaders at both plans experienced difficulty gaining staff buy-in  		before intervention components were finalized, Mathematica's training sessions  		were very useful in this process. However, leaders noted that it may have been  		useful to have Mathematica researchers return to review these items midway  		through the study period. Gateway leaders believe it may have helped to invite  		care managers who have participated in similar studies in the past to reassure  		staff and gain buy-in. </p>
<p><b>Both Plans were able to Successfully Transition New Staff into the  		Study</b>. At Gateway, one care manager went on maternity leave and another  		retired during the study period. In both cases, leadership transitioned a new  		care manager to take over the department staff member's caseload and conduct  		interventions for his or her members. A leader at Care Wisconsin stated that  		staffing changes were handled by incorporating study training into new staff  		orientation.</p>
<p><b>There were Higher-than-Expected Costs Associated with Study  		Implementation</b>. Plan leaders described costs as "low" or "modest." However,  		Care Wisconsin leaders felt that they should have asked for financial support.  		For Care Wisconsin, burden took the form of time commitments, training, and  		sending forms. Both plans experienced unanticipated expenses due to study  		participation, including printing materials and assigning staff to support data  		entry. </p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<h3>A. Interpretation of Impact Analysis Findings</h3>
<p>In this section, we interpret the impact analysis findings in light of  		the results of the quantitative fidelity analysis and use the findings from the  		conversations with care managers to provide greater depth of understanding.  		First, we discuss the results that show significant differences in outcomes  		and, second, examine the results that point to no difference between routine  		and enhanced care options. </p>
<p><i><b>1. Results Showing Significant Differences in Outcomes  		</b></i></p>
<p><b>Over the full year of follow-up, much more frequent medication  		reviews, in conjunction with slightly more frequent contacts among the enhanced  		care group, were associated with 16 percent fewer ER visits</b>. Members  		assigned to enhanced care received slightly more contacts and many more  		medication reviews (38 percent) than members assigned to routine care. The  		additional contacts may have allowed care managers to identify and address  		emerging health issues before they became urgent or severe enough for members  		to seek emergency care. Brown et al. (2012) identified frequent contacts and  		strong medication review as two of six approaches practiced in effective care  		management programs that cut readmissions for high-risk patients. Even though  		we observed no favorable effects for the number of inpatient admissions, the  		plans learned that the implemented number of contacts and reviews were more  		effective than routine practices and would allow them to reduce expenditures on  		ER visits by 16 percent. The effect on the number of ER visits among members  		hospitalized at least once was even higher. This suggests that targeting those  		hospitalized at least once before adopting a higher number of contacts for all  		members may be more effective. </p>
<p><b>Over the full year of follow-up, use of the teachback method to coach  		members was associated with 15 percent more ER visits, possibly because members  		assigned to teachback likely received less coaching overall</b>. The percentage  		of members receiving the assigned alternative was much lower for those assigned  		to the teachback method than for those assigned to routine care (39.3 percent  		versus 74.5 percent) as was the number of times coaching used teachback versus  		routine methods (1.3 versus 3.7 times per member per year). Routine practices  		(versus the teachback method) may have been more effective in reducing ER  		visits simply because many more members assigned to routine practices received  		any kind of coaching. Even though care managers liked the teachback method very  		much, some care managers experienced barriers with the method. Further, impact  		analysis suggested that members assigned to teachback had more ER visits only  		at the second (but not the first) six-month follow-up; therefore, it is  		possible that care managers improved their skills in providing the teachback  		method over time, indicating that more training was needed than provided during  		the study in the use of the teachback method. Both plans plan to schedule  		further training of care managers in the teachback method. </p>
<p>Results for outcomes measured over the 1-6 and 7-12 month periods were  		similar to those for the full period, suggesting that most of the enhanced  		options neither influenced outcomes early on but then dissipated, nor that they  		took several months to take effect. One exception is that assigning members to  		more frequent falls-risk screenings with an instrument increased their  		likelihood of readmission following a medical discharge as compared to those  		assigned to routine care; at the second six-month follow-up, the finding was  		reversed. These findings are most likely anomalous in that periodic falls-risk  		screening is not expected to affect the likelihood of readmission.</p>
<p><i><b>2. Results Showing No Significant Differences in Outcomes  		</b></i></p>
<p>We found no difference in any outcomes between enhanced care and routine  		care for the following tested options: (1) falls-risk screening three times  		yearly versus as-needed; (2) fall prevention referral letter versus no letter;  		(3) quarterly depression screening versus twice yearly screening; (4) use of  		PHQ-9 versus PHQ-2; (5) more frequent care plan review; (6) two versus one  		post-discharge follow-ups; (7) informing PCPs of members' discharge via  		telephone versus letter only; and (8) use of an instrument and checklist during  		post-discharge follow-up versus use of no tools. We observed no difference in  		the number of inpatient admissions between routine and enhanced care options  		for any implemented intervention component. Care managers at both plans  		strongly believed that one particular component did not improve member  		outcomes--informing PCPs about members' discharge. They believed notifications  		were not useful whether they were done by telephone or letter. </p>
<p><b>Although it may seem disheartening that many enhanced care options  		did not affect the outcomes of interest, a finding of no difference is  		meaningful because it can guide improvements in program efficiency</b>. If  		intervention components were implemented as intended, a finding of no  		difference in outcomes for members who received routine and enhanced care  		indicates that the more intensive alternative did not improve outcomes over the  		less intensive option. Such a finding suggests that it is not worth the extra  		cost of adopting the more expensive option. However, a finding of no difference  		in outcomes between routine and enhanced care options might have also been  		attributable to any one of the following reasons. </p>
<ul><li>
<p>The routine care option may not have differed sufficiently from  			 enhanced care as specified at the outset of the study. </p>
<ul><li>Care Wisconsin indicated that the more frequent screening for the  				risk of falls (Components 2 and 3) with the use of an instrument was in fact  				similar to the falls-risk screening routinely provided.</li>
<li>Conversations with care managers revealed confusion about how  				often to review a care plan (Component 6) and what is involved in a plan  				review.  </li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>The enhanced care option may not have been implemented in a manner  			 that distinguished it sufficiently from the routine care option because it was  			 not implemented consistently or fully. For some components, the routine care  			 option appears to have been delivered to more patients or more intensively than  			 the enhanced version. </p>
<ul><li>Although members assigned to receive enhanced care received more  				depression screenings than those assigned to routine care, the number of  				screenings fell far short of the assigned frequency. </li>
<li>One might expect improved outcomes among those assigned to one  				post-discharge follow-up (Component 9) because, as shown in the tracking  				analysis, such individuals were more likely to receive a follow-up and in fact  				did receive a slightly greater number of follow-ups per person. However, we did  				not find improved outcomes in either group, perhaps indicating that the  				difference between the two groups in the proportion receiving several  				follow-ups was not sufficiently large to generate detectable effects.</li>
<li>Although post-discharge follow-up with an instrument and a  				checklist (Component 11) was qualitatively more intensive, care managers  				performed fewer follow-ups with the instrument/checklist.  </li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Effects of some components that apply to only a subset of members  			 are more difficult to detect than effects of components that apply to all  			 members.</p>
<ul><li>For care transitions components (Components 9, 10, and 11), only  				hospitalized members were eligible; therefore, the power to detect effects for  				these interventions is even lower (although not markedly so, given that the  				number of care managers is the main determinant of power, rather than the  				number of patients). Similarly, for fall prevention referral (Component 3),  				only members who screen positive for the risk of falling are eligible to be  				referred.  </li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>It is possible that a given enhanced care component might show  		improvements in outcomes if the plan provides more resources to implement and  		monitor these changes (such as hire more staff or provide support to current  		staff). For example, although post-discharge follow-up with an instrument and a  		checklist (Component 11) was qualitatively more intensive, care managers  		performed fewer follow-ups with the instrument/checklist, possibly because it  		took them longer to perform follow-ups using a protocol.</p>
<p><i><b>3. Despite No Significant Differences in Outcomes, Several  		Enhanced Care Options Were Viewed as Useful or Otherwise Showed Promise  		</b></i></p>
<p>The more frequent screening for the risk of falls (Components 2 and 3)  		with the use of an instrument had no impact on the outcomes of interest for  		both plans together; however, it is possible that such screening benefitted  		Gateway members. Even though care managers assigned to screen members three  		times per year (enhanced care) screened a greater proportion of members (25.9  		percent versus 52.1 percent) and performed many more screenings per member per  		year as compared to care managers assigned to as-needed screenings (0.36 versus  		0.65), routine care proved as effective as enhanced care. </p>
<p>Depression screening under the enhanced care alternatives (Components 4  		and 5) was not associated with different outcomes; however, use of the shorter  		instrument allowed the plans to screen more members. More frequent and  		formalized depression screening might have had an effect on intermediate  		outcomes by identifying a greater number of depressed members who were then  		referred to therapy, perhaps helping the affected individuals overcome their  		depression and improve their well-being. In the absence of access to data on  		quality of life outcomes, we were unable to discern whether such effects  		occurred. Care managers believed, however, that they were able to identify more  		cases of depression and refer members to appropriate care. One motivation for  		testing the two-question instrument (PHQ-2) was to determine whether more  		members would be screened with PHQ-2 versus to PHQ-9 because the former takes  		less time. Indeed, fidelity analysis showed that slightly more members were  		screened with PHQ-2 (64.3 percent versus 58.1 percent). Use of either  		instrument was not associated with different outcomes. However, as noted by  		some care managers, it is possible that PHQ-2 was not as sensitive in detecting  		depressive symptoms as the longer PHQ-9. As Care Wisconsin adopts PHQ-9, it  		should keep in mind that a substantial fraction of patients was not screened at  		all when PHQ-9 was the required instrument.</p>
<p>Even though requiring two post-discharge follow-ups (Component 9) was  		not associated with different outcomes, Care Wisconsin is planning to adopt the  		second post-discharge follow-up as routine care. Evidence presented earlier on  		the number of contacts showed that a greater number of contacts reduced ER  		visits among hospitalized members. Therefore, second post-discharge follow-ups  		may prove helpful to such members.</p>
<p>Even though care managers at both plans found the use of an instrument  		and checklist post-discharge (Component 11) to be highly useful, fewer members  		assigned to follow-up with the instrument/checklist actually received that  		follow-up compared to the proportion assigned to routine follow-up who received  		some follow-up contact (24.7 percent versus 31.8 percent). This difference may  		explain why formal follow-up was not associated with improved outcomes.  		Nonetheless, our study suggests that use of follow-up checklist might benefit  		members because: (1) though insignificant, the size of the effect is large; (2)  		care managers and plan leaders believed that the component was beneficial; and  		(3) the approach is consistent with the proven transitional care interventions  		developed by Naylor (2004) and Coleman (2006). Care Wisconsin is considering  		adoption of the checklist for routine use.</p>
<h3>B. Limitations</h3>
<p>The main limitations of this study are the limited power to detect  		differences between the component options, the need to analyze outcomes for  		both plans in the aggregate, and the limited exposure of some members to  		components, which might have undermined the detection of impacts. Further,  		given the many comparisons (for several outcomes over several periods and for  		several components) between enhanced and routine care, some of the few  		statistically significant findings may have resulted from chance. The  		implementation results indicate that there was incomplete reporting by the care  		coordinators on their activities. We also found that, for two components, the  		routine care option did not differ meaningfully from enhanced care as specified  		at the outset of the study. </p>
<p>Only 24 care managers/teams participated in the study, and true  		differences between routine and enhanced care options would have had to be  		quite large (22-32 percent of the mean outcome) for it to have been highly  		likely to observe statistically significant differences in our sample. To  		obtain even this many care managers, we needed to "pool" the care managers from  		the two programs and treat them all as if they were all homogeneous. We  		estimated intervention effects under the assumption that these effects were  		equal for the two plans after controlling for patient characteristics and which  		plan the member belonged to. </p>
<p>It therefore may have been even more difficult to detect differences  		between the tested options because 30 percent of the Gateway sample did not  		receive the interventions for long. Members in the Gateway plan were not  		enrolled in care management for the full (one year) duration of the study,  		since members who reach their goals "graduate" from the program and cease to  		receive care management services. On average, members received care management  		for 4-5 months. Further, it is possible that exposure to intervention  		components for even a full year was not long enough for outcomes to change.  		However, because we are analyzing a high-risk population and intervention  		components that are not likely to have cumulative effects, one year should be  		long enough for many analyzed components and outcomes to show effects. </p>
<p>Given that we performed many comparisons between enhanced and routine  		care, it is possible that even the few statistically significant differences  		observed resulted from chance. The number of significant differences was about  		what would be expected by chance for the 80 comparisons (two outcomes were  		analyzed for ten components for all members over three periods and two outcomes  		for ten components for hospitalized members). Thus, it is unclear whether these  		represent true effects or differences due to chance. A joint test of whether  		all enhanced versus routine care differences were zero could not be rejected,  		indicating that some or all of the observed differences were likely to be due  		to chance rather than to the interventions. This also indicates that as a  		group, enhanced components did not have a different effect on measured outcomes  		than routine practices. </p>
<p>The findings from the implementation analysis of the tracking data may  		be flawed by incomplete reporting by the care coordinators on their activities.  		Care managers at both plans experienced some difficulties integrating tracking  		sheets into day-to-day activities, which indicates that future studies should  		consider other ways to track fidelity, such as via electronic health records.  		In the related Brand New Day orthogonal design study, the plan collected such  		information as part of the electronic health record. </p>
<p>For two components, the routine care option did not differ sufficiently  		from enhanced care as specified at the outset of the study, so one cannot tell  		whether an enhanced version of services for a given component was more  		effective from the routine care. For example, conversations with care mangers  		revealed that there was confusion about how often to review a care plan  		(Component 6) and what is involved in a plan review, which is an important  		finding for the participating plans. The multiplicity of routine care practices  		and a lack of understanding of what is involved in these practices illustrate  		that sharp differences between studied options can be hard to define.</p>
<p>For three components, the enhanced care option was not implemented in a  		manner that distinguished it sufficiently from the routine care option because  		it was not implemented consistently or fully or because routine care was more  		intensive as delivered compared to routine care guidelines. This is, however,  		not a limitation, but rather, an important finding in itself. The analyses in  		this report took an "intent-to-treat" approach in which component effects are  		computed by comparing outcomes of those assigned to the two options, regardless  		of whether or how thoroughly the options were actually delivered. The study did  		not include overzealous monitoring to make certain that the assigned  		interventions are implemented because such oversight was not planned to be  		introduced into the ongoing programs at the two plans. Rather, standard  		supervisory measures at the two plans continued to test the components in a  		"real-world" environment with the currently available resources, rather than in  		a strictly controlled setting. Thus, the finding that a given component was not  		implemented suggests the need to identify the factors that limit case managers'  		willingness or ability to implement the planned intervention components.</p>
<h3>C. Conclusions</h3>
<p>In this study, we find that a great majority of routine practices  		concerning falls-risk screening and fall prevention referral, depression  		screening frequency and use of screening tools, frequency of care plan review,  		number of post-discharge follow-ups, mode of PCP referral of members'  		discharge, and use of an instrument and checklist during post-discharge  		follow-up at the two plans work as well as alternative practices in reducing  		hospitalizations and ER use. However, there were a few exceptions. Requiring a  		higher versus lower minimum frequency of contacts was associated with fewer ER  		visits. Yet, surprisingly, teachback method was associated with more ER visits  		than the routine coaching method. This finding is likely attributable to the  		fact that care managers were not sufficiently familiar with the teachback  		method, making it less effective than the routine approach. Fidelity analysis  		showed that members assigned to routine care received more coaching than those  		assigned to the teachback method. More thorough training in the teachback  		method might yield better results. Both plans' care managers and leaders  		believed that use of the teachback method was particularly helpful. </p>
<p>Members did not experience fewer inpatient admissions, ER visits, or a  		lower likelihood of readmission when their care managers were assigned to  		provide enhanced approaches versus routine care management approaches to  		falls-risk screening, depression screening, care plan reviews, and care  		transitions. Some findings of no difference in outcomes may be attributable to  		an enhanced care option that, in design or in implementation, turns out not to  		be noticeably different from the routine care option. For example, the fidelity  		analysis showed that the enhanced and routine care groups received  		approximately the same number of post-discharge follow-ups, consistent with  		care managers reporting having difficulties conducting the second follow-up  		because calls were time consuming and members difficult to reach. Although  		post-discharge follow-up with an instrument and a checklist was qualitatively  		more intensive and reported as useful by care managers because it provided  		structure, care managers assigned to the instrument/checklist performed fewer  		follow-ups, so it is not surprising that we observed similar outcomes for  		routine and enhanced care groups on this intervention component. </p>
<p>Plan staff felt that the study provided an opportunity for learning and  		introducing improvements such that both plans have adopted principles, and  		processes used in the study. Despite the findings that outcomes were not better  		for the enhanced version of most of the components tested, the participating  		plans have nonetheless decided to adopt some of these enhancements. Plans'  		decisions to adopt these enhancements were made before the results on relative  		effectiveness of enhancements were available to them, and were therefore based  		solely on their experience with the options. We found that both plans' care  		managers and leaders believed that use of the teachback method was a useful and  		appealing innovation; the two plans intend to train all care managers in the  		method before requiring its routine use. In addition, Care Wisconsin intends to  		implement the PHQ-9 instrument for depression screening because it was shorter  		than the tools used at the plan before the study and because community  		clinicians were familiar with it. Care Wisconsin is considering training care  		managers in falls-risk assessment. Care Wisconsin has also developed a  		post-discharge tool similar to one used in the study and is considering  		adoption of a second post-discharge follow-up because of positive feedback from  		care managers and because both these enhancements are believed to be helpful to  		members. Gateway noted that the study introduced more structure in routine  		contacts, falls-risk screening, and care transitions management, which it  		considers to be valuable and intends to continue. In addition, the plan intends  		to train care managers in depression screening. For both plans, the study  		highlighted the need to track the services delivered by care managers.</p>
<h3>D. Implications for Policy and Practice</h3>
<p>When implementing an orthogonal design study, it is important to ensure  		adequate power to detect differences between tested options. In clustered  		designs (such as the one we used in this study) in which care managers are  		assigned to implement a given set of components for all their members, power  		depends predominantly on the number of care managers. Further, if given  		outcomes are analyzed for a subset of members (such as hospitalized members),  		the power to detect impacts is even lower.</p>
<p>Although it is important to analyze the fidelity to assigned  		alternatives in order to interpret the results of their effectiveness, it is  		also important not to enforce fidelity unless enforcement is intended to be a  		part of the intervention during and after the study (if interventions are  		incorporated into routine practices). One criticism of traditional randomized  		trials is that interventions are studied in highly controlled rather than in  		real-world settings. Effectiveness of an intervention should be studied in the  		way they would be implemented on an ongoing basis--that is, in real-world  		conditions. So, if care managers do not implement a given alternative during  		the study, it's an equally good reason not to adopt that alternative as if it  		had not improved outcomes. In addition, the fidelity and effectiveness results  		should be interpreted in light of feedback received from the implementers. It  		is possible that a given component was ineffective and implemented rarely  		simply because training was insufficient, as it might have been the case with  		the teachback method.</p>
<p>An important benefit of an orthogonal design study, as we have seen from  		the reaction of the participating plans, might be the structure and consistency  		of expectations about interventions that it provides. Rather than providing  		only general training and guidelines to care managers on how to manage  		patients, care managers are told precisely how they are expected to implement  		each of the components of care management that are being tested. When routine  		care is not well defined or when the way routine care is implemented differs  		across care managers differs, this structure itself can help standardize the  		care management intervention, leading to less variation in implementation  		across managers. Further, fidelity analysis allows participating plans to  		assess the degree to which components were carried out as specified, which can  		help the plan identify which areas of care management to focus on in their  		quality improvement efforts. The orthogonal design approach also encourages  		organizations to create a culture of learning by providing participants with a  		rigorous approach for testing out their new ideas.</p>
<p>However, the study also identifies some important difficulties with  		conducting orthogonal design studies in health care organizations. The types of  		variations in how care coordination is delivered studied here are likely to  		generate only moderate size effects on hospitalizations or ER use. To have  		adequate statistical power to detect such effects, a sizeable number of care  		coordinator units are needed, because the variance of these outcomes across  		care coordinators is large. Without adequate power, statistically insignificant  		differences in outcomes between enhanced and routine versions of a care  		component cannot be taken as valid evidence that the routine (and typically  		less expensive) version of the intervention is just as effective as the  		enhanced version. Although the number of care managers (24) participating in  		this study exceeds the number used in several other studies, it was not  		sufficient to detect impacts in this study unless they were quite large (22-32  		percent), due to the large variation in hospitalization rates across care  		managers.</p>
<p>The study also illustrates how hard it can be to change the behavior of  		even dedicated health professionals. For each of the components, both enhanced  		and routine care groups received the assigned intervention components less  		often than specified in the study. Very few members received at least the  		minimum number of services (for example, contacts, post-discharge visits,  		screenings) as specified in the study protocol, and an even smaller percentage  		of members assigned to enhanced care received services at least as often as  		assigned. Even though this finding may have been due <i>in part</i> to  		under-reporting of services provided, the large discrepancy between planned and  		delivered interventions suggests that care managers face various barriers to  		providing services as intended. Some of the barriers reported by care  		management staff include high caseloads, difficulty tracking provided component  		options, and multiple organizational changes occurring during the study period  		that were unrelated to the study. For example, plan staff indicated that they  		had developed informal ways of logging in which members received a given  		alternative to help them keep track. An automated way of tracking provision of  		services may have helped care managers focus on the provision of services.  		Further, although plans recognized the need to track provision of intervention  		components, some care managers found filling out tracking sheets burdensome. We  		found this qualitative investigation of barriers to implementation to be just  		as important for learning as estimation of the effects of the various  		enhancements. </p>

<p>In this study, 24 care managers were randomized to implement either  		Option <i>a</i> or <i>b</i> for each of ten intervention components.

The combination contains 11 letters (denoting  		ten options), one for each intervention component. Component 8 was a "dummy"  		component (one that was not specified or implemented). We were interested to  		see whether this "dummy" component (one that was not specified or implemented)  		would prove to have an impact on outcomes, where no such impact should occur.  		Due to the orthogonal design, inclusion of this dummy component in the analysis  		does not affect the estimates of impact of other components. The randomly  		assigned combinations of component options can be found in <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableB.1">Table B.1</a>. The analyses in this report took an  		"intent-to-treat" approach, in which component effects are computed by  		comparing outcomes of those assigned to the two options, regardless of whether  		or how thoroughly the options were actually delivered.</p>

</tr></table><p>This study was designed using the Plackett-Burman 12 experimental design  		with a foldover. Plackett-Burman is an efficient orthogonal design, meaning the  		number of intervention components tested was large relative to the number of  		care managers. The major limitation of this design is that it is of resolution  		III, meaning any component's main effects are confounded with all two-component  		interactions that do not involve that component. For example, the main effect  		for Component 1 might be confounded with Components 2 and 3, Components 3 and  		5, and so on. In order to mediate this problem and at the same time take  		advantage of the efficiency of the design, we utilized a complete foldover.  		This means that the assignment of component options in one half of the  		assignment grid was the mirror-image of assignments in the other half. The  		mirror-image effect can be seen in <a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableB.1">Table B.1</a>, as  		assignment 13 offers the opposite options as assignment 1. The foldover design  		doubled the number of "runs" for each component Option and changed the design  		to resolution IV. As a result, confounding remained only for three-way or  		higher-order interactions, which are more negligible than are two-component  		interactions.</p>
<p>The proportion of all members assigned to receive the enhanced care  		option was close to 50 percent for each option, although some outliers existed  		at the plan level because randomization was not stratified by plan. For  		example, at Gateway, 24 percent of members were assigned to more frequent  		depression screening (Component 5b), 26 percent were assigned to two  		post-discharge follow-ups (Component 9b), and 37 percent were assigned to be  		screened with PHQ-9 (Component 4b). The complete breakdown can be found in  		<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableB.2">Table B.2</a>.</p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="appendD" id="appendD">APPENDIX D. ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK FROM CARE  		MANAGERS</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we provide more detailed discussion of the feedback we  		received from care managers with regard to the implementation of each  		intervention component.</p>
<p>Implementation of intervention components and alternative options varied  		between care managers at the two participating plans. Gateway care managers  		made fewer contacts with members than the minimum required by the assigned  		options, whereas Care Wisconsin care managers made more contacts than the  		required minimum. This is not surprising because caseloads per care manager at  		Gateway are several times larger than those at Care Wisconsin, where teams of  		care managers serve members. </p>
<p>Care managers at Care Wisconsin who were assigned to screen their  		members for depression on a quarterly basis screened a greater proportion of  		members compared to those assigned to provide twice yearly screening. The  		opposite held for care managers at Gateway. Care Wisconsin care managers  		reviewed the care plans of approximately 22 percent of members on a quarterly  		basis, whereas Gateway care managers reviewed care plans of approximately 34  		percent of members on a quarterly basis (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.3">Table V.3</a>).  		Care managers at Care Wisconsin notified the PCP via telephone of nearly every  		discharged member; care managers at Gateway sent more notifications per member  		by letter versus telephone (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.2">Table V.2</a>). Care Wisconsin  		care managers made a telephone notification of the PCP of every discharge for  		30 percent of members. At Gateway, PCPs were notified by telephone for half as  		many discharges (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.3">Table V.3</a>). At Care Wisconsin, twice  		as many members received informal post-discharge follow-up than formal  		follow-up with an instrument and checklist. At Gateway, the proportion of  		members receiving follow-up was similar between informal and formal follow-up  		(<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableV.1">Table V.1</a>).</p>
<p><i><b>1. Frequency-of-Routine Contacts and Medication Reviews (Component  		1) </b></i></p>
<p>Care managers at Gateway reported that the minimum guidance for the  		number of contacts as part of the enhanced care option for low-risk members was  		insufficient for the provision of services and that they contacted most such  		members at least once per month instead of once every two months. However,  		several care managers found it difficult to maintain more frequent contact  		rates (enhanced care) for lower-risk members and noted that some members  		expressed the desire not to be contacted more than once a month. Gateway  		leaders remarked that participation in the study prompted the plan to consider  		adopting a better-defined frequency of contact as well as more structured  		processes for contacting members. Leaders at Care Wisconsin noted that some  		care managers experienced difficulty in following the frequency of contacts  		assigned in the study protocol because care managers tended to perceive all  		members as very high-risk, even though Care Wisconsin enrollees had fewer  		hospitalizations than Gateway enrollees. </p>
<p>Although care managers at Gateway believed that the minimum number of  		contacts assigned as part of the study was insufficient for the provision of  		services, they made fewer contacts than required by the assigned options. On  		the other hand, care managers at Care Wisconsin made more contacts than  		required as part of the study.</p>
<p><i><b>2. Falls-Risk Screening (Components 2 and 3) </b></i></p>
<p>Gateway Care managers reported that they found the formal falls-risk  		screening tool useful, even though they deemed it too long and found some  		screening tool questions redundant; nevertheless, they liked having a set of  		questions to ask. They often worked the questions into the flow of conversation  		such that members sometimes did not realize they were being asked questions  		from a formal instrument. Staff at Gateway found the letters to members  		burdensome to generate and did not believe the letters had a strong effect on  		members. Care managers at Care Wisconsin believed that the screening was  		redundant with services already provided at the plan.</p>
<p><i><b>3. Screening for Depression (Components 4 and 5) </b></i></p>
<p>Care Wisconsin leaders reported that care managers preferred the PHQ-9  		depression screening instrument because it was shorter than the tools used at  		the plan before the study; similarly, nurses preferred it because community  		physicians were already familiar with it. Care Wisconsin will adopt PHQ-9 for  		depression screening in routine care. Care managers believed that PHQ-2 was not  		sufficiently comprehensive. In contrast, neither leaders nor care managers at  		Gateway expressed a preference for PHQ-2 or PHQ-9. Gateway care managers felt  		that depression screening was difficult and awkward for those without a  		background in mental health, and members sometimes experienced difficulty  		opening up sensitive mental health matters. Screening members with a history of  		mental health issues occurred more frequently regardless of assignment to  		enhanced or routine care. Care managers at both plans believed that the tested  		depression screening options enabled them to identify and refer more members to  		appropriate care than before the study. Care managers at both plans did not  		believe that sending letters with screening results to PCPs was effective.</p>
<p><i><b>4. Frequency of Care Plan Review (Component 6) </b></i></p>
<p>Gateway care managers noted that their standard process of care before  		the study was to conduct care plan reviews more frequently than prescribed  		under the enhanced care option. The enhanced care option prescribed a review  		every six months, whereas Gateway's care plan reviews take place every time a  		member is contacted as reported by care managers. Care Wisconsin care managers  		considered the quarterly care plan review to be burdensome and the most  		difficult study component to implement.</p>
<p>Gateway care managers assigned to a more frequent review of care plans  		provided fewer reviews than those assigned to routine care. It is not clear why  		the care plans at Care Wisconsin were reviewed more often by care managers  		assigned to routine care; the guidance for routine care is to review the care  		plans twice per year (<a href="OrthoV1.shtml.html#tableA.1">Table A.1</a>), whereas the enhanced  		care option called for quarterly reviews.</p>
<p><i><b>5. Method Used to Coach and Educate Members (Component 7)  		</b></i></p>
<p>Care managers and leaders at both Gateway and Care Wisconsin liked the  		teachback method very much. Gateway care managers, however, experienced some  		difficulties with the teachback method; they found that some members were  		unable to repeat instructions and others preferred to move on to other topics.  		In addition, they felt that members experienced difficulty in giving care  		managers their undivided attention during telephone contacts. Care managers at  		Care Wisconsin communicated to leaders that the teachback method improved  		communication with members. The leaders noted that Care Wisconsin is  		considering adoption of the method throughout the plan. Before the study,  		several care managers assigned to routine practices were trained in the  		teachback method (enhanced care option) and continued using it. Given that the  		routine coaching method for some care managers was the teachback method, such  		care managers recorded use of the routine method when they in fact relied on  		the teachback method.</p>
<p><i><b>6. Number of Post-Discharge Follow-Ups (Component 9) </b></i></p>
<p>Although they believed that post-discharge follow-up is useful, Gateway  		care managers found it difficult to contact members twice after discharge  		because post-discharge phone calls and letters were time consuming and because  		they were frequently unaware of members' discharge. Care managers reported that  		members' schedules after discharge were often busy with follow-up appointments  		and other care, making it difficult for care managers to reach them twice. Care  		Wisconsin leaders believed the additional follow-up to be useful and are  		considering its adoption.</p>
<p><i><b>7. Informing PCP of Members' Discharge (Component 10) </b></i></p>
<p>Gateway care managers found that PCPs had mixed reactions to follow-up  		efforts. Small primary care offices were more receptive than large offices to  		notification of members' hospital discharge. Further, care managers expressed  		the belief that PCPs were more likely to receive information through letters  		rather than via telephone. On occasion, members visited PCPs before letters to  		the physician were generated. Given that Care Wisconsin's advanced practice  		nurses provide some medical services directly to members, members' and care  		managers' involvement with PCPs varies greatly. Although care managers at both  		plans attempted to provide PCPs with notification of members' discharge, they  		did not believe such notification added value.</p>
<p><i><b>8. Formal (Versus Informal) Post-Discharge Follow-Up (Component  		11) </b></i></p>
<p>Care managers at both Gateway and Care Wisconsin noted that the  		post-discharge follow-up checklist (part of the enhanced care option) provided  		much-needed structure to address members' needs as they transition from  		hospital to home. At Gateway, care managers found CTM-3 tool useful for  		conveying broad ideas and easy to incorporate into the flow of conversation.  		Care Wisconsin care managers felt that CTM-3 tool should be administered before  		members are discharged from the hospital rather than once they are at home. The  		plan has developed a care transition intervention that includes a  		post-discharge follow-up that uses a checklist similar to that implemented as  		part of the study.</p>

<p><a name="note1" id="note1">For</a> the recruitment of SNPs for the study, we  			 sought the help of Rich Bringewatt, the leader of the SNP Alliance, an  			 organization that represents the needs and interests of SNPs and the members  			 they serve (National Health Policy Group 2010). We are very thankful for Rich's  			 engagement in the recruitment of the SNPs. The SNP Alliance introduced our  			 study to plans serving dual eligibles that might be interested in  			 participating, provided their contact information, and facilitated the  			 communication with the leadership of the interested plans. After an in-person  			 meeting in October 2010 and several more conversations with plan leaders, we  			 secured a commitment to participate from three SNPs: Care Wisconsin and  			 Gateway, the two plans described in this report, as well as Brand New Day, an  			 SNP serving a population with SPMI, described in a separate report.</p>

<p><a name="note2" id="note2">Unlike</a> Gateway, Care Wisconsin did not restrict  			 its included population in this study to the subset of patients at highest risk  			 of hospitalization.

We include in our analysis a binary control  			 variable indicating which plan the care manager was employed by to eliminate  			 the potential for such bias. We also control for sample members' chronic  			 conditions and pre-enrollment hospitalization and ER use, and caregivers'  			 pre-demonstration hospitalization rates for their caseloads in the prior  			 period. Thus, the differences in target populations between the two plans  			 should be adequately controlled for, as are differences in casemix across care  			 managers within the two plans.</p>
