<hr /><p><br /></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Evidence on best practices in care management for chronically ill  		Medicare beneficiaries offers few clear guidelines about what works best. Given  		the wide variation both within and across plans in how special needs plan (SNP)  		services are provided, it becomes important to identify how best to implement  		or improve intervention components rather than testing only the overall  		effectiveness of SNPs in general. In this study, we sought to understand which  		of two alternative ways of implementing each of several components of care  		management lead to better health outcomes in the two participating SNPs. We  		used an efficient orthogonal design that allowed us to simultaneously compare  		effectiveness of alternative approaches to implementing ten components of care  		management services. Efficient orthogonal designs have been used extensively in  		manufacturing, and in some health care organizations, but not in published  		health care evaluations. Such designs enable the testing of multi-component  		interventions and various ways of deploying each component, offering great  		potential as a tool for continuous improvement in health care quality.</p>
<p>We tested two alternatives--routine care (services routinely provided at  		the plans before the study) and enhanced care (more frequent or more intensive  		versions of the services)--for each of ten care components. The tested  		components included frequency-of-routine contacts; falls-risk screening  		frequency and referral to fall prevention programs; depression screening  		frequency, use of depression screening instruments, and mode of referral;  		member education and coaching strategies; and management of care transitions,  		including frequency of follow-up and use of protocols and tools.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>Study Design and Analysis Methods</h2>
<p><i><b>Randomization, Outcomes, and Data</b></i></p>
<p>The participants were: (1) care managers in Care Wisconsin and Gateway  		(in Pennsylvania) plans who implemented the interventions; and (2) the 1,562  		dually eligible noninstitutionalized members with disabilities or frail elderly  		who comprised these care managers' caseloads. We randomly assigned each of the  		24 care teams/care managers in the study (17 from Care Wisconsin and seven from  		Gateway) to implement a different, pre-selected combination of alternatives  		(routine care or enhanced care) for each of ten components, for one year. The  		care managers implemented the same intervention components for all of their  		members. </p>
<p>For each component, we analyzed whether members assigned to the enhanced  		care variant experienced different outcomes than those assigned to the routine  		care variant. Outcomes examined included: (1) the number of inpatient  		admissions for any reason; (2) the incidence of readmission within 30 days of  		any discharge (i.e., including those for mental health problems) and within 30  		days of a discharge from medical stays only; and (3) the number of emergency  		room (ER) visits. We focused on readmissions for members hospitalized at least  		once during the follow-up because members who were not hospitalized cannot be  		readmitted. The program ran from May 16, 2011, through May 15, 2012, and we  		measured impacts over this period. We received approval for the study from the  		New England Institutional Review Board. U.S. Office of Management and Budget  		approval was not required because Mathematica did no primary data  		collection.</p>
<p>To analyze the effectiveness of enhanced versus routine care, we used  		two sources of secondary data obtained from the participating plans: (1)  		de-identified claims data on members' service use and chronic conditions; and  		(2) de-identified data on members' demographic characteristics and risk level,  		as assessed by each plan. For the implementation analysis, we used data  		collected by participating plans via tracking tools to assess the care  		managers' fidelity to their assigned component options. We also conducted  		discussions with care management staff to understand how faithfully the  		components were implemented. </p>
<p><i><b>Impact and Implementation Analysis Methods</b></i></p>
<p>We used regression analysis to compare the outcomes for members  		receiving routine care to the outcomes for members receiving enhanced care,  		controlling for any pre-intervention differences between the two groups in  		members' and care managers' characteristics. All four outcomes were analyzed  		over these follow-up periods for all members: 1-6 months; 7-12 months; and the  		full 1-12 month period. Analyses of effects of components on readmissions were  		done for hospitalized members over the 1-12 month follow-up. Regression  		analyses controlled for member characteristics observed over the two-year  		baseline period (May 16, 2009, to May 15, 2011). </p>
<p>Implementation analysis is particularly important because a finding from  		regression analyses that routine and enhanced care options were equally  		effective in terms of observed health outcomes for a given component might be  		incorrect if such care was not fully implemented. If such analysis suggests  		that some planned intervention enhancements were not well-implemented, further  		assessment should be done to identify the barriers to implementation of those  		interventions. In June through August 2012 (between one and three months after  		the intervention period ended, but before the analysis results were produced),  		we held discussions with care management staff to get their views on why  		enhanced care may have been more effective than routine care for some  		components but not for others, and to identify implementation facilitators and  		barriers. Care managers were instructed to use the tracking tool form after  		each contact with the members to record which components were provided. Using  		this information, we assessed the fidelity to assignments by examining: (1) the  		proportion of members receiving the assigned option at least once; (2) the  		annualized number of times each component or option was provided per member;  		and (3) the proportion of members receiving the option at least as often as  		assigned. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>Study Findings and Discussion</h2>
<p><i><b>Descriptive Results</b></i></p>
<p>The population of members in the study was composed of older adults,  		included more women than men, and was largely Caucasian. The proportions living  		in rural versus urban areas were about equal. Gateway members were younger,  		less likely to be newly enrolled in the plan, and less healthy than Care  		Wisconsin members. Use of hospital and ER services was high at both baseline  		and follow-up--47 percent of members were hospitalized during baseline and 43  		percent were hospitalized during the follow-up period.</p>
<p><i><b>Findings</b></i></p>
<p>Even though outcomes were similar for those whose care managers were  		assigned to the enhanced version as for those assigned to the routine version  		for most of the ten care components, there were a few exceptions: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Requiring a higher minimum frequency of contacts and medication  			 reviews was associated with 16 percent fewer ER visits at the full year of  			 follow-up. Members assigned to enhanced care received slightly more contacts  			 and many more medication reviews (38 percent) than members assigned to routine  			 care. Care managers remarked that they had difficulties maintaining the more  			 frequent contact rates due to already high caseloads. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surprisingly, patients of care coordinators assigned to use the  			 enhanced ("teachback") coaching method had 15 percent <i>more</i> ER visits  			 than the routine coaching method at the full year of follow-up, a finding  			 possibly attributable to care managers' lack of familiarity with the teachback  			 method. Fidelity analysis showed that care managers assigned to teachback  			 provided less coaching to their patients, in terms of the percentage of  			 patients who received any coaching and the number of times they received  			 coaching. The effect on ER visits dissipated in the second six-month follow-up,  			 which might be due to care managers improving their teachback skills over  			 time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Results for outcomes measured over the periods of 1-6 months and  			 7-12 months were similar to those for the full period, suggesting that most of  			 the enhanced options neither influenced outcomes early on but then dissipated,  			 nor that they took several months to take effect. One exception is that  			 assigning members to more frequent falls-risk screenings with an instrument was  			 associated with a greater likelihood of readmission following a medical  			 discharge as compared to those assigned to routine care; at the second  			 six-month follow-up, the finding was reversed. These findings are most likely  			 chance variation in when these readmissions occurred rather than real effects  			 of opposite signs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Some findings of no difference in outcomes may be attributable to a  		failure to implement the enhanced care option in a manner that sufficiently  		distinguished it from the routine care option. For example, although the  		teachback method was qualitatively more intensive, the fidelity analysis showed  		that the enhanced and routine care groups received approximately the same  		number of post-discharge follow-ups, consistent with care managers reporting  		having difficulties conducting the second follow-up because calls were time  		consuming and members difficult to reach. Although post-discharge follow-up  		with an instrument and a checklist was qualitatively more intensive and  		reported as useful by care managers because it provided structure, care  		managers assigned to the instrument/checklist performed fewer follow-ups, so it  		is not surprising that we observed similar outcomes for routine and enhanced  		care groups on this component. </p>
<p>Despite the findings that outcomes were not better for the enhanced  		version of most of the components tested, the participating plans have  		nonetheless decided to adopt some of these enhancements. The plans' decisions  		to adopt these enhancements were made before the results on relative  		effectiveness of enhancements were available to them, and were therefore based  		solely on their experience with the options. Care management staff reported  		several important lessons learned from the study implementation. We found that  		both plans' care managers and leaders believed that use of the teachback method  		was a useful and appealing innovation; the two plans intend to train all care  		managers in the method before requiring its routine use. In addition, Care  		Wisconsin plans to implement the Patient Health Questionnaire Nine-Question  		Instrument for depression screening because it was shorter than the tools used  		at the plan before the study and because community clinicians were familiar  		with it. Care Wisconsin is considering training care managers in falls-risk  		assessment. Care Wisconsin has also developed a post-discharge tool similar to  		one used in the study and is considering adoption of a second post-discharge  		follow-up because of positive feedback from care managers and because both  		these enhancements are believed to be helpful to members. Gateway noted that  		the study introduced more structure in routine contacts, falls-risk screening,  		and care transitions management, which it considers to be valuable and intends  		to continue. In addition, the plan intends to train care managers in depression  		screening. For both plans, the study highlighted the need to track the services  		delivered by care managers.</p>
<p><i><b>Limitations </b></i></p>
<p>Several limitations in the study should be noted. Because only 24 care  		managers/teams participated in the study, only large differences in outcomes  		between routine and enhanced care options (22-32 percent of the mean outcome)  		were likely to be detected. Moreover, to obtain even this number of care  		managers, it was necessary to "pool" care managers from the two plans and  		estimate a single effect. We estimated intervention effects under the  		assumption that these effects were equal for the two plans after controlling  		for patient characteristics and plan-level differences in mean outcomes.</p>
<p>Members in the Gateway plan were not enrolled in care management for the  		full (one year) duration of the study, since members who reach their goals  		"graduate" from the program and cease to receive care management services. On  		average, members receive care management for 4-5 months. Therefore, it may have  		been even more difficult to detect differences between the tested options  		because 30 percent of the sample did not receive the interventions for long.  		Further, it is possible that exposure to intervention components for one year  		was not long enough for the measured outcomes to change, due to time required  		to learn how to implement a change in care management protocols effectively and  		for opportunities for preventing a hospitalization to arise. However, because  		we are analyzing a high-risk population and types of services that should show  		results relatively quickly, one year should be long enough for effects to be  		observed, if they are ever going to exist. </p>
<p>Given that we performed many comparisons between enhanced and routine  		care, it is possible that some findings resulted from chance. The number of  		significant differences was about what would be expected by chance for the 80  		comparisons (two outcomes were analyzed for ten components for all members for  		three periods and two outcomes for ten components for hospitalized members). A  		joint test of whether all enhanced versus routine care differences were zero  		could not be rejected, indicating that even the few statistically significant  		observed differences may have been due to chance rather than to the  		interventions. This indicates that as a group, enhanced components did not have  		a different effect on measured outcomes than routine practices. While this  		could be viewed as routine care being just as effective as the tested  		enhancements, the lack of significant findings may also be due to insufficient  		statistical power to detect what may have been modest-size favorable effects.  		Only impacts of 22-32 percent or larger were detectable with 80 percent  		power.</p>
<p>The findings from the implementation analysis of the tracking data may  		be flawed by incomplete reporting by the care management staff on their  		activities. Care managers at both plans experienced some difficulties  		integrating tracking sheets into day-to-day activities, which indicates that  		future studies should consider other ways to track fidelity, such as via  		electronic health records. In the related Brand New Day orthogonal design study  		that we conducted (reported elsewhere), the plan collected such information as  		part of the electronic health record. </p>
<p>Another major limitation was that for five of the components, the care  		actually delivered by care coordinators assigned to the enhanced care option  		did not differ meaningfully from the care delivered to those assigned to  		routine care. Thus, it is not possible to determine whether these intended  		enhancements of a given component would be more effective from the routine  		care. For two of the components, at least part of the reason for failure to  		deliver the assigned intervention appeared to be a lack of explicit,  		unambiguous descriptions of how the enhanced care was to be delivered. For  		example, conversations with care mangers revealed that there was confusion  		about how often to review a care plan (Component 6) and what is involved in a  		plan review, which is an important finding for the participating plans. The  		multiplicity of routine care practices and a lack of understanding of what is  		involved in these practices illustrate that sharp differences between studied  		options can be difficult to specify and explain to care coordinators.</p>
<p>For the other three components for which the enhanced care option was  		not implemented in a manner that distinguished it sufficiently from the routine  		care option, the problem was either that the enhancement was not implemented  		consistently or fully, or that routine care was more intensive when delivered  		than specified by the participating plans. However, while this situation makes  		it impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of the planned enhancement, it  		should be viewed less as a limitation than as an important finding that can  		inform the plans of needs to standardize routine care practices, and an  		opportunity to learn why planned enhancements were not enacted. The analyses in  		this report took an "intent-to-treat" approach in which component effects are  		computed by comparing outcomes of those assigned to the two options, regardless  		of whether or how thoroughly the options were actually delivered. Standard  		supervisory measures at the two plans were continued throughout the study, so  		that the components were tested in a "real-world" environment with the  		currently available resources, rather than in a strictly controlled setting.  		Follow-up discussions with care coordinators revealed several reasons for the  		lack of full implementation of the enhanced variants, such as high caseloads,  		difficulty tracking which components they had already provided to a given  		patient, and multiple organizational changes occurring during the study period  		that were unrelated to the study.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>Implications for Policy and Practice</h2>
<p>The study illustrates the potential of orthogonal design for improving  		the effectiveness and efficiency of care management programs if enough  		observational units, such, as care managers, are available. Orthogonal design  		combines the rigor of experimental design with the ability to produce rapid  		results on the effectiveness of several components in a single experiment. It  		accommodates planned testing of alternative approaches to multi-component  		interventions and permits practitioners and researchers to tailor interventions  		to the target population and test enhancements to routine care. Given that  		orthogonal design tests combinations of routine and enhanced care, there is no  		traditional control group; all members receive each component of care (e.g.,  		screening), but some receive it in a different style or intensity than had  		previously been used. Further, orthogonal studies are attractive because the  		care managers who implement the interventions all are engaged in testing new  		variations because each care manager implements some enhanced care and some  		routine care options. Care manager engagement is greatly enhanced if they are  		included in the development of the enhancements to be tested; this should  		always be a feature of orthogonal design studies of care management.</p>
<p>An important benefit of an orthogonal design study, as we have seen from  		the reaction of the participating plans, is enhanced clarity of expectations  		about how interventions are to be provided. Rather than implementing a broad  		model of care, care managers are told precisely how they are expected to  		implement each of the components of care management being tested. When routine  		care is not well defined or the way routine care is implemented differs across  		care managers, as is often the case, this structure itself can help standardize  		the care management intervention, leading to less variation in implementation  		across managers. Further, fidelity analysis allows participating plans to  		assess the degree to which components were carried out as specified, which can  		help the plan identify the areas of care management to focus on in their  		quality improvement efforts. While efforts to standardize care management  		interventions can be done without orthogonal design studies, conducting such a  		study forces plans to re-examine their processes of care and protocols, and can  		uncover unknown areas of confusion or misinterpretation concerning routine care  		and operations. The orthogonal design approach also encourages organizations to  		create a culture of learning by providing participants with a rigorous approach  		for testing out their new ideas.</p>
<p>This study also identifies some important difficulties with conducting  		orthogonal design studies in health care organizations. The types of variations  		in how care coordination is delivered studied here are likely to generate only  		moderate size effects on hospitalizations or ER use--that is, they are not  		strikingly different ways of delivering care coordination, but rather  		relatively minor twists. Furthermore, some of the interventions can only affect  		subsets of the enrollees (e.g., those with depression, those with a hospital  		admission), so the expected effect calculated over all enrollees is attenuated.  		To have adequate statistical power to detect such modest expected effects, a  		sizeable number of care coordinator units are needed because the variance of  		these outcomes across care coordinators is large. Without adequate power,  		statistically insignificant differences in outcomes between enhanced and  		routine versions of a care component cannot be taken as valid evidence that the  		routine (and typically less expensive) version of the intervention is just as  		effective as the enhanced version. Although the number of care coordinators  		(24) participating in this study exceeds the number used in some studies in  		other fields, it was not sufficient for this study due to the large variation  		in hospitalization rates and other key outcomes across coordinators. </p>
<p>The study also identifies how hard it can be to change the behavior of  		even dedicated health professionals. For each of the components, both the  		enhanced and routine care groups received the assigned component less often  		than specified in the study. Very few members received at least the minimum  		number of services (for example, contacts, post-discharge visits, screenings)  		as specified in the study protocol, and an even smaller percentage of members  		assigned to enhanced care received services at least as often as assigned. Even  		though this finding may have been due in part to under-reporting of services  		provided, the gap is so large that it seems likely that many patients did not  		receive the full complement of intended services, reflecting various barriers.  		The qualitative investigation of barriers to implementation is just as  		important for learning as estimation of the effects of the various  		enhancements.</p>
