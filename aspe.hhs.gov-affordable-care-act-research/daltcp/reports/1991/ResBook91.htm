<p>This compendium is published by the Division of Children and Youth  		Policy within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation  		(ASPE), of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It summarizes the  		results of the Divisions research projects from 1986 through the  		present.</p>
<p>The role of research within the Division is to produce information on  		the organization, financing, and delivery of services to children and youth,  		particularly among disadvantaged groups. Recent work includes studies of issues  		related to the children of participants in the JOBS program and to the  		expansion of Head Start. Special studies have focused on understanding the  		needs of drug exposed and HIV-positive children as well as those of homeless  		families with children. Among the studies currently underway are projects  		relating to childrens mental health services, family preservation  		programs, and the educational needs of drug exposed children.</p>
<p>In addition to research, the Division has recently also supported a  		series of grants to stimulate and support state and local community-based  		efforts to integrate health and human services for low-income families as a  		means of improving the access to and effectiveness of these services.</p>
<h2><a name="organize" id="organize">ORGANIZATION</a></h2>
<p>The compendium is divided into six subject areas:</p>
<ol type="I"><li>Child Care, Child Development, and Head Start</li>
<li>Child Abuse/Neglect, Child Welfare, Foster Care</li>
<li>Adolescents</li>
<li>Special Populations</li>
<li>Miscellaneous</li>
<li>Grants</li>
</ol><p>Each subject is subdivided into Completed Projects and Projects Underway  		(if any). Within each subject area, completed projects are listed in reverse  		chronological order, from most recent to oldest. Projects underway are listed  		in chronological order by projected completion date. [<b><i>NOTE: Report links  		were added when this compendium was made Internet-ready.</i></b>]</p>
<p>Project descriptions include the title of the study, principal  		investigator, an abstract of the subject matter, the project completion date,  		the Policy Information Center Identification Number, and a division contact  		person. To obtain a copy of the final report for completed studies, the reader  		should contact:</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>The Care of Low-Income Children:  		Sub-study of the National Child Care Survey</i></b></p>
<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Sandra Hofferth and April  		Brayfield, Urban Institute</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The National Child Care Survey, coupled with  		the Profile of Child Care Settings, provides an array of  		nationally-representative information on the demand for and supply of child  		care in the U.S. in 1990. This sub-study provided funds to oversample  		low-income respondents and conduct separate analyses on child care utilization  		patterns, expenditures, and preferences among low-income parents.</p>

<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  William Prosser and Sharon M.  		McGroder, ASPE</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This paper critiques the hypotheses,  		analytic approaches and conclusions put forth in a paper written by Dr. Sandra  		Hofferth (of the Urban Institute) for the National Symposium on Child  		Care in the 1990s: Trends and Consequences. Dr. Hofferth analyses  		the National Child Survey data and presents analyses on the degree to which  		there is an unmet need for child care; how current expenditures  		vary by family income and how parental expenditures have changed over the last  		several decades; how the quality of center-based and regulated  		family day care has changed over time (as measured by education and training of  		staff, group sizes, and staff-child ratios); what parents say they want when  		selecting child care; where quality of care fits in their  		preference set; and what barriers exist to obtaining their preferred care.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>Infant Attachment Literature Review and  		Seminar</i></b></p>
<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Virginia Colin, consulting  		psychologist for Nancy Low and Associates, Inc.</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  Early infant attachment lies at the heart of  		healthy child development and lays the foundation for relating intimately with  		others, including with spouses and children. For the vast majority, the  		experience of the mothers care in the first experience of reality. But  		the demands of modern life and culture are placing new demands on parents. With  		these demands comes the need for clarity regarding the basic requirements of  		the newborn and the young infant: what is needed to nurture appropriately?  		Because attachment is a fundamental theme of social function, it is a central  		issue in social policy.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of infant attachment, there has been no recent,  		comprehensive literature review that incorporates research from the variety of  		disciplines, including child development, ethology, and the behavioral and  		psychodynamic literatures. For this reason, the Department of Health and Human  		Services commissioned a multidisciplinary literature review on infant  		attachment theory and research and conducted a seminar of experts to critique  		the review and propose a research agenda.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>Satisfaction with Child Care:  		Perspectives of Welfare Mothers</i></b></p>
<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Doug Wolf and Freya  		Sonenstein, The Urban Institute</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  Approximately 11% of the nations  		children have mothers on Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). In  		1988 this program was reformed to require mothers with children over the age of  		2 years to participate in employment programs. Child care subsidies were  		guaranteed. This paper examines AFDC mothers perspectives on their child  		care in 1983-1984, a period before welfare reform, to explore the  		characteristics of care that mothers are likely to work. Mothers ratings  		of their care on quality, convenience, dependability, and cost showed that no  		particular arrangement--care by relatives, sitters, family day care or  		centers--was superior across all these dimensions. Each type had strengths and  		weaknesses. Multivariate analyses of mothers satisfaction revealed that  		convenient hours and adequate adult supervision were valued for all preschool  		children. Low child to adult ratios and convenient location were important for  		children under age 3; the childs learning opportunities and happiness,  		and lower levels of caretaker experience were important for older pre-school  		children. The type of care used was not directly associated with satisfaction.  		The report concludes that a diverse range of child care options should be  		developed.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>Quality in Child Care: What It Is and How  		It Can Be Encouraged -- A Speech for the Family Impact Seminar</i></b></p>
<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Ann Segal, ASPE</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This speech briefly describes several issues  		concerning the regulation of child care including: who should regulate child  		care, whether standards effectively improve quality, how child care has been  		regulated since the late 1800s, current regulation practices, and how current  		child care legislation addresses regulation. The author concludes that in order  		to improve the quality of day care environments, there should be training and  		technical assistance for providers, and parents must be taught how to choose a  		good provider and then act accordingly.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This report presents the findings of a  		survey conducted to meet the informational needs of the Teenage Parent  		Demonstration and to address the broader issues associated with the nature of  		child care markets. The Teenage Parent Demonstration, initiated in 1986, is a  		study designed to learn more about child care needs and available supply of  		care for low-income and welfare mothers. The report describes the sample design  		of the survey, its results concerning the supply of child care and the need for  		child care, and a multivariate analysis of child care mode choice and  		expenditures. Data for the analysis was gathered in Camden, New Jersey, Newark,  		New Jersey, and South Chicago, Illinois.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This report presents the results of an  		exploratory study which identifies data items from the Consumer Expenditures  		Survey (CES) useful for the analysis of child-care spending and its impact on  		overall spending patterns. The authors created a data base out of selected  		family demographic and expenditure information contained in the CES. This  		report illustrates the potential uses of the data base and does not present a  		comprehensive analysis of child-care related spending behavior. It also  		evaluates the study and discusses alternative approaches for future research  		using the data base.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This paper synthesizes findings on current  		and trends in child care usage patterns among employed mothers of preschoolers  		(less than 6 years old). It summarizes the types, duration, and expenditures on  		arrangements using the Current Population Surveys (1958, 1965, 1977, 1982), the  		National Survey of Family Growth (1982) and the Survey of Income and Program  		Participation (SIPP) data (Winter 1984-1985).</p>

<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Lorelei R. Brush, Analysis,  		Research and Training</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This report argues that, if current behavior  		is indicative of future behavior, then about half of new AFDC participants will  		choose informal care for their children. The expenses of parents who use  		informal care, which is usually free or inexpensive, will be covered by current  		program expenditures. The analysis is based on Survey of Income and Program  		Participation (SIPP) data on child care for working guardians on AFDC. These  		data can help work/welfare program planners determine child care requirements  		for new initiatives encouraging AFDC recipients to work.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>Usage of Different Types of Child Care:  		An Analysis of the SIPP Data Base</i></b></p>
<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Lorelei R. Brush, Analysis  		Research and Training</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This report uses data from Survey of Income  		and Program Participation (SIPP) to defend the theory that the availability of  		child care providers and the affordability of different care arrangements  		together predict the kinds of care families use. The report differentiates the  		sorts of families who use informal care-care (care by a childs parents,  		siblings, grandparents or other relatives) from those using more formal  		arrangements (care by nonrelatives in homes or day care facilities) and those  		who pay for care from those who do not pay. The report notes that SIPP only  		analyzes what child care parents use, not what care they prefer. Policy  		planners much know the parents preferences in order to apply the SIPP  		information to predict child care patterns among participants in Federal  		programs.</p>

<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  William R. Prosser, ASPE</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This paper analyzes the growth of day care  		center capacity in the United States over two points in time, 1976 and 1984,  		and compares it to the change in potential demand for day care caused by the  		increased numbers of mothers with young children who were in the labor force.  		It concludes that day care center supply increased more than the number of  		young children who have mothers in the labor force.</p>

<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Karl Ensign, ASPE</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This paper discusses foster care prevention  		services, focusing on family support and family preservation services within a  		continuum of child welfare services. Family preservation services are defined  		as time-limited programs that serve a family at imminent risk of foster care  		placement with intensive, flexible services usually provided directly in their  		home. Family support programs are defined as services which provide ongoing  		support to fragile families within a community context in order to help prevent  		them from being overwhelmed by future crisis situations. The results of early,  		as well as more recent, evaluations in both of these areas are presented,  		describing the effectiveness with which both models appear to improve family  		functioning and prevent foster care placement.

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>Parental Drug Abuse and African American  		Children in Foster Care: Issue and Study Findings</i></b></p>
<p><i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Clarice Walker, The National  		Black Child Development Institute</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This study utilized data regarding African  		American children in foster care collected by the National Black Child  		Development Institute to compare whether or not there are differences in the  		characteristics, needs, services and outcomes for children depending on whether  		or not parental drug abuse was a contributing factor in their foster care  		placements. There were four major findings to the analysis: (1) Child welfare  		agencies are not achieving permanency for most children, particularly for those  		from homes with parental drug use; (2) Services to address the problems  		contributing to placement in foster care were either unavailable or  		insufficiently brokered or coordinated with other organizations to achieve  		reunification discharges; (3) Relative placements were often available and  		represent a significant resource to the children; and (4) Families with  		parental drug abuse were more likely to have less education, be poorly housed,  		and receive AFDC prior to placement than other families with children in  		care.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This descriptive study examines the  		configuration of services and programmatic systems in place to provide support  		to homeless families in five cities. The report describes the specialized needs  		of homeless families and factors contributing to family homelessness. Although  		it does not rigorously evaluate the programs in place in each city, the report  		discusses what aspects of the programs and practices seem especially promising  		in helping families achieve self sufficiency. The sites included in the study  		are Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Minneapolis and Oakland.</p>
<p>The final report is in two volumes. Volume I begins with an overview of  		the problem of family homelessness based on a review of the literature and  		discussions with national experts and prominent services providers, advocates,  		and public officials in major U.S. cities. The core of the first volume is the  		presentation of cross-site findings from the five site visits. These findings  		are grouped into two categories: findings related to coordination of services  		and findings related to comprehensiveness of services. The final chapter of  		Volume I discusses issues and barriers that were discovered during the site  		visits. These are program and policy concerns that have influenced the state of  		homeless services in the past and will shape the options for the future. Volume  		II of the final report includes the site visit reports for each of the five  		cities and profiles of the programs visited in each city.</p>

The study team conducted case studies in four cities -- St.  		Petersburg, Florida; Portland, Oregon; Los Angeles, California; and Chicago,  		Illinois -- where they viewed programs, interviewed program staff, and visited  		community organizations serving drug-exposed children. Case study findings were  		used to identify policy and service delivery issues related to meeting the  		needs of drug-exposed children and their families.

One mechanism will be the establishment  		of school-based family resource centers at each school. Also, local consortia,  		including parents, will be organized to seek resources and support. The State  		Department of Human Resources is committed to participating in this process and  		contributing staff to work in the schools or in other capacities as defined  		with the communities.</p>

<p><i>GRANTEE</i>:  Richard Morgan, Ohio Department of Human  		Services</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  DHS will assign a facilitator to each of  		seven sites to assist in conducting a needs assessment, resource inventory, and  		part of a community-based planning process. Local agencies will provide an  		array of educational, health, family support, and child welfare services.  		Depending on the site, services will be provided through public schools, family  		resource centers, or a public housing development. The seven sites are: Summit  		(Akron), Hamilton (Cincinnati), Franklin (Columbus), Lucas (Toledo), Trumbull  		(Warren), Montgomery (Dayton), and Allen (Lima) counties.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>Facilitating Community-Based Service  		Integration for Georgia Rural Communities</i></b></p>
<p><i>GRANTEE</i>:  Janet Bittner, Georgia Department of Human  		Resources</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  Three of Georgias major state agencies --  		Human Resources, Education, and Medical Assistance -- have formed a  		collaborative partnership entitled the Family Connection. With funding from the  		Joseph B. Whitehead Foundation, this group will integrate service delivery at  		the local level through restructuring organizational relationships and delivery  		mechanisms among these departments, under the premise that this leads to  		earlier and more effective delivery of services to children, youth, and  		families at-risk. Community-based coalitions will include public schools,  		public health, family and children services, county commissioners, business,  		juvenile court, mental health, substance abuse councils, and community action  		agencies.</p>
<p>The federal facilitator grant will be used to manage this  		effort across the seven rural sites, namely, the counties of Murray, Dawson and  		Hall, Elbert, Emanuel, Coffee and Ware, Lowndes and Mitchell, and the City of  		Carrollton.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>California Services Integration  		Project</i></b></p>
<p><i>GRANTEE</i>:  Wayne Sailor, San Francisco State University  		Foundation</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The Foundation will work with five  		California municipalities -- Oakland, Fresno, Watsonville, San Bernardino, and  		San Francisco -- to develop models for the integration of services through the  		schools to children and families at risk. The project expects both to  		facilitate the expansion and networking of local community efforts for services  		integration, and also to provide the state leadership with a sufficient base of  		demonstrations and evaluative data to ensure that emerging, successful models  		of service integration can be implemented statewide. The facilitation efforts  		will include (a) agency collaboration; (b) an immediate focus on disadvantaged  		and at-risk children; (c) consumer involvement and responsibility; (d) a single  		point of contact at the local level; (e) a community planning focus; (f)  		efforts linked with school restructuring; and (f) provision of a variety of  		social services to families.</p>
