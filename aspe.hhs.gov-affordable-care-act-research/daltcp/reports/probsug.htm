<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Understanding the characteristics and status of the elderly who receive  		longterm care is an important and growing area of research, as is interest in  		the extent of their disabilities and their care requirements. As Americans live  		longer, the extent and types of disabilities and required services are  		broadening. Anticipating resource requirements of elderly and disabled persons  		will be even more critical as members of the "baby boom" generation become  		older. Greater numbers and types of services may be needed because of the  		larger size of this portion of the population, and public policy will have to  		provide the necessary framework for meeting these needs.</p>
<p>Various government agencies, the Congress, academics, advocacy groups,  		and the general public have a pressing need for credible data about the elderly  		population on which to base policy alternatives and costs. Currently, survey  		data are available from many sources: the National Health Interview Survey  		(NHIS) Supplement on Aging (SOA) and the related Longitudinal Survey on Aging  		(LSOA), the National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS), and the Epidemiologic Followup  		Study to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES1), to  		name a few.</p>
<p>These surveys generally target either the elderly population who live in  		the community regardless of their health status, or the disabled elderly who  		live in institutions. None of these data specifically target the disabled  		elderly who live in the community, and who are in need of a variety of services  		because of their disabilities.</p>
<p>Medicare data are also available for the elderly-who participate in that  		program. These data can be linked to many of the surveys mentioned above, and  		they provide detailed information on expenditures for medical care. They  		provide little, however, to enhance analyses of the extent and types of  		disabilities from which Medicare recipients may suffer.</p>
<h3>The National Long-term Care Surveys for 1982 and  		1984</h3>
<p>The 1982 and 1984 National Long-term Care Surveys (NLTCS) are unique  		among surveys of the elderly. They represent the elderly population in the  		U.S., targeting those who are disabled and living in the community. The survey  		samples were drawn from the Medicare eligibility data collected by the Social  		Security Administration. By using the weights provided with the survey files,  		the samples represent that universe of the elderly. The detailed components of  		the NLTCS focus on persons identified as community based and disabled. These  		surveys provide rich and detailed data on this important subsegment of the  		elderly, while the context of the general elderly population is maintained.</p>
<p>Three additional supplements to the NLTCS add to its-richness and  		coverage:</p>
<ul><li>the Informal Caregivers Survey for 1982;</li>
<li>the Institutional Component for 1984; and</li>
<li>the Deceased Component for 1984.</li>
</ul><p>Included in the 1982 survey were detailed questions asked of persons  		identified as "informal" (unpaid) caregivers to the community-based disabled.  		These data make it possible to identify characteristics of those helpers who  		may or may not ue relatives of the disabled person.</p>
<p>The 1984 survey also includes an institutional component for the elderly  		living in facilities like nursing or personal care homes. Combining this  		supplement with the data for the community-based elderly, it is possible to  		produce national estimates on the full disabled elderly population. Further,  		the 1984 survey includes detailed data about those people in the 1982 sample  		who died between the two survey periods. These data on the deceased were  		collected from the next-of-kin.</p>
<p>The longitudinal aspects of the 1982 and 1984 surveys permit examination  		of changes in the health and functional status of the elderly, as well as  		analyses of their use of various health care services over time. The inclusion  		of data on the deceased allows description of the medical services and costs  		associated with these deaths. Taken together, these rich data on the  		chronically disabled elderly population are comprehensive, and they comprise a  		unique data source for public policy research.</p>
<p>The NLTCS data are not without their problems, however. Numerous  		constraints and complications have kept them from being as accessible as they  		should be. Sponsorship has migrated through several governmental agencies,  		causing some redefinition of the focus of the effort. A shift in the survey  		design, from cross-sectional in 1982 to longitudinal in 1984, introduced  		analytic complexities. Changes in definitions, as well as improvements and  		enhancements to individual questions, made the use of prior period data more  		difficult. Attempts to simplify the physical and logical file structures have  		resulted in a data file that is inefficient to process. Limited budgets and  		time constraints precluded sufficient data editing and documentation. Although  		these problems are not insurmountable, individual researchers and users have  		been left to grapole with them.</p>
<h3>The NLTCS User's Forum</h3>
<p>Increased interest in, and broader use of the NLTCS files led ASPE to  		sponsor the National Long-Term Care User's Forum, held in January 1989. At this  		meeting, representatives from various government agencies involved in the  		development of the NLTCS, as well as experienced users from the research  		community, joined together with other users and potential users to share their  		experiences with the data. The various strengths, weaknesses, and difficulties  		with the files were summarized.</p>
<p>The Forum served as an opportunity for the users to ask questions and  		share information of general interest, and to collectively identify those areas  		where technical support is most urgently needed. Sessions on file content and  		design, data editing, data linkage, weighting, documentation, and users'  		concerns provided a useful setting for interaction among those mast interested  		and knowledgeable about the NLTCS data. The Forum also provided a vehicle for  		summarizing the most knowledgeable users' positive experiences with these  		data.</p>
<p>Further, participants were able to ask pressing questions about the  		1988/1989 data, which are currently being collected.</p>
<p>Written proceedings from the Forum were developed, which summarized the  		sessions in terms of the topics discussed, questions asked, answers provided,  		and concerns expressed. Those proceedings will record what users hope will be  		the start of a dialogue among various researchers, system developers, and  		statisticians who are interested in the NLTCS data and their use.</p>
<p>This paper summarizes the problems with and suggestions for improving  		the NLTCS files. It incorporates many of the concerns and ideas users stated at  		the Forum. It outlines concrete areas where improvements and increased  		technical support are needed so that the research community can conduct the  		most useful and credible studies possible. Eliminating as many of these  		problems as possible will go a long way toward freeing analysts to do more  		research with the data, rather than having to do research about the data.</p>
<h2><a name="difficult" id="difficult">DIFFICULTIES AND COMPLEXITIES OF THE 1982 AND 1984  		NLTCS DATA</a></h2>
<p>Many structural complexities of the NLTCS data base for 1982 and 1984  		make the files difficult to use. Some of these are inherent to any longitudinal  		data, but are more complex because elderly persons are being surveyed. In  		particular, the elderly are frequently lost to survey due to death or entry  		into an institution. Some become incompetent, and then a proxy must supply  		(perhaps less reliable) information in their place.</p>
<p>Changes in the questionnaire itself add to its complexity. Varying  		definitions of disabled" (ex. screener, interview) can be confusing to  		users of the data. The components of the survey were not administered  		consistently in both periods. On the one hand, enhancements, additions, and  		deletions to the survey instrument were essential for keeping the data base  		analytically current. On the other hand, budget cuts have diminished the  		continuity of certain components of the survey.</p>
<p>These complications have been, for the most part, unavoidable. They do  		not detract substantially from the richness and breadth of these data, but they  		add to the difficulty in using the data. Generally, the complexities and  		difficulties in using the 1982 and 1984 NLTCS fall into five categories:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Inaccuracies in, and inadequate documentation about, the weights  			 provided on the files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inconsistencies among individual data items within instruments,  			 across instruments, and between survey years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ambiguous non-response data codes for many variables, and missing  			 data for some key variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation that needs cross-indexing, better accessibility,  			 better readability, and completeness; i.e., better organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inadequate technical support, which leaves users unable to receive  			 timely assistance, answers to questions, and access to any current file  			 information.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Each of these categories will be discussed below. </p>
<h2><a name="complex" id="complex">COMPLEXITIES AND INADEQUACIES IN THE WEIGHTS</a></h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The complex nature of the NLTCS files is compounded by the various  		weights that are available on the files. Multiple weights are provided because  		of the multipurpose nature of the files. Weights were carefully calculated to  		allow cross-sectional analyses for both 1982 and 1984, as well as for  		longitudinal analyses across the period. Unfortunately, because of the way that  		the sample for the 1984 file was constructed, the sample weights reflect a  		population definition that is inconsistent with that represented on the 1982  		file.</p>
<p>The 1984 sample comprised the 1982 community-based group without further  		screening, supplemented by persons who became disabled between 1982 and 1984  		and by others who reached age 65 between 1982 and 1984. The 1982  		community-based cohort was not rescreened for disability; rather Its surviving  		members were automatically included in the 1984 community-based component.</p>
<p>Further complications occurred because of the institutional component on  		the 1984 file. The control totals used for determining the sample weights were  		based on a broad definition of "institution," and thus the institutional  		population as defined for the 1984 NLTCS may be overstated. Conversely, the  		1982 population may be understated because several hundred people identified  		for inclusion in the community sample entered institutions between the time of  		sample selection and survey execution. They were therefore excluded from the  		1982 survey but the weights did not compensate for this exclusion.</p>
<p>For the deceased component of the 1984 NLTCS, discrepancies arose when  		linking the deceased population to Medicare records.</p>
<h3>Proposed Improvements</h3>
<p>The user community wants a set of weights that can be reliably used with  		little or no corrections or ambiguity. Users need explicit documentation  		relating to the construction and proper use of the weights, as well as any  		associated effect on error variance estimation. Control totals for benchmarking  		analyses are essential to insure their proper use.</p>
<p>This does not mean that users want to give up detail or control over the  		types of analyses they can do. Nor does it mean that they are unwilling to deal  		with complex data. Many sophisticated users are capable of making their own  		adjustments to appropriate weights to do hypothesis testing, as well as to  		account for possible bias due to non-response. Such users must be provided with  		the tools to do so.</p>
<p>To begin with, the weights for the 1982 NLTCS need to be corrected, to  		change the reference point of the file from cross-sectional to longitudinal.  		Then the longitudinal weights for the 1982-84 period need to be reexamined and  		adjusted to give the user a complete set of consistent, usable weights. The  		components (i.e. the raw selection probabilities) needed to make adjustments to  		the weights for particular research applications must be made available.  		Control totals need to be generated so that users can verify their own  		analyses. All aspects of the' weighting process should be properly  		documented.</p>
<h2><a name="data" id="data">DATA CLEANING AND EDITING</a></h2>
<h3>Key Variables</h3>
<p>Inherent in the use of data from both the 1982 and 1984 files for  		longitudinal studies is the need for consistency among the identifying and key  		variables of each file period: the key screener variables for 1982, and the key  		detailed interview variables for 1982 and 1984. For example, the reported age  		of a respondent should have a consistent and predictable value between file  		periods. Similarly, key demographic variables, (e.g., race and sex), should not  		change between file periods. These basic demographic variables on the NLTCS  		files need to be examined for consistency.</p>
<h3>Flap Variables</h3>
<p>Another general area of users' concerns centers on the detailed  		questions regarding activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental  		activities of daily living (IADL), and the associated check items and "flap"  		variables. The flap variables were not meant to be used for analysis, but  		rather as an aid to the interviewers to determine skip patterns in the  		questions. These variables are not really part of the survey data, and they  		were intended to provide observational information (by the interviewer).  		Indeed, portions of the data were initially edited by the Bureau of the Census  		based on the response patterns reflected by these flap variables. Yet most  		researchers need ADL and IADL summary variables much like those provided on the  		flap. Many analysts use the flap items in spite of their weaknesses. Great  		benefit would derive from constructing a set of functionally equivalent summary  		variables based on the detailed ADL and IADL questions.</p>
<h3>Screener ADL/IADL Definitions Versus Detailed  		Definitions</h3>
<p>Problems arise because of ambiguity between the screener ADL/IADL  		questions and the detailed community ADL/IADL questions. Such inconsistencies  		of definition are not immediately apparent from the documentation. Careful  		analysis is necessary to define consistent and useful variables since much of  		the detailed survey is based on responses to these ADL and IADL questions.</p>
<h3>Ambiguous "Missing Data" Definition</h3>
<p>Many of the variables on the NLTCS files are difficult to use  		individually because the "missing data" values associated with them are  		ambiguous. When a response is "missing," it generally might be one of four  		responses: not ascertained, don't know, refused to answer, or not applicable.  		For many research purposes, the "don't know" and "refused to answer" categories  		of nonresponse are actually responses, to be distinguished from the other two  		categories. Currently, users are forced to investigate, understand, and  		reproduce the so-called "skip logic" themselves, in an effort to untangle the  		"don't know" from the "not applicable" response categories. Many users want  		these ambiguities removed, and do not have the resources to perform the  		complicated, but necessary, preprocessing of the data.</p>
<h3>Inconsistent Helper/Household Member/Children Date</h3>
<p>Several thousand variables providing information on helpers, household  		members, and children of respondents are available on the NLTCS data base. Only  		a limited amount of information exists for any one such person, but the file  		structure allows for up to 15 persons in each of the three categories for each  		of the 2 years. Further, a helper can also be a household member. In this case,  		information is repeated but has not necessarily been checked for consistency.  		Researchers would greatly benefit from having these variables systematically  		examined, cleaned, and edited for intra-record consistency. Rules for such  		editing would be included in expanded and organized documentation, as described  		below.</p>
<h3>Summary and Check Variables</h3>
<p>Summary and check variables, which direct the user through the various  		segments of the survey, need to be checked and possibly edited for each sample  		person. There should be no confusion about which segment a respondent (or  		non-respondent) properly belongs in: the community, institutional, or deceased  		component. The current variables on the files which were meant to identify the  		various subpopulations, must be aligned for consistency. The documentation must  		be modified to accurately describe these variables.</p>
<h3>Proposed Improvements</h3>
<p>In summary, users of the NLTCS files have a need for systematic  		examination and adjustment of many of the key and general variables on the  		files. As pointed out at the User's Forum, a great deal of time has been spent  		by some; users in cleaning the disability data, reconciling the detailed  		interview data with the check variables, and creating a screener equivalent  		definition of "disability" from the detailed interview questions. Other  		researchers will have to go through the same or similar exercises to use these  		data effectively.</p>
<p>Data editing and cleaning of the NLTCS files would be welcomed by all  		who use the data, and will go a long way to allowing researchers to return to  		their research. The suggestions offered in the preceding paragraphs are  		summarized as follows:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Design and implement consistency checking of key and general  			 demographic variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construct a set of index or summary variables to functionally  			 replace the flap variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refine and redefine, if necessary, the screener ADL/IADL questions  			 versus the detailed ADL/IADL questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define unambiguous missing data values by systematically going  			 through the skip logic to untangle ambiguous responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure consistency among the helper, household member, and children  			 sections of sample persons records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define strict intra-record consistency-checks for that subset of  			 variables (or all variables) deemed crucial to research efforts.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2><a name="imputation" id="imputation">IMPUTATIONS AND THE CREATION OF DERIVED  		VARIABLES</a></h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Several users expressed concern at the extent of missing data for  		certain types of variables on the NLTCS files. As is true for most surveys,  		financial data are particularly difficult to collect because of imprecise  		knowledge by the respondent or proxy, or a general reluctance to share  		financial information. Imputation of financial data in a rigorous, systematic  		manner would be a great service to users. Many researchers do some imputation  		themselves, but lack the necessary resources and background information to  		produce the best possible estimates.</p>
<h3>Proposed Improvements</h3>
<p>There are a number of areas where imputations could be carried out using  		various techniques. One such technique would use control numbers from other  		surveys and published sources as the basis for the estimates. Another  		technique, hot-decking, uses reported information from responding sample  		persons to serve as proxy information for persons not answering particular  		questions. Inclusion of any estimated values on the file must be thoroughly  		documented, and the imputed values must be easily identifiable. Users would  		then have the option of not using the estimated values if they did not agree  		with assumptions made, or procedures used, for the estimation.</p>
<p>Another area of discussion and consideration would be the addition of  		new variables to the file. The availability of a standard set of constructed  		variables would be welcomed by many in the NLTCS user community. Variables that  		have come to be commonly used among the research community, and that should be  		defined consistently for most research applications, would be included in this  		type of file enhancement. Basic variables like one or more indices of overall  		disability would be welcomed by users who seek guidance on their definition.  		Again, the component data would continue to be available for variations of  		definition.</p>
<h2><a name="improve" id="improve">IMPROVED DOCUMENTATION</a></h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Users agree that there is a need for more complete, more usable  		documentation of both the 1982 and 1984 NLTCS files. The problem stems not  		from.too little documentation, but rather from the organization and  		accessibility of what is available and the incompleteness of the commentary on  		certain topics.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the current documentation consists of voluminous  		technical memoranda, codebooks, appendices, explanatory notes, etc., which have  		been produced as both primary documentation and in response to user's questions  		and needs. Technical memos between the Health Care Financing Administration  		(HCFA) and the Census Bureau give most of the details on sampling and  		weighting, but these memos are not summarized, organized, or indexed. Also,  		editing rules that apparently changed between the preparation of the 1982 and  		1984 data are not documented at all.</p>
<h3>Proposed Improvements</h3>
<p>As expressed at the User's Forum, concerns about documentation are quite  		varied. There is interest in having distributions and control totals on key  		variables, both weighted and unweighted, as part of the standard documentation.  		More graphic presentations would be beneficial. These could include flowcharts  		of the population bases for the 1982 and 1984 files, diagrams summarizing  		imputation procedures, and so forth. Summaries, tables of contents, and indices  		to help organize and use the documentation are needed. Users indicated that  		other models of good survey file documentation (like the Current Population  		Survey) should be considered for future or additional documentation of these  		data.</p>
<p>At the very least, a technical overview with a detailed table of  		contents and cross-referenced index is needed. This would identify for the user  		what is available and where to go to find it. An overview of the entire survey,  		including methodologies, instruments, and procedures, as well as differences  		between the 1982 and 1984 data periods, would further enhance the  		documentation.</p>
<p>Looking at particular subjects, a detailed section describing the  		weights, how they were derived, how to use them, and how to make adjustments  		for the nonresponse in the samples should be included in any documentation  		package. Adjusted, estimated, and constructed variables would be identified,  		and the adjustment procedures would be explained.</p>
<p>Ideally, if funds were available, the documentation would be  		totally"redone. It would be restructured to conform to accepted documentation  		standards, including what is best about the documentation of other public use  		files. Elements would include data dictionaries with frequency distributions  		for all variables, with cautions and limitations on their use. Variables with  		values estimated by imputation procedures would be clearly identified, and the  		procedures would be adequately explained. Constructed variables would be  		similarly described.</p>
<p>Users expressed concern about the upcoming 1988/89 file and its  		documentation. In addition to the detailed documentation that accompanies a new  		public use data file, users want to have an adequate understanding of what  		changes have occurred since the original design of the survey. They also want  		assurance that these changes will be reflected in the distributed file  		documentation.</p>
<h2><a name="technical" id="technical">TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE</a></h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Many users of the NLTCS files complain that no systematic mechanism is  		available for getting questions answered in a timely manner. They also noted  		that there is a need for centralized and systematic distribution of summaries  		of important technical notes so that users can judge whether further detailed  		information is needed. A technical assistance unit to support the user  		community would help fill this void.</p>
<p>A number of users had given thought to what elements they would like to  		see in such a unit. Some felt that a quarterly newsletter that detailed  		problems encountered and possible solutions, as well as the recent research  		efforts of other users of the data would be very useful. Others felt that  		periodic seminars on key topics relating to their research efforts would be  		beneficial. Generally, the technical assistance component would act as a  		clearinghouse for questions, directing users to appropriate people or  		documentation for information.</p>
<h3>Proposed Improvements</h3>
<p>It is important to design a technical assistance unit for the users of  		the NLTCS files. It should be easy to use, well advertised, and available on a  		regular basis. It should provide users with timely answers, and could serve as  		a forum for interaction among the users. Such a unit should coordinate  		distribution of file documentation and updates, a regular newsletter, and other  		information of general user interest. Telephone technical support, with perhaps  		an electronic mail/bulletin board system for obtaining Information and asking  		questions could be designed. Other technical assistance units should be  		analyzed in designing the unit.</p>
