<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>The mounting evidence of the effectiveness of supported employment (SE)  		services based on the Individualized Placement and Support (IPS) program model,  		in conjunction with the fact that relatively few of the many persons with  		serious mental illness (SMI) in publicly funded programs have access to such  		services, raises an obvious policy question: Should efforts be undertaken to  		promote and expand access to these evidence-based services for persons with  		SMI?</p>
<p>Assuming that at some point in the near future <b>specific</b> proposals  		for such efforts by state and/or federal agencies will be advanced, they will  		require objective evaluations that should be undertaken from a broad societal  		perspective. The current review therefore seeks to organize and interpret the  		growing literature on the effects of IPS SE programs from this same perspective  		in the hope that it can serve to inform these needed objective evaluations.</p>
<p>While a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of a specific policy  		proposal should provide valuations of both costs and benefits, the challenges  		to valuing some of the most important benefits of IPS SE programs are  		formidable. A substantial range of policy impacts can, however, be captured by  		applying the framework of social cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) as  		formulated by Meltzer (1997, 2006). Within this framework, a comprehensive  		measure of social cost of a mental health services program is defined simply as  		costs of consumption net of earnings of the persons affected by the program.  		The costs of consumption can be further categorized into:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>The resource costs of implementing the program (i.e., costs of  			 providing program services to the program clients).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cost impacts of the program on clients use of other mental  			 health treatment and rehabilitation services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impacts on clients costs of other publicly funded (or  			 third-party funded) services that are also consumed by clients (e.g., Medicaid  			 covered services for somatic health care).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impacts of the program on clients <b>private</b> consumption  			 costs (i.e., the costs of goods and services purchased by clients directly with  			 funds that they have access to (from their earnings, or from transfer income or  			 grants from public or private sources).</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The sum of these four categories minus program impacts on clients  		earnings represent the impact of the program on consumption net of earnings. In  		principle, the program impacts on the components of cost, and on earnings,  		should be measured over a time horizon long enough to capture all relevant  		program impacts.</p>
<p>The initial sections of this review, organized into <a href="#social">Part I</a>, are intended to parallel these components of social  		costs net of earnings. After some brief comments in <a href="#social">Part  		I</a>, <a href="#sectionI1">Section 1</a> on conceptual and definitional  		issues. <a href="#sectionI2">Section 2</a> focuses on the costs of providing  		IPS SE services. <a href="#sectionI3">Section 3</a> reviews studies that have  		reported on both the costs of IPS SE services and cost offsets as IPS SE  		services are substituted for other types of rehabilitation services.  		<a href="#sectionI4">Section 4</a> focuses on additional evidence and analyses  		from the literature on IPS SE program impacts on costs of other mental health  		and somatic health services. <a href="#sectionI5">Section 5</a> comments on the  		relevance, for measuring IPS SE program impacts of data on the associations  		between employment status and costs of mental health and health services.  		<a href="#sectionI6">Section 6</a> summarizes the main conclusions relate to  		program costs and service cost impacts. <a href="#sectionI7">Section 7</a>  		discusses some conceptual issues relating to measurement of IPS SE program  		impacts on private consumption net of earnings, while <a href="#sectionI8">Section 8</a> discusses evidence relating to program impacts  		on earnings, and <a href="#sectionI9">Section 9</a> discusses evidence relating  		to program impacts on non-earned income and total income.</p>
<p>In <a href="#evidence">Part II</a> of the review we turn our attention  		to evidence relating to measures of effectiveness that could be used in  		developing customized employment (CE) ratio measures of IPS SE program  		cost-effectiveness from a social perspective. <a href="#sectionII1">Section  		1</a> and <a href="#sectionII2">Section 2</a> of <a href="#evidence">Part  		II</a> focus on employment-related dimensions of effectiveness, and  		non-vocational dimensions of effectiveness. <a href="#sectionII3">Section 3</a>  		is a brief discussion of recent tests of enhancements to the IPS SE model  		intended to increase effectiveness, and <a href="#sectionII4">Section 4</a>  		considers the subject of variations in effectiveness by client/patient  		characteristics. Finally, <a href="#sectionII5">Section 5</a> discusses study  		limitations, and <a href="#sectionII6">Section 6</a> is a brief conclusion.</p>
<h2><a name="social" id="social">I. SOCIAL COSTS OF PROVIDING SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT (SE)  		SERVICES</a></h2>
<h3><a name="sectionI1" id="sectionI1">1. Comments on Conceptual Issues  		Relating to Costs of Implementing SE Programs</a></h3>
<p>Before reviewing the results of studies from the literature, it is  		useful to begin by considering several conceptual/definitional issues.</p>
<p>First, under the assumption that economies or diseconomies of scale are  		not very substantial in provision of SE services, our primary interest in  		empirical findings should be directed to average unit costs rather than total  		costs. This raises the question of what the appropriate unit of service  		(output) should be. While this unit could be defined as an individual contact  		with a client, the variety of activities involved in providing SE services may  		argue against this. For example, job-development work by an employment  		specialist (ES) may not entail any direct client contact. In addition, contacts  		of the ES with the client may vary substantially in time or content, and the  		same is probably true for ES contacts regarding job development with  		prospective employers.</p>
<p>These concerns may argue for using the client as the unit of output,  		regardless of the number and type of services required by the client. Since  		this definition of unit cost requires a time frame, it is likely that the most  		useful time period will be the year (since this is typically the unit of time  		corresponding to accounting, budgeting, and financing decisions). However, if  		the unit of output is the client-year, then heterogeneity in unit costs for  		individual clients may be an important phenomenon, with some clients requiring  		large numbers of services and/or time-intensive services within a given year  		while other clients do not.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>It also seems reasonable to expect that service cost per client should  		also diminish with the time that the client is involved in an SE program, since  		first-year service requirements are more substantial while service requirements  		in following years may in fact be lower, especially if the client is placed in  		a stable job situation and has a long tenure in that job. The literature  		provides at least limited support for the idea that service cost per client  		should diminish with the time. Cook et al. (2005) report a modest decline in  		hours of vocational service per client from approximately 3 hours per month in  		the early months of SE services to approximately 2 hours per month after 24  		months. Drake et al. (1999) reported, in an randomized clinical trial (RCT) of  		IPS SE versus enhanced vocational rehabilitation (EVR) services, that both  		groups experienced declines from the 2 month point to the 18 month point in  		percent receiving vocational services (95% to 61% for IPS and 84% to 57% for  		EVR), though some of the decline for IPS SE clients may have been due to  		declines in IPS service availability in the latter phase of the study (Dixon et  		al., 2002). Bush et al. (2009) characterize several previous studies as  		indicating that participants [in SE] relied on vocational services less  		over time.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> Bond  		and Kukla (2011) studied 142 IPS clients who were employed at least 10 hours  		per week in a competitive job and had begun a competitive job within 6 months  		prior to their study observation period of 24 months. They observed an initial  		contact rate for clients with their ESs of three per month and a decline in  		this rate to approximately 1 per month during the first 7 months of  		observation, with little change in this rate for the remaining 17 months of  		their study.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup> A similar  		pattern, with a slightly smaller decline over time, was reported by McGuire et  		al. (2010) for 91 persons over a 24-month period following their randomization  		to an IPS treatment arm. The average number of IPS contacts dropped from 9.04  		in the first quarter of study treatment to a range of 4.98-5.70 per quarter for  		quarters 3-8.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> Salyers  		et al. (2004) examined long-term follow-up experience of a small number of  		clients (n = 36) from two SE programs in New Hampshire and observed that after  		10 years 86% of these clients were still receiving SE services (though they do  		not indicate the volume or intensity of these services).<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A related issue is defining the end of a period of client service. It  		seems likely that at least some SE programs will not have a well-defined  		routine process for designating client discharges from SE services and thus may  		not have readily available data on the number of clients being served at any  		point in time. Moreover, even among programs that do have well-defined  		processes for discharging clients, these processes may vary considerably from  		program to program. Financial records of payments to the SE agency, presumably  		by third parties (such as Medicaid, vocational rehabilitation [VR] or  		Developmental Disabilities Administration), could be used as indicators of  		numbers of clients for whom an SE agency is being paid; however, it may not be  		common practice for agencies to generate statistics about length of time  		(within the year) on the reimbursable client rolls for each client in an SE  		program, and therefore about average length of time (within the year) per  		client.</p>
<p>A second issue is possible heterogeneity in the scope of SE services  		from one provider to another. Some services that could be viewed as primarily  		vocational in nature, such as cognitive remediation, could also be viewed as  		therapeutic services; this raises the possibility that clients of some SE  		providers may receive these services within the SE program (and the costs of  		the services are therefore included in the costs of the SE program) while  		clients of other providers may receive these services from personnel (and  		costs) not captured in the fiscal data for the program. In addition, some  		clients may not receive these services at all. For example, in the case of  		cognitive remediation, while this has been tested as an adjunct to  		standard SE services (e.g., Greig et al., 2005; Wexler and Bell,  		2005), it is not part of the fidelity assessment for SE services based on the  		Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model. Of course, one other aspect of  		heterogeneity in SE services across providers is that fidelity to the IPS SE  		model itself in fact varies widely across SE providers, and this presumably has  		some influence on variations in the level of unit costs observed in the  		data.</p>
<p>Third, other dynamic considerations may argue for viewing average unit  		cost at a particular time as a somewhat incomplete indicator of relevant costs  		for SE services over a longer time horizon. These considerations include: (1)  		the possibility of start-up costs (including delays in initially reaching the  		projected steady-state client caseload); and (2) the  		learning-by-doing phenomenon; both of these suggests that one may expect to see  		a decline in unit costs as SE providers gain more experience in providing  		services.</p>
<p>Fourth, we will address the issue of offset costs  		separately. While it has been suggested that the net impact of SE services on  		<b>overall</b> costs of mental health rehabilitation services is small when  		clients would otherwise have been receiving other vocational or psycho-social  		rehabilitation (PSR) services, we focus in the next sub-section of our review  		on the costs of SE per se without regard to any such offset  		costs.</p>
<p>Finally, while we will focus primarily on unit costs in this review, the  		reader should bear in mind that an empirical basis for assuming that economies  		or diseconomies of scale are not important in the provision of SE services is  		not established.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionI2" id="sectionI2">2. Results of Specific Studies of  		Program Costs</a></h3>
<p><i><b>2.1 The HMC Maryland Study</b></i></p>
<p>A recent study by Health Management Consultants (HMC, 2006) provides  		detailed cost estimates based on FY 2005 and FY 2006 data from seven SE  		agencies in Maryland. Data were derived from agency records and reports  		supplied by the agencies to HMC. Results indicated that the annual cost per  		full-time ES fell in a narrow range ($47,824-$65,462) for all but one of the  		agencies; the outlier agency reported a much larger figure that included  		unusually high costs for rent and for public relations. On the basis of these  		results, HMC suggested a bottom-line figure of about $60,000 per year per ES.  		(Note that this is a figure intended to include fully allocated overhead costs;  		detailed information on the allocation process was not provided.)</p>
<p>Translating this result into an annual cost per client requires that we  		factor in the numbers of clients per ES in the various agencies. HMC reported  		an average ratio of 13.9 clients per ES and a range in this ratio from 9.6 to  		22.3. This suggests an average cost per client of about $4,300 per year. If we  		weight the results by the numbers of clients served, the resulting per client  		average turns out to be about $5,000 because the two largest agencies, that  		account for about two-thirds of all the clients served by the seven agencies  		studied, reported per client costs of $6,138 and $4,815. (Of the seven agencies  		in this analysis, two did not provide any SE services that met the  		evidence-based practice (EBP) standard for IPS, while the remaining five  		provided EBP services in all or some of their sites. Excluding the two non-EBP  		agencies increased the average cost per client to about $5,100).</p>
<p>HMC also proposes an efficiency measure of average cost per  		working client. Since only 62.5% of all clients in their study were working,  		this measure is higher-than-average cost per client. They report an average  		(across all seven agencies) of $6,987. (This was calculated as the sum across  		agencies of all SE costs divided by the sum of the number of working clients in  		each agency.)</p>
<p>Finally, HMC notes that average caseloads per ES could be increased  		substantially and argues that this would lower the per client cost; an increase  		from the study mean of 13.9 to the EBP toolkit recommendation of 20 would  		reduce per client costs by more than 40% <b>if it is assumed that adding more  		clients did not entail additional costs for non-ES staff or other  		items</b>.This is an extreme assumption since HMC notes that some other types  		of costs that are sensitive to caseload, such as travel, are also important;  		but it still seems likely that a large reduction could be achieved with higher  		staffing levels. Implications for service effectiveness are not  		known.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p><i><b>2.2 Latimer et al. (2004)</b></i></p>
<p>This study obtained program cost data from seven programs in seven  		different states that were rated as achieving fidelity scores of 70 or higher  		(out of 75) on an IPS fidelity rating. Though the programs were all rated as  		high-fidelity, they varied widely in full-year clients per  		full-time budgeted ES (from 6.9 to 34.9). (Since the ratio was based on  		<b>budgeted</b> positions, ratios based on actual full-time equivalent staff  		would presumably have been slightly higher because of temporary vacancies.) The  		seven agencies also varied in the client turnover ratio calculated as number of  		clients served in a year divided by the full years of clients served (from 1.4  		to 3.1), and total cost per full-year client also varied (from $1,602 to  		$8,391) in 2001 dollars. Adjusting the latter figures for consumer price index  		(CPI) growth from 2001 to 2005 (annual averages) of 10.28%, yields a range of  		figures from $1,767 to $9,254. Corresponding means, calculated as the ratio of  		the mean agency total cost to the mean agency number of clients, are $2,898 (in  		2001 dollars) and $3,196 (in 2005 dollars).</p>
<p>Several differences between these results and the HMC results for  		Maryland are noteworthy. First, there is the obvious difference in that per  		client costs were found to be higher in Maryland. Second, the Latimer data  		imply strong economies of scale, with larger agencies having considerably lower  		costs per full-year client. As noted above, there was a five-fold range in cost  		per client and this corresponded to a seven-fold difference in caseload size,  		with the smallest agency having the highest costs.</p>
<p><i><b>2.3 Cimera (2008)</b></i></p>
<p>Another recent study of SE costs (Cimera, 2008) takes a different  		approach than the previous papers. Rather than examining accounting data from  		SE agencies, he studies payments by the state VR agency in Wisconsin to  		providers of VR services. This approach has the advantage of allowing cost  		comparisons between groups of clients defined by the nature of their mental  		disorders; on the other hand, the study is not able to document the specific  		nature of the services provided, and to determine the extent to which these  		services conform to the IPS model. It also does not provide evidence that the  		VR agencys payments correspond to costs derived from accounting data.</p>
<p>Cimera reports the average annual cost to the Wisconsin VR program. For  		FY 2002-2005, for persons with psychotic mental illness: the  		figures are $3,628 of FY 2002, $3,653 for FY 2003, $2,529 for FY 2004 and  		$6,404 for FY 2005. It is interesting to note that the FY 2005 figure is about  		30% higher than the corresponding HMC figure for Maryland. Cimera also reports  		analogous figures for two sub-groups of these clients: those with  		significant disabilities and those with the most  		significant disabilities. Averaging over all 4 years, the per client  		costs for clients in these two groups were $3,565 and $3,932  		respectively.<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a>, <a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<h3><a name="sectionI3" id="sectionI3">3. SE Implementation Costs and Cost  		Offsets from Other Vocational Programs</a></h3>
<p>The concept of cost offsets generally refers to the idea that  		implementation of an SE program may reduce the dollar amounts of resources  		devoted to other services, such as other vocational services, other PSR  		services, treatment services for mental health problems, and treatment services  		for somatic health problems. Such cost offsets may be of particular relevance  		for assessing cost-effectiveness of expanding SE services from a public sector  		perspective since the services whose costs are being offset are largely  		financed by governmental funds. (As discussed later in this review, however,  		these cost offsets are also relevant from the broader societal  		perspective as reflected in a social CEA.)</p>
<p>The potential nature and magnitude of cost offsets will depend  		critically on the nature of the specific SE implementation policy under  		evaluation. Several studies that have examined the costs of SE services have  		done so specifically in the context of substituting SE services for more  		traditional rehabilitation services (though the nature of these  		traditional services have varied from study to study).</p>
<p>Clark et al. (1996) compiled data from two day-treatment programs  		operated by a CMHC in New Hampshire that were converted to IPS SE programs at  		two different time periods in the early 1990s, in 1990 and in 1992. Prior to  		conversion, the average annual cost per client of the day programs were $8,739  		and $6,597; after conversion these costs (including the SE program costs)  		dropped to less than $2,000 in both programs. After conversion, the IPS  		programs had recorded costs of $1,920 and $1,878 per client per year. The  		implication of these figures appears to be that the cost offset of closing the  		day-treatment services more than covered the cost of the IPS SE programs.  		Overall community treatment cost trends were not as clear, however, because:  		(1) both sites reported fairly large increases in case management costs; and  		(2) the timing of downward trends in other outpatient services costs were not  		clearly related to the timing of the conversions to IPS services. In addition,  		data on hospital use in one of the two sites appeared to have some validity  		problems, while in the other site cost per client of hospitalization had been  		increasing before the SE program start-up and continued to increase after the  		start-up. These complications led the authors to the more conservative  		conclusion that the costs of conversion to IPS services were fully offset; they  		did not venture firm conclusions about cost savings over above this full offset  		of the IPS costs.</p>
<p>In a randomized trial comparison of IPS SE versus a group skills  		training (GST) VR program, Clark et al. (1998), report virtually no difference  		between the costs of these two programs. Average 18-month costs per client in  		1992 dollars, adjusted to a 12-month basis, were $3,757 for IPS and $3,688 for  		GST. Adjusting these costs to 2005 dollars based on CPI produces figures of  		$5,230 and $5,134. Since the adjustment by the all-items CPI (rather than a  		health sector CPI) seems conservative, the similarity between these figures and  		those reported in the HMC study (above) is striking. The similarity in costs  		between the two programs suggests that replacing a GST program with an IPS  		program would not increase costs. The evidence for a greater than 100% offset  		in vocational/rehabilitation costs (i.e., in shifting from the GST to the IPS  		SE program) is weaker than in the day-treatment conversion study discussed  		above, but Clark et al. (1998) argue that this reflects the fact that external  		pressures to reduce overall community mental health treatment costs were not as  		strong in the setting for the IPS versus GST study as in the setting for the  		conversion study.<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup> (Of  		course, as shown in the 1996 paper, the considerable expense of providing  		rehabilitation services within a day-treatment/partial hospitalization  		framework allowed for large cost offsets when the day-treatment programs were  		essentially terminated after the start-up of the IPS SE programs.)</p>
<p>Another randomized trial, involving inner-city residents with SMI (Drake  		et al., 1999; Dixon et al., 2002) compared an IPS SE program with an EVR  		service. Mean per client costs over an 18-month period for the two  		interventions were almost equal ($4,295 for IPS SE versus $4,438 for EVR in  		1995 dollars; in 2005 dollars, annual cost of $3,669 for IPS SE versus $3,792  		for EVR). This suggests that replacing an EVR program with an IPS SE program  		would fully offset the costs of the IPS SE program.</p>
<p>One other study conducted a randomized trial comparison of  		accelerated entry SE (as in the IPS model) to a more traditional  		gradual entry program that included 4 months of prevocational  		training (Bond et al., 1995). According to data on this study reported by Bond  		et al. (1995a), mean program costs for the two groups were as follows: $6,103  		(= $4,667 for day-treatment, + $1,436 for SE) for the traditional program  		versus $4,463 (= $1,443 for day-treatment, + $3,020 for SE) for the accelerated  		entry program. While the apparent cost savings for the SE program were large,  		statistical significance of the cost differential was not reported.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a state or federal policy maker considering a  		program to expand SE services, the significance of the apparent implication of  		these findings (i.e., that incremental costs for substituting IPS SE for other  		vocational interventions are small) will of course depend on the extent to  		which expansion of IPS SE services constitutes a substitution for other  		vocational services that are currently offered. While definitive statistics are  		scarce, it does appear that there is substantial scope for substituting IPS SE  		services for other vocational interventions. For example, it is estimated that  		the number of persons with schizophrenia in the adult United States population  		is approximately 2 million, and that less than 25% of all persons with SMI  		receive any form of vocational assistance.<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup> This would imply that, as a rough  		approximation, 500,000 adults are receiving vocational assistance, but numbers  		receiving SE services have been estimated at about 10% of that  		figure.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup> Thus, it  		seems reasonable to conjecture (as an order-of-magnitude estimate) that there  		is scope for a roughly ten-fold expansion of IPS SE services targeted  		specifically at persons with SMI currently served by other types of vocational  		services.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionI4" id="sectionI4">4. Other Evidence of IPS SE Cost  		Offsets on Mental Health Treatment Costs</a></h3>
<p>Even if the policy initiative under consideration involves extending SE  		services to a target population that is not now receiving any other forms of  		vocational services, for which SE services would be direct substitutes, there  		may still be cost offsets in terms of reduced costs for non-vocational  		services. In view of the level of expenditures by Medicare, Medicaid and state  		and local public mental health agencies on treatment of persons with SMI, these  		other cost offsets could potentially be far more important than savings from  		direct substitution of SE for other vocational services.</p>
<p>However, evidence for such cost offsets is very limited at present. In  		the early study on accelerated treatment cited above (Bond et al., 1995),  		little difference in hospital admission rates or days of stay were observed  		between the accelerated and traditional groups (the accelerated group had about  		10% greater use measured in either days or in admissions over a 12-month  		follow-up period). As we previously noted, Latimers review (2001) of that  		earlier study cited a savings in day-treatment cost of $3,224 per client per  		year that more than offset a $1,616 excess cost of SE services in the  		accelerated entry group. He also reported that the accelerated group had $658  		in savings per client for other treatment and rehabilitation services combined  		(drop-in center, outpatient services, medication clinic, clubhouse,  		psychiatrist, and substance abuse counseling). The combination of these cost  		differences is just under $2,300 in net savings for the accelerated program.  		The small difference in hospital use (noted above) suggests a reduction in this  		net savings figure when inpatient costs are included; also, Latimer does not  		report any significance test for overall net cost savings between the two  		groups.</p>
<p>Before-after evidence from the studies by Clark et al. (1996, 1998),  		however, provides conflicting evidence of overall treatment cost offsets. As  		noted above, in the 1996 study of day-treatment conversions to SE, the evidence  		was at least suggestive of net cost savings from SE, primarily because of the  		very large reductions in day-treatment (partial hospitalization) costs from  		before to after conversion. Results reported in the 1998 paper, by contrast,  		showed large declines between the 18-month baseline and the 18-month follow-up  		periods for inpatient treatment costs in <b>both</b> the IPS SE and GST  		interventions (mean declines of $11,982 and $10,570 respectively). While it is  		possible that simply providing access to employment-oriented vocational  		services could produce these very large inpatient cost offsets, an alternative  		and perhaps more plausible explanation is regression to the mean due to clients  		selecting into these programs in response to a period of unusually high  		disability and dysfunction. The fact that these large declines were observed  		for <b>both</b> programs, and that the decline for IPS SE was modestly but not  		significantly larger, precludes us from attributing much of the decline to the  		greater effectiveness of IPS SE services. Before-after changes in mean  		outpatient treatment costs per client were far lower (an increase of $613 for  		IPS SE and a decrease of $355 for GST). Thus before-after changes for  		<b>both</b> programs suggested substantial net cost offsets (relative to not  		having such programs available) largely because of the decline in inpatient  		treatment costs exceeded the increase in vocational program costs (about $5,500  		per client), but attribution of most of the declines to the programs themselves  		seems debatable.</p>
<p>Several other day-treatment conversions studies from roughly the same  		time period also failed to show convincing evidence of substantial treatment  		cost savings attributable to IPS SE programs. Becker et al. (2001) reported  		declines in hospitalization following conversion of two day-treatment centers  		to SE services in Rhode Island, but also reported a decline for a comparison  		group that remained in day-treatment, with no significant differences in the  		declines between the two groups. Bailey et al. (1998) reported on a  		before-after study of 32 long-term day-treatment clients in a mental health  		center in New Hampshire who voluntarily switched to an IPS SE program and were  		followed for 1 year. In this case, the authors made before-after comparisons  		for the IPS clients and found that days of crisis housing, days of  		hospitalization, outpatient mental health service utilization, and service  		costs did change. They noted that their expectations of reduced  		outpatient mental health service costs and use were not borne out in part  		because: (1) in the before period the SE clients spent many hours in a  		sheltered workshop program that were not counted as service utilization hours;  		and (2) after switching to IPS some clients required intensive initial IPS  		services and those who were not working participated extensively in  		skills training groups.</p>
<p>In the RCT comparison of IPS SE versus EVR for inner-city clients with  		SMI, Drake et al. (1999) did observe modest declines from baseline to follow-up  		in inpatient days for both study groups but the neither the declines nor the  		difference in declines between the groups were statistically  		significant.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup>  		Follow-up period (18-month) overall mental health treatment costs were not  		significantly different between the two groups (Dixon et al., 2002); inpatient  		costs for IPS clients were higher (but not significantly higher), by  		approximately $4,500, but baseline inpatient costs were also higher for IPS,  		and per client costs for outpatient mental health treatment were almost the  		same in the two groups. Baseline costs for other services were not  		reported.</p>
<p>Henry et al. (2004) report the results of a comparative analysis of  		hospitalizations and emergency room (ER) visits for IPS SE versus a comparison  		group of propensity-matched clients at a single site in Massachusetts. The  		period covered by the study was May 1995 through December 1999. For both  		outcome measures, the IPS SE group showed significantly lower rates of service  		use during the study period. They note, however, that the comparison group had  		significantly higher levels of impairment and significantly lower levels of  		mental health service use, suggesting that the propensity matching did not  		produce sufficiently comparable groups. To explore these differentials, the  		authors examined interactions between IPS SE and a grouping of high versus low  		levels of mental health service use; they reported slightly smaller but still  		significant main effects and significant interaction effects indicating that  		IPS SE clients with high mental health services use had the lowest rates of  		hospitalization and ER use, while IPS SE clients with low mental health  		services use still had hospitalization and ER use rates that were significantly  		lower than their comparison group counter parts. The authors interpreted their  		findings as suggesting that negative IPS SE impacts on hospital and ER use are  		greater when mental health services are integrated with employment support  		services. They note, however, that their results may in fact be the product of  		selection bias on observable factors (not included in their propensity  		analysis). Moreover, as a result of their transformation of their hospital and  		ER use outcome variables into rankings, it is not possible to ascertain the  		magnitude of the effects that they report. Given these limitations, it is  		difficult to view the results of this study as strongly supporting the  		hypothesis that IPS SE services produce substantial savings in the form of  		lower hospital and ER costs.</p>
<p>In summaries of research findings, literature reviews have uniformly  		failed to find support for the proposition that IPS SE leads to substantial  		treatment cost savings. Latimer (2001) observes that research findings  		offer little hope for a significant reduction in other health care  		costs (besides VR costs) following the introduction of  		SE.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup> Bond  		(2004), in a review the focused mainly on employment outcomes, also noted that  		by itself, enrollment in SE has no systematic impact on  		non-vocational outcomessuch as rehospitalization. Similar  		conclusions were expressed in reviews by Latimer (2005) and by Schneider  		(2003).</p>
<p>Perhaps the strongest direct evidence of an impact of IPS SE on reducing  		medical costs comes from a six-site European randomized trial (Burns et al.,  		2007) that randomly assigned 312 patients with SMI who were interested in  		competitive employment to either IPS SE or an alternative  		train-and-place vocational service program. Over an 18-month  		follow-up period, data on 289 patients were available and showed significantly  		lower probability of a hospital admission (20% versus 31%) and percent of time  		in hospital for patients assigned to IPS (4.6% versus 8.9%). The relatively  		high rate of hospital admissions for both groups may be an indication of  		stringent inclusion criteria (e.g., having psychosis and a major role  		dysfunction for at least 2 years) and/or differences in practice patterns  		(i.e., greater use of inpatient admissions) vis-à-vis the United  		States.</p>
<p>In an interesting extension of their analysis, Burns et al. (2009) also  		compared subjects, <b>within</b> each of their two study groups, who were  		currently working with those who were not to assess whether the pattern of  		within-group differences varied by study condition. While statistical tests  		were not reported, they did present evidence that the differences in  		non-vocational outcomes, including the probability of hospitalization, were  		consistently larger for the train-and-place vocational services  		group than for the IPS SE group. They interpret this finding as suggesting that  		IPS was more successful in getting less well functioning and symptomatic  		patients into employment.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionI5" id="sectionI5">5. What Does the  		Employment-Treatment Cost Relationship Tell Us About SE Impacts on Treatment  		Costs?</a></h3>
<p>It has been suggested in the recent literature (Bush et al., 2009; Drake  		et al., 2009) that empirical relationships between employment and treatment  		costs can help to inform us about the impacts of IPS SE on treatment costs. The  		logic of the argument is that since there is clear evidence that IPS SE  		promotes employment, evidence of a strong negative relationship between  		employment and treatment costs is a good indicator of expected treatment cost  		savings that arise from more widespread implementation of IPS SE services for  		persons with SMI.</p>
<p>Bush et al. (2009) present data from a 10-year follow-up of 187 persons,  		with co-occurring substance use disorder and SMI, who participated in the New  		Hampshire Dual Diagnosis Study. Employment outcomes for these 187 persons were  		tracked and all study participants were divided into three groups based on  		their trajectory of hours in competitive employment (defined as any paid  		position in the regular job market) over this follow-up period. These  		three groups were: a steady work group (n = 51), a late work group (n = 57) and  		a no work group (n = 79). The steady work group had a level of work hours in  		the baseline year which appears to have been an order-of-magnitude greater than  		the other two groups, and the annual average of work hours for the steady work  		group increased very clearly over the first 5 follow-up years, with a leveling  		off and a slight downward trend over years 6-10 of the follow-up. Over the full  		10-year follow-up period, the mean yearly hours of work for this group was  		5,060 (or roughly 10 hours per week). Because the work levels for the other two  		groups were much lower, both in the baseline and in the follow-up, <b>and</b>  		because the authors did not find any significant differences in follow-up  		service use or costs between these two other groups, they were combined into a  		single minimum work group whose mean yearly hours of work in the  		follow-up period was 411.<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Two service use measures were computed and compared for the steady work  		group versus the (combined) minimum work group: total outpatient service  		hours<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup> and total days  		in institutions (which included psychiatric hospitalizations and  		incarceration). An overall cost measure combining both of these measures of  		service use as also computed.</p>
<p>Baseline differences in annual means for these measures between the  		steady work and minimum work groups were fairly small: 178 versus 157 service  		hours, 26 versus 44 days in institutions, and $30,953 versus $37,898 for costs.  		In year 1 of the follow-up, outpatient service use hours for both groups  		increased substantially, but inpatient days dropped substantially. In  		subsequent years, outpatient service hours dropped substantially for the steady  		work group but remained fairly level for the minimum work group; for both  		groups, inpatient days did not show a clear downward trend from the follow-up  		year 1 levels (24 days for minimum work and 4 days for steady work), though  		costs for both groups did continue to decline. By follow-up year 10, costs had  		dropped to $9,732 and $17,949 for the steady work and minimum work groups  		respectively.</p>
<p>The authors tested for differences in the time pattern of utilization  		and cost impacts between the steady and minimum work groups by estimating a  		regression model, adjusted for baseline covariates, that allowed for  		group-specific differences in (1) baseline levels and (2) changes from baseline  		to first-year follow-up, and rates of change from first-year follow-up to  		tenth-year follow-up. Results indicated no differences for the outcome measures  		at baseline between the two groups, no significance in changes from baseline to  		first-year follow-up except a larger decline in costs for the steady work group  		that was marginally significant (p = 0.097), significantly greater downward  		trends from first-year to tenth-year follow-up for outpatient service hours and  		total cost for the steady work group, and a downward trend from first-year to  		tenth-year follow-up in a 0-1 hospitalization indicator that was more negative  		but not significantly different for the minimum work group. The authors point  		to this pattern of results as indicating that reductions in service use and  		costs are preceded temporally by increases in employment and that this supports  		the argument that their data show a <b>causal</b> relationship flowing from  		employment to reduced costs and service use. </p>
<p>The authors do acknowledge the potential problem of unobserved variables  		in a naturalistic study such as this, and specifically mention illness level,  		motivation, and response to treatment as potential confounders. While they go  		on to argue that other evidence relating to these specific confounders probably  		cannot account for the observed time pattern in their results, it is of course  		true that there are many other potential confounders that can induce a negative  		correlation between hours of work and service use or costs. A further problem  		in viewing these results in supporting the case for a nexus between IPS SE  		services and reduced costs is the fact that data indicating use or non-use of  		SE services were only collected on 19 of the 187 clients during the study  		period.<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Another very recent small-scale study (Schneider et al., 2009), based on  		experience in the United Kingdom, differed from Bush et al. (2009) in that the  		follow-up period was much shorter but all persons in the study were recipients  		of SE services. The paper examines baseline versus 12-month follow-up costs of  		services used for 142 clients, comparing 32 who were already working  		pre-baseline and remained in the same job, 32 who obtained worked just prior to  		baseline or during the follow-up period, and 78 who remained unemployment  		throughout the follow-up period. For both the baseline and 12-month follow-up  		interviews, clients were asked to self-report service use over the prior 3  		months. A broad range of health and social services were included in the  		service cost calculations, including mental health services (appointments  		with a psychiatrist, psychologist, community psychiatric nurse, attendance at a  		day center, counseling or therapeutic group work,inpatient mental health  		care), primary care (general medical practitioner, district nurse,  		community physiotherapist, dentist or optician), local authority costs  		(day centers run by social services, home care and social work  		inputs), voluntary day center costs (day care run by not-for-profit  		agencies which are independent of the public sector) and other secondary  		National Health Services costs (hospital outpatient appointment and  		inpatient care for needs other than mental health). Employment support  		agency costs were also included and varied for each client with the number of  		their recorded contacts with the agency.</p>
<p>Among the three study groups, a clearly significant decline in service  		costs (excluding employment support service costs) was only observed for the  		persons who entered employment during the study (<i>L</i> 40.00 versus <i>L</i>  		30.34 per week), with all of this decline due to reduced mental health services  		cost. An even larger and marginally significant decline (p = 0.067) over the  		study period in service costs was observed for the persons employed prior to  		and during the entire follow-up (<i>L</i> 47.86 versus <i>L</i> 28.31 per  		week). For the group that remained unemployed during the follow-up, service  		costs (excluding employment support service) were virtually unchanged from  		baseline to follow-up. In contrast, all groups had significant change in  		employment service costs with those not employed and those remaining employed  		experiencing large declines in costs while those who moved into employment  		during the follow-up reported an increase in these costs. Summing both types of  		costs, increases in costs were only observed for those who moved into  		employment, while the other two groups experienced relatively large declines in  		costs.</p>
<p>Interpretation of these results in terms of employment impacts is  		unclear, given the correlational nature of the observed association. The  		decline in service costs for the longer-term employed persons and for the  		persons moving into employment might suggest a negative relationship, but a net  		cost reduction for the second group would only occur if post-follow-up  		employment service costs declined instead of increasing. Finally, since all  		study participants were in a SE program, inferences relating to the impact of  		SE versus alternative vocational service programs (or versus no vocational  		service at all) cannot be made.</p>
<p>Taking together the evidence presented by these two studies, along with  		the recent study by Burns et al. (2008) support the hypothesis of a negative  		correlation between working and mental health treatment costs. As noted above,  		it has been suggested that this evidence supports the thesis of a negative  		<b>causal</b> impact of employment on treatment costs. This has been viewed as  		evidence for the view that employment ameliorates, or at least does not  		exacerbate, mental health problems. In the context of the SE literature, this  		evidence along with the strong evidence of a causal IPS SE impact on employment  		rates has been interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that IPS SE provides  		substantial treatment cost savings. However, in the absence of studies that  		more effectively control for biases due to omitted variables, and due to the  		impracticality of random assignment to employment, these causal interpretations  		of the effect of working on mental health treatment costs do not  		provide a persuasive basis for estimating treatment cost savings from IPS  		SE.<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>
<h3><a name="sectionI6" id="sectionI6">6. Summary of Results Relating to  		Costs of Services and Service Cost Offsets</a></h3>
<p>In order to draw conclusions about the annual unit costs of providing  		IPS SE services, we will focus on costs per client during the initial time  		period (typically 1 year) during which the client receives services. We have  		briefly noted that fragmentary evidence supports the expectation that costs for  		supporting each client after their initial year of services will decline but  		certainly does not fall to zero on a longer-term basis (perhaps up until  		typical retirement age for most clients or the clients drop-out of  		services for other reasons). This is a relevant consideration for analyzing the  		implementation of expanded support for IPS SE services unless it can be  		demonstrated that the initial employment gains over the first 12 or 24 months  		of service can in fact be largely maintained over a longer time period with  		little additional support service. I am not aware of any evidence that supports  		this expectation at present. Moreover, the evidence concerning job turnover,  		combined with the expectation that clients who lose or leave jobs will  		generally require additional SE services to obtain and keep new jobs, argues  		against such an expectation. I therefore conjecture that a reasonable time  		pattern of SE service costs over time for each new client would involve a  		somewhat higher initial year cost, a somewhat lower cost in subsequent years,  		and a further decline in costs due to attrition from SE services. I will  		include some illustrative calculations of this time pattern below.</p>
<p>As for the costs per client during the initial year of service, the  		paper by HMC (2006) and Latimer (2004) appear to provide the most useful  		benchmarks, suggesting a unit cost figure (in 2005 dollars) in the range of  		$3,500-$5,000 per client. Both studies also present data that suggests the  		potential for relatively large reductions in unit costs if client-staff ratios  		can be maintained at levels that are above those generally observed now but  		that are still viewed as consistent with high-fidelity IPS service (e.g., about  		20 clients per ES). For that reason, it may be sensible for policy planning  		purposes to focus on the lower cost figure of this range.</p>
<p>Several other studies cited above provide annual unit cost figures that  		are quite comparable. Cimera (2008) reports annual figures (in 2005 dollars) of  		$3,565 for clients with significant disabilities and $3,932 for  		those with the most significant disabilities. The reported figures  		from Clark et al. (1996) for the early 1990s of $1,920 and $1,878 per client  		per year, when converted to 2005 dollars are approximately $2,700. In the  		randomized trial studied by Drake et al. (1999) and by Dixon et al. (2002), the  		mean annual cost per client for an IPS SE program, in 2005 dollars, was $3,669.  		Note, however, that two of the studies cited above suggest figures somewhat  		higher than the $3,500 lower end of my suggested range. Clark et al. (1998)  		report annual cost per client from a randomized IPS trial in 1992 of $3,757,  		which (based on the CPI) is equivalent to $5,249 in 2005. Also, the Bond et al.  		(1995) study reviewed by Latimer (2001) reported a per client figure of $3,020  		for the early 1990s, which would amount to roughly $4,500 in 2005 dollars.</p>
<p>Viewing the figures just discussed as per client annual costs for the  		initial year of support services, it is useful to consider an  		order-of-magnitude guesstimate of the longer-term per client costs  		for SE programs. Based on the fragmentary evidence of the time patterns of  		services for individual clients noted above, I will provide an estimate based  		on the assumption that in each subsequent year of SE service, the cost per  		client is approximately one-half of the initial year cost. Even less evidence  		is available on attrition patterns of SE clients so I will use two alternative  		assumptions: one is that 10% of clients drop out per year (implying an average  		length of SE service of 5 years) and the second is that 5% of clients drop out  		per year (for an average length of SE service of 10 years).<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup> Assuming a $3,500 per client  		initial year cost and a 3% annual real rate of discount, the foregoing  		assumptions imply a long-term per client cost of $10,581 per client with a 10%  		annual attrition rate and $17,139 per client with a 5% annual attrition rate.  		(These figures are in present value of 2005 dollars.)</p>
<p>It should be emphasized that all of the cost figures cited in this  		section thus far represent implementation costs for an IPS SE program versus no  		program at all, that is, with no cost offsets. As noted above, the evidence  		from the conversion studies where individuals were moved from  		traditional rehabilitation programs, including day programs and  		train-and-place vocational programs, to IPS SE programs is consistent  		with the argument that IPS SE is not substantially more expensive and indeed  		may be less expensive than these traditional programs. This  		suggests that the <b>incremental</b> implementation costs of a policy of  		expanding IPS SE programs by replacing traditional programs will in  		fact be quite small. However, in the absence of specific policy proposals and  		information on the target populations it is not possible to gauge the extent to  		which an offset of these traditional programs would occur.  		Moreover, the fraction of patients with SMIs who are in fact regularly served  		by these programs may be fairly small, particularly for the most costly day  		programs.<sup><font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Finally, as noted above, there is very limited hard evidence, at least  		at present, for the argument that the implementation costs of expanded SE  		programs will be offset by other treatment cost savings. However, the case for  		other types of social cost offsets of expanded SE services, relating to  		reductions in net consumption and increases in earnings, may well be somewhat  		stronger. We turn in the next sections of this report to an examination of the  		evidence for these other social cost offsets.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionI7" id="sectionI7">7. The Impact of IPS SE on Net  		Consumption by IPS SE Clients: Conceptual Issues</a></h3>
<p>As noted above in our introduction, from a societal CEA perspective, the  		costs of IPS SE programs are equivalent to impact of the programs on the net  		consumption of IPS SE clients, where net consumption equals consumption minus  		earnings, and where consumption is defined broadly to include <b>all</b> goods  		and services consumed by these clients. In the preceding sections on SE costs,  		we have examined two components of consumption impacts, namely, costs of SE  		services and cost impacts of SE on use of other mental health treatment and  		rehabilitation services.</p>
<p>A number of other components of SE clients consumption are  		difficult to measure and typically not reckoned in CEA studies of SE programs.  		These include maintenance items of private consumption, such as  		rent, food costs, clothing costs, etc. In principle, consumption of services  		provided through public or charitable organizations (rather than purchased  		directly by the clients) should also be included in total consumption figures;  		these may, however, be very difficult to capture. For example, it has often  		been noted that persons with SMI have higher-than-average numbers of contacts  		with law enforcement. Measuring and costing these contacts is, however, very  		challenging and impacts of IPS SE programs on the costs of these contacts have  		not been measured in the literature. Impacts on other publicly funded services  		that are also consumed by clients may be easier to measure or estimate, such as  		Medicaid-funded somatic health care services.</p>
<p>Let us define clients consumption, excluding the SE program  		service costs, the mental health treatment costs, and the costs of all other  		publicly funded services (Medicaid, police services, etc.), as their  		<b>private</b> consumption. Basically, this consists of goods and services  		purchased by clients directly with funds that they have access to (from their  		earnings, or from transfer income or grants from public or private sources).  		Let us also define private net consumption as their private consumption minus  		their earnings. Thus, the problem of computing a societal cost figure, given  		that we can capture costs for most SE, health treatment, mental health  		treatment and (perhaps) other public services through other data, is the  		problem of measuring SE program impact on clients private net  		consumption.</p>
<p>If clients private consumption could be easily observed, we could  		obtain SE program impact on private net consumption simply by measuring impacts  		on private consumption and on earnings. As already noted, however, private  		consumption will generally be quite difficult to measure (and in fact has not  		been measured in SE evaluation studies). Alternatively, we could make the  		assumption that the SE program has no (or hardly any) impact on private  		consumption and then the impact on net consumption is simply the negative of  		the impact on earnings. </p>
<p>Another alternative, that appears to be feasible, is to look at SE  		program impact on total client income as the impact on client private  		consumption (based on the assumption that SE impact on client saving will be  		negligible).<sup><font><a href="#note20">20</a></font></sup> To  		implement this approach, we need only assess SE program impacts on all the  		important components of client income: earnings, public transfer payments,  		private transfer payments (e.g., from family members), and other non-earned  		income (e.g., interest on financial assets). Thus, our measure of the SE  		program impact on net-private consumption is just the impact on total private  		income (which includes an earnings impacts) <b>minus</b> the impact on  		earnings.</p>
<p>Note that it is not clear a priori whether the direction of impact of an  		SE program on private net consumption of clients will be positive or negative.  		Increases in earnings could be expected to reduce other private non-earned  		income, as public or private transfer payments to clients are reduced, and  		thereby reduce private net consumption. Conversely, increased earnings may  		increase consumption (including consumption of goods or services needed for  		work) and such increases in consumption will reduce any negative SE impact on  		net consumption.</p>
<p>Note also that from a societal CEA perspective, the distinction between  		earnings in competitive jobs and earnings in jobs that are not  		competitive (i.e., sheltered, set-aside,  		transitional) is potentially important. The economic rationale for  		looking at private consumption net of earnings as component of societal cost is  		that the dollar amount of earnings is offset by the dollar amount of goods  		produced by the worker (if the worker is in fact paid her/his marginal  		product). There may be good reason to believe that in many non-competitive  		jobs, earnings exceed marginal product, which would imply that increases in  		earnings due to an SE program do not fully translate to reductions in  		net-private consumption (holding gross private consumption constant). On the  		other hand, there may be circumstances where non-competitive wages received by  		workers (e.g., those in below-minimum-wage sheltered or set-aside jobs) are  		actually less than their marginal product, in which case increases in such  		earnings due to an SE program actually understate the corresponding reductions  		in net-private consumption.<sup><font><a href="#note21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Two other minor qualifications to our proposed approach should also be  		noted. First, it seems reasonable to measure both earnings impacts and private  		consumption impacts on an after-tax basis; if clients consumption of  		public services is already captured via other measures (such as impacts on  		Medicaid costs), increases in taxes paid (either as income taxes, payroll  		taxes, or sales taxes) could be viewed as portions of private income that are  		not in fact consumed by the client and therefore should not be counted as  		consumption.<sup><font><a href="#note22">22</a></font></sup> In  		addition, it has been argued (in the context of cost-benefit analysis) that  		increases in earnings also correspond to <b>additional</b> increases in the  		value of the workers marginal output because of the presence of sales  		taxes (Bailey, 1980). In the present review, we will generally disregard these  		qualifications as presumably negligible in magnitude, though we note at the  		outset that this probably introduces a small positive bias into our  		conceptualization of the impact of SE programs on net-private  		consumption.<sup><font><a href="#note23">23</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In the next two sections of this review we first report on available  		findings from the literature on SE impacts on earnings and then on SE impacts  		on non-earned private income.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionI8" id="sectionI8">8. IPS SE Impacts on Clients  		Earnings</a></h3>
<p>While the most commonly used measures of SE program impact on  		clients success in the labor market are employment rates and weeks and  		hours of work, a number of studies have also reported estimates of impact on  		earnings. Others have not reported earnings, but have reported SE impacts on  		wage rates and hours and/or weeks of work.</p>
<p><i><b>8.1 Studies Reporting Earnings Impacts</b></i></p>
<p>In the accelerated entry randomized trial by Bond et al.  		(1995, 1995a) noted above, accelerated participants averaged over twice as much  		in employment earnings as did gradual participants ($1,525 versus $574) over a  		12-month period. Several other earlier studies reviewed by Latimer (2001) also  		reported increases in earnings following entry of patients into IPS but one of  		these studies (Rogers et al., 1995) was a very small before-after study with  		not comparison group and did not report any significance test for the observed  		earnings increase; the second study (Bailey et al., 1998) reported a  		statistically significant increase in earnings for long-term day-treatment  		clients transferring to an SE program but did not report the amount of the  		earnings increase. </p>
<p>In their quasi-experimental comparison of two CMHCs in Rhode Island that  		converted from day-treatment to IPS SE with a third CMHC that did not convert,  		Becker et al. (2001) presented results separately for the 77 study participants  		who had no previous competitive work experience in the prior 5 years and the 37  		study participants who did have such experience. For both groups, differences  		in average earnings, among the three CMHCs, in the 2-year follow-up period were  		substantial. For the first group (no work history), the two CMHCs that had  		converted reported means of $518 in earnings versus only $61 for the CMHC that  		did not convert; for the second much smaller group (with some work history) the  		two conversion CMHCs reported mean earnings of $3,675 and $1,553 versus a mean  		for the third (non-conversion) CMHC of $1,228. Variances in these means were  		large, however, so that statistical significance of these differences at the 5%  		level was not observed. </p>
<p>Results reported by Clark et al. (1998a) from the randomized comparison  		of IPS SE and GST, along with the results of baseline versus follow-up  		comparisons for both groups, provide strong evidence of a positive,  		significant, and substantial IPS SE effect on earnings. In the 18-month  		follow-up period, mean earnings per person were $3,185 for IPS versus $1,800  		for GST. Corresponding figures on changes in earnings from baseline were +$854  		for IPS versus -$139 for GST.</p>
<p>Lehman et al. (2002) report on a randomized comparison if IPS SE with a  		comprehensive PSR program, only a component of which was a vocational  		service. Only a third of the non-IPS control group received any  		vocational services at all during the intervention, with services consisting  		mostly of skills training and vocational support groups. Average wages earned  		per month for the IPS subjects rose very rapidly in the first 4 months of the  		study and generally remained in the range of $40-$50 per month through month  		18, then dropping to the $35-$40 range per month for the final 6 months of the  		study. Control group average earnings remained at $10 or below for the first 8  		months of the study and fluctuated monthly in the $10-$30 range for the rest of  		the study. It was noteworthy that during the last 5 months of the study the IPS  		average earnings figure was only about 1.5-2 times that of the control group,  		while for most of the previous months the earnings differential was much larger  		(in absolute and relative terms). The authors suggest that the very low rates  		of employment and earnings for the control group (compared to experience in  		other IPS studies) may have been due to the lack of emphasis on vocational  		services in the control groups rehabilitation program and to the high  		rate of co-occurring substance use diagnoses (50% in the past year at baseline)  		for both study groups.</p>
<p>Mueser et al. (2004) carried out a randomized trial to compare the  		IPS model to a PSR program using transitional employment, and to a standard  		vocational service involving an array of vocational programs in a group of  		inner-city clients with mainly African-American or Latino backgrounds. A  		total of 204 clients were randomized into one of the three study conditions.  		Results over the 24-month follow-up period provided strong evidence of positive  		earnings effects for IPS. Average pr client earnings over the follow-up period  		were $2,095 for the IPS group, $1,124 for the standard vocational service  		group, and $721 for the PSR group. Corresponding average earnings in  		competitive jobs were $2,078, $616, and $239; the larger differences across the  		groups reflect the much stronger emphasis on competitive work in the IPS  		approach.</p>
<p>Earnings results from the inner-city randomized trial of IPS SE program  		versus an EVR service (Drake et al., 1999) were reported separately for three  		different types of jobs and for all job combined. Average earnings per person  		over an 18-month follow-up period were $1,875 for IPS versus $154 for EVR.  		Corresponding averages for non-competitive jobs were: (1) $43 (IPS) versus  		$1,335 (EVR) for sheltered jobs; and (2) $81 (IPS) versus $516 (EVR) for  		National Industries for the Severely Handicapped (NISH) jobs. Averages for  		total earnings were $2,000 (IPS) versus $2,005 (EVR).</p>
<p>Similar findings on earnings emerged from a more recent study (Bond et  		al., 2007) based on a randomized trial of IPS versus a diversified  		placement approach (DPA), which emphasizes work readiness and offers a range of  		vocational options, including agency-run businesses and agency-contracted  		placements with community employers. The trial recruited 194 subjects  		over the period August 1999-March 2002, randomized these subjects and  		successfully follower 187 of these subjects over a 24-month follow-up period  		for each subject. Average differences in competitive earnings over this  		24-month follow-up were $5,034 for IPS versus $2,675 for the DPA group;  		corresponding averages for earnings from all employment were $5,199 (IPS)  		versus $5,244 (DPA).</p>
<p>Looking across the various studies, several conclusions emerge. First,  		IPS consistently shows superiority in increasing earnings from competitive  		employment. Second, differences between IPS and comparison groups in total  		earnings depend critically on the type of vocational program provided in the  		comparison group. When the comparison group is provided a vocational program  		with a strong employment focus and vigorous outreach (as in the EVR and DPA  		comparisons noted above), clear differences in total earnings outcomes in favor  		of IPS are not observed; but when the comparison group is a  		traditional day program or PSR program without a strong employment  		emphasis, or a program that focuses primarily on skills training with job  		finding and placement as a secondary activity, positive IPS effects are  		observed for both competitive and total earnings. Fourth, in view of the  		differences between IPS effects on competitive earnings versus IPS effects on  		total earnings, implications of these effects for private net consumption (in a  		societal CEA context) may depend on the relationship between non-competitive  		earnings and marginal product noted above. </p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the dollar magnitudes of the earnings  		differentials reported above could not, in most cases, be translated to dollars  		of purchasing power in 2005 because the earnings figures covered a range of  		different dates and adjustments for inflation were not reported in most of the  		studies. However, it is relevant to note that upward adjustment to dollars for  		2005 would involve inflations (based on the CPI) on the order of 28% (for 1995  		to 2005) to 13% (from 2000 to 2005). Also note that the length of the periods  		over which earnings differentials were reported ranged from 12 months to 24  		months.</p>
<p><i><b>8.2 Projecting Earnings Impacts from Impacts on Hours and Weeks  		Worked</b></i></p>
<p>An alternative approach to estimating IPS SE impacts on earnings is to  		estimate IPS impacts on hours of work and multiply this impact by an  		appropriate hourly wage figure.<sup><font><a href="#note24">24</a></font></sup> As in the case of earnings, only a minority  		of published studies have reported SE impacts on either annual hours of work,  		annual weeks worked, or average hours per week worked by those with jobs.</p>
<p>Looking specifically at the 11 published RCTs of high-fidelity IPS SE  		reviewed by Bond et al. (2008), four of these studies reported data on annual  		hours of work. Bond et al. (2007) reported that mean annual hours for the IPS  		group that were 64.5 hours less than for the comparison (DPA) group, but when  		the comparison was restricted to hours worked in competitive jobs, the IPS  		group averaged 155.8 hours per year more than the DPA group. Drake et al.  		(1999) reported mean annual hours for the IPS group that were 196.3 hours more  		than for the comparison (EVR) group, but did not report total hours for either  		group including non-competitive jobs. Mueser et al. (2004) reported that the  		IPS group averaged 117.25 hours per year more than the group assigned to PSR  		and 70 hours per year more than the control group with standard  		services. Looking specifically at hours of work in competitive jobs, the  		mean annual additional hours for IPS were 166.3 (versus PSR) and 134.9 (versus  		standard services). In the New Hampshire RCT of IPS versus GST (Drake et al.,  		1996), average total annual hours worked were 399.2 for IPS versus 132.8 for  		GST; it appears that the differential between IPS and GST for competitive jobs  		is even larger, but it cannot be computed directly from the figures in the  		article.</p>
<p>Seven of the RCTs in the Bond et al. (2008) reported information  		on IPS SE impacts on annual weeks worked. Bond et al. (2008) cite Drake et al.  		(1999) as reporting 10.1 mean annual weeks in competitive jobs for the IPS  		group versus 0.8 weeks for the comparison (EVR) group; they also cite Lehman et  		al. (2002) as reporting 6.0 mean weeks worked in competitive jobs for IPS  		versus 1.6 weeks for the control group. Neither Bond et al. (2008) nor the  		original studies report <b>total</b> weeks for either IPS or the control group  		including non-competitive jobs. Mueser et al. (2004) reported that the IPS  		group averaged 15.09 weeks worked per year versus 5.7 weeks for the group  		assigned to PSR and 9.52 weeks per year for the control group with  		standard services.</p>
<p>Looking specifically at hours of work in competitive jobs, the mean  		annual weeks for IPS were 14.86, 1.69, and 9.52 for IPS, PSR and standard  		services respectively. Bond et al. (2007) reported mean annual weeks worked of  		17.31 for the IPS group versus 21.94 for the comparison (DPA) group; when the  		comparison was restricted to weeks worked in competitive jobs, the IPS group  		averaged 16.15 versus 8.17 hours for the DPA group. The three remaining studies  		for which Bond et al. (2008) reported comparisons in competitive weeks worked  		were for two international studies (Latimer et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2008)  		and one study that involved a combination ACT-IPS intervention (Gold et al.,  		2006).</p>
<p><i><b>8.3 Long-Term Trajectories of Earnings Impacts</b></i></p>
<p>Evidence on long-term earnings trajectories is obviously very limited,  		largely because of the expense of conducting long-term follow-up evaluations  		and (in some cases) the scaling back or elimination of funding for IPS SE  		services. </p>
<p>Salyers et al. (2004), reporting on the long-term follow-up experience  		of 36 clients from two SE programs in New Hampshire, observed that after 10  		years 17 of the 36 clients were currently employed, working a mean of 13.7  		hours per week at a mean hourly wage of $6.55.<sup><font><a href="#note25">25</a></font></sup> This suggests a mean weekly earned income of  		approximately $90 per week for those who were currently employed, and a mean  		for the entire group of approximately $43 per week.<sup><font><a href="#note26">26</a></font></sup> (For the 33 clients with  		<b>any</b> reported work over the 10-year follow-up, the mean weekly hours and  		hourly wages at the most recent job they held were similar to those reported  		for the currently employed.)</p>
<p>While comparable figures for the entire 10-year follow-up period were  		not reported, the authors indicate only five of the 36 clients did not work at  		all during the entire follow-up, and 12 were consistently employed for at  		least 5 years. Finally, an important qualification to all these reported  		figures is that they are based on follow-up from a before-after study with no  		control group comparison; thus they almost certainly overstate the long-term  		<b>impact</b> of SE services relative to any relevant control or comparison  		group.</p>
<p>Results from a much shorter follow-up period were reported by McHugo et  		al. (1998). Clients from the 18-month randomized trial of IPS versus GST (Clark  		et al., 1998) were re-interviewed to obtain data on their hours worked over the  		24 months that followed completion of trial study period. Mean hours of work  		were significantly for the 24-month follow-up period were significantly larger  		for the IPS group (815.4 hours versus 436.2 hours), and mean total wages over  		the same period were also significantly larger for the IPS group ($5,407.19  		versus $2,624.79). Comparing the hours of work in the 24-month follow-up to the  		initial 18-month study period revealed no significant changes over time within  		each group. Thus, it appears that IPS impact on earnings (relative to the GST  		control group) did not decay in the 24-month follow-up.<sup><font><a href="#note27">27</a>, <a href="#note28">28</a></font></sup></p>
<h3><a name="sectionI9" id="sectionI9">9. IPS SE Impacts on Non-Earned  		Income/Total Income</a></h3>
<p>Reported impacts on non-earned income and total income are very scarce  		in the current literature. The only published study to date is the comparison  		of IPS SE and a GST alternative (Clark et al., 1998). The authors reported a  		significant 18-month difference in earnings favoring IPS ($3,185 versus $1,800)  		and in taxes paid ($706 versus $415).<sup><font><a href="#note29">29</a></font></sup> Non-significant differences in income  		indicated higher total income for IPS ($15,552 versus $14,276) and slightly  		lower government benefit payments for IPS ($9,992 versus $10,368). Since the  		magnitudes of the earnings differential and the total income differential were  		virtually the same, the study results support a conclusion of zero IPS SE  		impacts on social cost arising from differences in private consumption net of  		earnings between the two study groups.</p>
<p>A different conclusion emerges in this study, however, from the  		comparison of IPS versus GST <b>changes from baseline</b> in income and  		earnings. The <b>change</b> in income was $788 greater for the GST group, and  		the <b>change</b> in earnings was $992 greater for the IPS group, so the change  		in social costs for private consumption was $1,780 greater for the GST  		group.<sup><font><a href="#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="evidence" id="evidence">II. EVIDENCE ON EFFECTIVENESS OF IPS  		SERVICES</a></h2>
<p>Multiple dimensions of IPS effectiveness have been mentioned in the SE  		evaluation literature. The most prominent dimensions, of course, are  		employment-related (measured by employment rates, hours of work, job tenure,  		job quality, and other measures of job satisfaction); however, non-vocational  		dimensions such as symptom reductions, health or mental health status, and  		perceived quality of life have also been examined. While measurement of IPS  		impacts in these different effectiveness dimensions is useful for carrying out  		cost-effectiveness comparisons between IPS and other employment-focused  		interventions, in principle a social CEA of IPS services should be able to  		reduce these diverse quantitative dimensions of effectiveness to a single  		preference-weighted measure that can be used as the denominator of a CE ratio  		for comparison with other mental health interventions using the same  		effectiveness measure. Unfortunately, a widely accepted measure of this type  		does not now exist.<sup><font><a href="#note31">31</a></font></sup>  		Moreover, use of broader health-state-preference based effectiveness measures  		(e.g., preference-weighted changes in the probability of health states which  		are sometimes labeled as "quality adjusted life years" [QALYs])  		would be required for cost-effectiveness comparisons with interventions  		directed primarily at somatic health problems. There does not appear to be any  		SE literature that has applied any of these broader measures of effectiveness,  		with the result that at this time we lack a basis for CEA comparisons of IPS  		interventions with other non-mental health interventions in the health  		sector.<sup><font><a href="#note32">32</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In this review, I will focus on four general topics relating to IPS  		effectiveness. First, relying mainly on the available recent literature  		reviews, I will briefly summarize the evidence on employment-related dimensions  		of effectiveness. (Much of this evidence is related to the evidence on earnings  		that I discussed in the previous section of this paper.) Second, I will review  		the much more limited findings relating to non-vocational dimensions of  		effectiveness. Third, I will review a small number of recent studies that have  		tested enhancements to the current standard IPS model. Fourth, I  		will briefly review the literature on searching for variations in IPS  		effectiveness that appear to be related to individual client characteristics.  		This last topic is of interest for reaching conclusions about the groups of  		clients who would benefit most from broader implementation of IPS programs.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionII1" id="sectionII1">1. Employment-Related Dimensions of  		IPS Impacts</a></h3>
<p><i><b>1.1 Comparisons of Employment Rates</b></i></p>
<p>There is a large volume of compelling evidence from randomized  		controlled trials demonstrating that IPS SE programs achieve higher rates of  		<b>competitive</b> employment compared to control groups in more traditional  		rehabilitation services, and that they generally achieve higher rates of  		employment overall. Summaries of these results are provided in a number of  		literature reviews published within the past 15 years (Bond, Drake, Mueser et  		al., 1997; Drake, Becker, Clarke and Mueser, 1999; Bond et al., 2001; Latimer,  		2001; Twamley, Jeste and Lehman, 2003; Schneider, 2003; Bond, 2004; and Bond,  		Drake and Becker, 2008). The most frequently used competitive employment  		outcome measure is the rate (fraction, percent) of persons who are  		competitively employed at a particular point in time (most commonly the final  		follow-up) or the fraction (percent) with any competitive employment over the  		study period. Study follow-up periods typically range from 12 months to 24  		months. </p>
<p>The recent review by Bond et al. (2008) compiles results from seven RCTs  		in the United States and four from outside the United States reported in the  		literature over the period 1996-2008. For the seven United States studies, the  		mean rate of competitive employment at any point in the RCT was 62% (and 68% if  		one apparent outlier study was excluded); the mean for the control groups was  		24% (27% with the apparent outlier excluded). For the four non-United States  		studies, the IPS mean was 59% and the control mean was 21%. The consistency of  		these results across a variety of populations, locations, and control  		conditions is clear. It is particularly interesting to note that two of the  		RCTs focused on populations that might be expected to be less responsive to the  		IPS intervention.</p>
<p>Twamley et al. (2008) studied 50 adults age 45 and older (mean age of  		50.5 years), a group for whom human capital theory would suggest that  		investment of time and effort in obtaining employment would have a  		lower rate of return because of a shorter expected payoff period. This  		disincentive may, however, have been mitigated by the study inclusion criterion  		of a desire to work.<sup><font><a href="#note33">33</a></font></sup>  		The authors also noted the greater obstacles to work due to higher comorbidity  		rates in this population. Nevertheless, over a relatively short study period  		(12 months) competitive employment rates of 57% were achieved in the IPS arm of  		the study versus 27% for the controls.</p>
<p>Lehman et al. (2002) randomized an inner-city group of subjects with a  		high rate of lifetime substance abuse diagnoses (75%) and a very high rate of  		SSDI or SSI receipt (89%). Not surprisingly, low rates of competitive  		employment were observed for both study groups over the 24-month study period,  		though the differential between IPS (27%) and controls (7%) was still  		significant.</p>
<p>Bond et al. (2008) also compare the findings of their review, relating  		to IPS versus control differences in competitive employment rates, to the  		findings reported in five other recent reviews (including some studies of other  		SE programs, including some which were not high-fidelity). They  		observe that these findings were generally similar, with IPS competitive  		employment rates being at least twice as high as that for clients in the  		control conditions.</p>
<p>While the results reviewed by Bond et al. (2008) suggest a substantial  		consistency across studies, it is also interesting to note that there were  		considerable differences in the control conditions for the studies that they  		reviewed. In most of the United States studies, the control conditions were  		vocational programs but in the case of Lehman et al. (2002) and in one of the  		two control groups in Mueser et al. (2004), the control condition was a  		standard PSR program that did not have an exclusive focus on vocational  		outcomes. Not surprisingly, these two studies reported low rates of competitive  		employment (7% and 18% respectively) relative to control conditions in other  		United States studies.</p>
<p>In contrast, several of the other control conditions had a very strong  		focus on employment including non-competitive employment. In Drake et al.  		(1999) the control condition was an EVR programs that used  		stepwise approaches that involved prevocational experiences, primarily paid  		work adjustment training in a sheltered workshop, even though they also  		endorsed competitive employment as their goal. In Bond et al.  		(2007), the control condition was a "DPA, which emphasizes work readiness and  		offers a range of vocational options, including agency-run businesses and  		agency-contracted placements with community employers. Accordingly,  		results for the control groups in these studies tended to show high  		<b>overall</b> rates of employment even though the rates of <b>competitive</b>  		employment were not unusually high. In the Drake et al. (1999) study,  		employment rates for IPS versus control were reported for three categories of  		jobs: competitive (61% versus 9%), sheltered (11% versus 71%), and NISH  		set-aside jobs (3% versus 9%). In the Bond et al. (2007) study, employment  		rates for IPS versus DPA were as follows: competitive -- 75.0% versus 33.7%;  		agency-run business -- 0% versus 25.3%; and other paid non-competitive jobs --  		5.4% versus 15.8%. For these two studies, overall employment rates were about  		the same between IPS and control. In several other studies reviewed by Bond et  		al. (2008) that reported such relevant data, non-competitive jobs were an  		important outcome. In Lehman et al. (2002), for both IPS and control groups,  		about 45% of all jobs reported were non-competitive. The same was true for the  		two control conditions in Mueser et al. (2004), but in the latter study the IPS  		group did not report any non-competitive jobs. (Of course, in both these  		studies the <b>overall</b> employment rates were still considerably higher for  		the group than for the controls.)</p>
<p>Because the length of follow-up for these studies is two years or less,  		available evidence on longer-term IPS impacts on employment rates is not  		available from any IPS RCT studies, or from any quasi-experimental studies of  		IPS impacts. The only available data of some relevance appear to be from two  		recent descriptive studies that are limited to persons who received IPS  		services.</p>
<p>McGurk et al. (2006) present some interesting 4-year follow-up results  		from a purely descriptive study of a small number (30) of IPS SE clients in an  		ongoing program. They report that (o)f the 14 people competitively  		employed with supports during the first 2 years in SE, nine continued to work  		with supports during years 3-4, four became unemployed, and one continued to  		work without supports. They also found that (o)f the 15 clients who  		did not work during the first 2 years in SE, three left the SE program (and  		remained unemployed), 11 stayed in the program but remained unemployed during  		years 3-4, and one worked sporadically without supports. In short, for  		this group of clients in a program that continued to function over a 4-year  		period, the employment outcomes observed over the first 2 years were mostly  		maintained, with some diminution, in years 3 and 4. Of course, in the absence  		of data on a control or comparison group, we cannot translate these observed  		outcomes in evidence about longer-term IPS SE impacts.</p>
<p>Similar descriptive findings were presented for a longer follow-up  		period (8-12 years) by Becker et al. (2007) for clients who had access to IPS  		services in ongoing operation over the longer-term follow-up period. Of the 78  		IPS SE clients in two original studies, 38 were followed up in re-interviews.  		At the time of the original 18-month follow-up interview, 14 of the 38 clients  		were receiving IPS services and 11 of these were competitively employed. Of the  		remaining 24 clients, 20 were receiving no employment services and four were  		receiving non-IPS services; employment rates for these 24 clients were not  		reported. During the longer-term follow-up period, all clients reported some  		work and 27 reported working in more than half of all the months of the  		longer-term follow-up period. At the specific time of the follow-up  		re-interview, 27 of the 38 were working with 18 working in competitive jobs,  		four in set-aside jobs, two in sheltered work, and three in volunteer  		positions. Of the 27 currently working four were working more than 20 hours per  		week.<sup><font><a href="#note34">34</a></font></sup> As in the  		McGurk et al. (2006) study, comparable data for a comparison group of non-IPS  		participants (during the initial follow-up period) were not collected or  		reported, so inferences about <b>impacts</b> of IPS services cannot be  		drawn.</p>
<p><i><b>1.2 A Comment on Comparisons of With Non-competitive  		Outcomes</b></i></p>
<p>The preceding discussion raises the question of the extent to which the  		focus of employment outcome measurement should be on competitive jobs versus  		all types of jobs (including non-competitive jobs). We note that strong and  		persuasive arguments have been made for focusing on competitive jobs, based on  		commonly accepted views about the nature of the recovery process  		and the desirability of integration of persons with severe mental illness into  		the broader community. It may, however, be argued that there are also relevant  		differences between outcomes of no employment versus outcomes of  		non-competitive employment, and that some positive (albeit lesser) weight in  		overall effectiveness should be accorded to the latter outcome, even though  		this may risk diverting agency resources and priorities from the more desirable  		goal of competitive employment outcomes.<sup><font><a href="#note35">35</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The practical challenge in measuring effectiveness impacts of IPS  		programs, relative to other employment programs that do not exclusively focus  		on competitive work outcomes, is to determine whether the appropriate weight  		given to the non-competitive outcomes should be zero or should be some positive  		value (albeit less than the value of a competitive outcome). To some extent  		this determination could reflect other measurable differences in job outcomes  		that have often been noted in the literature on IPS interventions, such as  		differences in pay and differences in non-monetary outcomes such as job  		satisfaction and self-esteem. Relevant data on these particular job outcomes  		are, however, often not reported in the literature.<sup><font><a href="#note36">36</a></font></sup></p>
<p><i><b>1.3 Impacts on Other (Competitive) Employment Outcomes</b></i></p>
<p>In addition to impacts on competitive employment rates, possible impacts  		of IPS on hours of work, weeks of work, and job tenure have also been  		documented in the literature. Bond et al. (2008) report that in the four RCTs  		in their review that reported such data, for study subjects who held any  		competitive job, the rate of working in a competitive job for 20 hours or more  		at any time during the follow-up period for each study averaged 43.6% for IPS  		versus 14.2% for controls.<sup><font><a href="#note37">37</a></font></sup> Data from Bond et al. (2008) for seven RCTs  		(five in the United States) indicate the average weeks worked per year in a  		competitive job (again for those who held any competitive job) were 19.2 for  		IPS versus 18.9 for the controls. There was, however, considerable variability  		in this result across studies. Several studies (Drake et al., 1999; Mueser et  		al., 2004) found that IPS subjects with any competitive jobs worked roughly  		twice as many weeks as their counterpart control subjects, while the remaining  		United States studies reported much smaller differences but still more weeks of  		work for IPS subjects, and the two non-United States studies reported slightly  		more weeks of work for the controls. </p>
<p>Another outcome indicator that has been of particular concern in the IPS  		literature is job tenure. Bond et al. (2008) report data for six RCTs  		(including one non-United States study) on weeks worked at longest competitive  		job. Differences between IPS and control subjects are quite small, with the  		overall average being 22.0 weeks for IPS subjects versus 16.3 for controls. An  		exception to this pattern is the Hartford study (Mueser et al., 2004) in which  		the IPS subjects averaged 25.5 weeks in the longest-job while control subjects  		averaged only 4.4 weeks. Bond et al. (2008) also note that the relatively short  		follow-up periods for these RCTs truncates some jobs and creates a downward  		bias in the measure of duration for the longest-held job. While they suggest  		that this limitation argues for focusing on an alternative measure such as  		weeks worked, it is worth noting that the latter measure is at best a very  		indirect measure of job turnover rates. In a more recent manuscript (Bond and  		Kukla, 2010), an extended time frame is used to measure the longest-job and job  		turnover for 142 clients from high-fidelity IPS programs who were each followed  		for 24 months after they began a competitive job. Results indicated an average  		job tenure of 10.0 months in their initial job and an average of 1.92 jobs  		during the 24 month observation period. These results confirm the limitations  		in the longest-job statistics from the RCTs noted earlier.</p>
<p>Several studies have also reported on IPS versus control or alternative  		treatment comparisons for job satisfaction. In their RCT of IPS versus GST  		(Drake et al., 1996), the authors reported that (a)mongthose who were  		working at the 18-month interview, there wereno group differences in  		satisfaction with job. Similarly, in their RCT with inner-city clients,  		Drake et al. (1999) report that Indiana Job Satisfaction ratings  		(averaged over all jobs and all rating periods) were high for both groups and  		revealed no group difference. In the Hartford study (Mueser et al.,  		2004), the same rating scale was applied and revealed no differences between  		groups.</p>
<p>In the Bond et al. (2007) RCT comparison of IPS versus DPA, job  		satisfaction was measured, for the first paid job and the longest held paid  		job, at 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after the start of the job. IPS  		participants reported higher job satisfaction at 2 weeks, for both first and  		longest-jobs, but no differences was observed at 3 months and 6 months. It is  		also interesting to note that with the exception of the RCT of IPS versus GST  		(Drake et al., 1996), the comparisons just cited included persons holding  		non-competitive jobs as well as competitive jobs.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionII2" id="sectionII2">2. Non-vocational Dimensions of IPS  		Effectiveness</a></h3>
<p>Several of the RCTs reviewed by Bond et al. (2008) reported on detailed  		tests for non-vocational outcomes, but none reported significant differences  		between IPS treatment groups and control/comparison groups. Drake et al. (1999)  		administered the Global Assessment Scale, the expanded Brief Psychiatric Rating  		Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and sections of the Quality of Life  		Interview. They observed increases over time in both study groups and  		interpreted this result to mean that:</p>
<blockquote><p>participating in a vocational program is associated with  		  improvementsin non-vocational outcomes such as quality of life and  		  self-esteem. Because participants in the two programs engaged in similar rates  		  but different types of work, our data suggest that type of work is less  		  important than participating in a vocational program for the effect on  		  non-vocational outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their analysis of the Hartford RCT, Mueseret al. (2004) assessed  		psychiatric symptoms, overall functioning, social functioning and social  		networks, quality of life, and self-esteem with interviews conducted at  		baseline and every 6 months of the 2-year follow-up. They did report evidence  		that clients in the PSR group showed more satisfaction with their social  		relationships over time than clients in the other two study groups (IPS or  		standard services). However, no other evidence for group differences in  		non-vocational outcomes was observed. </p>
<p>In their RCT of IPS SE versus GST, Drake et al. (1996) gathered similar  		information on global functioning, quality of life, self-esteem, and  		psychiatric symptoms. Improvement over time in several of these domains was  		observed for both study groups, but no significant group differences were  		reported. Lehman et al. (2002) measured quality of life, self-esteem, work  		motivation, medication attitudes, general health, and social network. However,  		no data comparing their treatment and control groups on these measures were  		reported. One other RCT (Bond et al., 2007) reported that data for treatment  		versus control group comparisons on non-vocational outcomes (social networks  		inside and outside the workplace, hospitalizations, independent living,  		psychiatric symptoms, and quality of life) would be reported in later  		publications but we are not aware that this has yet occurred. Finally, Twamley  		et al. (2008) reported that persons in their trial who obtained competitive  		work had a significant increase (relative to those persons who did not obtain  		competitive employment) in the Global Satisfaction items from the Quality of  		Life Index, but results of intent-to-treat comparisons between their two study  		groups were not reported.<sup><font><a href="#note38">38</a></font></sup></p>
<h3><a name="sectionII3" id="sectionII3">3. Recent Tests of Enhancements to  		the IPS Model</a></h3>
<p>A fundamental departure of the IPS model from previous VR approaches is  		the notion that training activities prior to job placement are not as effective  		as placing someone in employment and then tailoring any post-placement training  		and support to the needs of the job. It is therefore of interest that recent  		tests of enhancements to the IPS model have involved the addition of training  		activities that are not linked to specific jobs but rather are targeted that  		more general obstacles to success on the job. The motivation for testing these  		enhancements to IPS arises from concerns about short job tenure and  		unsuccessful terminations (being fired or voluntarily quitting without having  		another job already in place) (McGurk et al., 2005; Mueser et al., 2005).</p>
<p>One such promising enhancement is cognitive training. In a recent RCT,  		McGurk et al. (2005) tested the addition of a cognitive training intervention  		(the Thinking Skills for Work Program) to ongoing SE services for  		clients who had experienced a job failure (defined as being fired from a job  		held for less than 3 months or a voluntary quit during the same 3-month time  		frame without having another job in place). While the sample size for the study  		was small (44 clients), 12-month follow-up differences were significant, with  		the treatment group reporting more jobs, more hours of work and more wages. For  		each of these outcomes, the treatment group result was more than ten times that  		of the control group.</p>
<p>A second type of enhancement, tested by Mueseret al. (2005) was the  		workplace fundamentals program, a skills training program designed to improve  		clients skills in identifying workplace stressors and problem  		solving, and thereby to improve job performance. In this study, 35  		clients in an IPS SE program were randomly assigned, within approximately 2  		months after obtaining a job, to either the training program or to the control  		group. Each group was then followed for an 18-month period, but no significant  		differences in job tenure, job turnover, hours or days worked, or wages were  		observed. The authors note that this result contrasted with an earlier RCT  		finding (Wallace and Tauber, 2004) that the workplace fundamentals program had  		in fact reduced turnover; they note that the earlier study was limited to  		clients with a recent history of unsuccessful job outcomes and they speculated  		that the lack of significance in their own results may be due to the use of  		inclusion criteria that did not require recent job failures.</p>
<p>Finally, in a recent study from Hong Kong, Tsang et al. (2009) used a  		three-group RCT design to compare: (1) an enhanced IPS SE program that was  		integrated with a social skills training program; (2) a standard IPS SE  		program; and (3) a traditional VR program. The authors reported  		that at the 15-month follow-up, the employment rate for the enhanced IPS group  		was significantly greater than that for the standard IPS group (78.8% versus  		53.6%) and that both were far above the rate for the traditional group (7.3%).  		The enhanced IPS group also showed significantly longer job tenure than the  		standard IPS group. Results at 7-month and 11-month follow-ups paralleled the  		results at 15 months. While the study appears to provide strong evidence that  		social skills training is a useful enhancement to standard IPS, several caveats  		are required. First, the generalizability of the intervention and results from  		Hong Kong to a United States setting is unclear. Second, Bond et al. (2008)  		cited an earlier report on the Hong Kong study and commented that their own  		literature review excluded this study because they could not verify the  		fidelity of the IPS intervention and because the outcomes included  		partially competitive employment. It is not clear if these concerns  		apply to Tsang et al. (2009), since the publication has an extensive discussion  		of fidelity assurance procedures and since there is no mention in the paper of  		partially competitive employment.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionII4" id="sectionII4">4. Variations in IPS Effectiveness  		with Client Characteristics</a></h3>
<p>The population of persons with severe/chronic mental illness who are  		potential candidates for an IPS SE intervention is heterogeneous in terms of  		diagnoses, mental health status and symptoms, education, work history,  		recipiencystatus (especially vis-à-vis SSDI and SSI), and other relevant  		socio-demographic and economic characteristics. Consequently, it is useful to  		know whether the effectiveness of IPS SE services to this population may be  		strongly influenced by the use of any targeting strategies that focus these  		policies on particular sub-populations. </p>
<p>Some direct evidence from the literature on variations in the IPS  		treatment effect among types of SE clients can be inferred by  		comparing results of studies directed at different populations (e.g.,  		inner-city residents, middle-aged and older adults) but differences among these  		studies also include variations in other factors such as comparison conditions  		(e.g., traditional vocational programs, PSR programs, diversified  		placement programs, etc.) that preclude attribution of observed differences in  		results entirely to differences in client characteristics.</p>
<p>A clearer test of variations in effectiveness by client characteristics  		can be provided within individual studies by estimating interactions of the  		treatment variable with these characteristics. Several of the studies reviewed  		here in fact tested for such interactions. Drake et al. (1996) tested for  		interactions of IPS with age, work history, and diagnosis (schizophrenia versus  		affective disorders) and found no significant effects. Mueser et al. (2004)  		tested for interactions on employment outcomes between the three study groups  		and the following client characteristics: gender, education, diagnosis, work  		history (employed in the past 5 years versus not), and substance use disorder  		at baseline. Again there were no significant interaction effects observed.</p>
<p>We note that these findings are consistent with the interpretation, from  		Drake et al. (1996), that (t)helack of interactions between program type  		and individual characteristics indicates that IPS was the preferred program for  		all of the groups that were considered. Given the relatively small sample  		sizes in these studies, it is also reasonable to question the power of these  		analyses to reject the null hypothesis of no interaction effects. This concern  		was one of the motivations for the recent meta-analysis of Campbell et al.  		(2009). This analysis used data from four RCTs (Bond et al., 2007; Mueseret  		al., 2004; Drake et al., 1996; Drake et al., 1999). Bivariateinteractions on  		effect sizes and signs were investigated between IPS and the following types of  		patient characteristics: work history, demographic characteristics, benefit  		recipiency, homelessness, primary diagnosis, psychiatric symptoms, substance  		abuse, and prior hospitalizations. In the large majority of the comparisons,  		the IPS treatment effect was significant for all patient sub-groups, leading  		the authors to conclude that IPS is an effective interaction for all patient  		sub-groups. </p>
<p>However, if we are to use a CEA framework to examine possible issues  		about targeting of new IPS programs, information is required on the size of the  		IPS impacts, within each sub-group, on the specific effectiveness measure  		employed. For example, if the employment rate is the relevant effectiveness  		measure, we need to have estimates within each sub-group on the increase in the  		probability of employment resulting from IPS versus the control condition.  		Unfortunately, a <b>standardized</b> mean difference effect size, as is  		commonly used in meta-analysis and as used by Bond et al. (2009) for IPS  		impacts on employment rates, does not provide information on this increase in  		employment probability. The same comment would apply to standardized effect  		size measures for the continuous outcome variables (weeks worked and job  		tenure) examined in Bond et al. (2009). In these cases, the unstandardizedIPS  		impacts within each sub-group would be more relevant from a cost-effectiveness  		perspective for purposes of targeting. Moreover, as the comments from Bond et  		al. (2009) suggest, a larger data set would be required to simultaneously  		control statistically for multiple client characteristics if we seek more  		detailed criteria for defining sub-groups and making any proposed targeting  		more precise.<sup><font><a href="#note39">39</a>, <a href="#note40">40</a></font></sup></p>
<h3><a name="sectionII5" id="sectionII5">5. Limitations of Studies to  		Date</a></h3>
<p>We have already noted or implied in previous comments several concerns  		about limitations in the current literature, including in particular: (1) the  		relatively short time frame for follow-up and the measurement of costs and  		effectiveness; and (2) the relatively small size of the samples in the  		individual studies. With regard to the first limitation, one solution that has  		emerged is to mount more extended follow-ups that draw upon self-reported data  		from clients.</p>
<p>We also anticipate progress with respect to the second limitation on  		several fronts. First, application of meta-analysis methods, as in Bond et al.  		(2009) is being employed to combine data sets and bring additional power to  		hypothesis testing and effectiveness measurement. However, in combining data  		sets from different study sites, we need to choose sites that are homogeneous  		with respect to <b>both</b> the intervention <b>and</b> the control/comparison  		condition. Bond et al. (2008) has noted a concern about intervention  		homogeneity regarding the sites included in the Employment Intervention  		Demonstration Project (Cook et al., 2005); however control condition  		homogeneity is also important for combining estimates of treatment effects  		(since these are, of course, estimates of the <b>difference</b> between the  		control and treatment conditions). Thus, in a pooled statistical analysis  		across sites that differ widely in their control conditions, what is required  		is allowing for interactions between site and treatment to obtain treatment  		effects that vary by site; simply controlling for a site effect that uniformly  		impacts both control and treatment groups within a site is not sufficient.</p>
<p>Second, there is at least one large-scale study that is currently under  		way (Frey et al., 2008) with a study sample size of more than 2,000 persons;  		hopefully this will be the first of a series of such studies. (Note, however,  		that this study involves a <b>combined</b> intervention of IPS SE and  		systematic medication management.) With the additional power of meta-analyses  		and larger-scale studies, it should be possible to explore more detailed  		questions relating, for example, to IPS interactions with client  		characteristics and to IPS effects on relatively infrequent but important  		outcomes such as use of mental health care resources for inpatient treatments  		or psychiatric crisis services.</p>
<p>A third concern is the very limited amount of research results  		pertaining to IPS program impacts on <b>non-earned</b> income, included income  		from public sector benefit programs. As noted above, this information can  		easily combined with information on earnings impacts to measure more accurately  		the social costs of IPS programs. A fourth concern relating to costs is the  		need to develop more information on mental health service cost and somatic  		health services cost impacts of IPS services.</p>
<p>A fifth concern is the need to make study results more broadly  		generalizable by extending the trials of IPS interventions to populations that  		have thus far been excluded from or under-represented in the studies we have  		reviewed. An important example is individuals with a recent-onset of their  		schizophrenia or other serious mental disorder. One recent small-scale RCT in  		Australia demonstrated significant impacts on employment and hours of work for  		first-episode patients (Kilackey et al., 2008), and a recent RCT in the United  		States that adapted IPS to incorporate supported education as well as  		employment has been successfully implemented (Neuchterleinet al., 2008) though  		results of the intervention have not yet been reported. Several other trials  		that incorporate IPS models for supported education and employment are also  		being fielded under the auspices of NIMH RAISE project.</p>
<p>Sixth and finally, the research to date has also provided little  		information on the subject enrollment process and the reasons why some clients  		choose not to participate in IPS services. This information could help us to  		understand these selection factors, to understand the generalizabilityof the  		research results, and perhaps assist in developing other approaches to client  		recruitment that would expand the reach of available IPS services. While we  		have some very limited information which suggests that persons enrolling have  		characteristics similar to the general population of persons served in the  		public mental health system (Drake et al., 1996), we also have data from a  		variety of sources which indicate that a large fraction of individuals with  		severe mental illness do not have jobs now but would like to work. It seems  		likely that limits on the geographic availability of IPS program services tend  		to restrict the take-up rates for such services, and it has been reported that  		the inclusion criteria for IPS trials have been fairly lenient (apart from the  		requirement that clients should have an interest in competitive work) (Bond et  		al., 2009). However, we have little or no information about: (1) the fraction  		of the eligible population within IPS program catchment areas who in fact  		enrolled; or (2) the reasons for not enrolling of those who were eligible.</p>
<p>Finally, we should bear in mind important differences between randomized  		trials and the actual working of policies to implement and expand access to and  		use of IPS SE services. The enrollment process in a randomized trial is  		different, and perhaps more resource-intensive, than the outreach and intake  		process for a newly-established or expanded IPS SE program. Thus, lessons from  		the experience with enrollment in RCTs may not necessarily apply to the take-up  		experience of new or expanded IPS SE programs outside the context of an RCT.  		Similarly, the client experience in an RCT may differ because of the need to  		participate in the research aspects of the trial, and this may have  		consequences for attrition and perhaps even effectiveness of the intervention.  		Therefore, we should not view the already substantial RCT literature as  		obviating the need for careful evaluation (either retrospective or prospective)  		of a <b>policy</b> to expand access to and use of IPS SE services outside of  		the RCT context.</p>
<h3><a name="sectionII6" id="sectionII6">6. Summary and Conclusions</a></h3>
<p>The available literature demonstrates a consistent and substantial  		short-term impact of IPS SE services on competitive employment outcomes;  		evidence of longer-term impacts is more sparsebut suggests that when these  		services continue to be available over a longer time period, competitive  		employment gains may be fairly durable. We also have accumulated a fair amount  		of evidence about the short-term cost per client-year of IPS programs but we  		have much less information about per client-year costs on a longer-term  		basis.</p>
<p>With regard to cost offsets, the literature contains at least several  		examples that suggest a fairly small <b>incremental</b> cost of IPS SE services  		for persons moved from day-treatment programs or other resource-intensive  		vocational programs. This suggests that incremental cost projections for  		policies to expand use of IPS SE services should take into account the current  		service use profile of the populations targeted for these expansions. In a time  		of stringent resource constraints, policies that expand IPS use while reducing  		expenditures on other substitute services seem to be a very  		attractive first option. Moreover, the fragmentary data cited above suggest  		that the scope for IPS SE expansion as a substitute for other vocational  		services is fairly large; and the facts that: (1) only about 25% of adults with  		SMI are currently receiving any vocational services; and (2) the majority of  		these adults express a desire to work (McQuilkenet al., 2003; Mueser et al.,  		2001) suggest that there is a potential for extending IPS SE services to  		persons not currently receiving vocational services.</p>
<p>The consistent evidence of IPS effectiveness in promoting competitive  		employment suggest that broader policy efforts to expand IPS use (to persons  		not now receiving vocational services) may also be warranted on social CEA  		grounds, but that they should be monitored and evaluated carefully. Our  		evidence base to date on longer-term IPS program costs, and on virtually all  		other elements of social costs enumerated in the Introduction to this review,  		is very limited and clearly needs to be expanded before longer-term and more  		definitive judgments about the desirable scope of policies to expand IPS  		services can be reached.<sup><font><a href="#note41">41</a></font></sup></p>
<p>On the effectiveness side of the ledger (i.e., the denominator of the  		social CE ratio for expanding IPS), we need to consider how we can synthesize  		and/or modify the various dimensions of effectiveness in the current literature  		to produce a single comprehensive effectiveness measure (akin to a  		QALY) that can be used to systematically compare further  		investments in IPS services against investments in other types of mental health  		services and investments in somatic health services. I am not aware that  		developmental work on such measures is now proceeding.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to focus additional research and development efforts on  		increasing IPS effectiveness via tailoring or enhancements of  		standard IPS services to groups of persons who are not now being  		reached by standard services or for whom outcomes have been less  		positive. Examples include recent-onset patients for whom the IPS model will  		presumably have to expand to include supported education, and cognitive  		enhancement interventions for IPS clients who have experienced difficulties in  		obtaining or holding jobs. </p>

<p><a name="note11" id="note11">According</a> to the Substance Abuse and Mental  			 Health Services Administration's 2009 Center for Mental Health Services Uniform  			 Reporting System Output Tables, 51,027 adults received evidence-based SE  			 services from providers who were part of a the State Mental Health Agency  			 system.

The number of all persons in sheltered workshops as of  			 January 2010 appears to be in excess of 400,000 (National Disability Rights  			 Network, undated); presumably a large fraction of these persons have SMI though  			 the precise number is not known. Other types of programs that often provide at  			 least some vocational services include partial hospital (day-treatment)  			 programs, clubhouses, and other psycho-social rehabilitation programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note12" id="note12">The</a> declines for both groups could reflect  			 regression to the mean phenomena, more general mental health service system  			 trends or, possibly, the fact that <b>both</b> study interventions resulted in  			 offsets of inpatient costs. A treatment-as-usual control group would be needed  			 to test the last of these possibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note13" id="note13">One</a> study cited by Latimer did report  			 substantial reductions in hospitalizations and ER/crisis services, as well as  			 in treatment costs from before to after enrollment in an SE program (Rogers et  			 al., 1995). The importance of these findings was, however, diminished by the  			 very small size (19 subjects), and the reliance on before-after comparisons  			 with no comparison or control group. Latimer also notes that the intervention  			 in this study was apparently very intensive, (costing $7,128 per client per  			 year in 1990 dollars), and suggests that the intervention actually approximated  			 an assertive community treatment (ACT) program because of the wide range of  			 services (included case management services) provided by the ESs. Latimer  			 suggests that the intervention in this case did not in fact conform with  			 fidelity to the SE model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note14" id="note14">The</a> authors do present graphic evidence,  			 however, of differences in baseline and follow-up work hours for the two  			 components of the minimum work group. In particular, the late  			 work group did have a baseline work level that was small and did not  			 increase until year 3 of the follow-up, after which it increased steadily but  			 remained well below the level of the mean hours for the steady work group. The  			 no work group had a mean of zero hours in the baseline and remained  			 very low in the follow-up years with essentially no upward trend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note15" id="note15">Outpatient</a> services hours were the sum of  			 direct service hours (including therapy, medication checks, day-treatment, and  			 case management) and mental illness management services.</p>

<p><a name="note16" id="note16">The</a> possible overstatement in significance  			 levels (i.e., understatement of p values) may also be a concern here;  			 clustering of error terms within individuals over time, and between individuals  			 from the same mental health center may have occurred and there is no indication  			 that the authors corrected for clustering in computing standard errors for  			 their regression coefficients.</p>
<p>In addition, it would be interesting to know how the decision to  			 group the late work and no work groups impacted the significance of the  			 authors findings. They do indicate that these two groups did not differ  			 significantly in their service use and cost outcome measures; but it would also  			 be helpful to know the statistical results obtained from their regressions when  			 either: (1) all three groups were allowed to have differential outcome trends;  			 or (2) the no work group was kept separate and the steady work and late work  			 groups were combined into a single grouping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note17" id="note17">It</a> should be noted that evidence of positive  			 associations between employment and other positive non-vocational outcomes  			 (improvements in symptoms, satisfaction with leisure, finances, and  			 self-esteem) has also been cited as evidence of a possible employment effect on  			 treatment cost savings. For a recent brief discussion and references, see Burns  			 et al. (2008). More direct evidence of IPS SE on these positive non-vocational  			 outcomes is discussed below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note18" id="note18">Note</a> that attrition here refers to drop-out  			 from SE services from all causes, including retirement, mortality, declining  			 health, functional recovery, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note19" id="note19">There</a> is also a question as to whether other  			 non-vocational services provided by these traditional programs  			 would, or should, continue to be provided even in the presence of expanded SE  			 programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note20" id="note20">Note</a> that even if there is an SE program impact  			 on clients savings in the short run, the longer run (life-cycle) impact  			 on savings may still be zero if clients bequests are not  			 affected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note21" id="note21">One</a> would expect that the more typical case is  			 where the SE program <b>reduces</b> non-competitive earnings while increasing  			 competitive earnings. Here again the correspondence between net earnings  			 impacts on net-private consumption depend upon the relationships of the two  			 types of earnings to the workers marginal product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note22" id="note22">However,</a> if payroll tax payments increase the  			 individuals future consumption by increasing their future Social Security  			 benefits, we cannot argue that they are unrelated to the individuals  			 private consumption.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note27" id="note27">It</a> should be noted that during the 24-month  			 follow-up period, the mix of vocational services received by each study client  			 was not restricted to the services they were assigned to during the randomized  			 trial. Also, during the follow-up period, 37% and 44% of the IPS and GST groups  			 (respectively) received no vocational services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note28" id="note28">Becker</a> et al. (2007) also provide some  			 fragmentary information that relate indirectly to earnings in a much  			 longer-term follow-up. They report in 8 to 12-year follow-up re-interviews of  			 38 IPS SE clients, 89% were receiving benefits from Social Security including  			 26% receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and 74% receiving Social  			 Security Disability Insurance (SSDI); 71% reported being covered by Medicaid.  			 Thus, to the extent that earnings gains continued over a longer-term for these  			 clients, they were still modest relative to the eligibility thresholds for  			 public sector benefits. These figures are also similar to the finding from  			 Salyers et al. (2004) that 97% of clients followed up after 10 years were still  			 receiving SSI or SSDI and 91% were still on Medicaid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note29" id="note29">Tax</a> payments include individual income and  			 payroll taxes as well as employer payroll taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note30" id="note30">This</a> study also reports differences in levels  			 and before-after changes in tax payments for IPS versus GST, but the  			 implications for social cost of private net consumption are unclear because the  			 reported tax figures appear to include employer and employee payroll tax  			 payments as well as individual income tax payments. While it might be argued  			 that income tax payments reduce private net consumption, the implications of  			 payroll tax payments for the individuals future social security benefits  			 undercut this argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note31" id="note31">For</a> a recent example of an exploratory effort  			 to develop such a measure, see Rosenheck et al., 2005.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note32" id="note32">Of</a> course, we recognize that comparisons with  			 other public programs in non-health sectors would require a more broadly  			 applicable QALY type measure, or (more realistically) a monetary  			 measure (based on willingness-to-pay principles) for the benefits of the IPS  			 program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note33" id="note33">The</a> authors also not that "all participants in  			 the study had worked in the past, and 84% had a history of consecutive  			 employment for at least 12 months."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note34" id="note34">Separate</a> results were not reported for paid  			 jobs or for competitive jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note35" id="note35">We</a> also note that one could distinguish between  			 no employment, volunteer employment, and paid non-competitive employments, on  			 the grounds that even volunteer employment should be given some positive weight  			 relative to no employment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note36" id="note36">The</a> issue has been aptly framed by Drake et al.  			 (1999):</p>
<blockquote><p>"Ultimatelythe answer to this question may involve value: Do  				we believe it is better to integrate people with mental illness into mainstream  				society, or do we want to maintain separate work settings and keep them  				segregated from society?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While most people would presumably strongly agree with a preference  			 for integration, incorporating the value of integration into a social CEA also  			 requires that it be <b>quantified</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note37" id="note37">This</a> is the average across all study  			 participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note38" id="note38">Other</a> previous studies have examined  			 differences between persons with SMI who are competitively employed and those  			 who are not in terms of non-vocational measures such as symptoms, quality of  			 life, and self-esteem. (See, for example, Bond et al., 2001.) As in the case of  			 studies of the relationship between employment and mental health services (see  			 <a href="#sectionI5">Section I.5</a> above), the causal nature of such  			 relationships is unclear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note39" id="note39">It</a> should also be noted that measures such as  			 unstandardizedodds ratios of log odds ratio coefficients from multiple logistic  			 regressions, while they are also used a kind of effect size measure, are also  			 problematic in this context for use with binary outcomes such as employment  			 rates. The problem is that the odds ratio between IPS and control conditions  			 for one patient sub-group may be much larger than that for another patient  			 sub-group even though the marginal impact on employment probabilities of IPS is  			 the same for both sub-groups. For a discussion of this point in a different  			 context (see Kraemer, 2004).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note40" id="note40">One</a> other study (Bond, Xie et al., 2007), which  			 pooled data across four RCTs and looked at variations in IPS effects by  			 SSDI/SSI beneficiary status, is also relevant to this discussion. Significant  			 IPS positive effects on competitive employment rates for all four beneficiary  			 status groupings (SSDI only, SSI only, dual recipients, and non-beneficiaries);  			 the size of the IPS versus control difference in rates was somewhat smaller for  			 non-beneficiaries but was not substantially different across the four  			 groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note41" id="note41">Another</a> important reason for a better  			 understanding of IPS program costs is the relationship of costs to any proposed  			 payment arrangement intended to encourage providers to introduce/expand the IPS  			 services that they offer. Prior experience with incentive payment arrangements  			 for providers under the Social Security Ticket to Work Program suggests that  			 implementing payment arrangements that will in fact elicit a substantial  			 provider response may be a challenge for policy makers (Cook et al., 2006;  			 Salkever, 2003).</p>
