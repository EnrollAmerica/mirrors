<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>The bulk of the Division's research over the past several years has  		addressed long-term care financing issues affecting the elderly.</p>
<p>A number of related projects have been undertaken to estimate the likely  		impact of various reforms to the long-term care financing system. Early in  		1992, Lewin/ICF completed work on a three year project to further develop the  		Brookings/ICF Long-Term Care Financing Model and make it accessible to  		researchers (<b>Long-Term Care Microsimulation Model</b>). Two major products  		resulted from this study--a final report describing the model and the  		simulations which have been performed, and the documentation for the public use  		version of this model. Readers should note that ASPE has made use of the model  		since 1985. A number of reports were generated using earlier versions of the  		model which has since been updated. These earlier simulations, reported on in  		<a href="../1989/ResBook89.htm">Volume I</a> of  		the research booklet, are now obsolete. </p>
<p>Two related studies of demand and financing have also recently been  		completed: a study of premiums for prototype private long-term care insurance  		policies (<b>Premium Pricing of Prototype Private Long-Term Care Insurance  		Policies</b>); and a study looking at the future demand for long-term care  		using simpler and more traditional modeling methods than the Brookings/ICF  		model (<b>The Future of Long-Term Care: Projections and Challenges</b>). </p>
<p>The affordability of long-term care and the economic burden on  		individuals who use long-term care services have also been examined. In  		particular, Medicaid spend-down has received attention. A number of recent  		studies have been completed using a unique longitudinal data base (<b>Estimates  		of Medicaid Asset Spend-down in Connecticut</b>). A paper has also been  		prepared synthesizing the major national and state studies on spend-down and  		analyzing their differences (<b>Synthesis of Medicaid Spend-down  		Studies</b>).</p>
<p>We have also begun to explore some of the interactions between acute and  		long-term care. A recent study on catastrophic acute and long-term care costs  		estimates the proportion of income spent by the elderly on payments for acute  		and long-term care services (<b>The Burden of Catastrophic Acute and Long-Term  		Care Costs</b>).</p>
<p>Finally, in cooperation with SysteMetrics, the Division is producing a  		number of monographs this year which analyze the long-term care financing and  		delivery system, and examine the characteristics and costs of proposals for  		reforming that system (<b>Long-Term Care Financing Policy Review</b>).</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>ESTIMATES OF MEDICAID ASSET SPEND-DOWN IN  		CONNECTICUT</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Not  		Applicable</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  Several studies have made use of the unique  		opportunity offered by the Connecticut Nursing Home Patient Registry, a  		longitudinal data base which covers all persons admitted during the years  		1978-1987. This data set attempts to get at lifetime use, which is particularly  		important to Medicaid spend-down since over half of the persons admitted to  		nursing homes have multiple stays. The likelihood of spending down during a  		stay is much higher if a person has had a previous stay. Three different  		methodologies have been applied to the data to estimate the extent of Medicaid  		asset spend-down.</p>
<p>Two studies by Bice emphasize the application of survival techniques to  		admission cohorts. In <b>Nursing Home Stays and Spend-Down in the State of  		Connecticut: 1978-1983</b> mean lengths of stay are estimated for three groups  		of patients: private pay, Medicaid at admission, and Medicaid spend-down.  		Specific subgroups are examined using data on age and gender. The author  		concludes that nearly one person out of every four who enter nursing homes as  		private pay will eventually receive some assistance from the Medicaid program.  		In <b>Nursing Home Stays and Spend Down: State of Connecticut 1983-1984</b>  		Admission Cohort the contributions of the Medicare and Medicaid programs are  		examined, including the amounts of income (from Social Security and pensions)  		paid by Medicaid recipients toward their nursing home bills. The study finds  		that those who spend-down account for nearly 45% of the total number of persons  		receiving assistance from Medicaid, and consume nearly a third of Medicaid  		nursing home expenditures.</p>
<p>Gruenberg and his colleagues analyze data on a current resident cohort  		in <b>An Analysis of the Impact of Spenddown on Medicaid Expenditures</b>. This  		study estimates how many residents began their stays as private pay, but  		eventually spent down to Medicaid eligibility. It also estimates how many  		residents were Medicaid eligible prior to admission or became eligible at  		admission. Using data on the amount of income that nursing home residents on  		Medicaid applied to their bills, the author estimated the amounts of Medicaid  		funds provided for the care of various types of nursing residents. Those who  		spent down received nearly 38% of Medicaid expenditures.</p>
<p>Another study, by Liu and Manton, <b>Nursing Home Length of Stay and  		Spend-down: Connecticut, 1977-1985</b>, uses life table procedures to estimate  		length of stay distributions from nursing home patients in Connecticut. Three  		groups of patients were examined: private pay, Medicaid at admission, and  		Medicaid spend-down. According to the study, over 14% of all nursing home  		admissions (21% of nonMedicaid admissions) spent down to Medicaid eligibility.  		In addition, the authors found that Medicaid helped pay for 55% of the total  		nursing home days provided by Connecticut facilities.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>FINANCING STUDIES USING NATIONAL NURSING  		HOME DATA</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Korbin Liu, The  		Urban Institute, Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  Two studies related to Medicaid spend-down  		were conducted using the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS) and other  		data. In <b>The Effects of Multiple Admissions on Nursing Home Use:  		Implications for "Front-end" Policies</b>, the data were used to examine the  		phenomenon of multiple nursing home admissions. This was done to determine the  		number of individuals who would be fully covered if "front-end" financing  		options were enacted. Analysis of nursing home stays indicates that 51% of  		admissions would be fully covered by a three-month benefit, but adjusting for  		multiple admissions reduces this figure to 39% of cases. In <b>Medicaid  		Spenddown in Nursing Homes and the Community</b>, the NNHS data were used to  		examine the number of nursing home residents who entered a nursing home as a  		private pay and converted to Medicaid at some point during their stay. The  		author found that approximately 10% of nursing home stays involved spend-down  		to Medicaid eligibility.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>LONG-TERM CARE MICROSIMULATION  		MODEL</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  David Kennell,  		Lewin/ICF, Inc., Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  ASPE is using the Brookings/ICF Long-Term  		Care Financing Model to simulate the utilization and costs of nursing home and  		home care by impaired elderly persons for the period 1986-2020. The model has  		been updated to include the results of the 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey  		and the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey.</p>
<p>The long-term care model begins with a nationally-representative sample  		of the adult population generated from the pension and retirement income  		(PRISM) model developed by ICF, Inc. These data include age, sex, marital  		status, labor force participation, income, assets, and other characteristics.  		The model then simulates changes in the population each year, including changes  		in each individual's economic status, disability status, utilization of  		long-term care, and methods of paying for care.</p>
<p>Two reports developed from this project describe the model and the  		simulations which have been performed with it. <b>Model Assumptions</b>  		provides pertinent details about the variables, data, and equations on which  		the model is based. <b>Designing and Using Model Simulations</b> presents a  		base case projection which assumes that current public programs and private  		financing remain unchanged. In addition, the report contains simulations of  		various measures to promote the growth of private long-term care insurance and  		to expand/create public programs.</p>
<p>Given the long time period covered by these simulations, the results are  		sensitive to the choice of assumptions about the economy and individual  		behavior. For example, the ability of the elderly to pay for long-term care out  		of their own financial resources depends, in part, on how rapidly the cost of  		long-term care increases in future years.</p>
<p>The Brookings/ICF Long-Term Care Financing Model is available to  		interested researchers. However, access to a mainframe computer and significant  		amounts of computer time are required. The computer tape containing the code of  		the model and associated input data can be purchased through NTIS. Two volumes  		of documentation have been prepared for those who have a serious interest in  		learning how to use the model. The <b>User's Guide to Specifying  		Simulations</b> discusses the parameters of the model and provides examples of  		how these parameters can be changed to simulate alternative scenarios of the  		utilization and financing of nursing home and home care by elderly persons for  		the period 1986-2020. The <b>Programmer's/Operator's Manual</b> provides  		additional information on the structure of the computer program.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>SYNTHESIS OF MEDICAID SPEND-DOWN  		STUDIES</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Brian Burwell,  		SysteMetrics, Lexington, MA</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  Medicaid spend-down is a topic of  		considerable interest in long-term care policy because it is an indication of  		the catastrophic impact of long-term care expenses on the economic status of  		disabled elderly persons. This paper provides an overview of recent research on  		Medicaid spend-down in nursing homes. It addresses major conceptual,  		methodological, and measurement issues, and provides a synthesis of recent  		findings. Implications for long-term care policy and directions for future  		research are discussed. The report concludes that between one in four and one  		in five persons enter nursing homes as private pays and spend-down to Medicaid  		eligibility. The report also concludes that more longitudinal data bases are  		needed to determine whether the research results apply to other states. More  		information is also needed on the process of spend-down, e.g., do the elderly  		liquidate their home equity to pay for care, do they transfer assets to  		children?</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>THE BURDEN OF CATASTROPHIC ACUTE AND  		LONG-TERM CARE COSTS</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Korbin Liu, The Urban Institute, Washington,  		DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This study used the National Long-Term Care  		Survey and other data sources to estimate the extent to which acute and  		long-term care service use cause disabled elderly persons to incur catastrophic  		costs. The impact of these costs is measured by proportion of income. Overall,  		about 30% of the disabled elderly living in the community spent more than 20%  		of their income on acute and long-term care. However, there is considerable  		variation across income groups. In the lowest income group, 42% spent more than  		20% of their income on care, while only 11% in the highest income group spent  		that much.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>THE FUTURE OF LONG-TERM CARE: PROJECTIONS  		AND CHALLENGES</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Bob  		Applebaum, Miami University of Ohio, Scripps Gerontology Center, Oxford, OH</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This study used data from the Decennial  		Census of Population and Housing, the National Long-Term Care Survey, and the  		National Nursing Home Survey to develop projections of the need for long-term  		care among the elderly in the years 2000, 2020, and 2040. The study prepared  		three different sets of projections, using a dynamic projections model with  		assumptions about future mortality and morbidity varying between the different  		sets.</p>
<p>The authors' constant model shows 4.9 million severely disabled in 2020,  		and another 4.8 million moderately disabled, of a total elderly population of  		52.1 million. These numbers are generally consistent with estimates generated  		by the Brookings/ICF Long-Term Care Financing Model. A longer life/lower  		disability estimate for 2020 results in somewhat lower estimates, with 4.8  		million severely disabled and 4.6 million moderately disabled of a total  		elderly population of 57.5 million. Assuming longer life with higher disability  		instead gives much higher disability numbers--7.0 million severely disabled and  		6.6 million moderately disabled, of the same 57.5 million elderly population.  		The numbers in 2040 are generally consistent with this picture, but much  		higher, due to the aging of the baby boom population.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>PREMIUM PRICING OF PROTOTYPE PRIVATE  		LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE POLICIES</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Joshua Wiener, The Brookings Institution,  		Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This project generated estimates of  		benefits, costs and premiums for prototype long-term care insurance policies to  		provide Federal, State, and local governments and private insurance companies  		with an independent estimate of the potential for long-term care insurance  		coverage. The conclusions were that premiums were especially sensitive to: age  		at purchase; whether or not the policy was fully indexed for inflation; whether  		or not the policy offered has a nonforfeiture benefit equal to the full asset  		share; and length of coverage of care.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>THE USE, COST, AND ECONOMIC BURDEN OF  		NURSING HOME CARE IN 1985</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Thomas Rice, University of North Carolina, Chapel  		Hill, NC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This study used the 1985 National Nursing  		Home Survey to examine the use and cost of nursing home care among the elderly  		population of the United States. The following questions were addressed: How  		many persons aged 65 and older used nursing homes in a given year? How long do  		they stay and what are their annual charges? How often, and, to what extent, do  		residents "spend-down" to Medicaid? How much of the annual charges were paid by  		various payers; in particular, what are annual out-of-pocket costs?</p>
<p>The study found that approximately 2.1 million persons aged 65 and older  		(7.5% of the United States elderly population) spent some time in a nursing  		home during 1985. Over 70% were women and nearly two-thirds were single,  		widowed or divorced women. Mean charges per nursing home user in 1985 were  		$9,600 and median charges were $7,700. About 53% of 1985 nursing home costs  		were paid privately, out-of-pocket, 35% by Medicaid, 8% by Medicare, and 4% by  		other sources. About 22% of nursing home residents who entered nursing homes as  		private pay patients became eligible for Medicaid during their stay.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>LONG-TERM CARE IN COMPARATIVE  		INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Pamela Doty, ASPE, Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This ongoing research involves tracking  		developments in long-term care financing and delivery in other countries. The  		current focus is on lessons to be learned from the recent implementation of  		Israel's new long-term care insurance law. Past research has focused on  		comparative cross-national institutionalization rates, the balance of medical  		to non-medical long-term care institutional use, effectiveness of funding home  		and community-based care to prevent or postpone institutionalization, relative  		reliance on public versus private financing and differences in public financing  		mechanisms. A paper on comparative financing methods was presented at the  		Brookings Institution conference in May 1988 and a general overview of  		long-term care in international perspective, highlighting comparative  		institutionalization rates, was published in the <b>Health Care Financing  		Review 1988 Supplement</b>.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED CARE IN THE  		USA</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Robert F. Clark,  		ASPE, Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This paper describes the use of long-term  		care services by the frail elderly, particularly home and community-based care.  		It describes the functionally disabled elderly population (aged 65+) and  		provides an overview of the United State's long-term care system. The paper  		discusses: (a) Medicare home health care; (b) Medicaid home health care; (c)  		Medicaid personal care services; and (d) Medicaid home and community-based care  		under Section 2176 of OBRA 1981, Section 1915(d) of Title XIX as authorized by  		OBRA 1987, and Section 4711 of OBRA 1990. It addresses other sources of support  		for home and community-based care such as the Older Americans Act, the Social  		Services Block Grant, Supplemental Security Income, and various types of  		support housing arrangements. Finally, a list of surveys, administrative data  		systems and other sources of data on home and community-based care are briefly  		described.</p>
<p>This paper was prepared as background information for the members of an  		international long-term care research team. The team is focusing on  		international comparisons of nursing home care, with emphasis on appropriate  		outcome measures, data sources and comparability of data elements. The project  		is sponsored under the aegis of the International Collaborative Effort on  		Aging, organized by the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT: DO  		THEY REQUIRE DIFFERENT KINDS OF HELP?</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Robert F. Clark, ASPE, Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  Physical impairments are commonly believed  		to require relatively more active hands-on assistance with the Activities of  		Daily Living (ADL) while cognitive impairments use relatively more supervisory  		or standby assistance. Using data from the 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey,  		this paper examines whether the type of assistance (active, standby, assistive  		device, and combinations thereof) varies by cognitive status. It differs from  		prior studies by focusing on how assistance patterns might vary for specific  		ADLs. Generally, the cognitively impaired use standby help twice as frequently  		as the cognitively intact regardless of ADL. They also use active help and  		assistive devices more frequently but the disparity with the cognitively intact  		is not so great. Additionally, there are exceptions for particular ADLs (e.g.,  		the rate of use of assistive devices in bathing is higher among the cognitively  		intact). There appears to be a relationship between cognitive status and type  		of ADL help received, but it is subtle and varies by ADL.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>UNMET NEED AMONG THE ELDERLY WITH ADL  		DISABILITIES</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Mary E.  		Jackson, SysteMetrics, Lexington, MA</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  Numerous attempts have been made over the  		past few years to estimate the number of elderly persons who are disabled.  		Fewer estimates have been generated to gauge the extent to which such persons  		go without the assistance they need. In this study estimates of unmet need were  		generated using the community resident (noninstitutional) sample of the 1984  		National Long-Term Care Survey. Estimates of the number of frail elderly with  		unmet needs depend crucially on how "disability" and "unmet need" are defined  		and measured. Using a variety of definitions, the study found that the number  		of frail elderly with unmet needs can range from approximately 199,000 to 1.8  		million in 1990. This translates to between 5.3% and 42.0% of the disabled  		elderly population.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The Activities of Daily Living (ADL) are the  		basic activities of everyday life, such as eating, bathing, dressing,  		transferring, and toileting. Reported estimates of the size of the elderly  		population with ADL disabilities differ substantially across national surveys.  		Differences in which ADL items are being measured and what constitutes a  		disability account for much of the variation. When essentially equivalent ADLs  		are compared across 11 national surveys, estimates for the community-based  		population with ADL limitations range from 5.0% to 8.1%. Policy analysts need  		to think carefully about their definitions of ADL disability and specify in  		greater details the bases of their results.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>PREVALENCE ESTIMATES OF THE FUNCTIONALLY  		IMPAIRED ELDERLY</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Mary  		Jackson, SysteMetrics, Lexington, MA</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  Numerous proposals have been advanced for  		establishing a uniform Federal benefit for home care services for the disabled  		elderly. This paper operationalizes eligibility criteria invoked in these  		proposals, and offers estimates for the number who would be eligible under  		alternative functional and cognitive criteria. Differing cut-off points (i.e.,  		number and type of activities of daily living), in conjunction with varied  		definitions of disability (need for active, standby, or mechanical assistance  		in the performance of activities of daily living) are employed in order to  		demonstrate their effect on the number and types of persons eligible under a  		uniform Federal home care benefit. When functional criteria only are used,  		estimates range from 472,000 to over three million, or 1.6%-12.5% of the  		community-dwelling population, aged 65 or older. By adding cognitive impairment  		to eligibility criteria the number eligible increases to between approximately  		one million and 4.2 million elders (3.5%-14.0%). Programmatic issues related to  		using functional and cognitive criteria for eligibility determination are  		discussed.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  Under an ASPE grant, the investigators  		examined a sample of 2,898 elderly persons living in the community in  		Massachusetts. They were age 62 or older when interviewed in 1982 and 66 or  		older when re-interviewed in 1986. Residential settings included private homes,  		apartments in facilities for the elderly, and private apartments. For sample  		members surviving over the four year period, institutional placements were  		relatively rare. Informal support was available to most elders. Formal care was  		a factor in the lives of large numbers of the elderly living in the community;  		for those in apartments, this was related to a statewide program of case  		managed home care services. The authors recommend replication of the study in  		other states. This would yield descriptive information of value for more  		effective organization of services for the frail elderly.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  While a substantial portion of long-term  		care planning occurs at the State and local level, most prevalence rate  		estimates on functional dependency are only reliable nationally. The study  		produced models that estimate the prevalence of functional dependency among the  		noninstitutionalized elderly for small areas (States and counties) for each of  		three income groups: household income less than $3,000; $3,000-40,000; and  		greater than $40,000. Specific estimates of functional dependency for each  		State and selected counties were also made. Software showing how to do these  		analyses were developed and disseminated to State and local officials.

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS IN LONG-TERM  		CARE: SERVICE USE</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Robert  		F. Clark, ASPE, Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This paper examines the residential settings  		and long-term care service use of the frail elderly in five countries:  		Australia, Canada, Netherlands, Norway and the United States. Problems of  		making cross-national comparisons are noted, particularly the lack of a  		standard definition of a "nursing home" and wide variation in data collection  		systems. With 1985 as a comparison year, in all countries, the percentage of  		elderly living independently at home is quite high, approaching 90% in some  		cases. Nursing home admission rates are lowest in the Netherlands (3.0%). In  		Norway and the Netherlands, nursing homes are developing into more  		rehabilitative and respite-oriented facilities. Home and community care systems  		have expanded in recent years in all countries, especially in Canada. Australia  		has shifted the balance between nursing homes and hostels. Concern over the  		appropriate balance between public and private financing is greatest in the  		United States.</p>
<p>This paper will be merged with papers prepared by other members of an  		international long-term care research team. The result will be an article for  		the International Journal of Health Sciences on the measurement of nursing home  		outcomes. The project is part of a number of international data and measurement  		initiatives sponsored by the International Collaborative Effort on Aging,  		organized by the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>LIFESTYLE PATTERNS AND NURSING HOME  		USE</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Robert F. Clark,  		ASPE, Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This paper will examine the relationship  		between specific lifestyle behaviors--namely, smoking, alcohol use, exercise,  		and weight control--and nursing home use among the elderly. The data come from  		the 1986 National Mortality Followback Survey. Preliminary findings are that,  		as expected, weight control and exercise can help reduce the risk of nursing  		home use. Less expected are indications that persons with a history of smoking  		and alcohol use also are associated with lower nursing home use, even while  		controlling for age. Since it is unlikely that such persons are less disabled,  		it may mean that they are accounted for disproportionately in other long-term  		care settings, such as board and care homes.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This paper will address the use of various  		health-related and supportive services by the frail elderly living in the  		community. The data come from the 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey. The  		paper will present a series of cross-tabulations showing the use of various  		services by persons aged 65-74, 75-84, and 85+. The services will include: (a)  		adult day care/senior center; (b) prior nursing home use; (c) nursing home wait  		list; (d) hospital stay; (e) therapy: physical, occupational, speech; (f)  		mental health services; (g) selected medical specialty: dentist, foot doctor,  		optometrist, chiropractor; (h) emergency room or hospital clinic; (i)  		availability of a regular source of medical care; and (j) home health aide or  		nurse's aide services.</p>

<div class="bordered-text">
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>Research in this area addresses the characteristics and outcomes  		associated with both the formal and informal systems of delivering long-term  		care services and how the two systems interact.</p>
<p>The major research project of the Division in this area was the National  		Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration co-sponsored with the Health Care  		Financing Administration and the Administration on Aging. This multi-year, ten  		State randomized experiment was designed to test the cost-effectiveness of  		comprehensive case management and home care. The reports from this  		demonstration contain a great deal of information on home and community-based  		services, and the data base should be a rich source for further research for  		years to come. The final report on Channeling and the public use tapes were  		published in 1986 (<b>National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration</b>). A  		recent project which uses the Channeling data is <b>Reducing Nursing Home  		Utilization Costs Through Community-Based Long-Term Care: An Optimalization  		Analysis Using Data from the National Channeling Demonstration</b>. </p>
<p>Other Division studies recently completed or underway include a  		<b>Survey of Medicaid Personal Care Programs</b>, and a number of studies on  		informal caregiving. Also underway and not yet completed is a study of  		<b>Supportive Housing for the Frail Elderly</b>. The Division is also carrying  		a new initiative on informal caregiving which will culminate in a conference in  		the fall of 1992.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE FRAIL  		ELDERLY</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Robert Elliott,  		University of Pennsylvania, University Park, PA</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This paper, prepared by an ASPE student  		intern, provides an overview of assistive technology for the frail elderly.  		According to the Office of Technology Assessment, in 1985 there were over  		18,000 devices available to aid the functionally impaired elderly. The number  		has grown since then. The devices range in sophistication from a modified  		eating utensil to computerized voice simulators. The paper discusses barriers  		to the acceptance of assistive technology, such as inadequate training of users  		and inappropriate match of equipment of needs. The author concludes that  		properly used, assistive technology can help improve the quality of life for  		the frail elderly and enable many people to remain functionally independent.  		Assistive devices can also alleviate some of the burden of informal caregivers.  		From a research perspective, the overall costs, benefits and financing of  		assistive technology need to be better understood.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This study reviews the evidence on access to  		nursing home beds and concludes that several elderly who seek admission to  		nursing homes in some geographic areas are unable to obtain access. In  		particular, those with heavy care needs may experience discharge delays in  		hospitals, and Medicaid enrollees tend to have greater access problems than  		private pay patients. The limited supply of nursing home beds appears to be the  		primary reason for access problems.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH A BREAKDOWN IN  		CAREGIVING AMONG INFORMAL CAREGIVERS TO THE FUNCTIONALLY AND COGNITIVELY  		IMPAIRED ELDERLY POPULATION</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Judith Kasper, Johns Hopkins University,  		Baltimore, MD</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This study investigated the reasons that  		principal informal caregivers of the activity of daily living (ADL) dependent  		elderly decided to end caregiving. Data were from the 1982 and 1984 National  		Long-Term Care Surveys and the 1982 Informal Caregiver Survey. Two definitions  		of "ending caregiving" were used in the analyses: the first included all  		reasons why a particular individual chose to end caregiving other than the care  		recipients' death; the second definition looked at the decision to end informal  		caregiving in the community by placing the disabled elderly person in a nursing  		home. In the first definition, institutionalization was the outcome in only  		about half the decisions; in the other half of the cases, either the individual  		had recovered and no longer needed care or some other family member was now  		providing care. Factors associated with the decisions to end caregiving under  		both definitions included a non-spouse caregiver and assisting the elderly care  		recipient with three or more ADL impairments. Factors found to be specifically  		associated with the decision to seek institutional placement were the care  		recipient's cognitive impairment and the caregiver's expressed view that  		caregiving was "emotionally difficult." Being unable to leave the care  		recipient alone and experiencing more stress than satisfaction from the  		caregiving role were also related to decisions to end caregiving under the  		broader definition.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  A consistent finding of community-based  		long-term care demonstrations, including Channeling, is that these programs do  		not lead to net reductions in long-term care expenditures. Even though reducing  		nursing home costs was a goal of these demonstrations, none involved systematic  		managerial and resource allocation strategies specifically designed to reach  		this goal. Rather, resource allocation decisions were left largely to the  		professional judgment of case managers. This study addressed whether long-term  		care resources can in fact be allocated strategically among clients to reduce  		nursing home use and costs. It used the techniques of econometrics and  		mathematical optimization to address this question, using data from the  		Channeling demonstration. Essentially, the study found that higher skilled  		rather than lower skilled care in the community was a more cost-effective way  		to delay or prevent institutionalization.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This study assessed a variety of  		longitudinal models to examine the effect of different types of caregiver  		burden on outcomes important to policymakers: nursing home admissions, hospital  		use, and stability of the family and formal care networks. Analyses were  		carried out on the 1982 National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS), a nationally  		representative sample of the functionally disabled elderly living in the  		community, and the 1984 NLTCS Longitudinal Followup, along with the 1982-1983  		Informal Caregiver Survey, a representative sample of informal caregivers of  		the moderate to severely disabled elderly in the NLTCS (those with one or more  		ADL impairment). Among the findings: informal caregiver networks were found to  		be highly stable over time; formal caregiver networks fluctuated more,  		apparently responding more to time-specific needs. Caregivers who reported  		higher levels of "personal burden" (a dimension that included a number of  		elements such as lack of free time, having to provide care when the caregiver  		was sick, the caregiver experiencing worsening health, having to provide  		constant attention, etc.) were more likely over time to use or increase use of  		formal services. Caregivers who reported higher levels of "interpersonal  		burden" (a dimension that measured stress-producing characteristics of the care  		recipient such as senility, forgetfulness, yelling, and embarrassing behavior)  		were more likely over time to seek institutional placement for the elderly  		disabled care recipient.</p>

<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>Research in this section addresses long-term care quality concerns  		including the quality of public home and community-based services, quality  		concerns surrounding residential arrangements for persons with disabilities and  		consumer protection issues arising from the emergence of private sector  		financing arrangements. Recently work was completed on a study of the issues  		related to <b>Consumer Protection and Private Long-Term Care Insurance</b>. The  		Division is also engaged in a major study of the quality of care in board and  		care homes with an emphasis on the role of state regulation in promoting  		quality. Past work included a study of the quality of the post acute care  		system <b>Pilot Study of the Adequacy of Post-Hospital Community Care for the  		Elderly</b>.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>CONSUMER PROTECTION AND PRIVATE LONG-TERM  		CARE INSURANCE</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  David  		Kennell, Lewin/ICF, Inc., Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This paper reviews the current status of  		consumer protection issues associated with private long-term care insurance. It  		examines possible roles that the Federal government might play in this area.  		The views of a panel of experts drawn from government, industry, academia, and  		consumer organizations are reported. The panel concluded that the Federal  		government could make an important contribution by educating consumers about  		long term care insurance and related issues. Clarifying the tax status of these  		products, collecting better data on the risk of long term care, and expanding  		the capabilities of state insurance departments would also help. The panel did  		not reach consensus on whether certain specific features should be required on  		all policies, e.g., inflation protection and nonforfeiture benefits. These  		issues are currently under review by the National Association of Insurance  		Commissioners Long Term Care Task Force.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The purpose of this study was to collect  		background information and identify issues related to the Federal role in  		assuring and promoting quality home and community-based services or people with  		developmental disabilities. Underlying the project was a clear distinction  		between: (a) minimum compliance with regulations; and (b) proactive efforts to  		enhance programs. The goal was to identify a way to promote the latter without  		compromising the former. The researcher reviewed recent literature on quality  		assurance, conducted site visits to four states with innovative quality systems  		(Connecticut, Michigan, Oregon, and Pennsylvania), and held discussions with  		Federal and state agency staff, advocates, Congressional staff, providers and  		researchers. The researcher identified significant gaps in the knowledge base,  		most significantly, the question of how to translate values and mission  		statements into quality system design and service delivery.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>PILOT STUDY OF THE ADEQUACY OF  		POST-HOSPITAL COMMUNITY CARE FOR THE ELDERLY</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Barbara Phillips, Mathematica Policy Research,  		Inc., Princeton, NJ</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  One prominent response of hospitals to the  		necessity of controlling costs under Medicare's Prospective Payment System  		(PPS) has been a reduction in hospital lengths of stay. Patients appear to be  		sicker when they are discharged now than was the case prior to PPS. Sicker  		patients probably require more health and personal care services upon  		discharge.</p>
<p>The current evidence on the adequacy of post-hospital community care is  		largely impressionistic. A systematic assessment is required to develop  		objective evidence on the extent of problems and whether they lead to adverse  		health outcomes for patients. The methodology available up to now had not been  		adequate to support a systematic assessment of national scope. The primary  		limitation of this methodology is that it has required physician review of  		individual cases, which is difficult to implement in a national study and has  		often been found to be unreliable.</p>
<p>This study, sponsored jointly with the Health Care Financing  		Administration's Office of Research and Demonstrations, developed and tested a  		new methodology intended to overcome these limitations and to permit a  		systematic, national assessment of the adequacy of post-hospital care in the  		community for elderly patients and whether inadequate care leads to adverse  		health outcomes. The key to this methodology is a series of "guidelines" which  		specify standards for the amount of care that is minimally adequate to prevent  		adverse health outcomes for elderly patients with a wide variety of conditions  		commonly requiring post-hospital care in the community.</p>
<p>The methodology was implemented in a pilot study in nine hospitals in  		two states. The conclusion of the pilot is that the methodology is generally  		valid, feasible, and effective although some refinements are required. The  		guidelines (taken as a group) provide a reasonable definition of minimally  		adequate care.</p>

<div class="bordered-text">
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>Most of the Division's research in disability focuses on people with  		mental retardation or other developmental disabilities (MR/DD) who are likely  		to need long-term services and supports. The Division has sponsored studies to  		define the population, examine their characteristics, service needs and where  		they live, and identify how services are financed.</p>
<p>In late 1988, ASPE released the final report of the Departmental Working  		Group on MR/DD Financing (<b>Report to the Secretary from the Working Group on  		Policies Affecting Mentally Retarded and Other Developmentally Disabled  		Persons</b>). This report examined Federal policy barriers to community-based  		services and outlined alternative reform strategies. More recently the Division  		completed a study of children with high medical care costs to determine their  		characteristics and Medicaid experience (<b>Study of Disabled or High Cost  		Children</b>).</p>
<p>The Division has initiated several new disability related projects over  		the past few years including: a study of heath care financing issues affecting  		children and working age adults with disabilities, using the National Health  		Interview Survey; and a study of community supported living services targeted  		at persons with MR/DD.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>COMMUNITY PROGRAM SIZE AND  		QUALITY</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  James Conroy,  		Temple University, Philadelphia, PA</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The project examined the relationship  		between community residential size and quality of care for persons with  		developmental disabilities. Differences in cost and among small facilities  		(less than ten residents) are of special interest. Results are based on data  		from the National Consumer Survey and from detailed analysis of two  		States--Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Overall, information from the National  		Consumer Survey indicate that generally people are more satisfied and better  		integrated in group homes with less than ten residents than in larger places.  		Data from the two States show that while there are no real differences in  		family/consumer satisfaction between group homes of size 5 and size 7 or 8,  		there appears to be more satisfaction in group homes below size 5. Cost data  		are mixed. Smaller group homes in Pennsylvania appear to cost slightly more,  		but no relationship between cost and size in Connecticut can be  		ascertained.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>STUDY OF MEDICAID FINANCING FOR DISABLED  		OR HIGH COST CHILDREN</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL  		INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Marilyn Rymer Ellwood, SysteMetrics, Lexington,  		MA</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The Congress, DHHS, and other Federal  		agencies have expressed considerable interest in the adequacy of current  		programs and policies affecting severely disabled children, particularly those  		who are technology dependent and whose health and medical care place  		catastrophic financing and caregiving burdens on their families. This project  		used the Medicaid tape-to-tape and other data to estimate the numbers of  		children experiencing catastrophic health care expenses, the level of  		expenditures and sources of payment and their service utilization patterns.</p>
<p>All children who qualify for Medicaid through the Supplemental Security  		Income (SSI) program are studied in <b>SSI-Related Disabled Children and  		Medicaid</b>. This report analyzed the 1984 Medicaid claims of all children  		with SSI-related Medicaid coverage in California, Georgia, and Michigan in  		order to determine the enrollment, utilization, and expenditure patterns of  		these children. The study estimated the proportion of Medicaid expenditures  		attributable to SSI-related disabled children.</p>
<p><b>Variations in the Medicaid Safety Net for Children and Youth with  		High Medical Costs: A Comparison of Four States</b> analyzed the Medicaid  		experience of children and young adults with total annual Medicaid claims of  		$25,000 or more in California, Georgia, Michigan, and Tennessee in order to  		better understand service utilization patterns and how they vary by age and  		other characteristics. An important part of the study involved analysis of the  		Medicaid eligibility pathways.</p>
<p><b>Longitudinal Analysis of High Cost Medicaid Children in  		California</b> follows a cohort of children for several years during the 1980s.  		This report analyzed the Medicaid experience of children in California who had  		at least $25,000 in claims in 1983. The study analyzed Medicaid claims over the  		period 1980-1986 in order to determine whether these children remain high cost  		over a number of years, and whether their eligibility changes over time.</p>
<p>The relationship between Medicaid and other payers in California is  		examined using data on all pediatric hospitalizations in <b>Who is Paying the  		Big Bills? Very High Cost Pediatric Hospitalizations in California, 1987</b>.  		This report analyzed data on all pediatric hospitalizations costing $25,000 or  		more in California to determine the relationship between source of payment and  		various characteristics, including age and diagnosis.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  This project will identify the ways that  		Medicaid can be used to finance supported employment and prevocational services  		for beneficiaries with mental retardation and related conditions. The potential  		cost and impact of these services will be analyzed. As part of this research,  		information would be collected on the feasibility and appropriateness of  		offering supported employment and prevocational services to all waiver  		participants, community supported living arrangement participants and ICF/MR  		residents. The researcher will identify barriers and develop policy options to  		expand supported employment services.

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The purpose of this project is to provide  		three special studies of health and long-term care financing issues affecting  		nonelderly persons with disabilities. The three studies will be derived from  		nearly a decade of data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). These  		studies are:</p>
<p><b>The Medically Uninsurable Study</b> will examine the number and  		characteristics of persons unable to obtain health insurance, because of a  		disability or chronic medical condition. Comparisons will also be made to  		disabled persons with health insurance, nondisabled persons without health  		insurance, and the general population. This report will synthesize health  		insurance trends during the 1980s for persons with disabilities.</p>
<p><b>The Mental Illness and Mental Retardation Study</b> will provide a  		profile of children, working-age adults, and older people with mental illness  		or mental retardation who reside in community settings. The profile would focus  		on the size and characteristics of the two groups and examine closely the  		degree to which mental illness or mental retardation is linked to limitation of  		activity. This report would use the 1989 Mental Health Supplement, along with  		data from previous years of the NHIS.</p>
<p><b>The Disability and the Family Study</b> will examine the prevalence  		of disability in families, as other sources suggest that when one member of the  		family is disabled, there is a high probability that there are other disabled  		persons in the family as well. Various years of the NHIS will be used.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>COMMUNITY SUPPORTED LIVING  		SERVICES</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Brian Burwell,  		SysteMetrics, Lexington, MA</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  Community supported living programs are a  		significant departure from traditional, continuum-based, developmental models  		of residential services for people with developmental disabilities. Several  		state mental retardation service systems, as well as national policy leaders  		have embraced supported living approaches, recognizing them as a vehicle to  		translate into reality the lofty goals of independence, integration, and  		productivity. The Department has encouraged the growth of these models in its  		home and community-based waiver program and in the new "community supported  		living arrangements" (CSLA) Medicaid state plan option.</p>
<p>With this project, the Division is taking a closer look at how supported  		living programs work, identifying strengths and weaknesses of the approach, and  		beginning to quantify cost and program effectiveness. The project will provide  		descriptions of five established community supported living programs for people  		with developmental disabilities. The project will identify the elements of  		these programs that contribute to their success. In addition, national data on  		the strengths and weaknesses, cost-effectiveness and extent of the use of this  		model is being collected and analyzed. The project staff will work with experts  		to develop a short and long range research agenda on community supported living  		services. The final product will be a policy paper which describes the programs  		that were visited, and outlines the policy issues in this new service modality.  		The paper will also include an evaluation plan for CSLA.</p>

<div class="bordered-text">
<h3>A. Overview</h3>
</div>
<p>The Division has a long-standing commitment to improving basic data on  		disability and long-term care. In recent years, it has sponsored the National  		Long-Term Care Survey including the National Survey of Caregivers in 1982,  		cooperated with the National Long-Term Care Survey of 1984, and co-sponsored  		the National Long-Term Care Survey of 1989. Public use files have been made  		available from the National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration. In  		addition, a Conference on DHHS Long-Term Care Data Bases was held in 1987 to  		enhance their accessibility to researchers and private insurers. Current  		efforts include support of the National Mortality Followback Survey of 1986,  		and a design study for a national survey of people with developmental  		disabilities and a design study for board and care homes.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>NATIONAL BOARD AND CARE SURVEY  		DESIGN</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Mary Naifeh,  		Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  Board and care living arrangements for  		dependent populations (frail elderly, developmentally disabled and mentally  		ill) are an increasingly important part of the long-term care continuum. Under  		an interagency agreement with ASPE and the Office of the Assistant Secretary  		for Health, the Census Bureau examined the feasibility of using the 1990 Census  		as a sampling frame for a national survey of licensed and unlicensed board and  		care homes. A feasibility study was conducted in Missouri, which was the 1988  		dress rehearsal site for the 1990 Census. Based on the results, two separate  		instruments were recommended for a national survey, one for housing units and  		one for group quarters (institutional and noninstitutional). Other  		recommendations included more refined screening procedures and additional  		questions to distinguish board and care homes from more professional and  		medically-oriented places. With these changes, the study concluded that the  		decennial census provides a feasible frame for identifying and obtaining data  		from a nationally representative sample of board and care homes.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>NATIONAL LONG-TERM CARE SURVEY</i></b>  		<i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Kenneth Manton, Duke University,  		Durham, NC</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  A grant from the National Institute on Aging  		(NIA) to Duke University supported the creation of a longitudinal data set  		comprised of three waves of the National Long-Term Care Survey (1982, 1984, and  		1989) conducted by the Census Bureau and data extracted from Medicare Part A  		files (1980-1989). The focus is on changes in functional and health  		characteristics as well as long-term care service use among a nationally  		representative sample of elderly impaired persons.</p>
<p>The Division supplemented the NIA grant to permit additional data  		collection in three areas: (a) the effects of supply on the use of long-term  		care services, (b) the treatment of income and assets by persons with nursing  		home stays, and (c) patterns of informal caregiving. A public use tape is  		available.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The National Long-Term Care Survey is a very  		rich yet complex data base involving three separate interview waves (1982,  		1984, and 1989) and multiple components. The complexity of the data base had  		led to a number of issues related to utilization of the Survey for research  		purposes. As part of its objective to encourage the utilization of data bases,  		sponsored by DHHS, ASPE held a one-day forum for users of the National  		Long-Term Care Survey.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>NATIONAL MORTALITY FOLLOWBACK  		SURVEY</i></b> <i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Gloria Kapantais,  		National Center for Health Statistics, Rockville, MD</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The 1986 National Followback Survey is a  		nationally representative sample of 20,000 persons who died in 1986. The survey  		contains information about health and functional status of the decedent and the  		use of acute and long-term care services in the year prior to death. The survey  		was designed and managed by the National Center for Health Statistics; data  		collection was carried out by the Census Bureau. Nine agencies inside and  		outside the Department provided funding and technical support. ASPE provided  		funding and support to acquire data on impairments and use of long-term care  		services in the last year of life.</p>

<p><b>TITLE</b>:  <b><i>NATIONAL SURVEY OF THE MENTALLY RETARDED  		AND DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED/ COORDINATED DISABILITY SURVEY</i></b>  		<i>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR</i>:  Not applicable</p>
<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  Persons with mental retardation or other  		developmental disabilities (MR/DD) are a population of particular policy  		interest to ASPE. The absence of nationally representative data on the size and  		characteristics of the MR/DD population has been a significant barrier to  		estimating the budgetary impact and program outcomes of alternative financing  		options. To obtain information about the MR/DD population and other disabled  		populations (disabled children, SSI recipients, SSDI recipients), the National  		Center for Health Statistics is planning to conduct in 1993 and 1994 a  		supplement to the National Health Interview Survey called the Coordinated  		Disability Survey. ASPE has provided impetus for the survey, provided initial  		funding (for the MR/DD portion) through interagency transfers and contributed  		to the survey design and development of questionnaires. At present, Phase One,  		which will screen for the disabled population and obtain preliminary data, is  		scheduled for implementation. Phase Two is detailed followup interviews with  		persons screened in as disabled to collect service use and expenditure data is  		under development.</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b>:  The purpose of this project is to prepare  		the written report of the Departmental Coordinating Group on Disability Data.  		The Group was created by ASPE in 1989 in order to provide a policy framework  		for the many policy issues (i.e., employment, access to health care, and  		long-term care) that face the Department pertaining to the nonelderly  		disabled.</p>
<p>The report will contain: (1) descriptions of planned and on-going  		Federal disability data collection efforts; (2) key disability policy issues;  		(3) definitional and measurement problems; (4) the availability and adequacy of  		information on special populations, such as the mentally  		retarded/developmentally disabled, the mentally ill, and physically disabled  		adults; (5) gaps in disability data; and (6) specific recommendations for  		satisfying policy research needs on disability during the coming decade.</p>
<p>Information was compiled from presentations made by individual agencies  		at the Group's meetings and interviews with Departmental policymakers.</p>
