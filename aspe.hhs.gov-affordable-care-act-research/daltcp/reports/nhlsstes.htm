<p>This paper describes research to estimate the rates of nursing home  		admissions and to identify the determinants of long and short stays in nursing  		homes. The research employed recently available data from the 1982 and 1984  		National Long-Term Care Surveys. Hence, the results are both nationally  		representative and indicative of current nursing how use patterns by the  		disabled elderly population. The information presented has implications for  		public and private long-tem care policies.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Nursing homes are used for different purposes ranging from short-term  		rehabilitative care for persons recovering from an acute illness to long-term  		care for persons with chronic disabilities that preclude their residency in the  		community. Because of the different reasons why people enter nursing homes,  		estimates of the risks of nursing home entry and the costs of nursing home care  		over time need to be made for patient subgroups. One useful categorization with  		implications for service use is that of long- and short-stay patients.</p>
<p>To date, the identification and measurement of long- versus short-stay  		nursing home episodes have been based primarily on surveys of persons already  		in nursing homes. Several studies of the 1977 National Nursing Home Survey  		described the admission characteristics and utilization patterns of nursing  		home patients after they were in institutions (Keeler et al., 1981; Liu and  		Manton, 1983, 1984). Generally, data have <b>not</b> been available to explore  		the risk of nursing home admission by reasons for nursing home use and  		circumstances <b>preceding</b> admission. With few exceptions (Hughes et al.,  		1987), studies of nursing home risks have also generally not distinguished  		between the various types of nursing home admissions.</p>
<p>That nursing homes are used by long and short stayers suggests that the  		determinants of institutionalization might be different for the two subgroups  		in the nursing home population. Moreover, because of the dramatic difference in  		their consumption of nursing home days, each group of patients bas different  		policy implications. For this reason, it is important to differentiate the  		characteristics of disabled older persons that predispose them to one or the  		other type of nursing home admission.</p>
<p>In this paper, we present information from the 1982 and 1984 National  		Long-Term Care Surveys (NLTCS) to describe the relationship between personal  		characteristics of older persons and their use of nursing homes. The aims of  		this analysis are to characterize the risks of nursing home use, distinguish  		between nursing home users who are long- and short-stay patients, and describe  		the relationship between nursing home use and functional and other personal  		status. In the following sections, we describe the 1982 and 1984 NLTCS and  		results from both descriptive and multivariate analyses.</p>
<h2><a name="data" id="data">II. DATA SOURCE</a></h2>
<p><b>The 1982 National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS)</b>. The 1982 survey  		was a nationally representative survey of the Medicare population age 65 and  		older needing assistance with one or more Activities of Daily Living (ADL) or  		Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) on a long-term basis. A sample  		of 36,000 Medicare enrollees was drawn from the Health Care Financing  		Administration enrollee files and interviewed by telephone to identify those  		with assistance needs. Persons identified as requiring assistance with ADLs or  		IADLs for a period of three months or longer were interviewed personally in the  		second phase of the survey. Persons residing in institutions were excluded from  		the 1982 detailed interviews. No attempt was made to obtain information on  		deceased persons.</p>
<p>For all 36,000 sampled individuals, the screener document contained data  		on age, race, sex and birth date. For each of nine ADL and seven IADL items,  		the person was asked if he or she had problems performing that activity and the  		duration of the difficulty. If the individual responded that the actual or  		expected duration had been (or was expected to be) more than three months, the  		respondent was given the detailed interview.</p>
<p>The detailed portion of the long-term care survey was administered to  		all noninstitutionalized persons with chronic (90 days +) difficulty performing  		one or more ADL or IADL functions as indicated by the screener--6,393 persons  		qualified for interviews. Questions on functional status asked about the  		presence of 17 chronic medical conditions, and whether in the last 12 months  		any of 12 medical events had occurred (e.g., heart attack, stroke, broken hip,  		etc.). A series of detailed questions were asked regarding each function  		included in the ADL scale: eating, transferring, walking, dressing, bathing and  		toileting. Questions on health insurance involved coverage by Medicaid,  		CHAMPUS, other public assistance programs, or private health insurance.</p>
<p>Respondents were also asked a series of questions about stays in a  		nursing home or hospital, including admission dates and durations. Income  		questions addressed receipt of payments by any family member in the past month  		from various sources (e.g., Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits,  		Supplementary Security Income, wages, salaries).</p>
<p>In the NLTCS, cognitive impairment could be measured in several ways.  		Some portion of the sample in 1982 was administered the Short Portable mental  		Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ), which is a clinical aide for identifying  		cognitive impairment (Pfeiffer, 1975). Other members of the sample had proxy  		respondents and were not administered the SPMSQ, but proxy respondents were  		asked if the sample person were "senile."</p>
<p><b>The 1984 NLTC Survey</b>. The 1984 survey had both longitudinal and  		cross-sectional components. The survey was intended, in part, to provide  		insights into the factors contributing to or inhibiting change in functional  		and health status and institutionalization.</p>
<p>To conduct our analysis of the patterns of nursing home use between 1982  		and 1984 by long- and short-stay patients, we focused on the sample of persons  		for whom information was available in both the 1982 and 1984 NLTCS. By 1984,  		most of these individuals were found either in the community or in nursing  		homes. A third possibility was that individuals in the 1982 sample died between  		1982 and 1984.</p>
<p>Three types of survey instruments were used in addition to the screener  		and control card. A community questionnaire similar to the 1982 survey  		instrument was used for all functionally limited persons living in the  		community. This instrument was administered to community residents who were  		functionally disabled in 1982 and who continued to reside in the community in  		1984.</p>
<p>A questionnaire to obtain information about deceased persons was unique  		to the 1984 study. This instrument had two sections: health care and personal  		information. The health care section elicited data on nursing home,  		convalescent home and hospital stays if that was where the patient died.  		Questions included the sources of payment for those stays. For patients who did  		not die in such institutions, the questionnaire asked about stays just prior to  		death. There were also questions about earlier periods of institutionalization.  		A specific question about hospice care was included. Finally, there were  		questions about others who provided care to the decedent, both paid and unpaid  		helpers. Personal information surveyed included marital status, race, ethnic  		origin and income.</p>
<p>A questionnaire for institutionalized persons included four sections:  		(1) cognitive functions, (2) ADL impairments, (3) payment sources at admission  		and at the time of survey, and (4) certified beds. As with the other  		questionnaires, there was an indicator for whether the sample person or a proxy  		answered the questions. Questions were asked about admission to nursing homes  		and periods of institutionalization prior to admission. There was also a  		question about hospital stays in the last 12 months. Finally, it was determined  		who paid for care, both at admission and on the date of the survey.</p>
<h2><a name="analysis" id="analysis">III. DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS</a></h2>
<p><b>Transitions between 1982 and 1984</b>. <a href="nhlsstes.htm#table1">Table 1</a>  		presents the distributions of the 1982 sample by their 1984 residential status.  		About 72 percent of the community disabled persons in 1982 were still community  		residents in 1984. Only 7 percent were in nursing homes in 1984 while almost 21  		percent died in the intervening two years. The mortality rate of this sample is  		consistent with estimates from other studies of this age group (Manton, 1987).  		The proportion of persons in nursing homes after two years (7.1%) is higher  		than that recorded from the Longitudinal Study on Aging (Kovar, 1988), but may  		be explained, in part, by the fact that the NLTCS sample consisted of disabled  		persons in 1982.</p>
<p><a href="nhlsstes.htm#table1">Table 1</a> also contains the 1984 residential status  		of subgroups of the 1982 community residents by their demographic and  		functional characteristics in 1982. As expected, the risk of being a nursing  		home resident increased with age, rising from 4 percent for those 65-74 to 12  		percent for persons over age 85. Higher rates of nursing home use were found  		for females, whites, persons living alone, and those who were not married.  		Income was negatively related to nursing home use. Persons in the lowest income  		bracket had a risk of entering nursing homes more than double that of persons  		in the highest income bracket, i.e., 8.8 percent versus 3.6 percent. This  		relationship suggests that persons in the highest income groups had more  		resources to purchase home care which enabled them to remain in the community.  		Another explanation for this relationship is that higher income groups may have  		had a better overall health status than lower income groups.</p>
<p><a href="nhlsstes.htm#table1">Table 1</a> also presents distributions of the  		subgroups by disability status and select health conditions. The data indicate  		that nursing home residency is strongly related to a person's functional  		impairment level. A monotonic increase in use up to ADL 5-6 is observed.  		Persons with 5 to 6 ADL dependencies had a slightly lower use of nursing homes  		than persons with 3 to 4 ADLs, 9.8 percent versus 10.0 percent. Because of  		their severe disabilities, we might expect individuals with 5 to 6 ADLs to have  		had the highest rate of nursing home use. This ADL subgroup, however, also had  		high competing risks of mortality; that is, this subgroup may have had the  		highest use rate if many members had not died. Previous research using the  		NLTCS has shown that mortality risk during the 1982-84 period for the 1982  		community sample was related directly to disability in 1982 (Manton, 1987).  		Health conditions that were found most strongly associated with being a nursing  		home resident were hip fracture and stroke. Persons with lung diseases had the  		lowest risk of being nursing home patients.</p>
<p><b>Risks of Nursing Home Admission</b>. Although <a href="nhlsstes.htm#table1">Table  		1</a> presented the proportion of community residents who were found in nursing  		homes after two years, it does not fully represent the risk of using a nursing  		home at some time during the two-year interim. Some individuals, for example,  		could have entered a nursing home and died or returned to the community. A  		longitudinal assessment of nursing home admissions indicates far more use of  		long-term care facilities than is commonly reported in cross-sectional data. As  		<a href="nhlsstes.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a> illustrates, nearly twice as many study  		participants reported using a long-term care facility during the interim as  		were residents of one at the time of the 1984 survey. Slightly more than 13  		percent of the 1982 sample, 776 persons, had experienced at least one nursing  		home episode during the study interim. of these, however, only 7 percent, 414  		persons, were living in a nursing home in 1984. This comparison suggests that  		almost half of the nursing home admissions were for relatively short periods of  		tire.</p>
<p>Because the 1984 NLTCS elicited detailed information on nursing home use  		in the two years since the 1982 NLTCS, we were able to estimate the total  		incidence of nursing home admissions in this period, as well as to distinguish  		admissions that were long versus short stay. In this initial analysis we  		identified persons who entered nursing homes during the interval and who were  		no longer in nursing homes in 1984 as "short-stay" patients. Also included in  		this group of "short-stay" patients were persons who used a nursing home  		facility and died during the 1982-1984 interim. The assumption underlying this  		distinction is the observation that institutionalized persons captured in a  		cross-sectional sample (e.g. persons in nursing homes at the time of the 1984  		survey) tended to have much longer lengths of stay on average than persons in  		an admission or discharge sample (Manton et al., 1984). For example, the median  		length of completed stays in the 1977 NNHS discharge sample was 75 days while  		the average length of stay in the 1977 NNHS current resident sample was 597  		days (NCHS, 1979).</p>
<p><a href="nhlsstes.htm#table2">Table 2</a> presents the percent of persons who  		entered nursing homes at any time between 1982 and 1984 by socioeconomic and  		functional status in 1982. The column headed "All Users of Nursing Homes  		Between 1982 and 1984" refers to the 776 persons who experienced at least one  		nursing home episode during the period. <a href="nhlsstes.htm#table2">Table 2</a> also  		presents the ratio of 1984 current residents to all users between 1982 and  		1984. This measure was derived by dividing the number of 1984 current  		residents, as reflected by <a href="nhlsstes.htm#table1">Table 1</a>, by the numbers of all  		users between 1982 and 1984. On the basis of 1984 current residents  		representing long-stay patients, the higher the ratio the more likely a  		particular characteristic of a persons is associated with being a long-stay  		resident.</p>
<p>Similar to the cross-sectional data reported in <a href="nhlsstes.htm#table1">Table  		1</a>, the longitudinal data in <a href="nhlsstes.htm#table2">Table 2</a> show that the  		risk of nursing home use is strongly related to personal characteristics and  		disability level. A high rate of nursing home use was found for females,  		unmarried persons, and persons living alone. As expected, age was strongly  		related to nursing home use. About 23 percent of persons 85 and older entered a  		nursing home sometime during the two-year period between 1982 and 1984, while  		only 7 percent of persons aged 65 to 74 entered a nursing home during the same  		period. Also as expected, the risk of admission to nursing homes increased as  		functional status declined. only 8 percent of persons with IADLs, used nursing  		homes, whereas 19 percent of persons with ADL 5-6 entered nursing homes. Stroke  		and hip fracture were associated with a high risk of nursing home admission,  		while persons with lung disease had the lowest risk. These conditions were  		predictive of both any nursing home use and long-stay users. Only persons with  		incomes of $20,000 and more seem to have particularly low rates of nursing home  		use, approximately half of the rate of their counterparts with less than  		$20,000 of income.</p>
<p>We can use the ratio of 1984 residents to all users in the two-year  		period to identify characteristics of persons that are related to long versus  		short stays. By age, the ratio of residents to any users suggests that the  		"young-olds" who use nursing homes at all are likely to be long stayers, while  		older counterparts (i.e., 75+) are more likely to be short stayers. Being  		female, not married, and living alone are characteristics associated not only  		with higher risk of entering nursing homes, but also higher risks of being  		long-term stayers of nursing homes. No difference exists in the, ratio by race,  		although major differences were found in the use rates by race.</p>
<p>Persons who were more disabled tended to be associated with short stays.  		This is probably because their use of nursing homes was associated with  		postacute care. Higher proportions of long stayers in the IADL subgroup may  		have been due to problems such as cognitive impairments. Persons who entered  		nursing homes with a history of cancer in 1982 had the smallest proportion who  		were long stayers (40%), most likely because they were at high risk of dying by  		1984.</p>
<p>The income pattern suggests the proportion of long-stay patients  		declines as income increases. This. might reflect higher income persons staying  		in the community longer because of a greater ability to purchase supplemental  		home-based care. Hence, their use of nursing homes might have been for the  		final stage of an episode of illness.</p>
<p><b>Long and Short Stayers in Nursing Homes</b>. So far we have referred  		to the presence of long and short stayers among the persons who entered nursing  		homes between 1982 and 1984. We have also discussed the likelihood of being a  		long stayer if a person were found in a cross-sectional sample of nursing home  		patients. To address the issue of length of stay more directly, we derived the  		length-of-stay distributions of the nursing home users between 1982 and 1984 by  		the characteristics of their nursing home experience. Specifically, we derived  		lengths of stay for persons who (1) were in nursing homes in 1984 (the expected  		long stayers), (2) had entered nursing homes but had returned to the community  		by 1984, and (3) had entered nursing homes and were dead by 1984. These  		results, along with the distribution for all nursing home patients between 1982  		and 1984, are presented in <a href="nhlsstes.htm#table3">Table 3</a>.</p>
<p>The first column indicates that approximately 20 percent of the nursing  		home patients were found in each of the length-of-stay categories: The length  		of stay patterns are distinctly different, however, when each of the subsets  		are examined. Among the expected long stayers, the persons still in nursing  		homes in 1984, 34 percent had been institutionalized for over one year, whereas  		only 22 percent had been in nursing homes for less than 3 months. It should be  		noted that the lengths of stay of persons in this group are incomplete because  		we were only able to measure the duration between admission to the date of the  		1984 survey. Since all of the persons in this category were still nursing home  		patients, their eventual length of stay could be considerably longer than that  		measured in the 1984 survey. Hence, even persons in the less-than-three-months  		category could have eventual lengths of stay that would allow them to be  		classified as long-term nursing home patients.</p>
<p>In contrast to the long stayers, persons who entered nursing homes and  		returned to the community, and those who died, had dramatically different  		length-of-stay distributions. Among the short stayers who returned to the  		community, over two-thirds were in nursing homes for less than 3 months, with  		10 percent staying for more than 6 months. Among the short stayers who died by  		1984, only 27 percent stayed for more than 6 months. Hence, the length-of-stay  		patterns of the long and short stayers are inversely related.</p>
<p>The results in <a href="nhlsstes.htm#table3">Table 3</a> suggest that our strategy  		for disaggregating long- and short-stay patients is reasonable. Although we  		found persons with longer than 6 month stays in both the short-stay groups, the  		proportions were relatively small. We also found partial lengths of stay that  		were short among persons in the long-stay group. Since in 1984 only incomplete  		duration could be recorded for this group, it is likely that few persons would  		ultimately be short stayers. Future research could refine the estimate of  		whether persons were long or short stays by considering such characteristics as  		Admission diagnoses and ADL at admission.</p>
<h2><a name="multi" id="multi">IV. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF NURSING HOME  		ADMISSIONS</a></h2>
<p>In the prior sections we examined the relationships between personal  		characteristics of disabled individuals living in the community in 1982 and  		various outcomes in the intervening two years, including the rate at which they  		entered nursing homes. The tables presented the univariate distribution by  		characteristics. In this section, we examine the direction and magnitude of  		impact of multiple variables on the risks of nursing home admissions.</p>
<p>We employed logistic regression analyses to determine the effects of the  		factors examined above along with additional characteristics. Because we expect  		that the characteristics predicting long-stay patients are likely to be  		different than those predicting short-stay patients, we developed separate  		models. Hence, this section presents results of analyses of three categories of  		nursing home patients: (1) all nursing home users between 1982 and 1984; (2)  		persons who were in nursing homes at the time of the survey in 1984, the long  		stayers; and (3) persons who were admitted to nursing homes between 1982 and  		1984 but either returned to the community or had died by the tire of the survey  		in 1984. We combined the community and dead groups to increase the size of the  		short-stay group.</p>
<p>The dependent variable in this analysis, nursing home admission, is  		qualitative. In other words, it is binary with individuals either entering or  		not entering nursing homes. Because of the binary dependent variable, we used a  		multimonial logit model (Nerlove and Press., 1973). The results of this  		analysis are presented in terms of risk odds ratio (RM) which expresses the  		risk of nursing home admission for persons with a particular characteristic  		relative to those without the characteristic.</p>
<p>The variables that we used to predict nursing home admission were  		socio-demographic characteristics, medical conditions, ADL limitations  		cognitive impairment status, income, formal and informal community-based care,  		and prior nursing home use. All of the characteristics were based on responses  		to the 1982 NLTCS. For categorical independent variables, one level of the  		variable was omitted. Coefficients for the included variables can be  		interpreted as deviations in the logit from the omitted group.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Medical conditions</b>. Nine categories of medical conditions  			 were created from the 1982 NLTCS. Some of the source variables from the survey  			 were combined to create the categories. For example, bronchitis, emphysema and  			 asthma were combined into the lung disease category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>ADL limitations</b>. Four categories of ADL were created: (1)  			 only Instrumenntal Activities of Daily Living (IADL); (2) one or two ADLs; (3)  			 Three or four ADLs, and (4) Five or six ADLs. In the regression analyses, the  			 IADL category was omitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cognitive status</b>. Five categories of cognitive status were  			 created. Sample persons with proxy respondents were divided into two groups  			 those indicated by their proxies to be senile and those who were not senile  			 according to the proxies. The remaining sample persons were grouped according  			 to their SPMSQ scores (Pfeiffer, 1975); mild to no impairment, moderately  			 impaired and severely impaired. In the regression analyses, the category  			 representing mildly or not impaired according to SPMSQ scores was  			 omitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Socio-demographic characteristics</b>. Age, sex, race, marital  			 status, living arrangements, home ownership, and metropolitan residency were  			 included in the analyses. The age category for persons 65-74 was omitted from  			 the regression analyses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Income</b>. Sample persons and spouse income was grouped into 5  			 broad categories ranging from less than $4,000 to more than $20,000 per year in  			 1982. The income category $4-7,000 was omitted from the regression analyses. In  			 addition, Medicaid status in 1982 was included as a separate variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Community-based care</b>. Volume of community care was  			 operationalized by recording total episodes of care per week by all helpers;  			 normally this measure reflected the volume of assistance from more than one  			 person. Four groups were created ranging from no helper days to 15+ helper days  			 per week. The category 1-5 helper days per week was omitted from the regression  			 analysis. As an approximation of the financial burden of community-based care,  			 we also developed a measure of paid care as a percent of income. Categories of  			 this measure ranged from zero percent to 25+ percent. The category representing  			 zero out-of-pocket payments was omitted from the regression analyses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Prior nursing home use</b>. A nursing home stay prior to the 1982  			 survey was included to determine if individuals who had been reported to enter  			 nursing homes had a higher risk of reentering nursing homes than persons who  			 had never been institutionalized.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>All Users of Nursing Homes</b>. <a href="nhlsstes.htm#table4">Table 4</a>  		presents the results of the logistic regression analysis for all nursing home  		stays between 1982 and 1984. The first column presents the sample means for  		each of the characteristics that were used to predict nursing home admission.  		Since we used the same characteristics for each model, these means apply to  		subsequent models as well. The second column in <a href="nhlsstes.htm#table4">Table 4</a>  		presents the coefficients for each of the variables and their level of  		statistical significance. The third column presents the relative odds  		ratio.</p>
<p>Among the medical conditions, arthritis and lung disease were found to  		have a negative and statistically significant effect on nursing home  		admissions, whereas cancer and neurological diseases increased the risk of  		nursing home admission. The relative odds ratio indicates, for example, that a  		person with cancer in 1982 had 1.42 times the odds of entering nursing homes as  		a person who did not have cancer (ROR = 1.42), all other characteristics in the  		table being equal. In contrast, persons with lung diseases had lower odds of  		entering nursing homes than persons who did not have lung disease (ROR =  		.70)</p>
<p>Higher levels of activities of daily living were also associated with  		risk of entering nursing homes. In comparison to persons with only IADL level  		disabilities, persons dependent in ADLs had higher risks of entering nursing  		homes. Although the ADL 5-6 group appeared to have a slightly lower risk than  		the ADL 3-4 group, this might be explained by the high risk of mortality in the  		former. Because of the competing risk of mortality, the observed risk of  		entering nursing homes was likely to be lower than would be expected in the  		absence of mortality.</p>
<p>The presence of cognitive impairments increased the likelihood of  		entering nursing homes. Persons who were judged senile by proxies and those  		rated as moderately impaired based on SPMSQ scores had more than two times the  		risk of entering nursing homes as those persons who were mildly or not  		cognitively impaired according to their SPMSQ scores. The higher risk of  		entering nursing homes for those persons judged "not senile" by a proxy was  		probably due to unmeasured health or functional problems that demanded that a  		proxy respond to the survey.</p>
<p>Advanced age is a significant predictor of nursing home use. Persons  		75-84 had almost twice the likelihood of entering nursing homes as persons aged  		65-74 (i.e., ROR = 1.99). Persons aged 85 and over had an even higher risk than  		65-74 year olds--almost two and one-half to one (ROR = 2.48). Being white was  		also associated with a higher likelihood of entering nursing homes. Living  		alone increased the risk of entering nursing homes by 55 percent.</p>
<p>Income was not related to the risk of nursing home admission except for  		those with incomes greater than $20,000 per year. Persons with this level of  		income had a lower risk (ROR = .58) of entering nursing homes than persons with  		incomes between $4-7,000. Moreover, Medicaid status did not predict nursing  		home admission risks.</p>
<p>No significant differences in risk of entering nursing homes was found  		for different levels of community-based care received in 1982. Percent of  		income used for paid home-based care did, however, seem to make a difference.  		In comparison to persons who spent nothing, persons spending 1-10 percent (ROR  		= 1.27) and persons spending 11-25 percent (ROR = 1.86) had higher risks of  		nursing home entry. Although persons who spent more than 25 percent of their  		income also had a positive coefficient, this result was not statistically  		significant. Finally, prior nursing home use was strongly related to  		readmission to nursing homes. Persons who had been nursing home patients had  		twice the risk of those who had not.</p>
<p><b>Differences Between Long and Short Stayers</b>. In this section, we  		compare the determinants of long- and short-stay patients of nursing homes.  		<a href="nhlsstes.htm#table5">Table 5</a> presents the results of two separate regression  		analyses. The first two columns contain the coefficients and relative odds  		ratios for long-stay patients (i.e., persons institutionalized in 1984), and  		the third and fourth columns contain similar information for persons admitted  		between 1982 and 1984 but were not in nursing homes at the tire of the 1984  		survey, the short stayers. In the following, we focus on the relative odds  		ratios for variables that are statistically significant for either or both of  		the regressions.</p>
<p>Among the conditions, persons with neurological diseases had 1.28 times  		the odds of entering nursing homes for extended durations as those without  		neurological disease. On the other hand, cancer increased the likelihood that  		persons entered for short stays. These results are consistent with the natural  		history of the two diseases and the likely reasons why persons with such  		conditions use nursing homes. Neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's, tend  		to be characterized by relatively long periods of severe functional  		disabilities requiring continuous supervision. For many families, the  		caregiving burdens associated with managing a family member with Parkinson's  		would be too much to bear at home, so a prolonged stay in a nursing home is  		likely. On the other hand, persons entering nursing homes because of cancer  		have a strong likelihood of being placed there for terminal care associated  		with the final segment of an episode of illness.</p>
<p>ADL status was positively associated with nursing home admission for  		both long- and short-stay patients. For long-stay patients the ADL 3-4 category  		had a ROR of 1.60 indicating a high risk for this group relative to persons  		with only IADL problems. For short-stay patients, all three ADL groups had  		higher relative odds of entering nursing homes than the omitted IADL group. The  		competing risk of mortality may be responsible, in part, for the ADL 5-6 group  		not exhibiting the highest level of long-stay nursing home use. It appears that  		competing mortality risks may have caused the relative odds ratios for those  		with 5-6 ADLs from being the highest for the short-stay patients as well.</p>
<p>All four cognitive impairment categories had significantly higher risks  		of long-term nursing home stays in comparison to persons with no cognitive  		impairments. The moderately impaired SPMSQ group had two and one-half times and  		the severely impaired SPMSQ group had four times the risk of the cognitively  		intact persons. Persons judged senile by proxies had a ROR of 2.75. The  		positive ROR of persons judged not senile by proxies probably represented  		unmeasured health or functional problems predisposing the individuals to long  		stays in nursing homes. In contrast to the importance of cognitive impairment  		in increasing the risks of nursing home admissions for long stays, this factor  		did not appear to affect short stays. Only the proxy judged senility status had  		a significant coefficient, indicating a 45 percent increase in the likelihood  		of entering nursing homes for a short stay.</p>
<p>Increasing age was significantly associated with increasing risks of  		both long and short stays in nursing homes. Based on the ROR scores, it appears  		that age is a stronger predictor for short stays. Surprisingly, sex was not  		predictive of the risks of either long or short nursing home stays when all  		other factors were held constant. Being white increased the risks of both long  		and short stays in nursing homes. As might be expected, persons living alone  		had higher risks of long stays in nursing homes, but not short ones. Owning  		one's own home reduced the risk of long stays in nursing homes, and had no  		effect an short-stay risks. As with all nursing home admissions, only those  		with greater than $20,000 income had significantly lower risks of a long stay.  		This category had a ROR = .53. Income had no effects on short-stay risks.  		Medicaid status had no effects on either long- or short-stay risks.</p>
<p>Persons with no community-based caregiver days had a slightly lower risk  		of entering nursing homes for long stays than the omitted category of persons  		with 1-5 days of helpers. This result suggests that persons using no  		community-based care were probably healthier than persons who did use services  		in terms of some unmeasured health factor. The significant RORs for persons  		with out-of-pocket expenditures suggest an association between use of paid care  		and long-stay nursing home risks. The interpretation of this association,  		however, is difficult. It is likely that out-of-pocket payments represent  		unmeasured health problems that would predispose individuals to entering  		nursing homes. It is possible that paid care is an inadequate substitute for  		informal caregiving requirements; that is, persons had sufficient resources to  		purchase some amount of formal care, but could not afford the volume or type of  		care that would be available from spouse and other family members. It is also  		possible that high out-of-pocket expenditures created a situation where  		insufficient finances stimulated decisions to enter nursing homes possibly as  		Medicaid patients. All of these reasons appear to be plausible, but we do not  		have the information to determine the effect of each.</p>
<p>Prior nursing home use increased the risk of entering nursing homes for  		long stays by two-to-one (ROR = 2.08) and the risks of entering nursing homes  		for a short stay by 50 percent. It is unknown whether the nursing home use that  		we observed between 1982 and 1984, either long or short, was for the same  		condition as the stay before 1982. Nonetheless, it is likely that a person's  		health status, as reflected by a prior nursing home stay, was vulnerable to a  		future nursing home admission.</p>
<p>The multivariate analysis of nursing home admissions presented in this  		section confirmed and clarified the results of the univariate analyses  		presented earlier. The determinants of "any nursing home use" have been found  		in other studies (Cohen, et al., 1986; Branch and Jette, 1982). Few studies,  		however, have distinguished long from short nursing home stays, so the results  		of this disaggregation of types of nursing home patients provide new insights.  		The specific factors that predict long-stay, in contrast to short-stay, nursing  		home patients appear to be intuitively and clinically reasonable.</p>
<h2><a name="summary" id="summary">V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION</a></h2>
<p>The two objectives of the research reported were to estimate the rates  		of nursing home admissions and to identify the determinants of nursing home  		admissions. This information is important for the development of financing  		options for long-term care such as private insurance. In conjunction with  		length-of-stay information, risks of admission provide the necessary data to  		estimate the potential costs of specific policies. At the present time, only  		partial information is available from area studies or nationally representative  		studies with old data. This study was developed to provide information on  		nursing home admissions based an the recently available 1982 and 1984 National  		Long-Term Care Surveys. Hence, the results are both nationally representative  		and indicative of current nursing home utilization patterns by the disabled  		elderly population.</p>
<p>We found that 13 percent of the functionally impaired elderly living in  		the community in 1982 entered nursing homes in the following two years. We  		estimate, however, that only about 50 percent of the nursing home admissions  		were for long-term care, with the remainder being short-term convalescent or  		terminal care. For the consideration of long term care policies, the  		distinction between long and short stays appears to be critical, since the  		short-stay patients are unlikely to be in nursing homes long enough to incur  		private insurance benefits, although they would likely be Medicare SNF  		patients.</p>
<p>Results from the analyses were consistent, for the most part, with prior  		research. Higher nursing home use was found for older persons, females, whites,  		and persons living alone. Health status was also related to nursing home use in  		the expected directions. Higher ADL levels and specific conditions such as  		cancer were related to higher rates of nursing home use. Cognitive impairment  		was also strongly related to use of nursing homes, with the highest rates being  		observed for those with the most severe impairments based on the SPMSQ or on  		the judgment of proxy respondents. Income was negatively related to nursing  		home use, with particularly low rates being observed for persons with more than  		$20,000 per year. Finally, persons with prior nursing home use had considerably  		higher use rates than those who had not been institutionalized in the past.</p>
<p>To distinguish long from short stayers in nursing homes in this study,  		we defined long stayers to be those persons who were found in nursing homes at  		the time of the 1984 NLTCS. Prior research has shown that the "stock" of  		nursing home patients captured in a point-in-time survey tend to have  		dramatically longer stays than persons who are admitted and discharged during a  		short interval of time. To validate the definition that we employed, we  		measured the lengths of stay of persons who were institutionalized and those  		who had been admitted and discharged between 1982 and 1984. This comparison  		showed that even the incomplete lengths of stay of the institutionalized group  		were dramatically longer than the completed stays of the persons who were  		admitted and discharged.</p>
<p>We conducted analyses to determine the factors that were associated with  		risk of short- and long-stay patients separately. Some of the characteristics  		of disabled elderly persons predicted both long and short stays, while others  		were significantly associated with one type of stay but not with the other. For  		example, although age was positively associated with the risk of both long and  		short stays, living alone was associated with higher risks only for long-stay  		patients. The medical conditions also showed contrasting patterns for long- and  		short-stay patients. Persons with neurological impairments had higher risks of  		entering nursing homes for long stays, whereas cancer patients had higher risks  		of short stays.</p>
<p>Since the long stayers are the subgroup of nursing home patients who  		would be likely to use most of the nursing home days, information on this group  		would be the most valuable new information for the consideration of public and  		private long term care policies. In addition to the examples noted above, we  		found that private expenses for home-based care was associated with higher odds  		of entering nursing homes. We also found that persons with some community care  		had higher risks of entering nursing homes than those with no care, although  		the member of helper days, among persons with some help, did not appear to  		differentiate risks of nursing home admissions.</p>
<p>Although this research has produced new findings from a recent survey of  		disabled elderly persons, additional analyses with this and other data sources  		would further our understanding of nursing home risks. For example, we used  		individual conditions as potential predictors of nursing home use. Because of  		the clinical complexity of older persons, a strategy that reflects the multiple  		chronic conditions of given persons might provide more significant results than  		were found. In addition, improved results might be obtained if competing risks  		of nursing home admission and mortality could be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>In conclusion, information on the factors determining nursing home use  		presented above were intended to guide the development of public and private  		long-term care policies. Perhaps most important, this project distinguished  		between long- and short-stay nursing home users. Because of the dramatic  		difference in their consumption of nursing hone days, each group of nursing  		home patients has different policy implications. For this reason, it is  		important to differentiate the characteristics of disabled older persons that  		predispose them to one or the other type of nursing home admission.</p>
