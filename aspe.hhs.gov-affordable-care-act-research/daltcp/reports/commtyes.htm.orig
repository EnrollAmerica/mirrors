<hr /><p>In September 1980 the National Long Term Care Demonstration--known as  		"channeling"--was initiated by three units of the U.S. Department of Health and  		Human Services. It was to be a rigorous test of comprehensive case management  		of community case as a way to contain the rapidly increasing costs of long term  		case for the elderly while both providing adequate care to those in need and  		improving the quality of their lives.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>A. INTERVENTION</h2>
<p>Channeling was designed to use comprehensive case management to allocate  		community services appropriately to the frail elderly who needed long term  		care. The specific goal was to enable elderly persons, whenever appropriate, to  		remain in their own homes rather than enter nursing homes. Channeling had no  		direct control over medical or nursing home care expenditures. It financed  		direct community services, to a lesser or greater degree, according to the  		channeling model, but always as part of a comprehensive plan of care in the  		community. Channeling was implemented through local channeling projects.</p>
<p>Channeling consisted of seven core features:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Outreach</i> to identify and attract potential clients who were  			 at high risk of entering a long term care institution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Standardized eligibility screening</i> to determine whether an  			 applicant met the following pre-established criteria: (a) Age: must be 65 years  			 or older. (b) Functional disability: must have two moderate disabilities in  			 performing activities of daily living (ADL), or three severe impairments in  			 ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), or two  			 severe IADL impairments and one severe ADL disability. Cognitive or behavioral  			 difficulties affecting the ability to perform ADL can count as one of the  			 severe IADL impairments. (c) Unmet needs: must have an unmet need (expected to  			 last for at least six months) for two or more services or an informal support  			 system in danger of collapse. (d) Residence: must be living in the community or  			 (if institutionalized) certified as likely to be discharged into the community  			 within three months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Comprehensive in-person assessment</i> to identify the problems,  			 resources, and service needs of individual clients in preparation for  			 developing a care plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Initial care planning</i> to specify the types and amount of care  			 required to meet the identified needs of clients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Service arrangement</i> to implement the care plan through the  			 provision of both formal and informal in-home and community services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Ongoing monitoring</i> to ensure that services are appropriately  			 delivered and continue to meet the needs of clients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Periodic reassessment</i> to adjust care plans to the changing  			 needs of clients</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Two models of channeling were tested. The <i>basic case management  		model</i> relied primarily on the seven core features. The channeling project  		assumed responsibility for helping clients gain access to the necessary  		services and for coordinating the services of multiple providers. This model  		provided a small amount of additional funding to fill gaps in existing  		programs. But it relied primarily on what was already available in each  		community, thus testing the premise that the major shortcomings of the current  		system were problems associated with information and coordination which could  		be resolved largely by client-centered case management.</p>
<p>The <i>financial control model</i> differed from the basic model in  		several ways:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>It expanded service coverage to include a broader range of community  			 services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It established a funds pool to ensure that services could be  			 allocated on the basis of need and appropriateness rather than on the  			 eligibility requirements of specific categorical programs (though it required  			 participants to have Medicare Part A coverage).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It empowered case managers to authorize the amount, duration, and  			 scope of services paid from the funds pool, making them accountable for the  			 full package of community services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It imposed two limits on expenditures from the funds pool. First,  			 <i>average</i> client expenditures could not exceed 60 percent of the average  			 nursing home rate in the area. Second, expenditures for an <i>individual</i>  			 client could not exceed 85 percent of that rate without special  			 approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It required clients to share in the cost of services if their income  			 exceeded 200 percent of the state's Supplemental Security Income (SSI)  			 eligibility level plus the food stamp bonus amount.</p>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h2>B. THE DEMONSTRATION AND EVALUATION</h2>
<p>Ten sites across the country participated in the demonstration:</p>

</tr><tr><td>Southern Maine</td>
<td>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</td>
</tr></table><p>In September of 1980, the 10 participating states, a technical  		assistance contractor, and a national evaluation contractor were awarded  		contracts and began planning. A local project in each state was then selected.  		These projects were already well-established departments within existing human  		service organizations (typically area agencies on aging or private nonprofit  		service providers). The 10 local projects opened their doors to clients between  		February and June of 1982, and were fully operational through June of 1984. The  		local projects were phased out of the federal program in March of 1985,  		although most still continue to operate under state or other auspices.</p>
<p>The goal of the evaluation was to identify its impact of the  		demonstration on the following services and costs:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The use of formal health and long term care services, particularly  			 hospital and nursing home care and community services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public and private expenditures for health and long term care  			 services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual outcomes including mortality, physical functioning, unmet  			 service needs, and social/psychological well-being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caregiving by family and friends, including the amount of care  			 provided, the amount of financial support provided, and stress, satisfaction,  			 and well-being of caregivers.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The evaluation relied on an experimental design to compare the outcomes  		of channeling with what would have happened in the absence of channeling.  		Elderly persons who were referred to each channeling project were interviewed  		to determine their eligibility for channeling. If found eligible, they were  		randomly assigned either to a treatment group, whose members had the  		opportunity to participate in channeling, or to a control group, whose members  		continued to rely on whatever services were otherwise available in their  		community. In all, 6,341 persons were randomly assigned. Given both the  		substantial death rate among this population and interview noncompletions, the  		random assignment process yielded research samples of 3,372-6,326 elderly  		persons, depending on the analysis.</p>
<p>Several data sources formed the basis for the research. An extensive  		in-person survey was administered to the elderly members of the research sample  		(both treatment and controls) at baseline and at 6, 12, and (for half the  		sample) 18 months thereafter. Another survey was administered (usually by  		telephone) to the primary informal caregivers of a subset of the sample members  		at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months thereafter. Service and cost data were  		collected from Medicare, and Medicaid, and channeling records, and, where  		necessary, from providers directly; participant tracking data and project cost  		records were collected from the channeling projects; official death records  		were obtained from state agencies. Finally, state, local, and project staff  		were interviewed about the implementation and operation of the  		demonstration.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>C. EXPECTED EFFECTS OF CHANNELING ON FORMAL COMMUNITY SERVICES AND  		HOUSING</h2>
<p>The two models of channeling were expected to have a direct effect on  		the use and cost of community-based services as a vehicle for enabling elderly  		persons to remain in the community. The following were the primary expectations  		about these services:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Channeling was expected to increase the use of community-based  			 services both by keeping clients in the community who would otherwise be  			 institutionalized and by increasing the use of these services by those clients  			 who were already in the community and who had unmet needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increases in the use of formal community services were expected to  			 be greater in the financial control model than in the basic case management  			 model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total public expenditures for community services were expected to  			 increase, both from the increased use of services and from the substitution of  			 public for private purchases of services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased public expenditures were expected to be mitigated by some  			 substitution of lower-cost caregivers for both nurses and home health aides and  			 potentially by some reduction in the unit costs of purchased services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channeling was expected to increase the use of community housing by  			 enabling clients to remain in the community. It could also alter the pattern of  			 housing to move to better housing or by helping clients who needed more  			 intensive service to enter supportive housing facilities or personal care homes  			 rather than nursing homes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h2>D. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p>The channeling demonstration, as it was implemented in ten settings that  		represented a variety of community service environments, provides a great deal  		of information on community service use and expenditures among an impaired  		elderly population. More importantly, it also demonstrates how service use and  		expenditures are affected by two forms of case-managed community care  		programs.</p>
<p><b>Service Use</b>. The most clear-cut finding of this report is that  		both treatment and control groups used community services extensively, and that  		channeling increased use of community-based services. The expectations at the  		outset of the demonstration were that such increases would be due to the fact  		that greater numbers of elderly would remain in the community, as well as to  		the increased use of services by those already in the community. However, all  		the observed service use increases were due to the latter effect, because no  		impact was observed on mortality or institutionalization.</p>
<p>The results for community-based service use are consistent with the  		design of the channeling intervention in several respects. First, increases in  		service use were much larger and statistically significant for more types of  		services in the financial control model of channeling. The availability of  		extra funding, and perhaps also the flexibility of the waiver funds pool,  		permitted case managers to make services available the could not have been  		reimbursed through existing programs. Consequently, the financial control model  		increased the number of visits by formal caregivers to the elderly in the  		community by nearly 80 percent (2 visits per week) at both 6 and 12 months  		after randomization. Increased use was also observed at 18 months. The  		comparable figure for the basic model was a 22 percent increase at 6 months and  		somewhat less in subsequent periods. This estimated increase in service use  		under the basic model is not totally consistent with the estimated impacts on  		expenditures based on claims and provider records. These impacts suggest that  		expenditures may have declined under channeling in the first six months,  		although estimates over the entire 18-month observation period suggest a modest  		increase in expenditures under the basic model.</p>
<p>Expectations were also confirmed about the types of services for which  		impacts were observed. For both channeling models, the largest increases in  		service use were observed for personal care and housekeeping services. These  		services are not usually covered by existing public programs or private  		insurance and, it has been argued, are the services that the impaired elderly  		in the community need most often.</p>
<p><b>Targeting of Services</b>. We also looked for evidence that  		channeling was targeted toward specific types of individuals as it augmented  		the quantity of delivered services. We found little evidence that the impacts  		of channeling were related to any of the subgroup classifications that we  		investigated; the number of significant differences among subgroups was not  		much more than would have been expected by chance. However, there was some  		evidence (see Grannemann et al., 1986) that the financial control model  		increased to a greater extent the use of services from visiting caregivers for  		those who were in a nursing home prior to baseline, which is consistent with  		the objective of channeling to target those most at risk of institutional  		placement. But we found no indication that the impacts of channeling on  		services were concentrated on those with high unmet needs, those who lived  		alone, or those at any particular level of ADL disability. In both models, the  		impacts of channeling on service use are best characterized as widespread among  		channeling clients.</p>
<p><b>Impacts on Expenditures</b>. The control groups in both basic and  		financial sites were incurring substantial expenses for community-based  		services. For a person who remained in the community for a full year, these  		expenditures would amount to between $3,000 and $4,000. Nearly half of these  		expenditures were for services that were identified by sample members as  		entailing personal care and housekeeping. Medicare paid the largest share of  		control group expenditures for community services--55 percent in the basic  		sites and 74 percent in the financial control sites--in the first six  		months.</p>
<p>In the basic model sites, in which Medicare expenditures for community  		services tended to be relatively low and channeling dollars were limited,  		channeling case managers appear to have worked within the existing system to  		increase slightly the use of services and expenditures under the Medicare  		program. No significant impact on Medicaid or other public program expenditures  		was observed. Under basic modeling channeling the net increase in public  		expenditures over the 18-month observation period was $458.</p>
<p>Under the basic model, private payments were reduced. However, the  		magnitude of these reductions is unclear. In the first six months, we estimate  		a substantial reduction in private payments of $201 per sample member, which  		implies a small reduction in community service expenditures overall for that  		time period. Alternative estimation methods suggested even larger reductions.  		These estimated private savings represent some substitution of public for  		private dollars, but they may also be due to reductions in the use of  		unnecessary services or to shifts in care for high-use clients to a more  		appropriate setting. It seems unlikely, however, that if the demonstration were  		replicated, the reduction in private payments would be as large as was measured  		with our relatively small provider records sample. Indeed, smaller reductions  		were estimated for the 7-12 month period. The overall impact on public and  		private expenditures was estimated to be a $186 increase over the 18-month  		observation period.</p>
<p>The impacts of channeling on total expenditures are much larger under  		the financial control model. The direct community service expenditures of that  		model were $4,466 per client in the first 18 months following randomization.  		But because baseline channeling replaced Medicare, Medicaid, and some other  		public programs as designed, and also appeared to replace private expenditures  		to some degree, the net impact on expenditures was $2,604 per client in the  		18-month period. For an impaired elderly person who resided in the community  		for the full 18-month period, financial control channeling would be expected to  		increase the cost of community services from the $5,247 incurred under the  		existing system to $9,258 under financial control channeling.</p>
<p><b>Mitigating the Effects on Expenditures</b>. Despite the strong  		evidence of increases in public and total costs, there is some evidence that  		the financial control model projects were able to use their purchasing power to  		reduce the per unit cost of some services. We estimate that the price that  		channeling paid for nursing, therapy, and home health aide visits was,  		respectively, 13, 4, and 9 percent lower than the average price that the  		control group paid for such services.</p>
<p>Another expectation was the channeling would substitute less skilled and  		hence less expensive services for the more skilled and hence more expensive  		services used by the current system, which is built around the Medicare and  		Medicaid programs which are oriented toward skilled care. Substitution would  		also mitigate the impacts of channeling on expenditures. Here the evidence is  		limited. We did find evidence in the financial control model that some  		reduction in spending for traditional home health services (nursing, therapy,  		and home health aide) accompanied the expansion of personal care and homemaking  		services. This result was found only in the program records data, and was  		statistically significant only in the first six months. The fact that the  		interviews did not show reductions in the frequency or number of visits in  		which sample members reported receiving medical treatments or therapy suggests  		that any substitution of less skilled caregivers was for the nonmedical  		activities performed by nurses, therapists, and home health aides. Thus, there  		is some evidence that the financial control model contributed to the  		substitution of less skilled caregivers.</p>
<p><b>Impacts on Housing</b>. Given that channeling appeared to have no  		impacts on community residence or mortality, it is not surprising to find  		essentially no impacts on the aggregate use of and expenditures for community  		housing. Under the basic model, our analysis found no evidence of a shift  		either in the pattern of housing types used or the level of expenditures for  		community housing. In the financial control model sites, there was also no  		evidence of a change in total community housing expenditures, although there  		was some evidence of a small shift in expenditures away from personal care  		housing and toward public housing. These expenditure changes offset each other  		almost exactly and reflect a net change of residences only for a few  		individuals in the sample.</p>
