<hr /><p>With the implementation of the SSI program in 1974, a new group of  		beneficiaries was added to the Medicaid program--disabled children in  		low-income families. Prior to SSI, severely disabled children generally had  		qualified for cash assistance and Medicaid only if their families were eligible  		through the AFDC provisions. With SSI, children became eligible for Medicaid in  		their own right if: 1) their disabilities were severe enough to satisfy the SSI  		disability criteria, and 2) they (or their families) were poor enough to meet  		the program's financial requirements. Adult disability determinations for SSI  		are largely based on whether a person is capable of work. For children, SSI  		disability assessments until recently focused on whether a child suffered from  		a condition included in (or equal to) a listing of medical impairments  		promulgated by the Social Security Administration. As will be discussed later  		in the paper, a recent ruling by the Supreme Court (<b>Sullivan v. Zebley</b>,  		February 20, 1990) has required the SSI program to implement new standards for  		child disability determinations. The new standards will include individualized  		functional assessments for children which will focus on the impact of a child's  		handicap on his/her normal daily activities. It is generally believed that the  		new standards will result in a much higher approval rate for disabled child  		applicants.</p>
<p>This paper presents available data on the Medicaid experience of  		disabled children, with disabled children defined as those who met the  		(pre-<b>Zebley</b>) disability test of SSI. The study population includes  		disabled children eligible for Medicaid and SSI cash assistance, as well as  		other optional groups of children who meet the disability test of SSI, but only  		qualify for Medicaid (not SSI cash assistance). The analysis focuses on the  		Medicaid patterns of disabled children in California, Georgia and Michigan,  		using Tape-to-Tape data for 1984. This is the most recent readily available  		data on this Medicaid population group. The research questions addressed by  		this study include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>What are the Medicaid enrollment, utilization and expenditure  			 patterns of SSI-related disabled children?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What proportion of overall child Medicaid enrollment and  			 expenditures do disabled children represent? How do disabled children fit into  			 the overall disabled Medicaid population and expenditures?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the disabling conditions of SSI disabled children and how  			 do these conditions relate to Medicaid expenditure levels?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What differences are seen among selected subgroups of disabled  			 children on Medicaid, including SSI children (noninstitutionalized), disabled  			 children not receiving SSI benefits (noninstitutionalized), and  			 institutionalized disabled children?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What impact might the Supreme Court's <b>Zebley</b> decision have on  			 Medicaid patterns for disabled children?</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>DATA SOURCES</h2>
<p>The data for this study were drawn from the Tape-to-Tape data base.  		Tape-to-Tape is a multi-state Medicaid data base developed by the Office of  		Research and Demonstrations at HCFA. The Tape-to-Tape data base includes  		information on every Medicaid enrollee and every claim processed by the  		Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) in four States since 1980. The  		data used for this study are 1984 data--the most recent available on disabled  		children at the time of this study--for California, Georgia and Michigan.  		<a href="ssireles.htm#table1">Table 1</a> shows the number of Medicaid disabled children  		and the level of Medicaid expenditures for the study population. These three  		States accounted for about 16% of SSI children nationwide in 1984, and  		represent a range with regard to the comprehensiveness of their Medicaid  		programs.</p>

</tr></table><p>The study also made use of data from the SSI program which were linked  		to the Tape-to-Tape files. The SSI data came from the Characteristics Extract  		Record (CER), a 10% sample from the national data base on SSI recipients and  		applicants maintained by the Social Security Administration. The CER includes  		information on the major disabling condition for each SSI recipient. The  		disease categories used in coding the type of disability are based on the  		International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification  		(ICD-9-CM).</p>
<h2>MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY IN THE STUDY STATES</h2>
<p>The study States varied somewhat in the groups of disabled children  		which they included for Medicaid in 1984. All three States automatically  		enrolled SSI disabled children in their Medicaid programs. California and  		Michigan also covered disabled children under their medically needy programs in  		1984, but Georgia did not. Medically needy disabled children are those who  		passed the SSI-related disability test, but had too much income or resources to  		meet the financial criteria for SSI cash assistance. Although Georgia did not  		cover medically needy disabled children, it covered two optional groups of the  		disabled who were institutionalized: those who would be eligible for SSI if  		they were not institutionalized, and those who were eligible under special  		income level for the institutionalized.</p>
<p>The three study States varied substantially in the financial criteria  		which were used to determine Medicaid eligibility for disabled children in  		1984. The SSI program is federally administered and has a nationwide minimum  		benefit level for a person with no other sources of income. States also have  		the option to supplement the Federal benefit level (called the State  		supplementation payment). Among the study States in 1984, California and  		Michigan elected to supplement the Federal amount, while Georgia did not. The  		monthly SSI benefit levels (including State supplementation) in 1984 are shown  		in <a href="ssireles.htm#table2">Table 2</a>.</p>
<table><tr><td colspan="2"><b><font><a name="table2" id="table2">TABLE 2</a>. Monthly Benefit Level, Including  			 State Supplementation, for SSI Disabled Living Independently:California,  			 Georgia, and Michigan, 1984</font></b></td>
</tr><tr><td>California</td>
<td>$477</td>
</tr><tr><td>Georgia</td>
<td>314</td>
</tr><tr><td>Michigan</td>
<td>338</td>
</tr></table><p>Obviously, California's SSI benefit level was more generous than that of  		the other two States. The Federal poverty level in 1984 for one person under 65  		years of age was $450 monthly. Thus, the benefit level in California was above  		the Federal poverty level; the other two States used an income standard that  		was considerably less.</p>
<p>The income levels for medically needy coverage used by California and  		Michigan are shown in <a href="ssireles.htm#table3">Table 3</a>. The medically needy level  		used by California was considerably higher than its SSI level (with  		supplementation), while Michigan's medically needy level was virtually the same  		as its SSI level. Thus, California potentially extended Medicaid eligibility to  		disabled children whose families had much higher incomes than either Michigan  		or Georgia.</p>
<table><tr><td colspan="2"><b><font><a name="table3" id="table3">TABLE 3</a>. Medically Needy Income Level for  			 One Person:California and Michigan, 1984</font></b></td>
</tr><tr><td>California</td>
<td>$600</td>
</tr><tr><td>Michigan</td>
<td>339</td>
</tr></table><p>With a medically needy program, a State can allow persons to qualify for  		Medicaid through "spending-down," even if their income exceeds the medically  		needy income level. The spend-down process allows applicants to deduct medical  		expenses from income in determining financial eligibility. Thus, disabled  		children from families of any income level could qualify for Medicaid, assuming  		their medical bills were large enough (and the disabled child satisfied the  		disability criteria).</p>
<p>In all three study States, all-groups of disabled children were entitled  		to the same set of services. States have a mandatory set of Medicaid services,  		as well as optional services that they can elect to offer. Further, States can  		elect to set utilization limits on specific services, if they wish. As a  		result, the services included under any one State's Medicaid program can vary.  		There were some differences among the study States worth noting. Generally, the  		Medicaid program in Georgia was more limited than the programs in California  		and Michigan during 1984. Georgia limited the number of outpatient hospital  		visits that could be reimbursed by Medicaid to 12 visits per year, whereas the  		other two States imposed no limit. Georgia also limited the number of physician  		office visits during the year to 12. Neither California nor Michigan placed any  		restrictions on outpatient hospital or physician office visits. Although the  		restrictions in Georgia would not affect the utilization of the majority of  		disabled children, average measures of ambulatory services per enrollee may be  		affected. It should also be noted that Georgia did not cover inpatient  		psychiatric services for children during the study period.</p>
<h2>OVERVIEW OF MEDICAID DISABLED CHILDREN</h2>
<p>HCFA does not routinely collect data on the number of disabled child  		Medicaid recipients nationwide or their expenditures. The only nationwide data  		available on Medicaid disabled children is a count of the number of disabled  		children receiving Federally administered cash assistance benefits under the  		SSI program. According to the Social Security Administration, 288,725 children  		under age 22 were enrolled in the SSI program in December, 1987. This  		represented about 10% of overall SSI disability enrollment. As shown in  		<a href="ssireles.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a>, SSI child enrollment has remained generally  		flat since 1980, in contrast to the substantial growth during this period of  		the SSI adult disabled population.</p>
<p>Study data showed disabled children to be a small Medicaid group with  		regard to enrollment, but their expenditure levels are significant. Among the  		study states, they represented 2-5% of child Medicaid enrollment, as shown in  		<a href="ssireles.htm#figure2">Figure 2</a>. As expected, their expenditure levels were  		substantially higher than for other children on Medicaid. They accounted for  		14-33% of overall child Medicaid expenditures.</p>
<p>Disabled children can also be viewed as a subset of the disabled  		Medicaid population. Among the study States, they represented 8-12% of overall  		disabled Medicaid enrollment, and about 8-13% of disabled Medicaid expenditures  		(<a href="ssireles.htm#figure3">Figure 3</a>). However, about 30% to 40% of the adult  		disabled among the study States were also enrolled in the Medicare program,  		thus reducing their proportion of Medicaid expenditures. For the Medicare  		crossover group, Medicare is the first payer (before Medicaid) for many  		services.</p>

<p>Almost all disabled child enrollees qualify for Medicaid through the SSI  		cash assistance program. Among the study States, 97% of disabled children in  		California and Michigan and 99% of disabled children in Georgia were eligible  		for Medicaid because they received SSI assistance, as shown in  		<a href="ssireles.htm#table4">Table 4</a>. Even among the 5-10% of institutionalized  		disabled children in each study State, most were eligible because they received  		SSI benefits. Only 1% of disabled children in Georgia and 3% in California and  		Michigan were eligible through other coverage provisions.</p>
<p>Generally, disabled children are older than their counterparts in the  		AFDC program. The average age for disabled children ranged from 13 to 15 across  		the study States. From 68% to 78% of the disabled Medicaid children in each  		study State were over 10 years of age. In contrast, only 16% of AFDC children  		nationwide were over age 12 in 1982.<sup><font><a href="ssireles.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><p>Another difference from AFDC children is that there are significantly  		more males than females among disabled children. Among the study States, about  		57% of disabled children were male, while AFDC children are generally evenly  		distributed by sex.</p>
<p>Once disabled children enroll in Medicaid, they experience little  		turnover. In Georgia, disabled children averaged 10.3 months of enrollment for  		the study year, compared to 9.9 for California and 9.6 for Michigan.</p>
<p>Data on primary disabling conditions were available for SSI cash  		children, based on the 10% research sample compiled by SSA. The distribution of  		SSI children by major disease categories, as shown in <a href="ssireles.htm#table5">Table  		5</a>, shows a remarkably similar pattern by State. Four disease categories  		accounted for the vast majority of SSI children in each of the study States  		(over 80%). Mental retardation is the leading cause of disability for SSI  		children. The percent of SSI children with mental retardation ranged from 30%  		in California to 40% in Michigan among the study States. This compares to a  		nationwide average of 43% for SSI disabled children (in 1987).</p>

</tr></table><p>Diseases of the nervous system and sense organs are also a leading cause  		of disability for SSI children. The percent of SSI children with diseases in  		this category ranged from 22% in Georgia to 26% in California and Michigan,  		similar to the nationwide average for SSI children. Included in this disease  		category are infantile cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and  		muscular dystrophy, hearing loss or deafness, and blindness.</p>
<p>Two other disease categories accounted for a high proportion of SSI  		children: mental disorders including psychoses and neuroses (but excluding  		mental retardation) and congenital anomalies. The percent of SSI children with  		mental disorders ranged from 17% in Georgia and Michigan to 19% in California.  		This rate is considerably higher than the nationwide average of 6% of SSI  		children with mental disorders. Diseases reported in this category were  		specific delays in development (for example, learning and speech disorders) and  		schizophrenic disorders, particularly paranoid schizophrenia. The proportion of  		children with congenital anomalies was 8% in Michigan, 10% in Georgia and 11%  		in California. These rates were close to the nationwide average of SSI children  		with this disorder. Included in this disease category are spinal bifida,  		hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and Down's syndrome. All other diagnostic  		categories accounted for 3% or less of SSI children.</p>
<p><a href="ssireles.htm#table6">Table 6</a> presents limited study data on  		expenditures per child by disabling condition. These data are not presented for  		many cells due to the small sample sizes. If there were not at least 30  		children in a cell, data on expenditures per child were not included.</p>

</tr></table><p>However, the relative distribution of expenditures by disabling  		conditions is not completely consistent with the distribution of children by  		disabling condition. For example, although 30% to 40% of SSI children were  		reported to be mentally retarded, only 21%-27% of Medicaid expenditures for SSI  		children were attributable to this group of children across the study States.  		In Michigan, children with mental disorders accounted for 45% of overall  		Medicaid expenditures for SSI children, but they were only 17% of the SSI child  		population. In California and Georgia, children with neoplasms accounted for a  		much greater proportion of expenditures than enrollment.</p>
<h2>MEDICAID PATTERNS FOR SUBGROUPS OF DISABLED MEDICAID CHILDREN</h2>
<p>Although the profile of disabled children by demographic characteristics  		and type of disabling condition presented above generally holds true across all  		disabled children, there are significant utilization and expenditure  		differences among various subgroups of disabled children. To better understand  		these differences, disabled children were divided into three subgroups, by  		order of size:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>SSI Cash (noninstitutionalized)</b>. This group includes disabled  			 children receiving cash assistance through the SSI program who were not in a  			 long-term care institution during the study period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Institutionalized</b>. Children who were institutionalized in a  			 long-term care facility at some point during the study period were defined as a  			 separate group. In determining eligibility, parental income is generally not  			 considered to be available for institutionalized children. Thus, disabled  			 children in institutions may come from families not considered to be  			 low-income. Most disabled children in institutions received an SSI payment of  			 $25 (in 1984) to meet their personal needs. States with medically needy  			 coverage automatically extend coverage to the disabled in institutions if their  			 income is less than the cost of their medical care. If a state does not have a  			 medically needy program, it can elect from two optional coverage groups for the  			 institutionalized: the disabled who would be eligible for SSI except that they  			 are in an institution, and the disabled who qualify under a special income  			 level for the institutionalized. Georgia did not have a medically needy program  			 during 1984; however, it extended Medicaid eligibility to the institutionalized  			 disabled under a special income level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Noncash (noninstitutionalized)</b>. This group of children mainly  			 consists of noninstitutionalized children receiving coverage under a state  			 medically needy program. However, it also includes other mandatory and optional  			 groups, such as those eligible for but not receiving SSI, and children  			 qualifying under a waiver provision.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The distribution of disabled children in the study States by these  		subgroups is shown in <a href="ssireles.htm#table8">Table 8</a>, showing both proportions  		of enrollment and expenditures. The largest subgroup in terms of enrollment is  		SSI cash children living in the community. However, this group accounted for  		the majority of Medicaid expenditures for disabled children in only one of the  		three study states, Georgia. In California and Michigan, institutionalized  		disabled children accounted for 58% and 71% respectively of disabled child  		Medicaid expenditures, but only 8-10% of enrollment. Noninstitutionalized  		disabled children not receiving SSI benefits were only a small proportion of  		enrollment and expenditures in each of the States.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the vast majority of disabled children in each study  		State were SSI cash assistance beneficiaries. Further, most of the SSI children  		were living in the community. As shown in <a href="ssireles.htm#table8">Table 8</a>, 88% of  		California children and 90% of Michigan children were in this group, compared  		to 95% of Georgia children. The relatively higher percent of Georgia children  		in the SSI cash/noninstitutionalized group is attributable to two factors.  		First, Georgia had a much lower proportion of institutionalized disabled  		children than the other two States. Second, Georgia did not have a medically  		needy program for the disabled during the study period.</p>
<p>As shown in <a href="ssireles.htm#table9">Table 9</a>, most SSI disabled children  		utilized at least one Medicaid service during the year and thus were considered  		to be Medicaid recipients. Recipiency rates ranged from 84% in Michigan to 90%  		in California. It is somewhat puzzling that not all children received services  		during the year's period; however, the disabling conditions of some children  		(e.g., mild mental retardation) may not warrant medical services. Also, some  		children may have had private insurance coverage, in addition to Medicaid.</p>

</tr></table><p>The rate of inpatient hospitalization for noninstitutionalized SSI  		children ranged from 11% in Michigan to 20% in Georgia. The higher  		hospitalization rate in Georgia conforms with other studies which have shown  		higher hospital use in the South compared to other regions. In all three  		states, SSI children averaged 13 days per hospital user. The  		physician/ambulatory user rate ranged from about 75% in Georgia and Michigan to  		81% in California. The average number of visits per user was 10 in California  		and Georgia, compared to 8 for Michigan.</p>
<p>Only 1-3% of disabled SSI children received home health services during  		the year. The average number of home health visits per user ranged from 14 in  		California to 28 in Georgia. The majority of SSI disabled children did not  		receive any dental services during the study year. Dental care user rates  		ranged from 27% in Georgia to 34% in California, with an average of 2 visits  		per user. About two-thirds of disabled SSI children received at least one  		prescription drug during the year. Georgia and Michigan children averaged about  		13 prescriptions per user, compared to 11 for California children.</p>
<p>The annual Medicaid expenditure per SSI child (noninstitutionalized)  		ranged from $1,490 in Michigan to $2,434 in California, with Georgia in between  		at $2,251. Across all three states, at least half the annual expenditure per  		enrollee was attributable to inpatient hospital care. Michigan spent  		considerably less per SSI child for inpatient hospital care than the other  		States. Michigan's expenditures for hospital care were $755 per child, compared  		to about $1,350 for California and Georgia. Michigan's lower hospital costs  		were attributable to a lower user rate (especially relative to Georgia) and a  		lower reimbursement rate per day of care (relative to California).</p>
<p>Since average data can be misleading, <a href="ssireles.htm#table10">Table 10</a>  		shows the distribution of SSI children by annual Medicaid expenditure level.  		These data are different from the expenditure means presented earlier in two  		ways: they are not weighted by personyears of enrollment and they exclude those  		children who did not use any Medicaid services during the year. Although SSI  		disabled children who used services averaged $2,104 per child in California,  		the median expenditure was only $396. Georgia showed a similar pattern, with an  		overall average of $2,016 per child recipient, but $411 for the median  		expenditure. Finally, in Michigan the average was $1,255 per recipient, but the  		median expenditure was $239. The most expensive children had expenditures of  		$83,595 per recipient in Georgia, $216,128 in Michigan, and $536,085 in  		California. These distributional data show that a minority of children  		accounted for most of the expenditures, a pattern seen with most insurance  		groups.</p>

</tr></table><h2>INSTITUTIONALIZED DISABLED CHILDREN</h2>
<p>California and Michigan had similar proportions of institutionalized  		disabled children, 9% and 8% respectively. Georgia had a much lower  		institutionalization rate, with only 5% of disabled children institutionalized  		during 1984. A couple of factors contribute to the lower rate in Georgia,  		Georgia has fewer ICF/MR facilities relative to the other States, and it does  		not offer inpatient psychiatric care to children.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, most institutionalized children among the study  		States received SSI benefits of $25 per month to cover their personal needs,  		These children qualified for SSI assistance since the income of their families  		was not considered when they became institutionalized, and they had no income  		of their own. Only 13% of the institutionalized children in California, 15% in  		Georgia, and 9% in Michigan were not receiving SSI benefits. Generally, these  		no cash children qualified for coverage through the medically needy programs in  		California and Michigan, and under Georgia's optional coverage group which used  		a special income level to determine eligibility for the institutionalized.</p>
<p>By definition, all institutionalized children utilized Medicaid services  		during the year and thus were considered to be Medicaid recipients. In addition  		to institutional services, about 16-17% of institutional children in each study  		State used inpatient hospital care during the year (<a href="ssireles.htm#table11">Table  		11</a>). The number of hospital days per user ranged from 11 in Michigan to 19  		in California.</p>
<p>Much more variation was reported for physician/ambulatory care. In  		California and Michigan, 74-78% of institutionalized children used  		physician/ambulatory care during the year, compared to only 44% of Georgia  		children. The number of visits per user ranged from 19 to 26 in California and  		Michigan, respectively. The number of visits per user was only 8 in Georgia.  		However, these numbers have to be interpreted with caution. Georgia "bundles"  		physicians and other services into its institutional service package. The same  		bundling problem complicates the comparison of user rates for dental services  		and prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Study data show that most institutionalized children were in an  		institution for most of the study year. The average number of institutional  		days ranged from 300 in California to 333 in Georgia.</p>

<p>About 23% of Georgia institutionalized children and a third of such  		children in California and Michigan received services in SNF facilities during  		the year. The average number of days per SNF user was quite high, ranging from  		261 to 313. Relatively fewer institutionalized children (3-5%) received  		services in other types of ICF facilities. The number of days per other ICF  		user ranged from 129 to 270.</p>
<p>It is difficult to compare the States with regard to the use of  		inpatient psychiatric care for children. Georgia did not cover this service for  		children during the study period. Available data showed 16% of Michigan's  		institutionalized children used inpatient psychiatric care during 1984,  		compared to 1% of California children. However, California's data may not be  		complete. Some mental health services in California are administered through a  		county-administered mental health program. When these services are provided to  		Medicaid enrollees, Medicaid pays the claims outside the regular MMIS system.  		Thus, there may be some underreporting of children receiving inpatient  		psychiatric care in California, complicating any comparisons to Michigan.  		However, it is not believed this underreporting would significantly impact the  		overall Medicaid patterns in California for institutionalized disabled  		children.</p>
<p>The annual Medicaid expenditure per institutionalized disabled child  		ranged from $26,792 in Georgia to $31,638 in Michigan, with California in  		between at $28,349, with most of the cost attributable to long-term care.  		ICF-MR care accounted for more than half the expenditures for institutionalized  		in all three study states.</p>
<p>As shown in <a href="ssireles.htm#table12">Table 12</a>, there was not as much of a  		difference in the distribution of annual expenditures per enrollee for  		institutionalized children, as was observed with SSI cash children  		(noninstitutionalized).</p>

<p>Very few noninstitutionalized disabled children among the study States  		qualified for Medicaid through the optional eligibility groups extending  		Medicaid coverage to children not receiving SSI cash assistance. This group  		accounted for only 2% of Medicaid disabled children in California and Michigan  		and less than 1% in Georgia. The vast majority of the no cash children in  		California and Michigan qualified through the medically needy provisions, while  		the Georgia no cash children qualified under other provisions.</p>
<p>Disabled no cash children were enrolled for 6 to 7 months during the  		study year, compared to 10 or more months for all other disabled children (data  		not shown). This shorter length of enrollment probably relates to the more  		frequent redeterminations involved with medically needy and other optional  		coverage groups.</p>

The number of  		hospital days per user were also considerably higher, ranging from 21 to 63.  		Although the user rates for physician/ambulatory care were not consistently  		higher in each of the states, this group of children had many more physician  		visits per user, ranging from 15 to 29 per child.</p>
<p>Not surprising when, the annual Medicaid expenditure per disabled no  		cash child was 2-5 times greater than that of SSI cash children, with annual  		expenditures per enrollee ranging from $3,700 to $12,821 across the study  		States. The vast majority of expenditures for this disabled group were for  		inpatient hospital care.</p>
<p><a href="ssireles.htm#table14">Table 14</a> presents data on the distribution of no  		cash children by their annual expenditure level.

Although the average expenditure per no cash child in California in this table  		was $8,460, children at the median only had expenditures of $744.

</tr></table><h2>THE SUPREME COURT'S ZEBLEY DECISION</h2>
<p>A final study objective was to assess whether study data might provide  		any insights into the impact of the Supreme Court's <b>Zebley</b> decision  		(February 20, 1990) on the Medicaid program. As mentioned earlier, the court  		ruled that the Social Security Administration (SSA) had been using a harsher  		disability test for children applying to the SSI program than had been intended  		by Congress or used for adults. Although individualized assessments of ability  		to work were used (when necessary) for adult SSI disability determinations, no  		comparable individualized functional assessments were used for children.  		Instead, children could qualify for SSI only if they suffered from a condition  		included in or equal to a specific listing of impairments developed by SSA.</p>
<p>Several problems exist with the listings for children which SSA has been  		using, according to Jameson and King.<sup><font><a href="ssireles.htm#note2">2</a></font></sup> First, many childhood conditions are not  		included in the listings, and the listings do not address the symptoms that  		accompany many conditions. Specific disabling conditions which have proved to  		be problematic for SSI child applicants include Tourette syndrome, attention  		deficit disorder, Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, sleep apnea, AIDS, muscular  		dystrophy, infant drug dependence and fetal alcohol syndrome. Second, the child  		listings have not been periodically revised to reflect current medical  		knowledge since 1977 (when they were originally developed), unlike the adult  		listings. Third, the listings do not describe the functional limitations  		associated with childhood disability. For example, they do not take into  		account a child's dependence on medical technology in order to function.  		Finally, the listings do not describe disease processes in terms of the various  		stages of childhood. Particular problems have been encountered with the  		disability determination process for infants and toddlers.</p>
<p>Prior to the ruling, SSA maintained that a functional assessment for  		children comparable to the vocational assessment for adults was not feasible.  		However, the court maintained that SSA could assess the impact of a disability  		on a child's ability to undertake normal daily activities, such as speaking,  		walking, washing, dressing, feeding oneself, going to school, playing, etc.  		Thus, children who have disabilities which are not included in the SSA listings  		will be entitled to an individualized assessment which uses an age-appropriate  		functional standard.</p>
<p>As part of the ruling, up to 250,000 children rejected for SSI since  		1983 will be entitled to have their cases redetermined.<sup><font><a href="ssireles.htm#note3">3</a></font></sup> In addition, the eligibility of all future  		child applicants will be determined using the new standards. Thus, the Medicaid  		program can be expected to show a sharp increase in enrollment for SSI-related  		disabled children . Also, although the Court's ruling does not speak directly  		to the Medicaid eligibility of any children found to be retroactively eligible  		for SSI benefits, HCFA has stated that it will grant provide Federal matching  		dollars to any State which requests them for children covered retroactively  		under the new provisions.</p>
<p>How many children are likely to qualify under the new standards?  		<i><b>The Washington Post</b></i> quotes Social Security Deputy Commissioner  		Louis Enoff as declining to provide an estimate, but saying, "tens of thousands  		of children and hundreds of millions of dollars" will be involved over the next  		few years. The same article says "some experts" estimate one-third of the  		50,000 now being denied benefits on an annual basis will be eligible. Specific  		estimates of the numbers of children affected are not available from SSA or  		HCFA.</p>
<p>Will the Medicaid patterns of disabled children qualifying under the new  		functional standards be different from children qualifying under the pre-Zebley  		approach? Program analysts at HCFA and SSA, as well as the legal counsel for  		the Zebley case, were contacted to see what information they had on the  		characteristics of disabled children affected by the Zebley ruling.  		Unfortunately, no one seems to have a clear sense of the ruling's impact,  		particularly with regard to any Medicaid effects. First, some of these children  		denied SSI disability benefits in the past may have qualified for Medicaid  		anyway under other provisions, such as the AFDC, Ribicoff and/or medically  		needy groups. Second, no one knows which types of disabling conditions are most  		likely to be affected by the rulings. Some limited administrative data from SSA  		categorize children denied SSI coverage in 1989 by the "body system" of their  		disabilities. These data show children with "mental disorders" to account for  		35% of the denied applicants. Another 14% of the denied group were reported to  		have "neurological" problems. No other body system accounted for more than 10%  		of the denied population of children. In any event, it is unknown which types  		of disabling conditions will be the most affected.</p>
<p>Thus, study data can only be used cautiously in estimating the impact of  		the Zebley decision. Assuming the "experts" are correct and approximately  		17,000 children are added to the SSI rolls on an annual basis, total Medicaid  		expenditures could be increased by $10 to $47 million annually. The lower bound  		estimate assumes the average annual expenditure would be about $550 per child  		(using the 1984 California and Georgia median expenditure data of approximately  		$400 per noninstitutionalized SSI child, adjusted to 1989 dollars using the  		medical care price index). The higher bound estimate assumes annual Medicaid  		expenditures of $2,750 per child (using the 1984 California and Georgia average  		expenditure data of approximately $2,000 per child for noninstitutionalized SSI  		children, adjusted to 1989 dollars). Although the higher bound number is a  		sizeable amount, it would not represent a noticeable increase for Medicaid at  		the Federal level. Total FY1989 Medicaid expenditures exceeded $54 billion.</p>
<h2>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p>Study data on the personal characteristics of disabled children on  		Medicaid were generally consistent with other published information on SSI  		children. There are slightly more males than females among disabled children,  		and the average age was about 14 years. Four disease categories accounted for  		the vast majority of SSI children--mental retardation, diseases of the nervous  		system and sense organs (including infantile cerebral palsy, multiple  		sclerosis, epilepsy and muscular dystrophy, hearing loss and blindness), mental  		disorders, and congenital anomalies.</p>
<p>Among the study States, disabled Medicaid children accounted for 2-5% of  		child Medicaid enrollment and about 8-13% of child Medicaid expenditures.  		Disabled children were 8-12% of overall disabled Medicaid enrollment and a  		similar proportion of overall disabled Medicaid expenditures.</p>
<p>There were consistent differences in the Medicaid experience of three  		subgroups of disabled children among the study States in 1984:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Noninstitutionalized SSI Cash Assistance Children</b>. The vast  			 majority of disabled children disabled children on Medicaid were in this group  			 (88% to 95%). They lived at home in the community and received SSI cash  			 assistance benefits. The annual Medicaid expenditure per child in 1984 ranged  			 from $1,490 to $2,434, but the median expenditure per child was only $239 to  			 $411 among the study States. A minority of children in each State had  			 exceptionally high expenditures, thus substantially increasing the overall  			 average per child. About half the Medicaid expenditures for this group went to  			 inpatient hospital care for the 11% to 20% of children who were hospitalized  			 during the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Institutionalized Children</b>. About 5%-10% of disabled children  			 in each State were institutionalized, mainly in ICFs/MR and SNFs. The average  			 number of institutional care days per child exceeded 300 for the year. About  			 17% also used inpatient hospital care during the year. The annual Medicaid  			 expenditure per institutionalized child ranged from $26,792 to $31,638. Most  			 children in this group received an SSI cash benefit each month of $25 to cover  			 their personal needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Noninstitutionalized No Cash Children</b>. Perhaps the most  			 notable comment about this group is that there were so few disabled children  			 living at home who received Medicaid benefits, but not SSI cash assistance.  			 They accounted for only 1%-2% of disabled children among the study States. This  			 group of children showed very different Medicaid utilization patterns. Their  			 hospital user rate was 17%-26%, and they averaged many more days per hospital  			 user than SSI cash children (noninstitutionalized). They were only enrolled for  			 6-7 months of the study year, compared to 10+ months for the other groups. The  			 average Medicaid expenditure for the year ranged from $3,700 to $12,821 per  			 child, but a small group of children had exceptionally high expenditures which  			 greatly inflated the averages.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>What conclusions can we draw then about Medicaid's coverage of disabled  		children. To start, study data showed the SSI program is currently the main  		gateway to Medicaid eligibility for low-income disabled children. Very few  		disabled children are gaining access to Medicaid through the medically needy  		provisions. In California, the most generous States with regard to its  		medically needy income threshold, only 2% of disabled children qualified  		through the medically needy provisions. A similar proportion was seen in  		Michigan, the other study State with medically needy coverage.</p>
<p>Why are so few disabled children qualifying under the medically needy  		provisions? Because State Medicaid programs deem family income to be available  		to children living in the community, many families with disabled children have  		income considerable in excess of State medically needy levels. Only when there  		is a major health crisis, such as a hospitalization, will they be able to incur  		medical liabilities of a sufficient amount to reduce their income to the  		medically needy level (through the spend-down process). Several study results  		point to this pattern. Disabled children in the no cash noninstitutionalized  		group had considerably higher Medicaid expenditures per enrollee when compared  		to SSI cash noninstitutionalized children. They had shorter lengths of  		enrollment during the study year. Their inpatient hospital user rates were  		considerably higher, and they averaged many more hospital days per user. In a  		sense, the medically needy program is giving these children catastrophic  		coverage, but not the ongoing coverage provided to SSI cash children.</p>
<p>Also, many low-income families with disabled children may not be aware  		of access to Medicaid coverage through the medically needy provisions. An  		application for SSI (and automatic Medicaid coverage) is handled by the Social  		Security Administration, but an application for medically needy coverage is  		processed by the local welfare department. The family of a disabled child  		denied SSI coverage may not understand that Medicaid eligibility might be  		possible with a second application to the welfare department. In any event, it  		certainly represents an additional administrative hassle. Finally, there is the  		stigma associated with welfare offices, which can reportedly discourage  		separate Medicaid applications.</p>
<p>There have been repeated calls for reform to the medically needy  		provisions, especially the income spend-down component. Generally, the reforms  		call for eliminating spend-down and changing to a buy-in provision for Medicaid  		coverage, using a fixed percent of income for a family.</p>
<p>A second stud pattern of importance is the extreme difference in  		Medicaid expenditure levels per child between institutionalized disabled  		children and disabled children living in the community. <a href="ssireles.htm#figure4">Figure 4</a> shows the average Medicaid expenditure for the two  		main groups of disabled children--non-institutionalized SSI cash children and  		institutionalized children. The annual expenditure levels for institutionalized  		children were $28,000 to $32,000 across the study States, compared to $1,490 to  		$2,434 for SSI cash assistance children living in the community. Although the  		institutionalized only accounted for 5%-10% of Medicaid disabled children in  		each of the study States, the accounted for a much greater proportion of total  		Medicaid expenditures for disabled children. In two of the study States, well  		over half of the total Medicaid expenditures for disabled children were for the  		institutionalized.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure4" id="figure4"><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-reports-basic/68276/ssirefg4.JPG" /></a></div>
<p>These expenditure patterns underscore the importance of the optional  		Medicaid groups introduced during the 1980s to allow States to waive the  		Medicaid deeming rules for institutionalized children who could be cared for  		appropriately and cost-effectively at home. Recently available data indicates  		chat 36 States have home and community-based waiver programs which include  		disabled children, although only 9 States operated programs exclusively for  		disabled children in 1989. An additional 17 States offer TEFRA State plan  		options which allow the State to ignore parental income and resources when  		determining eligibility for home care. Estimates are not available on the  		number of disabled children receiving waiver services, but an estimated 4,000  		children are being served through the TEFRA option nationwide.<sup><font><a href="ssireles.htm#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Certainly, study data showed a very low user rate for home health  		services in 1984--only 1%-3% for disabled children among the study States. More  		recent data may show a different pattern. Nevertheless, it seems safe to assume  		there is still opportunity for reducing institutional expenditures through the  		greater use of home health services.</p>
<p>A third conclusion of importance is that many noninstitutionalized  		disabled children did not have high Medicaid expenditures annually. There was  		substantial variation in the distribution of expenditures among children in the  		noninstitutionalized group, with a small proportion of very high cost children  		substantially increasing the overall average. The median annual expenditure per  		noninstitutionalized SSI cash child ranged from $239 in Michigan to $441 in  		Georgia. Thus, many disabled children do not have high annual Medicaid  		expenditures. Policymakers may mistakenly assume at times that all disabled  		children incur substantial Medicaid costs each year. Study data should be  		helpful in refuting this image.</p>
<p><a href="ssireles.htm#figure4">Figure 4</a> also shows the annual Medicaid  		expenditure level in each of the study States for AFDC children. Although the  		average annual expenditure levels for noninstitutionalized SSI cash children  		were about 4-6 times the AFDC level for the study period, the median SSI child  		expenditure levels were much closer to the average AFDC levels.</p>
<p>As a final note, the Supreme Court's Zebley decision earlier this year  		may change the situation for the number of disabled children on Medicaid  		considerably. On February 20, 1990 the court ruled that the SSI program has  		been too harsh in its interpretation of the disability requirements for  		children. The Social Security Administration has been ordered to use  		individualized assessments in determining the disability status of children in  		the future. As a result, the overall level of Medicaid enrollment and  		expenditures for disabled children may change substantially. Study data  		indicate the expanded coverage may result in Medicaid increases of $10-$42  		million annually.</p>
