<hr /><p>There has been rapid growth of public and private expenditures for long  		term care--a term which encompasses any of a variety of services (including  		personal and medical care and assistance with household management) usually  		provided in the home and designed to help the recipient continue to live in the  		community. The expectation that these expenditures would rise even more as a  		result of both demographic trends and increases in health care costs has  		focused attention on ways to control long term care expenditures while still  		providing adequate care to those in need. In 1980, the United States Department  		of Health and Human Services (DHHS) funded the National Long Term Care  		Demonstration to conduct a rigorous test of one such approach--the provision of  		case managed community-based services to meet the long term care needs of the  		functionally limited elderly--called Channeling.</p>
<p>This report documents the design and implementation of the surveys which  		collected data for evaluation of the Channeling demonstration. In doing so, it  		introduces a number of topics and results which have implications for the  		evaluation. Discussion of these implications is outside the scope of this  		report; separate technical reports in which such implications are discussed in  		detail will be completed as part of the evaluation.</p>
<p>This Executive Summary begins with an overview of the demonstration. It  		then presents an overview of the research issues and design, discusses the  		implications of the design for data collection, summarizes the data collection  		activities and instruments, describes the links among the data collection  		efforts, and reviews the chapters of the full report entitled: <b><i>The  		Evaluation of the National Long Term Care Demonstration Survey Data Collection  		Design and Procedures</i></b>.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>A. OVERVIEW OF THE DEMONSTRATION</h2>
<p>The intended target population of the Channeling demonstration was the  		elderly with severe functional limitations who required long term care services  		for an extended period of time and who, in the absence of Channeling, were at  		high risk of being institutionalized. For this group of people, the goal of  		Channeling was to bring about more effective and efficient provision of  		community-based long term care services. The basic hypothesis to be tested was  		that the primary problems of the long term care system were lack of  		information, uncoordinated services, and reverse financial incentives--rather  		than the lack of direct services themselves. With respect to direct service  		use, the objective of Channeling, through case management, was to facilitate  		substitution of services provided in the community--both formal services and  		the informal care provided by family and friends--for institutional care,  		wherever community care was appropriate. This substitution was intended, in  		turn, to reduce costs and to improve the quality of life of its clients.</p>
<p>To accomplish these ends, the Channeling demonstration tested two  		variants of a managed system of long term care in 10 communities around the  		country. The two variants, called the basic case management model and the  		financial control model, were each tested in five sites.<font size="-2"><a href="sydataes.htm#note1">1</a></font> A set of core functions was common to  		both models, with additional features (that differed by model) intended to  		enhance Channeling's ability to intervene in the existing long term care  		system.</p>
<p><b>Core Channeling Functions</b>. The major impacts of Channeling on  		clients, caregivers, and costs were to be effected principally by managing  		individual clients' service use, particularly by reducing the use of  		institutions. To achieve this objective, the designers of Channeling prescribed  		seven essential functions (Gottesman 1981):</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Outreach</i> to identify and attract the target  			 population;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Screening</i> to determine whether an applicant was part of the  			 target population;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Comprehensive needs assessment</i> to determine individual  			 problems, resources, and service needs, using a structured assessment  			 instrument;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Care planning</i> to specify the types and amounts of care  			 necessary to meet the identified needs of each client;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Service arrangement</i> to implement the care plan through both  			 formal and informal providers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Monitoring</i> to assure that services were provided as called  			 for in the care plan or modified as necessary; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Reassessment</i> to adjust care plans to changing needs.  			 Reassessment was to be done three months after program entry and every six  			 months thereafter (or more frequently if a client's status changed).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These constituted the minimum set of functions deemed necessary to  		affect service use and ultimately client outcomes. In the Channeling  		demonstration, as noted, this minimum intervention was enhanced by additional  		features, some designed to increase Channeling's ability to affect service use,  		others and to limit the resources used.</p>
<p><b>Additional Model Features</b>. The basic case management model  		included one additional feature designed to improve access to existing  		services. Each basic case management project had limited discretionary funds  		that case managers could use to purchase community-based direct services in  		order to complete a care plan by overcoming existing service or program  		gaps.<font size="-2"><a href="sydataes.htm#note2">2</a></font></p>
<p>The financial control model included six additional features, which  		together constituted not only a substantially more powerful influence on  		service access and use but also a cost controlling mechanism. These were:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>expanded service coverage; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pooling of government funds (Funds Pool)<font size="-2"><a href="sydataes.htm#note3">3</a></font> from categorical programs for use by Channeling  			 irrespective of categorical eligibility;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>authorization power;<font size="-2"><a href="sydataes.htm#note4">4</a></font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cap on average expenditures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>limits on costs of individual care plans; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cost sharing by clients.<font size="-2"><a href="sydataes.htm#note5">5</a></font></p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Implementation of the Demonstration</b>. State agencies, with overall  		responsibility for demonstration activities in their respective states were the  		prime contractors to DHHS. They in turn made arrangements (typically by  		subcontract) with local government or nonprofit agencies at the demonstration  		sites which acted as host agencies for the Channeling project in their site.  		The sites and host agencies selected for testing the Channeling interventions  		are shown in <a href="sydataes.htm#TABLE1">Table 1</a>. The major milestones in the  		planning and implementation of the demonstration are shown in <a href="sydataes.htm#TABLE2">Table 2</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the demonstration was tested at a  		judgmentally selected sample of sites (in that they applied to participate in  		the demonstration and were selected by DHHS based in part on their ability to  		implement the demonstration), not at a random selection of sites. The sites do  		represent a broad range of demographic and service environments. However, it  		should be kept in mind that the particular nature of the selection process may  		have led to greater sophistication or innovativeness about community care or to  		a richer community service environment in the demonstration sites than in the  		nation as a whole.<font size="-2"><a href="sydataes.htm#note6">6</a></font></p>
<p></p>
<h2>B. OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH DESIGN</h2>
<p>This section briefly reviews the research questions that were the  		objectives of the evaluation effort and the experimental approach that was the  		cornerstone of the research design.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">1. Research Objectives</h3>
<p>Given that the intended impact of Channeling was to achieve less costly,  		more efficient use of services, and improved client and caregiver outcomes  		through improved matching of client needs and services, the research was  		designed to address the following impact questions:</p>
<p><i>What was Channeling's impact on formal and informal service  		use?</i></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Did Channeling reduce the use of nursing home care?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did Channeling reduce the use of hospital care?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did Channeling increase the use of formal community-based health and  			 long term care services (including case management)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did Channeling increase or decrease the amount of informal care  			 provided by family and friends?</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i>What was Channeling's impact on the costs of long term care?</i></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Did Channeling increase or decrease public costs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did Channeling increase or decrease private costs?</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i>What was Channeling's impact on individuals?</i></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Did Channeling reduce mortality rates?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did Channeling improve social and psychological well-being?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did Channeling reduce unmet needs and increase satisfaction with  			 services provided?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did Channeling reduce the rate of deterioration of  			 functioning?</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i>What was Channeling's impact on informal caregivers?</i></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Did Channeling increase or decrease caregiver stress and  			 well-being?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did Channeling increase or decrease caregivers satisfaction with the  			 care received by the elderly individual to whom they give assistance?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did Channeling increase or decrease the income and employment of  			 caregivers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did Channeling increase or decrease the financial support provided  			 by family and friends?</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition to addressing impact issues, the research was designed to  		address implementation and cost-effectiveness issues:</p>
<p><i>How was the project implemented in each site?</i></p>
<ul><li>
<p>What were the characteristics of the environments in which  			 Channeling was implemented?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What were the characteristics of Channeling clients?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What were the costs of Channeling?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What approaches would be most effective for implementing future  			 programs like Channeling?</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i>Was Channeling a cost-effective long term care policy  		intervention?</i></p>
<h3 align="CENTER">2. Experimental Design</h3>
<p>To determine the impacts of the demonstration, the evaluation used an  		experimental methodology to determine how what was observed under Channeling  		differed from what would have happened under the existing long term care system  		in Channeling's absence. To achieve this objective, the Channeling evaluation  		incorporated random assignment of eligible applicants to the treatment group or  		to the control group in each of the 10 demonstration sites. Differences between  		outcomes for the two groups provide estimates of outcomes attributable to  		Channeling.</p>
<p>This experimental methodology was implemented in the Channeling  		demonstration as follows. To enter the project, individuals who were referred  		to or applied to Channeling were screened to determine whether they were  		eligible and interested in participating in Channeling. If so, they were  		randomly assigned to either a treatment group (and thus had the opportunity to  		participate in Channeling), or a control group (the members of which continued  		to rely on the existing long term care system). Such an experimental design is  		a powerful methodology for isolating program impacts for two reasons. First,  		the control group establishes what would have happened in the absence of  		Channeling in that its experiences embody any changes that occurred because of  		trends over time (such as improved training of health care professionals) or  		policy changes (such as changes in reimbursement policies under Medicare and  		Medicaid). Second, random assignment ensures that the treatment and control  		groups are similar with respect to not only measured characteristics but also  		unmeasured ones that may affect outcomes.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>C. OVERVIEW OF DATA COLLECTION ACTIVITIES</h2>
<p>The research design, specified in DHHS' request for proposals for the  		evaluation and further developed during the design phase of the project,  		presented a number of critical issues for the data collection effort.<font size="-2"><a href="sydataes.htm#note7">7</a></font> To identify the eligible target population from  		among those elderly persons who were referred to the demonstration, a screening  		approach was required that was operationally feasible, sufficiently sensitive,  		and able to provide a standardized set of data for the research. Randomization  		of the sample raised sensitive political and operational issues which had to be  		resolved in close coordination with the demonstration projects, because their  		support of the experimental methodology and cooperation in the random  		assignment process were critical to its success. Screening and randomization  		are discussed in greater detail in Chapter II of the full report.</p>
<p>The original survey data collection plan for the elderly sample,  		specified in the request for proposals, was that all data (baseline and  		followup) on the treatment group would be collected by Channeling project staff  		and all data on the control group would be collected by research staff.  		However, data collection by two groups raised a number of serious analytical  		and practical problems for the research, involving the potential  		noncomparability of treatment and control group data collected under this  		design and the differing needs of practitioners and researchers. Although the  		evaluation contractor had identified these problems in its proposal and had  		proposed a solution, it became clear in the early months of the design phase  		that it was inadequate and the issue was raised again with DHHS in January,  		1981.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of the evaluation design for the demonstration, as  		noted, was random assignment of individuals to treatment or control groups so  		that the control group can provide the basis for comparing the intervention to  		the status quo. This requires that the data for treatment and control group  		members be comparable. To prevent potential noncomparability, the evaluation  		contractor proposed that research interviewers administer periodic research  		interviews to all sample members. After extensive discussion, this  		recommendation was accepted for the followup interviews, with agreement that  		case managers would periodically reassess client needs as a separate activity.  		This was an important decision because data comparability was even more  		critical for followup than for baseline data as the followup interviews  		involved collection of data on the outcome variables. But it was not accepted  		for the baseline because to have practitioners develop a care plan for  		Channeling clients from a baseline completed by research interviewers violated  		assessment procedures in normal clinical practice.</p>
<p>Several alternatives were considered. One was to have both a research  		baseline and an initial clinical comprehensive needs assessment completed for  		all treatment group members; however, the cost and respondent burden were  		prohibitive. Another was to have clinicians administer the research baseline to  		control group members, but such a solution ran the substantial risk that in  		doing so clinicians would provide some case management services to control  		group members which they would not have received otherwise. If this happened  		the control group would no longer represent the status quo, violating the  		principles of randomized design, which were critical to the success of the  		evaluation. The decision finally was reached that clinicians would conduct  		baseline assessment interviews with all clients, including treatment group  		members. Research interviewers would administer the baseline to control group  		members and to treatment group members who were terminated from the Channeling  		projects prior to administration of the baseline assessment instrument.</p>
<p>Special efforts were made, therefore, to standardize training on the  		baseline instruments and procedures between the two sets of data collectors and  		a small subsample of the treatment group was selected for reinterview by  		research staff to examine data comparability. Baseline design and data  		collection procedures addressing these issues are discussed in Chapter III of  		the full report. The results of the reinterview study and an assessment of the  		comparability of baseline data for treatment and control groups are reported in  		Brown and Mossel (1984).</p>
<p>One feature of the planned intervention was use of a standardized,  		comprehensive assessment instrument for care planning. The data collection  		design outlined above further required that this instrument meet both research  		and clinical information needs at entry into the demonstration (baseline).  		Further, it had to be suitable for use in both community and institutional  		settings. These requirements called for a lengthy period of instrument  		development with input from both the research and clinical perspectives. This  		process is also described in Chapter III of the full report.</p>
<p>There were six major research components in the evaluation of the  		Channeling demonstration, corresponding to the major research questions  		outlined above. Associated with each research component was a set of sources  		providing data for the analysis. As can be seen from <a href="sydataes.htm#TABLE3">Table  		3</a>, no single source or methodology provided all the data necessary to  		address the issues in any research component of the evaluation, requiring close  		coordination among a variety of data collection activities. For example, the  		cost analysis drew upon data from personal interviews with the elderly sample  		members, from coding of individual service records maintained by local service  		agencies (other than the Channeling projects), and from computerized claims  		records maintained by state and federal agencies. In addition, in the special  		case of followup interviews with the caregivers of deceased sample members,  		community and institutional providers identified as having served them were  		also asked to provide data for the service use and cost analyses.</p>
<p>The need for linked data across sources and methodologies presented one  		of the most significant challenges in the design of the data collection  		instruments and procedures for the evaluation. The subsequent chapters of the  		full report discuss the specific issues faced in the development and  		implementation of each data collection effort involving individual-level  		data.<font size="-2"><a href="sydataes.htm#note8">8</a></font> The remainder of this  		section provides an overview of the procedures necessary for linking the  		separate survey efforts and the survey organization managing the integration of  		the activities connected with each.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">1. Establishing Links Among Data Sources And  		Surveys</h3>
<p>Figure I.1 shows in schematic form the linkages among the various data  		sources and data collection activities. The data collection schedule is shown  		in <a href="sydataes.htm#TABLE4">Table 4</a>.</p>
<p>After screening for eligibility and random assignment, elderly persons  		in both treatment and control groups (called the elderly sample) received a  		baseline assessment. As noted, Channeling project staff administered the  		assessment interview (with some additional clinical information) to the  		treatment group, for which it served the dual functions of an initial needs  		assessment for case management and baseline information for the research;  		research staff administered the same assessment instrument (without the  		additional clinical information) to the control group. When necessary, proxy  		respondents were asked to provide certain information not available from the  		elderly sample member. All elderly sample members for whom a baseline  		assessment interview had been completed were eligible for followup interviews  		by research staff 6 and 12 months after random assignment. The first half of  		the sample to be enrolled also received a followup interview 18 months after  		the initial random assignment. The purpose of the followup interviews was to  		obtain outcome measures of service use and quality of life. They also provided  		the basis for obtaining Medicare, Medicaid, and provider billing records to  		obtain complete service use and cost data and for identifying the primary  		informal caregivers of a subsample of both treatment and control groups.</p>
<p><b>Linking Elderly Sample Survey with Service and Cost Data</b>. In  		their 6- and 12-month followup interviews elderly sample members were asked to  		name providers from whom they had received services. Caregivers at their 6- and  		12-month followup also provided the names of providers used by sample members  		who were deceased. Provider cost and service use data were collected for a 20  		percent subsample of elderly sample members who named (or had named for them)  		community-based providers, for all those indicating use of supportive housing,  		and for all those with hospital and nursing home stays not covered by Medicare  		and Medicaid.</p>
<p><b>Linking Elderly Sample Survey with Informal Caregiver Survey</b>. A  		subset of the elderly sample members enrolled in the demonstration were  		assigned to the informal caregiver subsample. (This subset is described further  		in Chapter VI of the full report.) Caregiver interviews were administered by  		research interviewers to the informal caregivers identified by these sample  		members as the family member of friend who helped the most. The caregiver  		interviews were administered after the sample member had completed his or her  		corresponding interview.</p>
<p><b>Linking Elderly Sample Survey with Death Records Data</b>. Death  		records searches were made for all sample members who did not complete their  		most recently assigned interview (including those who did not complete their  		baselines) after all followup interviews had been completed or had reached some  		other final status.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">2. Survey Organization and Management</h3>
<p>Due to budgetary constraints, the evaluation contractor had no site  		offices. Rather, data collection operations were managed from the main office  		and the field interviewers used their homes as their site base of operations.  		This structure necessitated intensive use of telephone and written  		communication between evaluation staff in the central office and the projects  		and the research interviewers. When issues arose that affected data collection  		policies and procedures, policy decisions were made and documented in  		operations memoranda distributed to evaluation staff (and to project staff as  		appropriate).</p>
<p>Figure I.2 shows the overall survey management structure for the  		evaluation. The survey director, who reported to the project director, oversaw  		all survey activities, for which there were four main tasks: randomization,  		field operations for the elderly sample member and caregiver interviews, data  		reduction, and provider data collection. During the entire data collection  		effort, there was frequent communication among the managers of these subgroups  		(as indicated by dashed lines in Figure I.2) to ensure that operations were  		coordinated and that interdependent activities were completed in timely and  		accurate fashion. In addition, the managers reported on progress, productivity,  		and budget monitoring to the survey director.</p>
<p><b>Management of Randomization</b>. The survey manager for randomization  		was responsible for training and supervising the randomization clerks. Their  		duties included receiving requests for random assignment of applicants from the  		Channeling projects, assigning research identification numbers and research  		statuses, maintaining randomization logs and other documentation, transmitting  		information on randomized sample members to the field coordinators, and logging  		all incoming mail as well as documents sent for data entry.</p>
<p><b>Management of Elderly Sample Member and Informal Caregiver  		Surveys</b>. The survey manager for field operations trained and supervised the  		field coordinators and research interviewers. She monitored interviewer  		progress, providing regular reports to the survey director, and handled all  		interviewer-related issues or problems raised by project staff and sample  		members. The field coordinators assisted in research interviewer training and  		supervision throughout the data collection period. They assigned work to the  		interviewers, provided interviewer progress reports to the field operations  		survey manager, prepared interviewer productivity reports, and processed  		interviewer time sheets.</p>
<p>The survey manager for data reduction trained and supervised the quality  		control (QC) supervisor and staff. She oversaw the production of followup  		contact sheets for sample members and their caregivers and for the provider  		data collection, supervised all data cleaning activities, and was responsible  		for reconciling all discrepancies in final status and ensuring that all  		relevant documents had been received from the projects and research  		interviewers.</p>
<p>The QC supervisor assisted in interviewer and QC staff training,  		communicated with project staff regarding missing documents, and was  		responsible for ensuring that documents were subjected to quality control in a  		timely fashion. She and her QC staff also were responsible for editing and  		coding documents for data entry and for data cleaning.</p>
<p><b>Management of Provider Records Data Collection</b>.<font size="-2"><a href="sydataes.htm#note9">9</a></font> The director of provider data collection was  		responsible for developing the survey instruments for the provider records data  		collection, hiring and training special site interviewers, monitoring  		interviewer progress, and providing regular reports to the survey director.  		Site managers were responsible for assigning work to and supervising the  		interviewers, generating productivity reports, and processing interviewer time  		sheets. Most provider interviewers used their homes as a base of operations.  		Two interviewers were based in Princeton; they collected data in sites with too  		few providers to merit a locally based interviewer and assisted interviewers in  		sites with above average work loads.</p>
<p><b>Management of Death Records Data Collection</b>. The assistant survey  		director managed the death records data collection. In all but two sites, staff  		at the State Vital Statistics offices searched for death records from a  		computer generated list provided to them by evaluation staff. In the remaining  		two sites, evaluation staff undertook the death records searches  		themselves.</p>
<p></p>
