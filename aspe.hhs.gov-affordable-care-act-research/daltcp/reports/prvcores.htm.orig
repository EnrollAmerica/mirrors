<hr /><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Numerous attempts have been made over the last few years to estimate the  		number of elderly who are disabled.<font><a href="#note1">1</a>,  		<a href="#note2">2</a>, <a href="#note3">3</a>, <a href="#note4">4</a>,  		<a href="#note5">5</a>, <a href="#note6">6</a></font> Fewer estimates, however,  		have been generated to gauge the extent to which those who are disabled go  		without the assistance they need. Most recently, estimates have been published  		by Ken Manton of Duke University.<font><a href="#note7">7</a></font>  		These estimates indicated that almost 35 percent (34.6%) of the disabled  		elderly experienced unmet need in one or more of the basic activities of daily  		living (ADL). The implication of this finding is that over one-third of the  		disabled are not getting some very basic needs met, and that both the informal  		and formal systems of care, in tandem, are overlooking these frail elderly  		individuals.</p>
<p>Long-term care policy-makers, however, are becoming increasingly aware  		of how sensitive estimates can be to definitions of the phenomenon being  		estimated. For example, recent research shows that the definition of disability  		invoked can substantially affect the numbers of people estimated to be  		disabled.<font><a href="#note8">8</a>, <a href="#note9">9</a>,  		<a href="#note10">10</a>, <a href="#note11">11</a></font> Just as there can be  		alternative ways of defining an ADL disability, there can also be varied  		approaches to defining unmet needs. In order to explore the potential  		variability in estimates due to definitional variation, a series of unmet need  		estimates for the disabled elderly were generated by altering the definition of  		unmet need. The construction and presentation of these estimates is the focus  		of this report.</p>
<p>In generating alternative estimates, we first replicated Dr. Manton's  		work using a slightly different version of the same data source that he  		employed. Besides presenting alternative estimates of the prevalence of unmet  		need, the correlates--or characteristics of persons-associated with unmet ADL  		need were also analyzed. In light of our findings we discuss policy  		implications, as well as the need for further research in this area. Before  		reviewing the estimates, we outline the parameters of how unmet need has been  		conceptualized and operationalized in this study.</p>
<h2>CONCEPTUALIZING UNMET NEED</h2>
<p>Persons with impairments sufficiently severe that they require some form  		of assistance in the basic activities of daily living (ADLs)--such as bathing,  		dressing, using the bathroom, transferring, moving about, and eating--are  		typically considered disabled. They may be totally dependent on another person  		to perform one or more of these tasks, or they may only require some hands-on  		assistance from another human being. Alternatively, they may need someone to  		stand-by In the event that they require help. Those suffering from Alzheimer's  		disease or a related condition may need supervision in initiating and/or  		carrying out tasks. Others may have an impairment in an ADL, but overcome their  		disability with the use of an assistive device such as a walker or grab bars.  		All of these individuals have, to a greater or lesser degree, <i>needs</i> in  		ADLs.</p>
<p>In conceptualizing "unmet need" among this population, one must  		distinguish between a need not being addressed at all versus a need that is  		receiving some, but not sufficient, attention. In the former case, the  		individual is not able to care for him/herself and there is no one to help fill  		this need; the person's need goes <i>unmet</i>. In the latter case, the person  		has a need which is being addressed, but insufficiently, this person's needs  		are <i>under-met</i>. Both types of unmet needs are usually considered under  		the broad umbrella of unmet needs, however.</p>
<h2>OPERATIONALIZING UNMET NEED</h2>
<p>Ideally, policy makers would like to know how many elders experience  		lack of assistance in any kind of need, be they unmet or undermet. To estimate  		the prevalence of unmet and undermet needs, however, researchers must rely upon  		existing data sources, and are thus constrained by the information  		available.</p>
<p>In this particular study, we employed data from the 1984 National  		Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) to generate estimates. The 1984 NLTCS was chosen  		for analysis because it was intentionally designed so that national estimates  		of the physically disabled elderly population could be developed on a number of  		factors. Yet, while the NLTCS provides a fairly comprehensive set of questions  		about the kinds of help an individual receives in specific ADLs, the coverage  		of unmet needs was somewhat limited. More specifically, the NLTCS collected  		some data on unmet needs, but none on undermet needs.</p>
<p>Instead of gathering information on the <i>extent</i> to which  		disability needs were met, the NLTCS collected data only on needs for which  		persons received no assistance, but for which they said they needed help. In  		other words, data exists which describes needs that were completely unmet only.  		Sample respondents had to first report receiving neither human assistance nor  		using an assistive device before they were asked by the interviewer whether or  		not they needed any help. Consequently, our estimates of unmet need in this  		report include only those persons who do not have any of their needs (per ADL)  		met. In general, however, none of these respondents said they did not do (or  		were unable to do) a given ADL task at all, and thus presumably they were  		performing the task themselves at some level, or at least sporadically.</p>
<h2>PREVALENCE OF UNMET NEED</h2>
<p>Estimates were generated for unmet need in six common ADLs: bathing,  		dressing, toileting, transferring, indoor mobility, and eating. Before  		estimating persons with unmet needs in each ADL, we first defined what  		constituted a disability in each ADL; from this denominator we then estimated  		the proportion of those disabled who had unmet need. Several alternative  		definitions of disability and unmet need were employed in generating the  		estimates; each are described in detail below.</p>
<p><b>Disability Definitions</b>. Settling on a definition of disability is  		less than clear-cut. Good arguments can be made for using alternatively  		stringent or liberal definitions of disability (and unmet need). In this report  		we take four separate approaches to defining ADL disability. Each of these  		approaches is summarized at the bottom of the tables in which the estimates  		appear (<a href="#TABLE1">Table 1</a>, <a href="#TABLE2">Table 2</a>,  		<a href="#TABLE3">Table 3</a> and <a href="#TABLE4">Table 4</a>).</p>
<p>First, we replicated the definition of disability used by Ken Manton in  		his <i><b>Milbank Quarterly</b></i> publication.<font><a href="#note12">12</a></font> Criteria used by Dr. Manton were:</p>
<ul><li><i>Does not perform the ADL at all</i></li>
<li><i>Receives active human assistance (stand-by assistance not  		  included)</i></li>
<li><i>Uses an assistive device</i></li>
<li><i>Does not receive human assistance, does not use assistive device,  		  but reports needing help</i></li>
</ul><p>The above criteria were employed in generating the estimates in  		<a href="#TABLE1">Table 1</a>, and in the "DUKE-1" column of <a href="#TABLE5">Table 5</a> and <a href="#TABLE6">Table 6</a>. These are  		relatively liberal criteria because they do not require that an ADL disability  		be chronic in order to be considered a disability.<font><a href="#note13">13</a></font> Most current estimates of the disabled elderly do  		not consider transient disability that is likely to resolve within a few months  		or less. Another factor consistent with Dr. Manton's liberal definition of  		disability is the inclusion of persons whose only indicator of disability is  		the use of special equipment. Yet he does invoke relatively restrictive  		criteria by excluding from the disabled group those who require stand-by  		assistance.</p>
<p>Dr. Manton included incontinence as evidence of disability in toileting.  		Typically, however, disability in toileting is reserved for persons unable or  		needing help to get to the toilet and/or In using the toilet. Thus, to provide  		estimates consistent with the traditional definition of toileting dependency,  		we devised a second approach to the definition of disability which is the same  		as Dr. Manton's except that it excludes incontinence from the disability  		criteria for toileting. Estimates based on these criteria are found in  		<a href="#TABLE2">Table 2</a>, and in the "DUKE 2" columns of <a href="#TABLE5">Table 5</a> and <a href="#TABLE6">Table 6</a>.</p>
<p>Our third approach was to redefine disability so that only chronic  		disabilities--those lasting or expected to last for three months or longer--are  		included in the estimate. Besides chronicity, other criteria include:</p>
<ul><li><i>Does not perform the ADL at all</i></li>
<li><i>Receives active human assistance</i></li>
<li><i>Receives stand-by assistance</i></li>
<li><i>Does not receive human assistance, does not use assistive device,  		  but reports needing help</i></li>
</ul><p>Estimates based on this third definition of disability may be found in  		<a href="#TABLE3">Table 3</a>, as well as in the "SMI-1" columns of  		<a href="#TABLE5">Table 5</a> and <a href="#TABLE6">Table 6</a>. In contrast to  		the first two approaches, this definition of disability is somewhat more  		stringent. Even though it includes stand-by assistance, at the same time it  		excludes the use of special equipment from the criteria used to establish  		disability. We consider as disabled anyone receiving any kind of human  		assistance, but treat those whose dependency is restricted to special equipment  		as non-disabled. For example, someone needing a steady hand while walking  		across a room would be labeled as disabled by this definition, but a person  		using a walker or cane, with no other assistance, would not be considered  		disabled. We acknowledge, however, that the use of an assistive device as  		insufficient evidence for an ADL disability is debateable. On the one hand,  		using special equipment implies some level of disability; that is, without the  		use of the device the performance of the ADL would be difficult at best. On the  		other hand, the use of the device often renders a person independent of the  		assistance of another, and therefore enabled, rather than disabled.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the differences of opinion in the long-term care community  		about whether or not to include the use of assistive devices in definitions of  		disability, we also developed a fourth approach which incorporates the use of  		special equipment into the definition of disability. This particular criteria  		of disability was used to construct the estimates presented in  		<a href="#TABLE4">Table 4</a>, and in the "SMI-2" columns of <a href="#TABLE5">Table 5</a> and <a href="#TABLE6">Table 6</a>. The only  		difference between the disability definitions in <a href="#TABLE3">Table 3</a>  		and <a href="#TABLE4">Table 4</a> is that <a href="#TABLE3">Table 3</a>  		excludes, and <a href="#TABLE4">Table 4</a> includes, use of special equipment  		as evidence of disability.</p>
<p><b>Unmet Need Definitions</b>. Just as there is divergence of opinion on  		how best to define disability, differences also exists with regard to defining  		unmet need. In this paper we present estimates based on three alternative  		definitions of unmet need. The first corresponds, once again, to criteria used  		by Ken Manton in his <b><i>Milbank Quarterly</i></b> article.<font><a href="#note14">14</a></font> In that study, an unmet need was defined to exist  		if a person met one of the following criteria:</p>
<ul><li><i>Does not perform the activity at all</i></li>
<li><i>Receives no human assistance, does not use an assistive device,  		  but reports needing help</i></li>
</ul><p>and two additional criteria that are ADL-specific:</p>
<ul><li><i>Persons who are incontinent (of bowel or bladder) are considered  		  to have an unmet need.</i></li>
<li><i>Those who report (initially) that they do not bathe at all, but  		  later in the interview state that they take a bed/basin/sink bath are not  		  considered as having an unmet need in bathing.</i></li>
</ul><p>This last criterion is actually an exception to the first criteria, and  		is exclusionary rather than inclusionary. These unmet need criteria are  		reflected in the estimates appearing in <a href="#TABLE1">Table 1</a> and in  		the DUKE-1 columns of <a href="#TABLE5">Table 5</a> and <a href="#TABLE6">Table  		6</a>.</p>
<p>Our second approach to defining unmet need again replicates the criteria  		used by Dr. Manton, with one change. Incontinence is dropped as an indicator of  		unmet need. In Dr. Manton's analysis, incontinence was treated as both a need  		<i>and</i> an unmet need under the toileting ADL. While incontinence may  		require attention from a caregiver, and its management can legitimately be  		considered a long-term care need, the NLTCS does not solicit information from  		respondents on unmet need in the management of incontinence, and thus it may  		not be appropriate to count It as an unmet need. Therefore, in the second  		approach to unmet need definition, we drop incontinence as evidence of unmet  		need in toileting. These definitions are reflected in the estimates which  		appear in <a href="#TABLE2">Table 2</a> and in the "DUKE-2" columns of  		<a href="#TABLE5">Table 5</a> and <a href="#TABLE6">Table 6</a>.</p>
<p>Our third and last approach to defining unmet need breaks with Dr.  		Manton's definition. First, we mainly consider an unmet need to exist only if a  		person:</p>
<ul><li><i>Receives no human assistance, does not use an assistive device,  		  but reports needing help.</i></li>
</ul><p>In contrast to Dr. Manton's approach, this third approach excludes from  		the unmet need criteria most persons who do not perform an ADL task at all.  		However, unmet need in three ADLs--bathing, dressing and toileting--was defined  		to exist for a subset of individuals who did not do the ADL at all. Persons  		with the following characteristics were defined as having unmet need:</p>
<ul><li><i><b>Bathing</b>: Unable to bathe, did not wash in a sink/basin, and  		  did not have a bed bath within the prior week </i></li>
<li><i><b>Dressing</b>: Does not dress at all and no one helped the  		  person change bed clothes in the prior week </i></li>
<li><i><b>Toileting</b>: Does not use the toilet at all, and did not take  		  care of toileting needs by using any special equipment (e.g., bed pan, portable  		  toilet, commode, special underwear), and did not use a urinary catheter or  		  colostomy bag. </i></li>
</ul><p>Unlike Dr. Manton's approach, persons who reported not doing any of the  		other three ADLs--Mobility, Transferring and Eating--are <i>not</i> considered  		to have unmet need. Persons not getting around inside at all may have unmet  		need in mobility, but they may just as well be bed-bound or chair-bound and not  		have the ability to get around inside even if help were available. Likewise,  		persons who are bedbound would not be considered to have unmet need in  		transferring if they did not have the ability to transfer, even with help. The  		NLTCS does not allow us to distinguish between these two states. And with  		respect to the eating ADL, those not eating are unlikely to have unmet need in  		this area, but rather do not sat because they are receiving nutrition  		intravenously or through a feeding tube. The NLTCS does not provide information  		on alternative sources of nutrition, and thus we cannot identify those who  		don't eat and have authentic unmet need in eating. Therefore, because we cannot  		identity with any certainty those with unmet needs in these three ADL's who do  		not do the activity at all, we chose to consider them as <i>not</i> having  		unmet need in this last definition.</p>
<p>A summary of the alternative definitions of unmet need used in the  		estimates that follow may be found at the bottom of Tables 1-4, where estimates  		based on these definitions are presented.</p>
<p><b>Estimates</b>. Four sets of estimates were generated. Each set  		contains estimates for 1984 as well as for 1990. The 1984 estimates are those  		derived from the 1984 NLTCS, and those for 1990 are based on the 1984 estimates  		but have been adjusted to the projected elderly population in 1990.<font><a href="#note15">15</a></font> The 1984 estimates appear in Tables  		1-4, and are summarized in <a href="#TABLE5">Table 5</a>. Estimates for 1990  		are summarized in <a href="#TABLE6">Table 6</a>.</p>
<p>All estimates were based on the community resident  		(non-institutionalized) sample of the 1984 NLTCS, and were subjected to a  		weighting procedure whereby cross-sectional weights were applied in order to  		adjust for non-response and the complexities of the sampling design.  		Application of weights results in nationally representative estimates of the  		aged 65+ community-dwelling population.</p>
<p>We could have presented the updated 1990 adjusted estimates only, but  		chose to present the 1984 estimates, found in Tables 1-5, as well. We did this  		for two reasons. First, it was on the 1984 estimates that we could legitimately  		apply precision criteria. An estimate is considered reliable if its unweighted  		cell size is 75 or larger and if its relative standard error is .30 or  		smaller.</p>
<p>In reviewing Tables 1-4, it is noteworthy that although all disability  		estimates meet the precision criteria, many of the unmet needs estimates do  		not. This is especially true for estimates of the number of elders with unmet  		need in specific ADLs. Relatively few ADL-specific unmet need estimates are  		reliable because their corresponding unweighted cell sizes are very small.  		Small cell sizes also contribute to the higher relative standard errors  		attached to these estimates. Use of the <i>ADL-specific</i> unmet needs  		estimates should therefore be interpreted judiciously. One should refrain from  		using these estimates per se; however, they do provide us with a sense for  		which individual ADL needs are more or less likely to be met.</p>
<p>Our second reason for presenting the 1984 estimates is to provide direct  		comparison to Dr. Manton's published estimates which are reported in 1984  		figures. In this regard, our replication of Dr. Manton's criteria yield  		slightly different results from his published estimates, which are reproduced  		in <a href="#EXHIBITA">Exhibit A</a>. <a href="#TABLE1">Table 1</a> presents  		our replication of <a href="#EXHIBITA">Exhibit A</a>. Comparing these two  		tables, we find somewhat higher estimates of overall disability and unmet need  		in our replication (DUKE-1). That is, Dr. Manton's initial estimate for the  		total number of disabled elderly is 3,499,000 whereas our replication effort  		yielded an estimate of 3,705,000, a difference of 5.6 percent. Also, Dr.  		Manton's estimates indicate a slightly larger proportion of elders with severe  		disability (5-6 ADL limitations) than does our replication. Dr. Manton's  		estimate of the number with unmet needs is 1,212,000 and ours is 1,563,000, a  		difference of 29 percent. Overall 34.6% of the disabled in Dr. Manton's  		estimates have unmet needs whereas our replication shows 42.2% to have unmet  		needs. Both sets of estimates indicated that persons with 5-6 limitations have  		the highest prevalence of unmet need, i.e., over half of those with 5-6  		limitations in both sets of estimates have unmet needs.</p>
<p>Obviously, our replication of Dr. Manton's estimates yielded some  		substantial differences--a 5 percent difference in the overall disability  		estimate and nearly a 29 percent difference in the unmet need estimate. These  		differences may be attributed to a number of factors, the first of which may be  		error in replicating Dr. Manton's operationalization of disability and unmet  		need. His exact coding scheme was not available to us for direct translation,  		and we thus had to rely on conversations with his staff at the Duke University  		Center for Demographic Studies. Second, Dr. Manton used the public use tape to  		generate estimates, and we relied on a version of the 1984 NLTCS edited by  		staff at the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR). We know that  		the AHCPR version includes edit changes on ADL items for about 12 percent of  		the sample. These changes probably account for some of the discrepancy in the  		total count of those with disability, as well as for the differing proportions  		of persons within each of the three limitation categories (i.e., 1-2, 3-4, 5-6  		limitations). And finally, differing weighting variables were used in the  		estimates. Dr. Manton's estimates were generated using the weighting variable  		included on the public use tape, and our replication effort relied upon a more  		recent weighting variable developed by staff at AHCPR for the 1984  		cross-sectional analyses.<font><a href="#note16">16</a></font> Taken  		together, these factors may explain the differences in the two estimates, but  		it is difficult to ascertain which element is responsible for what proportion  		of the discrepancy.</p>
<p>We now turn to our second set of estimates (DUKE-2) which again  		replicates Dr. Manton's criteria--with one major exception. In these estimates  		incontinence is excluded both as a criterion for disability, as well as for  		unmet need, in toileting. As shown in <a href="#TABLE2">Table 2</a>, when  		incontinence is excluded 1.35 million <i>fewer</i> persons are identified as  		having unmet needs (compared to <a href="#TABLE1">Table 1</a> estimates). This  		change translates into fewer disabled elderly (3,249,000 versus 3,705,000), as  		well as a drastically reduced proportion with any unmet need (8.9% versus  		42.2%).</p>
<p>As noted above, our final two sets of estimates (SMI-1, SMI-2) provide  		alternatives to Dr. Manton's conceptualization of disability and unmet need. In  		these estimates, we restrict disability to those with a <i>chronic</i>  		disability in at least one of the six ADLs under consideration. Other major  		differences include excluding incontinence as evidence for either disability or  		unmet need in toileting, and excluding from the unmet need category certain  		persons who do not/cannot perform a given ADL task. Also, receipt of stand-by  		assistance is considered grounds for disability in both sets of estimates. The  		use of an assistive device is not considered evidence of disability in the  		SMI-1 estimates, but is included in the disability definition in the SMI-2  		estimates.</p>
<p>Focusing on the SMI-1 results (<a href="#TABLE3">Table 3</a>), we see a  		decrease in the number of persons defined as disabled (N=2,064,000) by  		approximately 79 percent and 37 percent when compared to the DUKE-1 and DUKE-2  		estimates, respectively. This is due to excluding those without chronic  		disability from the disability pool, as well as those whose only evidence of  		disability is the use of an assistive device. Findings from <a href="#TABLE3">Table 3</a> also demonstrate that by employing refined  		definitions of unmet need, both the actual number and proportion of disabled  		elders estimated to have unmet need drops from 1,563,000 (42.2%) in the DUKE-1  		and 288,000 (8.9%) in the DUKE-2 estimates, to 168,000 (8.1%) in the SMI-1  		estimate.</p>
<p>Turning to results from <a href="#TABLE4">Table 4</a> (SMI-2), we note a  		substantial increase in the number disabled, as compared to <a href="#TABLE3">Table 3</a> (SMI-1). This increase is attributable to the  		inclusion of the use of an assistive device in the disability criteria. This  		addition inflates the number of disabled elderly by approximately 1.1 million.  		Note that <a href="#TABLE4">Table 4</a>'s estimate of overall unmet need is  		unchanged from <a href="#TABLE3">Table 3</a> (N=168,000). This is because the  		definition of unmet need is the same in both tables. But the <i>proportion</i>  		of elderly disabled with unmet needs decreases from <a href="#TABLE3">Table  		3</a> to <a href="#TABLE4">Table 4</a> (from 8.1% to 5.2%) simply as a function  		of the larger denominator in <a href="#TABLE4">Table 4</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, even when disability and unmet need definitions are  		modified, as presented in <a href="#TABLE3">Table 3</a> and <a href="#TABLE4">Table 4</a>, persons with the greatest disability (5-6  		limitations) are still found to have an inordinate proportion of unmet needs  		compared to persons with fewer disabilities. While this pattern is upheld,  		regardless of definitions employed, the pattern is not as strong in the SMI-1  		estimates where those with only 1-2 limitations experience nearly as much unmet  		need as do those with 5-6 limitations (i.e., 8.4% of those with 1-2 limitations  		and 9.0% of those with 5-6 limitations have unmet needs).</p>
<p>While the reliability of unmet need estimates for specific ADLs is  		questionable, as discussed above, these estimates do provide us with some  		information about in which ADLs the elderly are most likely to report unmet  		need. In all four sets of estimates unmet need in toileting is most prevalent.  		Due to varying definitions of both disability and unmet need, the percent of  		the disabled elderly with unmet need in toileting ranges from 2.6 percent  		(SMI-2) to 39.8 percent (DUKE-1). Unlike most of the ADL specific estimates  		these do meet precision criteria and thus we have confidence that they are  		reliable estimates. Interestingly, this varies from what the General Accounting  		Office (GAO) reported in their results using the 1982 NLTCS where indoor  		mobility was found to be the most prevalent unmet ADL.<font><a href="#note17">17</a></font> It is difficult to isolate the reasons for this  		difference as the GAO report did not specify operational definitions. In  		contrast it is worth noting that indoor mobility ("Getting Around") is one of  		the two <i>least</i> prevalent unmet ADLs in all of our estimates, along with  		eating Dr. Manton's original estimates as published are consistent with our  		findings in this regard (see <a href="#EXHIBITA">Exhibit A</a>).</p>
<p><a href="#TABLE5">Table 5</a> provides a summary of the four alternative  		estimates for the 1984 population. In <a href="#TABLE6">Table 6</a>, the 1984  		estimates have been adjusted to reflect the 1990 population. Trends described  		above remain essentially unchanged for the 1990 adjustments. Of course, both  		the number of disabled, as well as the number with unmet need increases between  		1984 and 1990 due to the growth of the elderly population during these years.  		For example, the total number of disabled using the SMI-1 definitions is  		approximately 2.4 million, up from 2.0 million in 1984. The comparable increase  		in unmet need is about 31,000 for a total of 199,000, up from approximately  		168,000 in 1984.</p>
<h2>CORRELATES OF UNMET NEEDS</h2>
<p>The majority of persons reporting unmet need as defined in the SMI-1 and  		SMI-2 estimates above have only one unmet need. That is, nearly 84 percent  		(83.9%) of those with any unmet need report not getting help in just one ADL  		(data not shown). As shown in <a href="#TABLE7">Table 7</a>, the oldest-old  		(age 85+) are slightly more likely to have an unmet need as compared to their  		younger counterparts (9.2% for 85+ versus 8.1% and 7.8% for the 65-74 and 75-84  		age groups, respectively). In contrast to what was reported by an earlier study  		by the General Accounting Office,<font><a href="#note18">18</a></font> our results suggest that disabled males are  		slightly more likely to have unmet needs (8.6%) than are disabled females  		(7.9%). Also, whites and those with impaired cognitive status were more likely  		to report unmet need. None of these differences are very substantial, as the  		overall prevalence of unmet need for the disabled population was 8.1 percent,  		using the SMI-1 definitions of disability and unmet need.</p>
<p>More striking, however, is the finding that a full 16.5 percent of the  		disabled elderly who live alone have unmet need. This contrasts to 5.1 percent  		of those living with a spouse, 4.9 percent of those residing with a spouse and  		another household member(s), and 7.1 percent of those who live with a  		non-spouse household member(s). The marital status finding, while not as  		marked, indicates that the non-married disabled elderly are also at greater  		risk of experiencing unmet need. Both results suggest the importance of  		informal supports in meeting the needs of the disabled elderly.</p>
<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p>How many disabled elderly are at risk because they do not receive the  		assistance that they need in basic self-maintenance activities? This question,  		as is its answer, is reminiscent of the question: How many disabled elderly are  		there? As demonstrated by prior research, the answer to the latter question is  		not at all straight-forward, and has been shown to be dependent on how one  		defines disability. Likewise, the results presented in this report indicate  		that estimates of the number of elderly with unmet need are sensitive to how  		one chooses to define "unmet need". Depending upon the specific definition  		invoked, estimates range between approximately 199,000 and 1.8 million in 1990.  		This translates to between 5.3 and 42.0 percent of the disabled elderly  		population.<font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></p>
<p>These estimates, regardless of their definitional origins, should be  		considered <i>underestimates</i> of the true prevalence of unmet need in ADLs.  		Not counted in these estimates are needs which receive some, but not  		sufficient, attention. Undermet, or residual unmet, needs conceivably place the  		elderly at risk of further functional decline, morbidity, or even perhaps  		institutionalization and death. But we were unable to estimate the number of  		disabled older persons with undermet needs due to limitations in the data  		provided by the NLTCS. Nevertheless, these estimates do provide an indication  		of the magnitude of the most serious type of unmet needs, i.e., those that are  		remaining completely unaddressed.</p>
<p>Clearly, one way of meeting unmet needs is to supply formal services in  		the form of home or institutional cars, or to rally the support of family and  		friends so that they may provide care for the vulnerable elderly person. In  		many instances, there are obstacles--financial as well as social--to one or  		both of these solutions. But that discussion is beyond the scope of this  		paper.</p>
<p>There may be, however, an alternate method for meeting at least some of  		the needs that are going unmet. Some impaired individuals may be able to  		compensate for a disability by using an assistive device that currently exists  		or which may be developed in the future. Use of such equipment may enable some  		to overcome disability altogether, or at the very least may relieve some of the  		burden assumed by caregivers. More extensive use of assistive devices may, in  		selected cases, be instrumental in addressing the unmet needs of those who live  		alone, a group identified by our analyses as having the highest rate of unmet  		need of any group of disabled elders.</p>
<p>Additional evidence provided by the 1984 NLTCS indicates that there are  		needs that might be ameliorated if assistive devices were used with more  		frequency. That is, we found that 36 percent of those with ADL disabilities  		(SMI-1 definition) said that they didn't use a specific device (e.g., hand  		rails, grab bars, ramps, elevators/stair lifts, extra wide doors/hallways, push  		bars on doors, a raised toilet seat, or a more convenient toilet room/portable  		toilet), but that such equipment would make things easier or more comfortable  		for them. More specifically, for example, about 16 percent of those with unmet  		needs in toileting (SMI-1 definition) said that they didn't have hand rails or  		grab bars in their homes, but could use them if they had them. Also, 16 percent  		of those with an unmet need in toileting reported that they didn't have access  		to a raised toilet seat, but if they did life would be easier. Moreover, nearly  		13 percent of those with toileting unmet need also said that they didn't have  		easy access to a bathroom or portable toilet at night, and 16 percent didn't  		have adequate access during the daytime. While it's difficult to estimate how  		much unmet need in toileting, and other ADLs, could be alleviated by  		introducing special equipment, undeniably it would have some impact on reducing  		unmet need.</p>
<p>Persons responsible for designing future surveys of the disabled should  		consider including questions crafted to elicit information on the extent of  		unmet need. This might be done by employing a skip pattern in the survey  		whereby persons identified as disabled in a given functional task (i.e.,  		needing or receiving human assistance, or using an assistive device) would be  		asked an additional question about unmet need in that task. The question might  		be worded:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>How often do you go without the help that you need, because no one  		  is available to help you?</i></p>
<ul><li><i>Always, or almost always</i> </li>
<li><i>Sometimes</i> </li>
<li><i>Almost never, or never</i> </li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>A question worded in this manner would elicit information on both unmet  		as well as undermet need in a given ADL (or IADL). If the survey budget  		prohibits the addition one unmet need question per functional task, then  		clustering a few functional items within one unmet need question might be a  		reasonable alternative. One might also consider a second unmet need follow-up  		question that solicits information about the respondent's potential use of  		special equipment which might render him/her both more independent and perhaps  		diminish unmet need. That question might have wording similar to the  		following:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>(How much) would special equipment such as ..... help you to be  		  less dependent on the help of others in (task)?</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In sum, one current survey of the elderly (NLTCS) does furnish us with  		some information on the number of elderly with unmet needs. But this  		information is limited, and at best affords an underestimate of those whose  		needs are being neglected. There is still a major gap in our knowledge, and it  		is an important gap to fill. In the current fiscal environment, legislators and  		policymakers contemplating expanding long-term care coverage will no doubt be  		faced with having to justify the need for expansions, and this type of  		information could prove valuable when eligibility and coverage issues are  		debated.</p>
