</dl><h2><a name="abs" id="abs">ABSTRACT</a></h2>
<p>Data are presented to defend the theory that families use the kind of  		care which is available -to them and affordable. Survey of Income and Program  		Participation (SIPP) data on marital status, other adults in the home, hours  		the mother works, age of mother, region and city size (indicators of the  		availability of other care providers) in addition to socioeconomic variables  		and number of children (indicators of affordability) combine to differentiate  		users of care by father, grandmother, sibling, nonrelative and center. Such  		variables also predict who pays for care and how touch they pay.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>The increase in the number of mothers of young children in the work  		force in the last 10 years has spawned a concomitant increase in interest in  		statistics on the usage of different kinds of child care. What sorts of care  		are being used by different sorts of families? Who is paying for care? How much  		do people pay? </p>
<p>Economists (e.g., Robins, 1987) tend to phrase these questions in terms  		of the use of market care (child care which is paid for) as opposed to  		non-market care. They are interested in how the "choice" of market care is  		influenced by such variables as the education of the parents, the income of the  		family and the wage that the mother could earn, should she enter the paid work  		force. Psychologists (e.g., Ruopp et al., 1979) frequently discuss child care  		issues in terms of the quality of care encouraged by different environments  		(e.g., the more formal day care center or family day care home as opposed to  		more informal care by relatives) and the effects on children of differences in  		such variables as group size and the training of staff. Federal government  		officials, concerned with the design and implementation of programs for  		low-income families, focus more on questions of the kinds of care that should  		be approved as part of a government-sponsored program, the degree to which it  		should be subsidized, and the amount such a subsidy would cost. </p>
<p>In this paper we discuss certain concerns of psychologists in  		differentiating the sorts of families who use formal versus more informal care  		arrangements and the general concern of economists about the kinds of families  		using market care. We report on a national data base which includes more of the  		variables used in econometric modeling of child care usage patterns than would  		generally be selected by psychologists. We do not discuss the central concern  		of psychologists and early child educators about the quality of care because  		data on this subject are not available in conjunction with family data on child  		care usage. We do conclude sections with discussions of the usefulness of the  		data for Federal staff planning child care initiatives. </p>
<p>Our goal is to present a theory which differentiates those families who  		use informal care (care by the child's parents, siblings, grandparents or other  		relatives) from those using more formal arrangements (care by nonrelatives in  		homes or in day care facilities) and those who pay for care from those who do  		not pay. Then we determine the degree to which data from a national survey  		support the theory. The basic premise of the theory is drawn from Morgan (1983)  		who believes that <b>families use the kind of care which is available to them  		and affordable</b>. </p>
<p>The arguments for availability are as follows. Informal care  		arrangements will be made for young children when a relative lives nearby, is  		not employed or involved in an educational or training program during the hours  		when child care is needed, and is willing to serve as care provider. A father  		might provide care if he is unemployed, works on a shift which is different  		from his wife's, or is involved in an educational program with classes in hours  		different from his wife's hours of employment. His availability is probably  		maximized when his wife works part-time since the hours of her work may be more  		likely to be outside of 9 to 5 or adaptable to his schedule. A grandmother or  		other relative might be used as caregiver when she lives nearby or with the  		mother, is young and healthy enough to be willing and able to care for  		children, and is not employed outside the home the same hours as the mother.  		More formal care arrangements, on the other hand, will occur more often when  		there are no available relatives or when there is an ample supply of center  		care or family day care homes. That is, care by nonrelatives in homes,  		preschools, day care centers and after-school programs will be more common when  		mothers work full-time (conflicting with the availability of any relatives).  		And since center care is more readily available in the southern  		states<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> and in  		metropolitan areas, it will be used more often in cities than in more rural  		areas. </p>
<p>In terns of affordability, other hypotheses can be made. First, informal  		care may be used more by families in lower socioeconomic groups; more formal  		care may be used more often by families in higher groups. Informal care is  		likely to be used when families have a larger number of young children for whom  		care is needed; formal care may be used more frequently by families with only  		one or perhaps two young children needing care. </p>
<p>In addition, we should like to propose certain hypotheses based on a  		notion of personal or group preference. We believe that families often prefer  		in-home care (by relatives, where possible) for infants and toddlers, but  		prefer center care for their older preschoolers. School-age children may  		generally be care for, in the neighborhood where they live or go to school, in  		their own home or the home of a neighbor or friend rather than a relative or  		family day care provider. </p>
<h2><a name="data" id="data">DATA SOURCES</a></h2>
<p>Several national surveys conducted by the Bureau of the Census have  		supplied data on patterns of child care usage in the United States. Their  		results support the theory outlined above. For example, the Current Population  		Surveys (CPS) conducted by the Bureau of the Census in 1958, 1965, 1977 and  		1982 polled nationally representative samples about the kinds of care working  		people used and the cost of such care. The review, <b>Trends in Child Care  		Arrangements of Working Mothers</b>, considering data from 1965 to 1977 (U.S.  		Bureau of the Census, 1982) and the report on-the 1982 survey, <b>Child Care  		Arrangements of Working Mothers: June 1982</b>, discuss several results which  		relate the use of different care arrangements to the availability of  		caregivers. These surveys found more care by fathers among married couples,  		especially where the mother was working part-time; more care by grandmothers  		and other relatives in households of unmarried mothers living with another  		adult; and more formal care among unmarried mothers working full-time with no  		other adult in their households. In addition, formal care was more often used  		in metropolitan areas than in non-metropolitan areas. </p>
<p>Data from these surveys also support the notion that care arrangements  		are related to their affordability. Specifically, measures of level of parental  		education, family income, and parental occupations all relate to the kinds of  		care used. Relatives are more often used by families who can not afford to pay  		much money for child care -- those with lower levels of education and incomes  		where neither parent is in a white-collar job. Care by nonrelatives is more  		common among parents who can afford to pay for care -- those families where  		parents are well educated, have higher incomes, and where both parents work in  		white-collar occupations. </p>
<p>In matters of personal or group preference, these surveys have two  		common results. Black families use less care by father, more care by other  		relatives, and more center care than White families. And, with regard to the  		ages of children, the findings show that center care is much more common among  		children from 3- to 5-years-old than for younger children. </p>
<p>Generally, these findings have resulted from unidimensional analyses of  		data where, for instance, level of education is related to child care  		arrangement. It is the purpose of this paper to update the results from  		previous Census surveys and extend them by using more recent data (from 1985)  		and constructing multidimensional models predicting the use of different kinds  		of care and who pays for care from many different 'family descriptors. </p>
<h2><a name="SIPP" id="SIPP">THE SURVEY OF INCOME AND PROGRAM PARTICIPATION  		(SIPP)</a></h2>
<p>Data for the present analysis are derived from the Survey of Income and  		Program Participation. The SIPP, conducted by the Bureau of the Census, gathers  		longitudinal data on social and demographic characteristics, labor force  		participation, earnings and income, and participation in Federal programs. Each  		sample or "panel" is selected to represent the civilian noninstitutional  		population of the United States. Representative households participate in the  		study over a period of approximately 2 1/2 years, being interviewed every four  		months. </p>
<p>This paper concerns the fifth set of interviews of the 1984 Panel. This  		wave of interviews contained a special topical module on child care which asked  		working guardians about the care arrangements for their youngest three children  		under the age of 15. Its interviews were conducted in January through April of  		1985; for each household, the child care questions concerned the month  		immediately preceding the interview. Thus, the information on child care  		reflects care in the winter months of December, 1984 through March, 1985. </p>
<p>The 1984 Panel initially selected 25,000 housing units of which about  		20,000 were occupied and eligible for interview. All individuals ages 15 and  		older in the household were interviewed, a total of 53,726 people. By the time  		of the fifth wave, 51,975 people remained active in the sample, -of-which 3,601  		declared they-were working guardians of children under 15. They each answered  		the questions about child care, discussing the arrangements made for 5,564  		children. It is these answers which are discussed below. </p>
<p>In presenting data, we first discuss the general results from SIPP, then  		discuss the model for connecting family descriptors and child care  		arrangements, and finally describe the results from analyzing the model. After  		the analysis of kind of care used by families, we continue with an analysis of  		who pays for care and how much they pay. </p>
<h2><a name="type" id="type">TYPE OF CHILD CARE ARRANGEMENT</a></h2>
<p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> provides a summary of the kinds of  		arrangements made for children in sample households. The findings are grouped  		by age of child. If a family had two or more children in one of the age groups,  		data for the youngest child were included in the table. For children aged 0 to  		5, primary care arrangements are noted. For older children, whose primary care  		arrangements were usually school, secondary care arrangements are recorded.  		</p>
<p>Some explanations of entries in the table are relevant. First, "in-home"  		care categories generally include care in the child's home and in the  		provider's home. So, for example, in-home care by grandmother includes care in  		the child's home, as well as care in the grandmother's home. This combination  		of different homes was done to focus on the individual acting as caregiver and  		to raise the sample size using particular caregivers to allow for subsequent  		analyses of as many groups as possible by age of child. The exception to this  		combination of categories is nonrelative care. Because of the considerable  		difference between care in the child's home by a nonrelative (sometimes a  		"Nanny") and care in a nonrelative's home (often a family day care in-home),  		these kinds of care have been separated on the table. </p>

</tr></table><p>Second, the alternative to care in a home situation is referred to as  		"out-of-home" care, implying that children are in the formal care arrangements  		defined by day care centers, preschools or schools or that they are cared for  		by the mother where she works. Third, let us clarify the use of "Mother" as  		principal caregiver in this data base of working mothers. This category occurs  		because many mothers work part-time, and consider that they are still the  		primary caregiver for their children. Some mothers even work full-time (for  		example, on the night shift) and retain the role of primary caregiver. </p>
<p>The findings may be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>A family home (either the child's own or another home) is the most  			 frequent place in which care occurs for preschool children, housing 82, 78 and  			 62 percent of children in the three age groups of preschoolers on  			 <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. Out-of-home arrangements are more frequent than  			 in-home situations for the primary care of children 5-years-old and above, but  			 the home is the most frequent form of secondary care for school-aged children,  			 when 77 percent of 6- to 8-year-olds and 88 percent of 9- to 12-year-olds are  			 cared for in a home environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Care by relatives (mother, father, self, sibling, grandmother, and  			 other relatives) accounts for the greatest percentage of in-home care for all  			 ages of children (59, 60, 65, 68, 68, and 83% respectively).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fathers and grandmothers are the most common caretakers in the homes  			 of children with working mothers until children are in the older grades of  			 elementary school (aged 9 to 12) when self and sibling care supercede.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of formal day care arrangements in centers, preschools, and  			 after-school programs peaks with 3- and 4-year-olds at 33 percent of children,  			 though it is relatively common for all ages up to 8. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Thus, as in previous data bases, in-home care -- particularly by  		relatives -- is very prevalent for young children of working guardians. When  		the child's guardian (usually the mother) is at work, fathers and grandmothers  		assume the greatest burden for child care, with siblings given responsibility  		for older elementary school-aged children. </p>
<p>The first Census report on the SIPP child care data, <b>Who's Minding  		the Kids?</b> (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1987), presents similar data to those  		quoted above and goes on to discuss differences between the families who use  		different kinds of care in terms of the guardian's marital status, education,  		occupation, race, and hours of employment (full-time vs. part-time). In  		general, tables are 3-way, displaying kind of care, age of child and one  		descriptor of the guardian. </p>
<p>It is the purpose of this report to develop models predicting the choice  		of kind of care from the range of descriptors of the guardian accessible  		through the data base. Variables can be divided into groups defining measures  		of availability, affordability and group preference, so that the discussion of  		results can inform the suggested theory. </p>
<h2><a name="overview" id="overview">OVERVIEW OF APPROACH TO PREDICTING KIND OF CARE  		USED</a></h2>
<p>In order to develop models of what sorts of families use different kinds  		of care, the statistical technique of probit analysis was chosen (Pindyck &amp;  		Rubinfeld, 1976). This technique is similar to regression analysis in that it  		uses information from a series of "independent" variables (e.g., marital status  		of guardian, education, income) to predict behavior on a "dependent" variable  		(use of father care or another sort of care). The major difference in this type  		of analysis is that the dependent variable must be in the form of Yes/No (Uses  		this kind of care/Does not use this kind of care). </p>
<p>The notion of availability of types of care can be explored through the  		SUP variables of marital status, hours of work, age of mother, region and  		metropolitan area:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Marital status</b>. Three variables represent this category:  			 single mothers residing with no other adult; single mothers residing with  			 another adult (not the father of the child); and married mothers. Each variable  			 is coded as a 0 (not true of this family) or a 1 (true of this family). The two  			 which appear in the analyses are the two descriptors of single mothers; all  			 results should be interpreted as a comparison of these single mothers to  			 married mothers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hours of Work</b>. The variable Part-time describing mothers who  			 worked less than 32 hours a week is used in the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Age of Mother</b>. Mothers were divided into those under 26,  			 those 26 to 35, and those over 35. The variables representing the youngest and  			 oldest groups appear in all equations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Region</b>. The Census regions of Northeast, North Central, South  			 and west were defined; South is the comparison region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Metropolitan Area</b>. The Census definition of a Metropolitan  			 area was accepted. Those without this designation may or may not be in a  			 "metropolitan" area; those with it are definitely in an area of high population  			 density. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>That is, fathers are likely to be available when mothers are married and  		working part-time. Grandmothers are more likely to be available to unmarried  		mothers who are living with another adult. Grandmothers may also be more  		available when mothers are younger, so that the grandmothers are also  		relatively young. Formal care arrangements are more likely to be available in  		southern states and in cities. </p>
<p>The idea of affordability is examined through the various measures of  		socioeconomic status (mother's education, occupation and family earnings) and  		the number of children in the family.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Mother's Education</b>. The four categories of education are:  			 less than a high school degree, a high school degree, sane college or a college  			 degree, and training beyond college. The variable representing those with a  			 high school degree does not appear in the models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Mother's Occupation</b>. Four occupational groups were defined  			 using the traditional us categories: Professional, Sales, Service, and  			 Labor/Craft. Too few mothers were in the Armed Forces to include that group. In  			 the analyses, Sales is not included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Family Earnings</b>. The natural log of Earnings for the family  			 or sub-family (in a complex household) for the month of December, 1984 was used  			 as this measure. All members of the sample had provided information on this  			 particular month. Earnings was chosen instead of income since it represented a  			 more regular influx of monies, one on which it seemed more likely that families  			 would base their budgeting for child care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Number of Children in Age Groups</b>. Three variables define the  			 number of children in various age groups: the number of children in the family  			 between the ages of 0 and 6; 7 and 10; and 11 and 14. All three variables may  			 be entered into the probit analyses as they are measured independently of each  			 other. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Specifically, care by relatives is likely to be more common among  		families who are less able to pay for care -- those with less education,  		occupations in the blue collar groups, and lower incomes. Also, families with  		many children will be less likely to be able to purchase care for those  		children, especially if a number of children are of preschool age. </p>
<p>The final variable, race, may yield results suggesting different  		preferences across racial groups.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Race</b>. All guardians were classified as Non-White or White.  			 The category "White" includes Hispanics. The variable Non-White appears in all  			 analyses. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>There have been previous results showing different usage patterns for  		Black and White families, and we may expect those to be repeated here. It may  		be that racial groups differ in the availability of different kinds of care.  		Even after taking account of the socioeconomic measures listed above, there may  		be differences in the affordability of care, perhaps due to interactions among  		availability and affordability variables. Or, there may be another set of very  		different measures which accounts for racial differences in usage of different  		kinds of care. </p>
<p>In the presentation which follows we discuss models predicting the five  		most frequent care arrangements (all of those with sufficient samples<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> to permit the probit analysis).  		We describe first families which use informal, in-home care by father,  		grandmother, or siblings since informal care is the more prevalent care  		arrangement. Then we describe families which use more formal care supplied by  		nonrelatives in their own "family day care homes" and in centers. For each kind  		of care we separate the results for children in six age groups: infants less  		than 1-year-old, toddlers 1- to 2-years-old, preschool children aged 3- to  		4-years-old, 5-year-olds, 6- to 8-year-olds, and 9- to 12-rear-olds. Because of  		constraints from the size of the samples within each age group, some care  		arrangements are discussed for a subset of ages, rather than all ages. </p>
<p>The tables which present data from the probit analyses show "effect  		sizes" for each of the independent variables. That is, the numbers show the  		size of the effect of moving from a score of 0 on a variable to a score of 1.  		For the predictor of part-time work, for example, they show the change in the  		probability of using a particular kind of care from those working full-time  		(those with a score of 0 on the variable) to those working part-time (scoring 1  		on this variable). On <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>, for example, the change in  		the probability of using father care for infants in families where the mother  		works full-time to those where the mother works part-time is .148. Families in  		which the mother works part-time are 14.8 percentage points more likely to use  		father care for their infants than families in which the mother works  		full-time. As is usual in statistical presentations, the plus sign and stars  		indicate the level of significance of the effect. This particular effect of  		hours of work is significant at the .001 level. </p>
<p>In the example using "part-time" as a predictor, the comparison group  		(full-time) is straightforward. Among groups of variables describing different  		levels of education, occupational categories, marital status, or region of the  		country, the comparison group is not as obvious. It is the one category which  		does not appear on the table. For example, three levels of education are listed  		an <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>: mother's education less than a high school  		degree, mother's education involved some college courses or a college degree,  		and mother's education included some advanced courses beyond college. The  		missing level is mother's education included a high school diploma, but no  		further course work. So, if there is a significant result shown for any of the  		three levels of education on the table, mothers in the significant category are  		more likely (if the effect size is positive) or less likely (if the effect size  		is negative) to use father care than mothers with a high school diploma. </p>
<p>It is also possible to compute the significance of differences between  		levels of the same variable when both levels are shown on the tables. To  		accomplish this, one calculates a t-statistic from the coefficients and  		standard errors of the two levels of the variable. Where the results suggest  		that the levels of a variable differ, we have done these calculations and  		reported any significant differences in the text. </p>
<p>Since it is rare for results to be completely consistent across all age  		groups, we discuss the findings that are significant in about half of the age  		groups and in a consistent direction in the other groups. Because of confusion  		introduced by same male guardians in the sample, only data for children with  		female guardians are presented. </p>
<h2><a name="father" id="father">FATHER CARE</a></h2>
<p>The family descriptors which are related to use of the father for child  		care support the theory that the use of different kinds of care is related to  		availability and affordability. Several variables show consistent results  		across age groups when examining father care (see <a href="#table2">Table  		2</a>): marital status of the mother; part-time work status of the mother; the  		region of the country in which she lives; mother's education and occupation;  		and the number of children in the family. The first two suggest that father  		care is used more when the father is available:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Single mothers, whether or not they live with another adult, are  			 less likely to use father care than couples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When mothers are working part-tine, fathers are much more often used  			 as child care providers than when mothers are working full-time. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The father is not available in the household of a single mother, so it  		seems reasonable he would be used less as a primary caregiver than other, more  		available people. Since most of the fathers in the sample were employed, and so  		were not easily available for full-time child care (unless both members of the  		couple did shift work and chose different hours), fathers were more often used  		when mothers worked part-time. According to the research of Harriet Presser  		(1986), shift work is very common among families with young children, so that  		it is not a surprise that so many fathers have some hours available for care  		while their wives are working.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The third finding, concerning region of the country, suggests that  		father care is used when form of market care are not as prevalent:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Father care is much more prevalent in the Northeast, and somewhat  			 more prevalent in the north central and western-states than in the South.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Regional differences in the use of father care may be due to the fact  		that the supply of center care is more substantial (and-perhaps less costly) in  		some parts of the country (e.g., the southern states) than in others. Or, it  		may be that there are different attitudes toward kinds of care in different  		parts of the country which lead to a more frequent use of informal arrangements  		in same regions and more formal ones in others. A good national study of the  		supply of market care would be useful in pinpointing the degree of regional  		differences in the supply and cost of center care and family day care homes.  		</p>
<p>In contrast to these findings which may be explained by the availability  		or lack of availability of fathers, other consistent findings suggest that a  		part of the decision about care may be economic.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Mothers with course work beyond college are less likely to use  			 father care than mothers in any other educational group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mothers who work in service occupations are more likely to use  			 father care than mothers in technical and sales occupations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The greater the number of children under the age of 10, the more  			 likely the family is to use father care. </p>
</li>

</tr></table><p>These variables combine to suggest a socioeconomic explanation of the  		use of father care. Mothers who are very well educated are likely to have  		spouses who are also well educated, who have careers that take time above and  		beyond a 40-hour week, and who do not choose to do child care. These better  		educated parents find sources of care outside the nuclear family. In a sense,  		the father is not "available" to provide care, but more practically, he  		commands a salary in the workplace which is sufficiently high that he cannot  		choose to stay home with children. In addition, mothers in service occupations  		use <b>more</b> father care. This may be because these mothers are earning low  		salaries and feel that the use of market care would reduce their contribution  		to family earnings to just about zero. Or, it may be that mothers in service  		occupations have more flexible working hours than women in other occupational  		groups and can arrange to work a different set of hours than their husbands. In  		this case the availability of the spouse dovetails with the affordability of  		his care. If a family has only one or two children, it is likely to be easier  		to pay for care than if there are more children. With a larger family, the  		father is called upon as a resource for care in place of paying an outsider.  		</p>
<p>It is important to note that there is not a significant or consistent  		trend for the variable of family earnings. After factoring out the effects of  		level of education, occupation, and number of children, the amount the family  		earns does not predict the use of father care. So, socioeconomic variables do  		seem to play a role in determining kind of care used. They may well be acting  		to reduce the choice of families about kind of care. When care would be  		relatively costly (families have more young children) and/or the mother is  		earning a low salary (in a service occupation), the family may feel forced to  		use father care because other alternatives are perceived as too costly. On the  		other hand, when mothers (and probably fathers) are well educated, the father  		may simply not be an available choice for care provider. </p>
<p>Thus, in the analyses of the model describing families which use father  		care, our theory holds. Father care is used in families with fathers present,  		where the hours a mother works can be arranged around the hours a father works,  		and in regions of the country where center care is less readily available (or,  		perhaps, less costly). And it is used where socioeconomic variables encourage  		such care. </p>
<h2><a name="grandmother" id="grandmother">GRANDMOTHER CARE</a></h2>
<p>The theory that available caregivers are the ones who are used is  		supported by two results on grandmother care. First, marital status is related  		to the use of grandmother care (see <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>):</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Single mothers who reside with another adult more often use  			 grandmother care than do couples. This is especially true for single mothers of  			 infants and toddlers. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>In many cases where mothers are living with other adults, these other  		adults are 20 to 30 years older than the mother. This would suggest that they  		are, in fact, the mother's parents. With an available child care provider in  		the house, it is not surprising that these mothers elect grandmother care more  		often than other mothers. </p>

</tr></table><p>The high level of significance of this predictor for mothers of the  		youngest age groups of children may have several explanations. Mothers with  		very young children may still be trying to establish themselves financially to  		be able to live on their own; the arrangement of living with grandparents is a  		useful one for the time being. Or, these mothers may prefer the support of  		their parent(s) when they have infants and toddlers, finding that the hours of  		care are easier to manage when there is an extra pair of hands to share the  		work. The use of grandmother care may became less frequent for these mothers  		when the children are 3- to 4-years-old because of a preference on the part of  		grandmothers: as they age and the children are becoming more active, it becomes  		more difficult to care for them. Also, when the first child reaches 3 or 4,  		there may be a second child, and the pair may feel too exhausting for the  		grandparent. This latter explanation is supported by the next finding:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Grandmothers are used as caregivers when there are fewer children  			 from 0 to 6 in the family. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>It would seem that grandmothers are making preferences known. They are  		willing to care for small children, as long as there are not very many of them.  		</p>
<p>The second finding supporting the notion that mothers choose  		grandmothers as caregivers at least in part because of their availability  		relates to the mother's age:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Mothers over the age of 35, especially those with children  			 6-years-old or more, rarely use grandmother care in comparison to younger  			 mothers. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>When mothers are in this older age group, grandmothers are probably 55-  		to 65-years-old. They may not be around to care for youngsters or they may well  		not feel like caring for children. In this sense, availability is both a  		measure of physical presence and an indicator of willingness to serve. </p>
<p>Findings on the use of informal care by a grandmother also partially  		support the notion that she is used because of her affordability:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>More</b> mothers with occupations in the labor or craft groups  			 use grandmother care than mothers in the technical/sales groups. There is a  			 trend for <b>fewer</b> mothers of 1- to 12-year-olds in service occupations to  			 use such care. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>There, thus, appears to be a hierarchy among mothers in these three  		groups of occupations. Mothers in labor and craft occupations use more  		grandmother care than do mothers in technical and sales occupations who in turn  		use more grandmother care than mothers in service occupations. It would be  		interesting to explore differences between families in these groups. If  		finances were the most powerful or only reason for choice of grandmother care,  		one would expect that mothers in labor/craft occupations and those in service  		occupations, which earn lower salaries than the professional and sales groups,  		would use more grandmother care. The fact that only mothers in labor and craft  		occupations make the selection more often than the other groups of mothers  		suggests another explanation is required. Perhaps the difference between these  		groups is in the specific hours that they work. Mothers in labor and craft  		occupations may be most likely to work from 9 to 5, followed by mothers in  		technical and sales occupations and lastly by mothers in service occupations.  		Grandmothers may not wish to care for children in the evening or on weekends.  		</p>
<p>Results concerning the variable of family earnings are also somewhat  		problematic.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Families with lower earnings and children from 1- to 12-years-old  			 tend to use more grandmother care than families with higher earnings. But the  			 earnings variable reverses itself in the case of families with infants: those  			 with higher earnings use more grandmother care. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>A financial rationale would suggest that all families with lower  		earnings would choose grandmother care, if it were available. The fact that  		families with infants show a different trend may be because finances are not  		the overarching principle for them in choosing care. When mothers of infants  		work, they may believe that grandmother care is superior and clearly opt for  		this care. </p>
<p>So, there appears to be some support for the notion that grandmother  		care is used because it is affordable, but certain trends in the data suggest  		that this is not a completely consistent rationale for using grandmothers.  		Their availability seems a consistent reason; their affordability sometimes a  		reason. </p>
<p>The last finding follows trends in previous Census studies by showing a  		relationship between race and choice of grandmother care:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Among school-aged children, there is more grandmother care in  			 NonWhite families than in White families. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>It may be that this is a cultural effect or an additional comment  		suggesting that more grandmothers are available and willing in Black and Asian  		families than in White families. </p>
<p>In sum, where grandmothers are available, they are often used,  		particularly by families whose finances suggest that such free or low cost care  		is advisable. In the case of families with infants and NonWhite families, the  		grandmother may well be the caregiver of choice. For their part, grandmothers  		may make clear a preference for younger children, for fewer children, and for  		hours of care that are during the day: they are willing to help, but understand  		their limits. </p>
<h2><a name="sibling" id="sibling">SIBLING CARE</a></h2>
<p>It is only with the oldest group of children, 9- to 12-year-olds, that  		sufficient sibling care exists to perform a probit analysis. <a href="#table4">Table 4</a> shows that four variables significantly describe  		those families who choose sibling care: the two which describe the households  		of single mothers; one referring to mother's age; and the variable of race. The  		first three support the notion of availability of caregivers leading to their  		use; the finding regarding race may support the theory of differences in group  		preferences or it, too, may reflect a difference across racial groups in the  		availability of alternatives. First, with regard to availability, we found  		that</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Sibling care is used more often by single mothers (with and without  			 another adult in the household) than by couples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also used more by older mothers (those over 35) than by  			 younger mothers. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>It would seen that older, single mothers do not have the supportive cast  		available to younger, married mothers. Fathers are not present; grandmothers  		are older and may not be able to care for children. Older siblings, however,  		are often available and may well be asked to serve as caregivers. </p>
<p>The fourth important predictor of sibling care is race:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>NonWhite families use siblings more frequently than white families.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is an interesting result. It may be that programs for the older  		children in NonWhite families are just not as easily available in the schools,  		or it may be that NonWhite families prefer giving their teen-agers  		responsibility for other family members. </p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="nonrelative" id="nonrelative">CARE BY NONRELATIVES</a></h2>
<p>Only care of children under the age of 6 is included in this set of  		analyses (see <a href="#table5">Table 5</a>) as nonrelative care is not  		sufficiently prevalent for school-aged children to allow for probit analyses.  		The measures of marital status and hours of work, with consistent results  		-across age groups, suggest that mothers may use care by nonrelatives when  		relatives are not available or, perhaps, not willing:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Single mothers with no other adult in the household use more  			 nonrelative care than couples. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>In these family situations, the child's father and grandparents are not  		readily available to provide care, so it makes sense that more mothers in this  		position need to seek care outside of the extended family. Second,</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Those working full-time (not working part-time) use nonrelative care  			 more often than those working part-time. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>One clear finding in the earlier section on father care was that fathers  		could be called upon for child care if the mothers worked part-time, but were  		much less frequently available if the mothers worked full-time. This finding on  		nonrelative care is the reverse side of the coin. When full-time care is  		required, it is more likely for parents to use sources outside the family. </p>
<p>The next consistent finding may be due to different levels of supply of  		nonrelative care in different regions of the country, to differential costs, or  		to group preferences, however they might have been established:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Families in the north central states use more nonrelative care than  			 families in the South. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>We found core father care in areas outside the South; here we see a  		preference for nonrelative care in one area -- the north central states -- over  		the South. While differences were not particularly expected for the variable of  		region of the country, they are evident in the data. </p>
<p>The last consistent finding is connected to the finances of care:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Families with higher earnings use more nonrelative care. Since most  			 nonrelatives require payment for care, it seems reasonable that families more  			 able to pay would more often elect nonrelative care </p>

</tr></table><p>The picture of users of nonrelative care, the first type of formal care,  		is very different from that for users of informal care arrangements. For one,  		nonrelative care seem to be used when care by relatives is not easily  		available. For example, it is used by mothers with no other adult in the  		household (i.e., no father or grandmother), and it is used when the mother  		works full-time, a situation which, even in couples, often precludes care by  		the father. Because we are talking about care for children under 6, it is  		unlikely that there are many families with siblings of sufficient age to be  		entrusted with the care of young children. </p>
<p>Though the grandmother may not live with the family, one might  		hypothesize that she is available to some of the families who choose  		nonrelative care. However, the families who ultimately do use nonrelative care  		are different from those who use grandmother care in the key fact that they  		have higher earnings. This might mean that they (and the grandmother) have a  		choice in who cares for the child; it might mean that the grandmother is also  		working; or it might also mean that these families have been free to move away  		from the grandmother and do not have her child care services available. </p>
<p>One might also note that the use of nonrelative care crosses education  		and occupational groups, and age groups of mothers. Members of all groups who  		are in need of full-time care (and who may not have choices of relatives for  		such care) find the family day care home to be a solution. </p>
<h2><a name="center" id="center">CENTER CARE</a></h2>
<p>Of the seven variables which consistently predict use of center care,  		three relate to the lack of availability of other forms of care (mother's hours  		of work, region and metropolitan area), three to affordability (number of  		children in the family, mother's occupation, and family earnings); and one  		deals with the issue of cultural preference or, perhaps, some combination of  		availability and affordability (race). (See <a href="#table7">Table 7</a>).  		With regard to availability we have the following findings:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Center care is used less by part-time workers than by full-time  			 workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Families in the north central states, the Northeast and the West use  			 center care less frequently than those in the South.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Center care is more frequent in metropolitan areas. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>When the nether is working full-time, she may well overlap working hours  		with the father, so that he is not available for care. The number of hours of  		care required may be too extensive for the grandmother (if she lives nearby).  		Other relatives may be unwilling to extend their services for so many hours  		each week. The choices for full-time care seem to be care by nonrelatives,  		either in a family day care home or a center. Since centers are more frequently  		available in the South and in metropolitan areas, it seems reasonable that  		southerners and city dwellers do use this form of care more often than those in  		other parts of the country or in less densely populated areas where the supply  		of care is more limited. </p>
<p>The fact that center care is a form of market care -- that it is usually  		paid for -- would seem to account for the next results:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Families with fewer children more often use center care than  			 families with more children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mothers in service occupations use center care more sparingly than  			 mothers is technical, sales, management and professional occupations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Center care is used more often by families with higher earnings.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The families who use center care are thus in a better position to afford  		payments for care. They have fewer children to pay for, they are in occupations  		with relatively higher salaries, and their family earnings are greater. Also,  		mothers working in service occupations may be working more unusual hours (shift  		work or weekends) when centers are less available. </p>
<p>Finally, there is a result for race:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>NonWhite mothers use center care more frequently than White mothers.  			 </p>
</li>
</ul><p>This repeats the results of previous Census studies, though the reason  		for it remains unclear. It may be a matter of availability of center care or a  		cultural preference or a combination of reasons. </p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY OF FINDINGS ON TYPE OF CARE</a></h2>
<p>The findings cited above, when reorganized according to the descriptors  		of families, show the strength of the theory which holds that availability and  		affordability are the reasons families use different kinds of care.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Marital status</b>. The results suggest that mothers make more  			 use of teenagers and other adults as child care providers, when they are  			 present in the household. Specifically, couples more frequently use father  			 care; single mothers living with another adult more often use grandmother care;  			 single mothers with or without another adult use more sibling care for older  			 children; and single mothers with no other adult in the household use more  			 nonrelative care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Hours of work</b>. Certain child care providers are available  			 only part-time, others may be used for full-time care. Fathers fall into the  			 first category and may be counted on for care part-time; nonrelatives -- family  			 day care home providers and centers -- may be used by those requiring full-time  			 care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Age of mother</b>. Older mothers (those over 35) make less use of  			 grandmother care and more use of sibling care than younger mothers. This, too,  			 would seem to be a comment on the less frequent availability of grandmothers to  			 women over 35 and the greater frequency of older children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Region</b>. Center care is used more in the South; father care in  			 all other areas; nonrelative care in the north central states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Metropolitan area</b>. Center care is more prevalent and more  			 often used in metropolitan areas. </p>
</li>
</ol><p>The findings on economic variables are similarly supportive of the  		theory.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Socioeconomic variables</b>. Care by relatives is more common  			 among those from lower socioeconomic groups; care by nonrelatives is more  			 common among those who can more easily pay for it. From an educational  			 standpoint, mothers with course work beyond college are less likely to use  			 father care than all other mothers. From an occupational outlook, mothers in  			 service occupations are more likely to use father care, and less likely to use  			 grandmother care or center care. Mothers in craft and labor occupations are  			 more likely to use grandmother care. From an earnings perspective, families on  			 the lower end of the scale use more grandmother care for toddlers and older  			 children, and less nonrelative and center care across the age groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Number of children</b>. Families with only one child or perhaps  			 two children are more likely to use grandmother care and center care. Families  			 with a larger number of children are more likely to use father, care.  			 Grandmothers may be unwilling to care for many children; center care can be  			 very expensive if many children are involved. The father seems the chosen  			 individual if more children are in the family. </p>
</li>
</ol><p>Lastly, there are the consistent results for the variable of race, due  		perhaps to the availability of different kinds of care, perhaps to the  		interaction of measures of availability and affordability, and perhaps to  		different cultural preferences.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Race</b>. Black and Asian mothers more frequently use  			 grandmothers, siblings, and center care than `bite mothers. </p>
</li>
</ol><p>So, the ability to predict the kind of care a family will use through  		judging the availability and affordability of such care is reasonable. Lower  		income families may have more relatives available to them; they can certainly  		afford such care better than they could center or nonrelative care. The  		drawbacks are that the hours of care by relatives are limited; grandmothers, at  		least, sees often to care for only 1 or 2 children and are more likely to be  		caring for these children when they are infants and toddlers. </p>
<h2><a name="modeling" id="modeling">MODELING WHO PAYS FOR CARE</a></h2>
<p>The notions of availability and affordability should be useful again in  		examining the equation describing who pays for care. If no relative is easily  		available (and willing to provide free care), the likelihood is a mother will  		use paid care. If the family can ill afford the cost of care, unpaid care  		(generally by relatives) is more likely to be used. And this is basically the  		set of findings resulting from the probit analysis of payment for care (see  		<a href="#table7">Table 7</a>). </p>
<p>Three of the findings follow from the above discussions of availability  		of relatives as caregivers:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Single mothers with no other adult in the household more often pay  			 for care than do couples or single mothers living with another adult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mothers working part-time pay for care less often than those working  			 full-time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mothers over the age of 35 pay for care less often than younger  			 mothers. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>When no other adult is living with the mother, she has no ready access  		to caregivers and is more likely to have to seek paid care by nonrelatives.  		However, other mothers may obtain unpaid care fairly easily: older mothers may  		elicit care from the child's older siblings; mothers working part-time may have  		the services of the child's father; mothers living with another adult may use  		that other adult. </p>
<p>A further finding with regard to the age of children for whom paid care  		is used would also seen to follow from the availability of care:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Families with preschoolers pay more often for care; families with  			 school-aged children pay less often for care. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Children who are in school most of the day are likely to need fewer  		hours of additional care than preschoolers, and relatives, neighbors or  		siblings may be willing to provide such hours. Older children may stay by  		themselves. Families with preschoolers, especially where the mother works  		full-time, are not likely to have the same options. </p>
<p>The variable of region is also signficantly related to paying for  		care:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Families living in the West pay for care somewhat less often than  			 those in the South. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is probably because families in the South are using more center  		care (which must be paid for) whereas families in the west are using more  		father care. </p>

</tr></table><p>It also seems clear that families who are better able to pay for care  		are the ones who do, in fact, pay for such care:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Mothers in service occupations are less likely to pay for care than  			 those in any other occupational group; families with higher earnings are more  			 likely to pay for care. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Mothers in service occupations very often use the free child care  		provided by the father, perhaps out of need, perhaps out of choice. </p>
<p>The hypotheses about availability and affordability therefore hold here,  		in who pays for care, as they did in the earlier analyses of the kind of care  		families used. Families without a father, grandmother or older sibling  		available to act as caregiver more frequently pay for care as do families with  		more money to pay for care. </p>
<p>It would be valuable at this point to be able to connect the results for  		type of care and payment for care, but unfortunately, the SIPP data base does  		not allow for this association. It asks each family how much money they spend  		on child care per week, but does not ask which child's care is paid for (to  		allow connections between type of care and payment or age of child and payment)  		let alone how much money is paid for each kind of care for each child for a  		particular number of hours (to allow calculations of hourly costs for care). It  		seem that nonrelative and center care are more frequently paid for, but we  		cannot determine the degree to which this is true or the hourly costs of each  		form of care. </p>
<h2><a name="pay" id="pay">MODELING HOW MUCH PEOPLE PAY</a></h2>
<p>In this section we are interested both in the dollar amount that  		families pay for child care and in the percentage of their income spent on  		care. We may hypothesize first that both of these indicators of size of payment  		for child care will be related primarily to whether or not the family is  		purchasing care. Families using in-home care by relatives have been shown in  		previous Census studies to pay less money for care than families using formal  		care arrangements. While we cannot use SIPP data to connect the specific kind  		of care with payment for care, we can hypothesize that the descriptors of  		families likely to use the formal care arrangements of family day care and  		center care ought to be the descriptors of families who pay more money for  		care, and holding family income constant, pay a higher percentage of their  		income on child care. The caveat in the prediction that the percentage of a  		family's income spent on care will be greater among those families using formal  		care arrangements is due to a second hypothesis: the percentage of income spent  		on care will be inversely related to family income. </p>
<p>The data show that about 30 percent of the SIPP sample of female  		guardians pays for care, a percentage which may seem small. In fact, a division  		of families by age of children shows large differences among groups.  		Specifically, 57 percent of families with all children under 6 pay for child  		care, 49 percent of those with at least one child under 6 and one child 6 or  		over, and only 12 percent of families with all children over 6. </p>
<p>The average amount paid (among families who do pay) is $39.34 per week  		which represents, on average, 9.24 percent of the family's income. On the one  		hand, $39 may not seem like a large sum. Many fairly well-to-do families might  		wonder where it is possible to find child care for $39 a week when full-time  		care for one child in a family day care home is running $80 to $100 in their  		area and center care is even more expensive. It is important to recall that  		this sample has a large group of part-time workers, that all parts of the  		country do not have the price structure for care of our major cities, and that  		these findings on costs are very similar to those in other studies of child  		care. On the other hand, $39 per week represents a considerable portion of many  		family's weekly pay check. How to manage the cost of care may be a central  		concern. </p>
<p><a href="#table8">Table 8</a> shows the results of a simple linear  		regression using family descriptors to predict how such people pay for care. In  		general, the hypothesis is substantiated that families more likely to pay for  		care are also those likely to pay more money for care:</p>
<ul><li>Single mothers living with another adult pay more money for care than  		  couples;</li>
<li>Families with more children aged 0 to 6 pay more money for care;  		  families with more children from 11 to 14 pay less for child care;</li>
<li>Mothers under 26 years of age pay less money for care than mothers 26  		  to 35 years of age;</li>
<li>Mothers who work full-time pay more money for care than mothers who  		  work part-time;</li>
<li>Mothers with occupations in the labor group pay less money for care  		  than mothers in management, professional, technical and sales occupations;</li>
<li>Mothers with education courses beyond college pay more money for  		  child care than mothers in any other educational group;</li>
<li>Families with higher earnings pay more money for care than those with  		  lower earnings. </li>
</ul><p>More particularly, we see from these data on who pays for care and how  		much people pay that couples can be more economical than single mothers. That  		is, families headed by single mothers were shown to pay more often for care  		than did couples with comparable incomes. In this analysis of how much people  		pay, single mothers with another adult in the household are seen to pay $5.23  		more per week, on average, than couples. So, couples not only pay less often  		for care, but when they pay, pay a smaller amount. </p>
<p>Similar results hold for other descriptors of family structure. From the  		results on who pays for care, we noted that families with a higher number of  		preschool-aged children were more likely to pay for care, but families with a  		greater number of school-age children were less likely to pay. On  		<a href="#table8">Table 8</a> we note that families with preschoolers must also  		expect to pay more money for care, families with 11- to 14-year-olds may pay  		less. Specifically, each additional preschool-aged child adds $10.77 to the  		families' weekly cost of care. Each 11- to 14-year-old subtracts $3.90 from the  		cost of care. </p>
<p>The earlier results for age of mother demonstrated that mothers over the  		age of 35 pay less often for care than mothers 26 to 35. This oldest group of  		mothers is more likely to have teen-agers available as caregivers, so they are  		obliged to pay for care less often. When they do pay, however,  		<a href="#table8">Table 8</a> shows that they pay about the same amount as  		mothers in the middle age group. The youngest group of mothers, on the other  		hand, pays for care about as often as mothers 26 to 34, but when they pay, the  		amount is, on average, $6.32 less than that paid by mothers in the middle age  		range. Their peers or relatives would seem more likely to be willing to provide  		support to these mothers in need, perhaps because they, too, are young and have  		the energy to care for more children, or perhaps because they understand the  		young families' financial constraints and are willing to help then out. </p>
<p>Mothers who work part-time were shown to pay for care less often than  		mothers working full-time. On <a href="#table8">Table 8</a> it is also the case  		that when these mothers pay for care, they pay less money than mothers working  		full-time. They are paying for fewer hours of care, so it makes sense that they  		should be paying a smaller amount of money. </p>
<p>The results of the effects of socioeconomic variables on how much people  		pay for care also supplement the results on who pays for care. The people who  		pay are those more able to pay: mothers not in service occupations and families  		whose earnings are higher. And it is families in higher socioeconomic groups  		who also pay more money for care: those with mothers who have taken courses  		beyond college; those with mothers not in labor occupations; and those with  		higher family earnings. The causality in these relationships is not clear.  		Issues of supply and demand may be operating to set prices for care. Families  		who can afford to pay more money may seek what they consider to be higher  		quality care, thinking that higher cost is a part of higher quality. It may be  		that the cost of care is simply higher in neighborhoods where families earn  		more money. </p>

</tr></table><p>The remaining three variables which significantly predict how much  		families pay for child care do not directly support the hypothesis that people  		who are more likely to use market care -- more likely to pay for care -- are  		also likely to pay a higher price for care:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>White mothers are no more likely to pay for child care than Nonwhite  			 mothers, but when they pay, they pay more money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Families living in the West are less likely to pay for care than  			 families living in the South, but when they do pay, they pay a higher fee than  			 those in the southern or the north central states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Families living in metropolitan areas are no more likely to pay for  			 care than those not in metropolitan areas, but when they pay, they pay a higher  			 price. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The variable of race was not a significant predictor of payment for  		care; Nonwhite and White families pay for care to about the same extent. But in  		the regression of how much people pay for care, there is a racial difference.  		After factoring out the effects of education, occupation, and earnings, the  		analysis shows that NonWhite families, on average, pay $5.21 less per week than  		White families. Perhaps this is a factor relating to the kinds of care chosen  		more often by NonWhite families: grandmother care for school-aged children and  		not nonrelative care for 5-year-olds. Care by relatives does tend to be less  		expensive. However, NonWhite families use more center care for 1- to  		4-year-olds, and this would seem to imply they would pay more money for care.  		Perhaps they are receiving subsidized care; there does not seem an obvious  		explanation of this finding. </p>
<p>Equally difficult to explain is the finding on part of the country. In  		comparison to the South, families in the West were shown to pay for care less  		often. But when they do pay for care, they pay more money than families in the  		southern or the north central states. We saw from the analysis of kinds of care  		that families in the West use more father care than families in the South, a  		finding which supports their less frequent payment for care. But it is not  		clear why families in the West should pay more money for care in situations  		where they must pay or why they pay more money than families in the north  		central states. Perhaps a supply study of child care can isolate regional  		differences in cost, providing an explanation of this finding. </p>
<p>The final result on families in metropolitan areas may have an  		explanation in the findings on differences in kinds of care used. Families in  		metropolitan areas were shown to use more center care than families in other  		areas. While these city dwellers are no more likely than other families to pay  		for care, because they are using center care more often, when they do pay, it  		seems reasonable that they will have to pay a higher price than families using  		other forms of care. </p>
<p>In sum, certain families are more likely to pay for care and to pay more  		money for care than others. Those who pay more money have more preschool-aged  		children, earn higher salaries, live in the west and/or metropolitan areas, and  		the mothers are more likely to work full-time and have same advanced course  		work. Those who pay less money are couples with more children from 11 to 14,  		where mothers work in labor occupations and are under 26 years of age. The  		families who can pay more, do; those who can afford little pay as little as  		possible. </p>
<p><a href="#table9">Table 9</a> summarizes the results of a simple linear  		regression predicting the percentage of income spent on child care for those  		who do pay for care. In general, the results show that, holding earnings  		constant, those families who pay more money for care also pay a higher  		percentage of their income for child care. Those families with higher earnings  		pay a smaller percentage of their incomes on care. Specifically, four findings  		repeat the analysis of how much people paid for care:</p>
<ul><li>Single mothers (with and without another adult in the household) pay  		  a higher percentage of their income for child care than couples;</li>
<li>Families with more children 0 to 6 pay a higher percentage than  		  families with fewer children in this age range;</li>
<li>Mothers who work full-time pay a higher percentage than those working  		  part-time;</li>
<li>White mothers pay a higher percentage than NonWhite Mothers. </li>
</ul><p>So, single mothers, families with more preschool aged children, White  		mothers, and those mothers working full-time pay more money for care. They are  		also paying a higher percentage of their income for this care. </p>

<ul><li>
<p>Families with higher earnings pay a lower percentage of their income  			 for child care than do families with lower earnings; </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Families with higher earnings pay more dollars for care, but these  		dollars represent a smaller percentage of their income than the dollars paid by  		those with lower earnings. Thus, while families in lower socioeconomic groups  		may be able to find care which, on an absolute level, costs less per week, they  		may still be spending a higher percentage of their income on care than families  		who pay a higher weekly figure for care. </p>
<p>These regression equations can be useful in predicting the amount  		different groups of families will need to pay for care. For example, the  		equation predicting the dollar amount paid weekly for care can be used to show  		the different amounts paid by families with different levels of earnings.  		<a href="#table10">Table 10</a> lists annualized earnings from $12 to $70,000,  		estimates of annual child care costs, and the estimated percent of income spent  		on child care. It uses the following assumptions about the family: that the  		family is a couple living in the north central states in a metropolitan area;  		and that the mother is White, 26- to 35-years-old, with a high school diploma,  		employed in a service occupation, and working full-time. If this family pays  		for child care, the equation estimates that they pay from $669 (if they have  		essentially no earnings) to $1,545 (if their annualized earnings are $70,000).  		That is, families with higher earnings do pay more dollars for care, but the  		dramatic increase in payments occurs between families earning essentially  		nothing and those earning an annualized income of $5,000. The difference  		between the child care payments of those earning $5,000 and those earning  		$70,000 is less than $300. </p>

A family  		earning a token $12 a year is paying about 41 percent of its entire income on  		child care. A family earning $5,000 per year is spending a hearty 27 percent on  		child care, but families with higher earnings spend considerably smaller budget  		shares on such care. Families earning $10,000 per year are estimated to spend  		10 percent of their income on child care; families earning $30,000 are spending  		5 percent; families earning $70,000 are spending only 1 percent. </p>
<p>Additional tables of policy relevance may be constructed. For instance,  		it is possible to select the set of families most likely to require public  		assistance and predict the amount they will pay for care, not counting  		subsidies. <a href="#table11">Table 11</a> shows one such analysis. It displays  		the average cost for care for Nonwhite mothers who are under the age of 26  		years, who have not completed high school, who are city dwellers training for  		service occupations and currently earning the token amount of $1 a month (we  		assume they are subsidized for the remainder of their income). To determine the  		amount paid by White mothers, add $5 to the amount shown on the table. </p>

</tr></table><p>To be useful to program planners, assumptions must be made about the  		relative frequency of occurrence of families in the new program. Suppose, for  		example, that planners from one of the western states are working on an  		initiative for young mothers first applying for AFDC, and they wish to estimate  		the amount these mothers would pay for child care, if they entered the work  		force or an education/training program on a part-time basis. If the mother is  		NonWhite, she is estimated to pay from $0 per week (if she is married) to $8  		(if she is single and living with another adult) for child care. White mothers  		pay from $5 per week (if married) to $13 (if single and living with another  		adult. </p>
<p>There is one significant caveat to the use of this information on cost  		of care: we only know how much parents say they pay for care, we do not know  		the total cost of care. Child care for low income families may be subsidized by  		state or federal monies; child care for families in certain businesses may be  		subsidized by the company; care by relatives may be at a lower charge,  		essentially being subsidized by the relative. The numbers on the table are  		either the total cost of child care <b>or</b> the additional amount paid by  		families above and beyond a subsidy. </p>
<p>A third use of the data on cost relates the cost of child care to tax  		laws. At the time of this SIPP panel and currently, there are limits to the  		amount of money parents can deduct as a child care tax credit. For one child,  		the maximum deduction is $2400; for two or more children, it is $4800.  		<a href="#table12">Table 12</a> shows the distribution of families in SIPP by  		number of children and annualized amount spent on child care. The data suggest  		that 24 percent of families with one child spend more than the maximum of $2400  		($48 per week), but only 5 percent of families with two children and 7 percent  		of families with more than two children exceed the maximum of $4800 ($96 per  		week). So, the tax credit for child care has been very useful in allowing tax  		relief for the major part of a family's child care expenditure. </p>

<p>The theory that the availability of child care providers and the  		affordability of different care arrangements together predict the kinds of care  		families use has been substantially supported by this analysis of the SUP data.  		Families with a father or a grandmother in the home are more likely to use  		in-home care by these relatives. Families without an adult in addition to the  		mother are less likely to use such care. Father care is more frequent when the  		mother works part-time; nonrelative care is more frequent when the mother works  		full-time. Care by relatives is more common among families in lower  		socioeconomic groups; care by nonrelatives is more frequent among those  		families with higher earnings. In addition, we have seen that the theory helps  		predict the families who pay for care. Those who do not have relatives  		available as caregivers and those who can better afford to pay for care are  		generally the families who do pay for care. </p>
<p>Though this theory has been useful to explain the majority of results,  		there were two sets of variables which did not seem to fit. First, there were  		regional differences in usage of different kinds of- care. Center care was  		found to be more prevalent in the South; father care was' more prevalent in all  		other areas; and in-home care by a nonrelative was more frequent in the north  		central states. This seems partly an issue of availability since the supply of  		center care is greater in the South. However, we do not have data which  		demonstrate regional differences in the supply of family day care homes to show  		that the different patterns in the usage of this form of care is due to a  		difference in supply. And we do not know what other issues contribute to  		regional differences. Perhaps they are due to differences in the cost of these  		formal care arrangements or in parental attitudes toward formal types of care.  		A supply/attitude study which also asked about the costs of the various kinds  		of care could add valuable insight into the reasons for these SIPP results.  		</p>
<p>The second set of results not fully explained by the theory is the set  		dealing with race. Holding all socioeconomic variables constant, Black and  		Asian mothers more frequently use care by grandmothers, siblings and in centers  		than White mothers. It may be the case that Black and Asian families live  		closer to grandmothers, so that their supply of relative care is greater than  		that of White families. Or, it may be that an interaction among other variables  		contributes to the differences in the use of care arrangements. For instance,  		it may be that more Black families live in metropolitan areas in the south than  		White families and that this combination of descriptors explains their  		increased use of center care. It also may be that ethnic preferences (or other  		unmeasured variables) contribute to the different usage patterns. </p>
<p>One important caveat on the results of this study is that the SIPP asks  		about patterns of <b>use</b> of child care providers, not about a family's  		<b>choice</b> of care providers. We do not know from the data if people are  		actively choosing a particular form of care or if they are "forced" into it by  		lack of availability of other forms of care or lack of finances to afford  		market care. The relevance of this difference is evident, for example, in the  		use of relative care. Many fathers and grandmothers are caring for infants and  		toddlers, but how many more families would choose these people as caregivers if  		they were available? </p>
<p>This use of care by close relatives may be a positive choice by families  		or it may be the result of a lack of ability to choose a form of paid care. If  		the mother is not available, she may well actively choose as her substitute  		someone who will raise her children in the same way she would. The most welcome  		candidates are probably those relatives close to her who know and share her  		values. The fact that father care crosses income lines suggests that it is  		often `chosen as a positive alternative, rather than because finances do not  		allow another choice. The fact that grandmothers are chosen more often by  		families in lower income groups may be because they are more likely to live in  		close proximity to their children than are grandmothers of higher income  		families. The fact that other relatives are used more often by the lowest  		income groups may be because more of these people are available for child care  		than relatives of higher income groups, both because they are more likely to  		live nearby and they are less likely to be fully employed outside of the home.  		Thus, there is a good argument emerging from the data that relatives are a  		first choice for caregivers by families in all income groups (at least for the  		youngest groups of children). </p>
<p>There is a second element of preference which may be built into the  		data. For 3- to 5-year-old children, there is more center care than for other  		ages. It may well be that this is parental preference. The question then  		becomes: how many more preschoolers would be in center care if parents could  		afford such care (or were subsidized)? </p>
<p>For Federal program planners this difference between usage patterns and  		patterns of parental choice must be taken seriously before SIPP data are used  		to predict child care patterns among families who will participate in any new  		Federal project. Per example, planners of work/welfare programs may be pleased  		to see that relatives (generally unpaid) care for about half of the young  		children of working mothers and that only about 30 percent of families pay for  		care. They might be tempted to assume that most families who will enter their  		program will not require child care, that they will handle arrangements on  		their own and not need a subsidy for care. This assumption ignores the  		important fact that we do not know the extent to which the different forms of  		care will be <b>chosen</b>, should families be allowed a choice. We assume that  		a choice in care arrangement and the availability of a subsidy will change the  		percentage using different kinds of care and, consequently, the percentage who  		'will pay for care. What we do not know is exactly how these patterns of usage  		will change. (In a second paper, "Child Care Used by Working Warren in the AFDC  		Population: An Analysis of the SIPP Data Base",<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> Brush deals with this issue in more detail.)  		</p>
<p>The SIPP has provided results which seem intuitively reasonable, as well  		as supporting the proposed theory. It has been argued that the availability and  		affordability of care are the major determinants of the use of different  		arrangements of child care and of payment for care. The next step might be to  		connect these data with more information on the quality of these sorts of care,  		on parental preferences for type of care for their children of different ages,  		and on the costs of the different types of care. </p>
