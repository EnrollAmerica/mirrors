<h2>II. ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The National Long Term Care Demonstration was established in 1980 by  		DHHS to evaluate "channeling," a case management approach to organizing  		community-based long term care for the disabled elderly as an alternative to  		institutionalization.</p>
<p>Channeling is designed to improve both the targeting of services and  		resources to those in greatest need and the match of client needs and services  		(both formal and informal). These, in turn, are expected to lead to better  		client outcomes and less costly, more efficient utilization of services. Two  		models of the approach--basic case management and financial control--are being  		tested, each in five sites. These ten demonstration projects began serving  		clients in early 1982, and will end operations in late 1984 or early 1985.</p>
<p>Seven core channeling functions are common to all ten channeling  		projects: outreach, screening, comprehensive assessment, care planning, service  		arranging, monitoring, and reassessment. To these, the five basic case  		management model projects add a limited amount of additional "gap-filling"  		dollars for direct purchase of services. The five financial control model sites  		enhance the core channeling intervention by expanded service coverage; pooling  		of Medicare, Medicaid, and other public funding sources; case manager  		authorization of amount, scope, and duration of service for individuals; a cap  		on average service expenditures for the caseload as a whole; cost limits on  		individual care plans; and cost sharing by higher income clients.</p>
<p>All ten channeling projects had implemented the core channeling  		functions by the first set of evaluation site visits, 3-5 months into project  		operations. Variations in organizational structure had already emerged,  		particularly with respect to subcontracting or decentralizing functions.  		Referral networks had been established with the existing provider agencies most  		likely to be in contact with the disabled elderly in each community, often  		through formal written agreements, and the standardized screening procedures  		had been implemented. Despite unexpectedly low referrals from nursing  		home-related programs and physicians, the channeling projects had been able to  		recruit persons meeting the eligibility criteria, largely from hospitals, home  		health agencies, and referrals from individuals and families. The population  		screened as eligible was considerably older and more functionally impaired than  		the national elderly population.</p>
<p>The assessment and care planning process had been implemented according  		to design. Provider agreements for delivery of service to channeling clients  		had also been developed; these were more formal in financial control model  		sites, where competitive bidding was used to award service contracts, than in  		the basic case management sites. The service arranging and initiating aspects  		of the care planning process took considerably longer, and were reportedly more  		difficult, in the basic case management than in the financial control sites,  		due to problems of accessibility, availability, and control of service  		authorization. At the time of the site visits, little experience had been  		gained with the ongoing case management functions, particularly monitoring and  		reassessment. But there did already appear to be a tendency to rely heavily on  		different types of formal providers and informal caregivers to monitor one  		another, as opposed to more direct case manager-initiated monitoring.</p>
<p>The funds pool and care plan cost control had been implemented in the  		financial control sites through standardized procedures. Though cost control  		was optional in the basic case management sites, evidence of concern for cost  		control was found among those case managers as well. Client cost-sharing  		procedures had limited application at the time of the initial round of site  		visits, and arrangements for use of gap-filling dollars in the basic case  		management sites were still being developed.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>III. OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>The National Long Term Care Demonstration was established in 1980 by  		DHHS to test the effectiveness of "channeling," a means of organizing  		community-based long term care for the disabled elderly as an alternative to  		the current institutionally oriented system. Channeling offers a central point  		of intake for individuals in need, systematic assessment of their needs, and  		ongoing case management to arrange and monitor the provision of services.  		Through contracts with the participating states, local agencies in ten  		communities around the country were selected to implement the demonstration.  		The ten channeling projects began serving clients in early 1982, and will  		conclude operation in late 1984 and early 1985.</p>
<p>The demonstration is being rigorously evaluated, through a randomized  		treatment/control design, which permits direct comparison of the experiences of  		persons assigned to channeling with the experiences of otherwise similar  		persons receiving services through the standard existing delivery system. To  		evaluate channeling's impact on individuals, a sample of about 4,900  		individuals is being followed for 12-18 months after assignment. To evaluate  		channeling's effectiveness and feasibility as a means of organizing the  		delivery of long term care, the implementation of channeling, its relation to  		the existing delivery system, and the characteristics of its clientele are also  		being documented.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">A. The Overview</h3>
<p>This overview describes the structure and intent of the demonstration,  		the characteristics of the channeling projects, the client and system level  		activities of the projects, and factors that have influenced implementation and  		early operations. It, and the full report on which it is based,<font size="-2"><a href="implees.htm#note1">1</a></font> thus represents both a status report on  		the projects in their first year of operation, and a first step toward the full  		evaluation of channeling's impact and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>The information presented is preliminary. As such, it is subject to  		several important limitations. The data sources covered varying periods, none  		much more than halfway through the project's startup phase. Most of the  		qualitative data were obtained in on-site interviews with key participants  		during the third to fifth month of each project's operations; the quantitative  		data covered variously the first 7-11 months of projects operations. Features  		of some of the channeling projects have changed since them; in addition,  		several important data sources to be used in the final analysis were not yet  		available. Finally, because individual projects began operations at different  		points over a five-month period, more data were available on some than on  		others. This means that comparisons among projects and models should be  		regarded as particularly tentative, and that data on groups of sites and the  		demonstration as a whole should also be interpreted with caution.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">B. The Channeling Approach</h3>
<p>In the past decade long term care has emerged as a central concern to  		health and social service providers and policy makers. Underlying this is the  		increasing proportion of the population that is elderly (65 and older), and  		even faster growth of the population 75 and older.</p>
<p>There now seems to be a general consensus that the major problems of the  		current long term care system have to do with unmet or inappropriately met  		service needs, combined with rapidly escalating public costs. A number of  		alternative solutions have been proposed--including modifications to benefits  		under existing programs, financing options, and organizational options. Several  		of these have been, or are now being, tested in national demonstrations; other  		have taken the form of legislative proposals or been enacted into law.</p>
<p>Channeling was designed principally as an organizational strategy and,  		in one of two variants being tested, a financing strategy, to achieve the  		following objectives: improved targeting of service resources to those in  		greatest need; improved matching of client needs and services (both formal and  		informal); improved client outcomes; and less costly, more efficient  		utilization of services. The two variants of channeling as a managed system of  		long term care being tested are: a basic case management model and a financial  		control model. Each combines a set of common "core channeling functions" with  		additional features intended to enhance channeling's ability to intervene  		effectively in the existing long term care system.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">1. Core Channeling Functions</h4>
<p>Channeling is intended to affect client outcomes and the cost of care  		principally by managing individual client utilization of service, particularly  		through reductions in the use of institutions. To achieve this objective, the  		designers of channeling prescribed seven essential functions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Outreach: to identify and attract the target population</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Screening: to determine whether an applicant is part of that target  			 population</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comprehensive needs assessment: to determine individual problems,  			 resources, and service needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Care planning: to specify the types and amounts of care to be  			 provided to meet the identified needs of individuals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service arrangement: to implement the care plan through both formal  			 and informal providers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring: to assure that services are provided as planned and  			 modified as necessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reassessment: to adjust care plans to changing needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Both channeling models incorporate these seven functions. The additional  		features differ between the two channeling models.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">2. The Basic Case Management Model</h4>
<p>The basic case management model tests the premise that the major  		problems in the current long term care system are insufficient information,  		access, and coordination, which can essentially be solved by client-centered  		case management. This model depends upon the array of services already  		available, but introduces an organization responsible for helping clients gain  		access to and coordinate the services they need to remain in the community. The  		channeling organization assigns to each client a case manager, who is  		accountable for planning and arranging the entire package of services needed by  		the client, and helps negotiate the complex array of existing programs and  		service providers.</p>
<p>An additional feature of the basic case management model is a limited  		amount of special service dollars for direct purchase of community-based  		services, in order to overcome gaps in existing services or funding programs  		that constitute barriers in the way of appropriate service delivery. Because  		these gap-filling funds are limited, the case manager still must rely primarily  		on family and friends, services provided by voluntary agencies, and existing  		government programs, in developing a plan of care.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">3. The Financial Control Model</h4>
<p>The financial control model adds six features directed at changing  		certain aspects of the current long term care system that the basic case  		management model accepts as given.</p>
<p><i>Expanded Service Coverage</i>. Funding is extended to some  		community-based services which may not be reimbursed by government programs or  		which are unavailable to particular clients in some communities:</p>
<table border="BORDER" align="CENTER"><tr><td>Day health and rehabilitative care</td>
<td>Home health aide services</td>
</tr><tr><td>Housekeeping services</td>
<td>Chore services</td>
</tr><tr><td>Home delivered meals</td>
<td>Skilled nursing</td>
</tr><tr><td>Speech therapy</td>
<td>Mental health services</td>
</tr><tr><td>Housing assistance</td>
<td>Nonroutine consumable medical supplies  </td>
</tr><tr><td>Day maintenance care</td>
<td>Companion service</td>
</tr><tr><td>Homemaker/personal care services  </td>
<td>Physical therapy</td>
</tr><tr><td>Respite care</td>
<td>Transportation service</td>
</tr><tr><td>Occupational therapy</td>
<td>Adaptive and assistive equipment</td>
</tr><tr><td>Adult foster care</td>
<td> </td>
</tr></table><p><i>Pooling of Government Funds (Funds Pool)</i>. The services on the  		expanded service coverage list typically have to be paid for by a number of  		separate funding streams. To overcome this, channeling creates a pool of  		service dollars (drawing on Medicaid, Medicare, and other government programs).  		From the perspective of the client and case manager, therefore, coverage of the  		expanded services for any individual channeling client does not depend on  		eligibility for particular categorical programs.</p>
<p><i>Authorization Power</i>. For the services paid for from the funds  		pool, case managers have the power to authorize the amount, duration, and scope  		for individual clients. This gives case managers direct access to--as well as  		accountability for--funding of services, and ability to alter services in  		response to changing client needs or service delivery problems.</p>
<p><i>Cap on Average Expenditures</i>. A maximum (cap) on average service  		expenditures per active client for the channeling project's caseload as a whole  		is set at 60 percent of the average of the state's rates for intermediate care  		facilities (ICF) and skilled nursing facilities (SNF) in each demonstration  		area.</p>
<p><i>Limits on Costs of Individual Care Plans</i>. Under the cap on  		average expenditures, the cost of individual care plans can vary; but those who  		exceed the 60 percent cap must be offset by persons whose care is below that  		percent. Direct limits on annual expenditures for each individual, set at 85  		percent of the average of the state's nursing home rates, can be exceeded only  		with state approval of specific cases.</p>
<p><i>Cost Sharing by Clients</i>. To focus government financing for the  		expanded list of community-based services on those clients most in need,  		individuals with incomes in excess of a protected amount--set at a multiple of  		the state's Supplemental Security Income eligibility level plus the food stamp  		bonus amount--are required to share in the cost of their services. They pay all  		their income above the protected amount (except for services locally available  		at no charge to the client) up to the cost of services received.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">C. Structure of the Demonstration</h3>
<p>Implementing a project of the scope and complexity of the National Long  		Term Care Demonstration requires substantial resources, constant interaction  		among many actors at the national, state, and local levels, and considerable  		time. To provide a sense of home these implementation activities have taken  		place over time, <a href="implees.htm#TABLE1">Table 1</a> lists key events in the two and  		one half years from the time the demonstration was formally announced to the  		date all provides had become operational.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">1. National Structure of the Demonstration</h4>
<p>The National Long Term Care Demonstration is jointly administered within  		DHHS by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation  		(ASPE), the Health Care Financing Adminstration (HCFA), and the Administration  		on Aging (AoA). The national technical assistance contractor, Temple University  		Institute on Aging, is responsible for development of clinical and  		administrative guidelines, for training channeling project staff in the core  		channeling functions, and for seeing that these are carried out consistent with  		the national demonstration design and standards of clinical practice.  		Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (MPR), the national evaluation contractor, is  		responsible for the research design and analysis of the channeling  		demonstration; and for all data collection instruments and procedures for the  		evaluation, whether administered by the channeling projects or by MPR  		staff.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">2. The Channeling Demonstration State Lead Agencies</h4>
<p>The ten states designated by DHHS to implement channeling projects as  		part of the national research and demonstration effort are: Florida,  		Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania to implement the financial  		control model of channeling; Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey and Texas to  		implement the basic case management model. The governor in each applicant state  		designated a lead agency for the channeling projects, to be responsible both  		for coordinating state long term care planning activities, and for contributing  		to and overseeing implementation of the local channeling projects.</p>
<p>The lead agencies selected for three of the ten states were  		comprehensive human service agencies--combining public assistance, Medicaid,  		health, social services, and aging mandates and functions within one  		administrative entity. Three other state lead agencies were similar to these  		umbrella agencies in combining the long term care resources of Medicaid and  		public social services. The remaining four were freestanding departments on  		aging, responsible for Older Americans Act programs but not for administering  		the Medicaid or social services block grant programs.</p>
<p>During the planning phase, the state lead agencies were actively engaged  		in a joint effort with the local host channeling agencies and local channeling  		staff to establish the projects. After site operations began, the focus of the  		lead agency's role began shifting to a monitoring function. Respondents in  		several of the states considered the state long term care planning effort to be  		as important to the state as the implementation of the channeling project, and  		in at least four states, statewide long term care program initiatives were  		reportedly patterned on, or developed concurrently with, the channeling project  		design.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">3. The Channeling Sites and Host Agencies</h4>
<p>In contrast to some of the previous long term care demonstrations in  		which new organizations were created, existing organizations were designated as  		hosts for the channeling projects. This was intended to facilitate the  		implementation of channeling by building on the experience and legitimacy of  		agencies that already had important roles in managing or providing services to  		elders with long term care needs. The ten sites and host agencies designated to  		implement channeling are:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Miami, Florida, Miami Jewish Home and Hospital for the  			 Aged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eight rural counties in Eastern Kentucky, Department of Social  			 Services, State Department of Human Resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>York and Cumberland Counties in Maine, Southern Maine Senior  			 Citizens, Inc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Baltimore, Maryland, City of Baltimore, Council on Aging and  			 Retirement Education/Area Agency on Aging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater Lynn, Massachusetts, Greater Lynn Senior Services,  			 Inc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middlesex County, New Jersey, County Department of Human  			 Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rensselaer County, New York, County Department on Aging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Western Reserve Area Agency on  			 Aging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Philadelphia Corporation on  			 Aging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Houston, Texas, Texas Research Institute for Mental  			 Sciences.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Four are private, nonprofit corporations, six are public agencies. Three  		of the public agencies and three of the private host agencies were designated  		Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) under the Older Americans Act. The host agencies  		in two sites are service providers that do not administer public programs, but  		rather receive funding through the various public reimbursement and direct  		funding sources. The host agencies in three sites have responsibility for  		eligibility determination, case management, and service authorization under  		social services block grant/public social service programs, and one is also  		responsible for determining eligibility for public assistance and Medicaid.</p>
<p>During the planning phase, the local channeling projects and their host  		agencies maintained very close operational relationships. After local project  		staff were hired, host agencies continued to play active roles in interacting  		with the state lead agencies, working out the details of site operational  		plans, and assisting the project to develop relationships with referral sources  		and providers. Host agencies typically treated the channeling projects as  		component programs of the agency, with channeling project directors being  		allowed considerable administrative discretion but not considered independent  		of regular policy and administrative oversight.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">D. Organizating the Channeling Projects</h3>
<p>The approaches selected by the sponsoring state and local agencies to  		organize the core channeling functions varied. Major variants involved  		decisions to subcontract functions to one or more other agencies, to  		decentralize (out-station) functions to other locations, and to assign separate  		staff to assessment versus care planning and service arranging. The structures  		adopted for the channeling projects reflected the interaction of several  		factors: demonstration guidelines, state policy and program interests, the  		nature of the local provider and referral systems, management requirements,  		programmatic concerns, geography of the catchment area, and host agency  		practices and preferences.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">1. Developing Relationships with Referral Sources and  		Providers of Care</h4>
<p>Rather than direct outreach, channeling projects emphasized development  		of a network of referral sources from among the provider agencies and community  		organizations most likely to be in contact with the target population. All  		projects worked to identify potential referral sources, orient them to  		channeling, and negotiate written agreements with at least some of the priority  		referral sources, such as hospitals. Although there was considerable variation  		in the formality and intensity of this process, most projects based their  		agreements with referral sources on the model developed by the national  		technical assistance contractor. Channeling projects devoted considerable  		effort to public information, particularly meetings between channeling staff  		and a multitude of other agencies, organizations, and community groups.</p>
<p>The mechanisms used to select service providers ranged from formal  		competitive bidding systems to informal "letters of agreement." The financial  		control model projects typically employed some form of open bidding process to  		select providers. One basic case management site also employed competitive  		bidding to select providers to receive gap-filling funds, but less formal  		methods were used to select the majority of providers in the basic case  		management sites. Efforts to identify and engage information supports--such as  		family, friends, and neighbors--were generally carried out at the case manager  		level at all sites, with some support and direction at the project level.  		Efforts to engage volunteer organizations, in contrast, were typically the  		result of decisions and activities at the project level.</p>
<p>In addition, channeling projects often included both referral sources  		and providers on channeling agency advisory councils, in some cases building on  		existing interagency groups or a previous project which had brought providers  		together in a common effort.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">2. Implementation of Gap-Filling Funds in Basic Case  		Management Model Sites</h4>
<p>Each of the basic case management model sites received $250,000 to be  		used over the duration of the project to fill gaps in the existing service  		system and stimulate development of low cost alternatives to existing services.  		In general, gap-filling funds were earmarked to compensate for lack of access  		to services normally available in the service area--because of wailing lists,  		pending eligibility, emergencies, or other special limitations. In almost all  		sites (including financial control sites), respite care, demand-responsive  		transportation, home delivered meals, and reliable homemaker/personal care were  		judged to be limited. In many cases long waiting lists or long waiting time for  		publicly supported services were reported to be limiting access to these  		services, particularly homemaker and home delivered meals. Clients commonly  		seen as priorities for services to be paid through gap-filling funds were those  		in a life- or safety-threatening situation or at immediate risk of  		institutionalization; those needing, but not eligible for,  		Medicaid-reimbursable services; and those needing services not  		Medicaid-reimbursable. Projects had had quite limited experience with  		gap-filling funds at the time our data were collected; expenditures typically  		included respite services for informal caregivers, medical or specialized  		equipment, and chore/home repair services.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">3. Implementation of the Funds Pool and the Average Per  		Client Cap in Financial Control Sites</h4>
<p>The funds pool and the average per-client expenditure cap were the two  		major program components that had to be implemented for financial control  		channeling projects. As described earlier, the principal intents of the funds  		pool were to enable case managers to choose services independent of funding  		source and eligibility, to unite categorical funding streams, and to reinforce  		interagency collaboration. The cap on average client expenditures combined with  		the estimated number of active client days for each site for the budget period  		defined the total projected budget for services. Sixty percent of the total  		projected funds pool budget for core services is underwritten by HCFA through  		Medicare (Section 222) waivers. The remaining 40 percent of the funds comes  		from sources administered by state and local government, primarily state  		Medicaid programs.</p>
<p>The procedure used at the time of our interviews was as follows: drawing  		on the funds pool, each of the financial control projects followed standardized  		procedures for provider reimbursement. Contracted providers invoiced at least  		monthly and their bills were checked against service orders issued by the case  		managers. A report generated by a semi-automated financial control system (FCS)  		was used for this verification. Once verified and approved, provider invoices  		were forwarded to the fiscal unit (generally in the host agency), were actual  		payments to the providers were issued. The primary function of the FCS was to  		ensure that obligations of funds for client services did not exceed the cap on  		average per client expenditures. Because service funds were obligated through  		the actions of a number of individual case managers making clinical decisions  		about the most appropriate ways to meet client needs--rather than through a  		single controller or fiscal manager--the FCS required data on care plans, cost  		calculations, and service expenditures for individual clients. This was in  		order to produce a set of reports used to manage the agency budget not only at  		the project level but at the case manager and client level as well.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">E. Casefinding and Screening</h3>
<p>Development and implementation of strict entrance criteria to identify  		elderly individuals at high risk (those who "but for channeling" would be in an  		institution) received considerable effort.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">1. Targeting</h4>
<p>Several factors associated with risk of institutionalization were  		combined with specific program criteria (such as geographic boundaries of the  		catchment area and age), to form the standard eligibility criteria for the  		demonstration (see <a href="implees.htm#TABLE2">Table 2</a>). A screening process was used  		to minimize the cost associated with using a comprehensive in-person assessment  		as the basis for determining appropriateness for channeling. A standard  		screening instrument encompassing the eligibility criteria was designed, and  		each channeling project established a unit to screen prospective  		participants.</p>
<p>Applicants came to the attention of the screening unit primarily in two  		ways: elderly individuals (or family, friends, or other persons acting on their  		behalf) contacted the screening unit directly; or formal provider organizations  		made a referral. Each project followed the standard screening procedure which  		involved administering the screening instrument by telephone.<font size="-2"><a href="implees.htm#note2">2</a></font> Screeners conducted the interview with potential  		clients where possible, but could also accept reports from formal referral  		sources, families, friends, or other proxies.</p>
<p>Immediately following the screen, which averaged 15-20 minutes, the  		screener made a determination of the person's eligibility for channeling. For  		any applicants meeting the eligibility criteria, the screener then called the  		evaluation contractor daily for random assignment to the channeling treatment  		group or to the control group. Based on the random assignment decision  		(communicated within 24 hours), screeners called applicants (and in most cases  		their referral sources) to tell them whether they had been accepted as clients.  		Those determined ineligible or assigned to the control group were referred back  		to the original referral source or, in the case of self and family referrals,  		to the local information and referral (I&amp;R) agency. Eligible clients were  		assigned to the project's assessment staff and members of the control group to  		MPR for baseline interviews. Figure 1 outlines the client flow process from  		referral to assignment to receipt of case management services.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">2. Results of the Targeting Effort</h4>
<p>Channeling projects recorded receiving eligible referrals from over 20  		types of referral sources. These ranged from medical equipment rental  		suppliers, out of town relative and clergy, to more traditional health and  		human services providers such as hospitals and local social service agencies.  		Although there was considerable variation among the individual channeling  		projects, patterns by category of referral source emerge when the sites are  		considered together. For a sample of 3,035 individuals determined eligible for  		the project from inception of the demonstration through December 1982 (ranging  		from slightly over ten months for projects that started intake in late February  		1982, to under seven months for those beginning operations in June 1982), the  		highest ranked sources of eligible referrals were, respectively,  		family/friends/self (27.9 percent), hospitals (21.4 percent), and home health  		agencies (15.2 percent). The lowest ranked were information and referral  		agencies (3.9 percent), nursing home-related sources (2.9 percent) and  		channeling outreach (0.8 percent).</p>
<p>Actual ages of eligibles ranged from 64<font size="-2"><a href="implees.htm#note3">3</a></font>-103 years, with a mean age of 79.6 years. Compared  		with the national aged (65 and over) population, this channeling sample was a  		much older group: 8.8 percent of the national aged population is 85 and over,  		compared to 27.6 percent of the channeling sample.</p>
<p>Impairment in activities of daily living (ADL)--bathing, dressing,  		toileting, transfer, continence, and eating--was used as the primary  		determinant of functional disability. Measured in this way, 72.6 percent of the  		channeling sample was severely or very severely impaired (two or more severe  		ADL impairments); an additional 21.1 percent of the sample was classified as  		moderately impaired (at least two moderate or one severe); and 6.3 percent was  		classified in the mild range (zero or one moderate). For a portion of the  		moderate ADL impairment group, and all the mildly impaired group, there was an  		additional qualification requirement based on severe impairments in  		instrumental activities of daily living (IADL)--meal preparation, housekeeping,  		shopping, travel, taking medicine, managing finances, and using the telephone.  		Of this group, 98.4 percent reported severe impairments in two or more IADL  		categories (the 7 IADLs were collapsed into 4 categories for eligibility  		purposes), including cognitive or behavioral impairment category for  		eligibility purposes, and was reported for 51.3 percent of the full  		sample).</p>
<p>This channeling sample was significantly more impaired than the national  		aged population in performing bathing, dressing, and toileting functions. Only  		32 percent of the channeling sample was reported independent in dressing, 44  		percent in toileting, and 10.5 percent in bathing--compared to 97, 98.4, and  		95.7 percent, respectively, of the national aged population.</p>
<p>In addition to the impairment criteria, channeling eligibility also  		required documentation of unmet needs for services expected to last at least  		six months. Eligibles reported an average of three unmet service needs expected  		to last for at least six months. Of the full sample, 32.4 percent reported more  		than four unmet needs, and an additional 60.4 percent reported unmet needs in  		two or three areas. The remaining 7.2 percent qualified for channeling because  		their support system was judged too fragile to meet their needs on a continuing  		basis. In all, 86 percent of eligibles were reported to have fragile informal  		support systems.</p>
<p>With respect to insurance coverage, 98.4 percent of the channeling  		sample reported coverage either under Medicare, or Medicare plus other coverage  		such as private insurance or Medicaid. In all, 24.4 percent of the channeling  		sample were covered by Medicaid, compared with 13.8 percent of the nation's  		aged population (which includes those currently institutionalized).</p>
<p>Of the channeling sample, 33.9 percent lived alone in the community,  		compared to 27.5 percent of the aged population nationally; 70.8 percent were  		female, above the 59.6 percent figure for the national aged, but not unexpected  		given longevity patterns and the high number of those over 85 in the channeling  		sample. Screen data showed that 21.3 percent of channeling eligibles were black  		and 3.9 percent Hispanic; nationally, 8.1 percent of the aged are black and 2.7  		percent are Hispanic.</p>
<p>With respect to income, 60.4 percent of the channeling sample reported  		incomes of less than $500 per month; an additional 33.2 percent reported  		monthly incomes between $500 and $999.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">F. Initiating and Managing Services for Channeling  		Clients</h3>
<p>For the targeting population described above, the principal functions of  		channeling were to plan, initiate, and manage an array of needed services.  		These core channeling activities included assessment, care planning, arranging  		services, and ongoing case management.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">1. Baseline Assessment</h4>
<p>Channeling emphasized a comprehensive individual assessment process  		encompassing social, health, and other areas of need, conducted in person and  		documented through a standardized written instrument. The assessment instrument  		developed for the demonstration was administered to channeling clients by  		clinically trained case managers, relying primarily on client self-report.  		Staff at each project received standardized training on the assessment  		instrument and process from the national technical assistance contractor.</p>
<p>Each case that was screened, determined eligible, and assigned to the  		channeling treatment group, was assigned an assessor or case manager to  		schedule and conduct the baseline assessment; demonstration guidelines called  		for completing the assessment within seven working days after assignment.</p>
<p>At the outset of the interview, assessors explained the nature of the  		demonstration, and clients (and, when necessary, family members or guardians)  		were asked to sign an informed consent document, agreeing to participate in the  		demonstration and to release information for research and clinical purposes.  		Assessors then completed the baseline assessment instrument, which averaged one  		hour and 15 minutes. Assessments were usually completed in one visit, generally  		in the home of the client or proxy but sometimes in hospital and nursing homes.  		After assessment, staff checked the eligibility criteria--the same as in  		initial screening--to confirm program eligibility, and initiated the care  		planning process.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">2. Care Planning</h4>
<p>Following review of the assessment information, most case managers  		contacted informal caregivers, physicians, or formal provider agencies  		currently (or recently) involved with clients, to inform them of the case  		manager's role and to discuss particular needs of clients. Case managers then  		began writing the care plan. The standard care plan format (with minor  		site-specific variations) included client problems, expected outcomes, types of  		help or service needed, specific provider, and pattern of delivery. The initial  		care plan was usually designed for a three-month period, after which the client  		would be reassessed and the care plan modified accordingly.</p>
<p>The next stage of care planning--the selection of service  		providers--differed between the basic case management and the financial control  		projects. Basic case management projects (only one of which had begun to use  		gap-filling expansion funds in this early period) frequently reported problems  		with the availability of selected services and in some cases had to consult  		several providers before finding services, particularly homemakers or personal  		care, necessary to complete the care plan. In the financial control projects,  		service-specific contracts with major providers made service availability,  		client access, and provider selection much less of an issue, particularly when  		services were in short supply.</p>
<p>Working with informal providers was considered especially time-consuming  		and difficult, but channeling staff did report incorporating them in many care  		plans: family members were typically used for companionship, meal preparation,  		and personal care functions; nonfamily for things like visiting, shopping, and  		transportation.</p>
<p>After the case manager identified which services were needed and the  		sources of care (informal and formal), the cost of the care plan was estimated.  		Using a standard cost calculation worksheet, the financial control projects  		compared these estimated costs to the cost limits described earlier. In the  		basic case management projects the cost calculation component was not as  		extensive, and use of the standard worksheet was optional. However, case  		managers and supervisors in all sites reported a strong emphasis on cost  		control, although they felt that completion of the cost calculation worksheets  		was burdensome. Basic case management projects, whose care plans were not  		formally constrained by cost controls, felt that keeping care plan costs below  		nursing home rates was not difficult (primarily because of limited service  		access and availability). Although financial control model projects operated  		under formal cost limits, only one reported that the cap was really  		constraining care planning decisions.</p>
<p>Calculation of client cost-sharing contributions was also performed at  		this stage. As noted, basic case management projects had not yet implemented  		cost-sharing procedures for gap-filling funds at the time of our visits.  		Financial control project staff attributed limited application of the  		cost-sharing requirements to two factors: the services for which no cost  		sharing was required tended to include a large number of the services most  		frequently ordered by channeling; and the majority of their clients had  		relatively low incomes. In general, case managers felt that the cost-sharing  		requirements were not affecting participation.</p>
<p>Following provider selection, supervisory review, and approval, case  		managers arranged for a written sign-off on care plans from clients and/or  		their families explaining to the client and the family what channeling was  		going to do, and what was expected of the family. Project staff described this  		step as an important departure from conventional practice.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">3. Initiating Services</h4>
<p>In general, after care plan sign-off, case managers began the service  		ordering process. In the basic case management sites there was typically at  		least informal negotiation with potential providers during the early phases of  		care planning, to avoid promising services that could not subsequently be  		delivered. In the financial control sites, this preliminary contact was much  		less common, since providers were under direct contract to the channeling  		agency.</p>
<p>In the basic case management sites the service ordering process involved  		negotiation and "brokering" among the client, the case manager, and the  		provider. Case managers could recommend the amount, type, and duration of the  		services ordered. But the decision on these--as well as whether to provide  		services at all--was at the discretion of the provider, and subject to  		prevailing program eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>In the financial control sites the service ordering process was quite  		different, particularly for the non-health-related services. Their contracts  		for services made access and availability much less of an issue than for basic  		case management models, and enabled them to specify providers, units, and  		schedules. One exception to this--despite the formal contracts--was home health  		providers, whose extensive experience and medical orientation often made  		agreement between the two a necessary condition for the ordering of skilled  		care.</p>
<p>After ordering services for the client--usually confirmed via a written  		service order--case managers confirmed that service was actually initiated.  		This was done most often through telephone calls with providers, clients, or  		families.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">4. Ongoing Case Management</h4>
<p>Once the initial care plan was implemented, each case manager was  		responsible for ongoing monitoring of the client, in order to maintain a high  		quality of service on a continual basis and to adapt services to changes in  		clients' social and physical condition. Formal reassessments are required at  		specified intervals, and most case managers reported engaging in frequent  		contact. In general, they reported that this was more time consuming than  		expected, because of the frailty of clients and the unreliability of some  		service providers. The majority of these contacts appeared to be initiated by  		clients or informal caregivers to discuss problems of service delivery or needs  		that were not being met, and case managers relied on these as their primary  		means of monitoring providers. Case managers also depended to varying degrees  		on providers' reports. They reported relying on staff who had day-to-day  		contact with their clients--such as those delivering meals or providing  		personal care--to monitor changes in client needs, and in turn, on skilled  		providers--such as nurses--to monitor service provision by the nonskilled  		providers. The boundary between monitoring clients and monitoring providers  		was, therefore, somewhat blurred in practice.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">G. Caseload Development and Elapsed Time</h3>
<p>Project staff consistently suggested that case management functions  		would be implemented differently after the caseload buildup period was  		completed. Two major factors were identified as influencing channeling's  		ability to recruit and serve the at-risk target population: the rate of  		caseload buildup, and the time required to complete the major steps in the  		channeling process. These issues are closely linked. Referral sources and  		providers frequently commented on the time required for assessment, care  		planning, and service initiation, and cited this as one factor influencing  		referrals. Similarly, the priority given to building and maintaining the  		caseload was frequently cited by channeling staff as causing uneven or  		burdensome workloads, backlogs at screen or assessment, lengthy elapsed time,  		and insufficient time to devote to working with informal caregivers and to  		ongoing monitoring of clients.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">1. Caseload Development</h4>
<p>By February 28, 1983, 2,835 clients had been assigned to the ten  		channeling sites. Most of the basic case management projects began operations  		approximately 2-3 months prior to the financial control projects, but because  		caseload buildup proceeded faster in the financial control projects, slightly  		more cases were enrolled in the financial control model (1,457 compared to  		1,378 for the basic case management model).</p>
<p>As persons were assigned to channeling for assessment, care planning,  		and service initiation, some clients dropped out because they decided not to  		participate, were determined not to meet the eligibility criteria, or  		experienced changes in their conditions or circumstances. Other persons dropped  		out or were inactivated following initiation of services for a variety of  		reasons. These events affected the activities of channeling staff as well as  		the size of their active caseloads. Of the cohort of 1,077 individuals who had  		entered channeling by August 31, 1982, 60.4 percent were active four months  		later (31 clients in this latter group had been inactivate or terminated and  		then reactivated). In addition, 5.8 percent (62 individuals) were inactive at  		the end of four months. The major reason for individuals being inactivated--a  		temporary status from which persons had to be reactivated or terminated within  		three months--involved placement in institutional settings.</p>
<p>The majority of clients not receiving project services after four months  		had been terminated from the program 33.8 percent of those assigned to receive  		services). The major reasons included refusal to participate (10.8 percent),  		death (9.9 percent), institutionalization (4.9 percent), and insufficient  		disability (3.8 percent). Reasons for termination did vary by model, with basic  		case management projects having a significantly higher proportion of refusals  		(13.2 percent) than the financial control projects (7.1 percent). For the  		sample members terminating before completing an assessment (21 percent of the  		full cohort), client refusal to participate in the demonstration was the major  		reason. For those terminating during the care planning process (4.7 percent of  		total sample cohort) refusal to participate, death, and institutionalization  		were the predominant reasons for termination. For those terminating after care  		plan sign-off and service initiation (8.1 percent of full cohort), death and  		institutionalization became the major reasons for termination, with the  		proportion of refusals dropping.</p>
<p>As of the end of February 1983, active caseloads for the ten projects  		ranged from 74-301, with an average of 162. The active caseload of each  		channeling project at any given time was the result of several factors: the  		volume of referrals, the number of applicants determined eligible at the  		screening, the number assigned to the channeling treatment group, and  		subsequent inactivations and terminations. The way in which these factors came  		into play determined the workload of channeling staff performing the functions  		at each stage of the channeling process. This in turn affected the time  		required to complete each of these steps which, in its own turn, then  		influenced the rate of buildup a project could accommodate.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">2. Elapsed Time Between Functions</h4>
<p>Clients averaged 30.2 (median 24) days from the point of assignment to  		initiation of first service. The periods from referral to screening, and  		screening to assignment, had mean times of 1.1 and 1.7 days, respectively,  		accounting for a small proportion of the total elapsed time. Completing the  		assessment (mean time of 7.3 days) and care planning (mean time of 19.8 days)  		processes were the functions requiring the longer time. The mean number of days  		from care plan sign-off to service initiation was 4.2 days.</p>
<p>The elapsed time between functions varied significantly between models.  		The major difference in these elapsed times occurred during the care planning  		phase, with basic case management projects averaging 23.4 days from assessment  		to care plan sign-off, compared to 15.5 days for financial control projects.  		This finding is consistent with reports by case managers in the basic case  		management projects (noted earlier) about the difficulties they encountered in  		identifying and finding services for their clients.</p>
<p>Because most programs providing care for the elderly do not calculate  		this type of elapsed time information, the channeling experience cannot be  		systematically compared to that of existing programs in the long term care  		system. In assessing the elapsed time, it may also be relevant to distinguish  		the provision of post-acute services from a broader, long-term approach to  		community care. Channeling's comprehensive screening, assessment, and care  		planning process was intended to develop a basis for serving the chronically  		impaired elderly over an extended period of time; and each of these steps  		required considerable case manager, client, and family involvement. The  		emphasis on rapid caseload development during the early months of program  		operations may also have been a contributing factor.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">H. Factors Influencing the Implementation and Early  		Operations of Channeling</h3>
<p>The channeling sites were a self-selected sample of communities across  		the country interested in long term care. That they were able to implement  		channeling may indicate that the conditions conducive to implementation were  		already at work in those particular communities; it is less clear whether such  		conditions can be created deliberately in other environments.</p>
<p>Respondents identified a wide range of factors that facilitated or  		constrained the planning and start-up of channeling operations. The two  		facilitating factors most frequently cited were support at the state level, and  		support from the local provider community. The next most frequently cited  		factors, in order, were the presence of a strong lead individual and capable  		staff in the channeling agency itself, the existence of a previous long term  		care project in the community, the responsiveness of channeling to community  		need, and good local planning. The major constraints identified fell into three  		broad categories: design of the demonstration itself (including research  		requirements) and the kind of responsibilities it imposes upon a service  		delivery system; the behavior of extracommunity actors (namely, the federal  		government and the national contractors) and the kinds of limits that they  		place upon local options and freedom of action; and the effect of turf issues  		and provider concern on the ability of the channeling demonstration to operate  		in the local community.</p>
<p>In a national demonstration that brings additional resources and  		attention to a state or a community, and for which major actors applied to  		participate, there is an inherent incentive to implement the program. To do  		this successfully, however, without alienating necessary participants, involves  		compromises. In the course of channeling's implementation and early operations,  		three areas important to the eventual success of channeling appear to have been  		affected by implementation compromises: identifying and recruiting an impaired  		elderly population at risk of institutionalization; planning care and arranging  		services; and managing the provision of care.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">1. Target Population</h4>
<p>A fundamental concern was channeling's ability to identify and recruit  		the planned target population. Referral sources generally understood the  		channeling eligibility criteria, but within those parameters sometimes differed  		on whom they would refer, and when. A few sources referred only persons with no  		informal supports; some others assumed that persons with no informal caregivers  		were not likely to remain in the community in any case and did not refer them  		to channeling. Some did not refer clients until they had run out of benefits or  		need for that agency's service; others made referrals in anticipation that they  		could continue serving the client under channeling's auspices. In a few  		instances, clients needing very heavy care were reportedly not referred because  		channeling was seen as lacking capacity for skilled service, because the cost  		of their care might exceed the channeling expenditures cap, or because the  		clients might be required to share in the cost of services. In many cases  		clients were reportedly referred by providers because services they needed were  		not available except through channeling funds--either the gap-filling funds of  		the basic case management projects or the funds pool of the financial control  		projects.</p>
<p>The case mix may also have reflected the way the screening process was  		implemented. A few respondents felt that the eligibility criteria and the  		nature of the screening instrument (including its reliance on self-reported  		information) tended to exclude some persons who had mental impairments, who  		lived alone without assistance in daily activities, or who overemphasized their  		independence in order to qualify for community care and leave institutions.  		Some felt that the strict disability criteria and the requirements for expected  		unmet needs for a six-month period excluded persons who could benefit from  		channeling.</p>
<p>Reservations about a control group, and about the time required for  		channeling to initiate services, were also cited as factors influencing  		referrals to channeling, particularly for persons whom referral sources  		believed needed prompt services (especially those being discharged from  		hospitals). For these reasons, referrals were often made to both channeling and  		a provider agency simultaneously.</p>
<p>Referral patterns may also have reflected the choices channeling  		projects made in targeting formal referral sources and conducting outreach.  		Emphasis on recruiting applicants from the health care sector resulted in a  		steady and important flow of referrals from hospital and home health agencies,  		and home health agencies emerged as intermediaries in this process. Often  		persons were discharged from hospitals to home health agencies providing  		post-acute skilled care services under Medicare, and were subsequently referred  		to channeling as benefits were exhausted and/or skilled care needs diminished.  		Referrals from physicians and nursing home-related sources, despite  		considerable effort by channeling in the latter case, were uniformly low;  		reasons for this will be examined as the projects continue operations.</p>
<p>Thus, the early data suggest that the channeling projects were  		successful in developing referral sources and implementing screening procedures  		that enabled them to locate and recruit a disabled elderly population. The  		extent to which this was in fact a population likely to be institutionalized in  		the absence of channeling will be determined through comparison of the  		experiences of the treatment and control groups as the demonstration  		continues.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">2. Care Planning and Service Selection</h4>
<p>Development and implementation of care plans for channeling clients  		appear to have been influenced by a number of factors. The ability of a case  		manager to design a specific care plan depends upon the information and the  		services available. Assessors reported that the standardized comprehensive  		in-person assessment provided them with useful information on which to base  		care plans, despite some concern about its length, structure, or the  		reliability of self-reported information.</p>
<p>The time and effort required to complete the assessment and care  		planning processes were attributed in large part to the standardized forms and  		procedures required by demonstration guidelines, and to the rapid pace of  		intake required during the caseload buildup period; availability and  		accessibility of formal and informal providers of care were also mentioned as  		factors. Some basic case management projects lacked access to services that  		case managers thought appropriate and, because gap-filling funds were not yet  		available, had to develop alternatives in order to establish a care plan. In  		financial control projects, the case manager's flexibility was sometimes  		limited by agency contracts with a small set of providers, resulting either  		from limited supply or from the fact that a particular project was compelled to  		contract with the low bidder. Referral sources making a dual referral to both a  		direct service provider and channeling, and the desire of both clients and  		agencies not to disrupt existing service arrangements for individuals in some  		cases, also appear to have imposed constraints on case managers' design of the  		care plan and selection of providers.</p>
<p>Care planning also appears to have been influenced by the presence or  		absence of informal caregivers. Availability of informal caregivers is a  		function of demographics, culture, and the orientation of case managers toward  		this source of care. Many case managers reported families were "burned out"  		when they turned to channeling, making it a time-consuming process to  		incorporate them into the care plan, particularly to increase or alter their  		role. Pressure on case managers to build up the caseload during this early  		period also reportedly detracted from involving informal caregivers.</p>
<p>It is clear that in the basic case management sites, and in some  		instances the financial control sites, negotiating services was a significant  		element of the channeling process. As a result, the care plan reflected the  		compromise of implementation at the particular site rather than the ideal set  		of appropriate services to meet particular needs. Home health agencies emerged  		as influential sources of many services channeling clients need, in both basic  		and financial control sites; and considerable effort was devoted to negotiating  		with them over the amount and type of clients services, defining the respective  		roles of case managers and home health agency staff in managing and monitoring  		care.</p>
<p>Care planning was shaped further by cost considerations. In the basic  		case management sites, where cost was not a formal limiting factor, case  		managers indicated that they were aware of rates for services and often took  		this into account in formulating care plans. In the financial control sites,  		where the estimation of the cost of service package was required, case managers  		and supervisors reported considerable attention to staying within the formal  		cap. Staff in some sites reported encouraging clients and families to pay for  		services; others indicated that they preferred to use inexpensive providers or  		a less expensive or intensive form of a desired service to keep within the cap.  		There was some limited evidence that, as a result of requirements for cost  		sharing, the service plan might be varied so as to use services for which cost  		sharing was not required. Concerns about the cost and quality of service  		available also influenced care planning decisions, particularly in choices  		between nonprofit and proprietary homemaker agencies. The care plan, therefore,  		to some degree reflected a series of compromises with both the existing service  		system and the design features of each channeling model.</p>
<h4 align="CENTER">3. Ongoing Case Management</h4>
<p>Lack of time to carry out active monitoring of clients was identified as  		a major concern during early operations. Pressures for caseload buildup, and  		the associated initial assessment and care planning activities were seen as  		imposing strict limitations on the amount of time that could be devoted to  		ongoing case management. As a result, care managers reported relying heavily in  		most instances on monitoring clients through contacts initiated by providers in  		day-to-day contact with clients (homemakers, personal care aides), and by  		clients, families, and informal caregivers. Similarly, monitoring of providers  		was accomplished through both clients and families, supplemented in many cases  		by skilled care providers monitoring other caregivers.</p>
<hr /><p>Viewing all this within and across sites and models provides perspective  		on the circumstances that shaped the early implementation of channeling. Some  		of these influences were grounded in the environments of the channeling  		projects: the demographics and geography of the area, the public programs and  		services that existed there, the nature of provider and referral source  		networks, the position and auspices of the state lead agency and local host  		agency. Others were specific to the national design and structure of the  		demonstration. Still others stemmed from the design, structure, and staffing of  		the individual projects. Clearly the different influences interacted to a  		considerable degree.</p>
<p>It is this interaction of channeling, its environment, and its role in a  		national research demonstration effort that will ultimately determine impacts  		on costs and clients. For the final report, the impact of these factors on the  		projects in their mature state will be described and examined in conjunction  		with channeling's outcomes, to provide a more definitive statement of the  		factors affecting successful implementation and operation of a community  		service program like channeling.</p>
