<hr /><h2>A. PHASE I</h2>
<h3 align="CENTER">1. Background</h3>
<p>Current demographic trends indicate that the number of individuals age  		65 and over is expected to grow from 26 million in 1980 to 32 million by the  		year 2000. This group is the one most likely to require long-term care (LTC)  		services including care in nursing homes, residential care facilities,  		retirement communities, and care in their own homes.</p>
<p>An analysis of LTC financing indicates that both public and private  		financing has increased over the last 15-20 year. Public financing, including  		funds from Medicare, Medicaid, the Veteran's Administration and other State  		programs, increased from 34 to 57 percent of all LTC expenditures from 1965 to  		1979. In short, as demand for these services has grown, the government has  		assumed a larger role in their financing. Federal, State and local governments,  		however, are becoming increasingly concerned that they will be unable to meet  		the growing demand for publicly financed LTC services. New methods for the  		private financing of LTC need to be explored and developed. This study  		addresses these alternative methods of LTC financing such as pooled financing  		arrangements.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">2. Pooled Private LTC Financing Prototypes</h3>
<p>Pooled financing alternatives are designed to spread the costs of LTC  		services across a broader group of individuals, while eliminating risk for all  		individuals in the group. Examples of pooled financing arrangements are LTC  		insurance, prepaid health plans offering LTC services, and life care and  		continuing care centers.</p>
<p><b><i>LTC Insurance</i></b>. Few individuals currently have private  		insurance for extended LTC services. Most elderly individuals have Medicare  		coverage and supplemental coverage, which may provide up to 100 days in a  		nursing home, but which do not cover extended stays.</p>
<p>In recent years, several companies have developed individual insurance  		policies that provide extended LTC services. Approximately 100,000 individuals  		are currently covered by this type of insurance, which is offered by more than  		ten companies. Of the four policies examined in detail, all provide indemnity  		type benefits for from two to four years of care in a licensed nursing home.  		Coverage continues under these plans beyond the time when skilled nursing is  		necessary. Per diem benefits range from $20-50 per day for nursing home care  		(equivalent to $600-1,500 per month or $7,300-18,250 annually) for nursing  		care, with most individuals purchasing $40 or $50 per diem policies. Premiums  		are usually based on an individual's age at the time of purchase and vary  		depending on the coverage desired. For a per diem benefit of $40-50, premiums  		are in the $400-800 per annum range for those in the early 70s, who are the  		most frequent purchasers of the insurance.</p>
<p>Group insurance coverage plans could also be designed to include LTC  		coverage. We identified only one plan, the Blue Cross plan for the United Auto  		Workers (UAW), which offered this coverage. The policy includes both skilled  		nursing and home health care benefits, and it is estimated to cover about  		800,000 UAW workers and their dependents. The average monthly cost of this  		benefit has been estimated to be about 50 cents per month. In part, the cost  		remains low due to low utilization of the benefit.</p>
<p><i><b>Prepaid LTC Programs</b></i>. A second form of pooled financing is  		prepaid LTC programs. These programs provide a pooled financing vehicle which  		could be used to provide LTC services.</p>
<p>Most current Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) packages include a  		standard LTC benefit package, providing these services only when necessary in  		recuperation. However, several innovative prepaid LTC programs have emerged in  		recent years.</p>
<p>The Health Care Financing Administration is currently sponsoring several  		Social/HMO (S/HMO) demonstration programs which offer comprehensive LTC  		benefits. Under these programs, Medicare pays the S/HMO a per capita amount on  		behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. This premium is supplemental by an additional  		amount from HMO enrollees. In exchange, Medicare beneficiaries receive  		comprehensive LTC benefits, as well as non-health related services such as  		Meals on Wheels and homemaker services.</p>
<p>Blue Cross of Southern California is also offering a prepaid LTC package  		through the Ultracare plan. This plan, which supplements the Medicare program  		benefits, provides home health benefits such as nursing care, housekeeping,  		meal and transportation services, and those services offered in life care and  		continuing care centers.</p>
<p><i><b>Life Care Centers</b></i>. A life care center typically provides a  		full range of residential, health, and social services for the remaining  		lifetime of an elderly individual in exchange for some combination of an  		initial entrance fee and a monthly charge. Centers that provide primarily  		residential services, but do arrange for residents to have access to health  		care services, are considered continuing care centers. Life care and continuing  		care centers differ from a traditional retirement home in how they finance the  		costs of their services. Their financing ranges from comprehensive financing  		for residential and health services to financing for residential services only.  		In 1979, there were approximately 600 life care or continuing care centers,  		with over 200,000 residents. Due to the unique financing arrangements of these  		organizations, they represent an important method of financing LTC.</p>
<p>Life care centers typically require a large initial fee, as well as  		substantial monthly payments. Initial fees range from $50,000-100,000 for a one  		bedroom apartment with monthly payments ranging from $750-1,500. Despite the  		fact that life care centers are relatively expensive, many homes have a waiting  		list.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">3. Alternative Financing Approaches</h3>
<p>In the course of our review, a number of additional approaches for  		private LTC financing were identified. Although not yet tested in the market  		place, these alternatives represent the current thinking of those who have  		followed the trends in LTC financing and are actively involved in new prototype  		design. In addition, some of these alternatives represent the use of a  		combination of pooled LTC financing vehicles and personal resources. The  		approaches considered include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Single premium annuity</i>. Under this mechanism, an elderly  			 individual could be offered a single premium immediate annuity for purchase at  			 the time of entry into a nursing home, retirement home, life care center or  			 other retirement/health care setting. This annuity would be structured to  			 ensure a monthly cash payment continuing from the time of entry until death.  			 This would provide incentives for the individual to leave the facility if  			 possible, while preserving the value of his monthly benefits. The benefit could  			 also be designed to increase in value with the length of the stay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Life indemnity prototype</i>. In a project sponsored by the  			 National Center for Health Services Research (NCHSR), a prototype LTC indemnity  			 policy has been developed, and premiums have been estimated under various sets  			 of assumptions. Premiums for this plan were estimated to range from $28-116 per  			 month depending on the indemnity payment (from $35-70 per day) and the age at  			 the time of insurance purchase (65-80 years). In addition to estimating  			 premiums, this NCHSR study includes a survey of consumer acceptance of such  			 policies. When completed, it will provide valuable information on the attitudes  			 and preferences of the elderly with regard to LTC services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Combination life/LTC insurance</i>. Due to the difficulty of  			 attracting purchasers of LTC insurance at younger ages, some believe that  			 combining LTC coverage with conventional life insurance coverage may offer  			 broader appeal without the substantial risk that LTC insurance alone possesses.  			 Most people purchase life insurance to protect primarily against unexpected and  			 premature death. For those living to older ages, life insurance has less value  			 than protection against the costs of unexpected LTC services that exceed normal  			 living expenses. The significance of both types of risk suggests that a  			 combination life and LTC benefit sold on a group or individual basis could  			 provide good value to a broad range of individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>LTC/individual retirement account (IRA)</i>. To increase the  			 private financing of LTC, some have suggested that individuals be able to  			 contribute to IRAs which are earmarked for LTC. Contributions to these LTC/IRAs  			 could either be tax deductible or used as a tax credit. By making the  			 contributions tax deductible or a tax credit, and by deferring taxes on the  			 interest earned on the contributions, the after-tax cost of saving for LTC  			 expenses would be reduced. This would increase the availability of funds for  			 the private financing of LTC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Pension benefit options</i>. Individuals who receive employer  			 pension benefits from defined benefit and defined contribution plans generally  			 receive either annuities or lump sum payments. One possible option to increase  			 the private financing of LTC would be to allow individuals to elect a variation  			 of a life annuity. This option may be particularly attractive for many of the  			 elderly for a number of reasons. First, this option does not reduce the present  			 value of one's pension benefits, but simply modifies the timing of the benefit  			 payments. Any funds not used for LTC could be used for other purposes or they  			 could become part of one's estate. This feature may be particularly desirable  			 for the elderly who do not think they will require LTC services. Second, this  			 method of financing may match the LTC expenditure requirements of the elderly  			 who spend limited periods in nursing homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Reinsurance options</i>. Reinsurance programs may help promote  			 the growth of private financing vehicles. Little is currently known about LTC  			 utilization patterns. There is, therefore, a high degree of risk in making LTC  			 insurance widely available. This degree of risk means that premiums are  			 difficult to set, and perhaps that they are higher than necessary. Reinsurance  			 programs, which protect insurance companies for risks above a certain amount,  			 may be useful in eliminating some of this risk, thereby reducing premiums. Such  			 programs could encourage the broader sale of LTC protection.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In summary, there is a broad range of alternatives to encourage greater  		private financing of LTC services that deserve closer attention in the  		future.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">4. Financial Resources of the Elderly</h3>
<p>Elderly individuals and families have a variety of resources available  		for use in meeting potential LTC needs. Personal income from social security,  		private and public pension plans, life insurance benefits, and personal assets  		all represent potentially significant sources of financing for LTC services.  		Although LTC financing problems are greatest for those with little personal  		income and few assets, there may be opportunities to pool these risks or fund  		these benefits more efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>ICF's analysis indicates that 26 percent of all individuals 65-69 had a  		total potential annual income (including annuitized value of wealth) above  		$25,000 in 1980. This percentage declines to 16 percent of individuals age 80  		and over. For single elderly persons, corresponding figures are 7 percent for  		those 65-69 and 10 percent for those 80+.</p>
<p>There appears to be a promising market for LTC financing alternatives.  		We estimate that, among the approximately 12 million individuals age 70-79,  		approximately 2.5 million (20 percent) would have been able to purchase LTC  		insurance for less than five percent of their income in 1980. The market is  		much larger if we assume that a portion of the nine million individuals age  		65-69 would also purchase LTC insurance. In the case of life care centers, we  		estimate the current potential market at roughly two million of the 12 million  		individuals age 70-79.</p>
<p>In the future, the income of the elderly is likely to increase for three  		reasons: (1) the future growth in real wages; (2) increases in women's labor  		force participation; and (3) the growth in the percentage of elderly families  		receiving pension and IRA benefits.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">5. Barriers to Growth</h3>
<p>Despite the apparent need and potential for growth in LTC financing  		products, there is limited availability of these products. We identified  		several barriers to growth in these products including:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>State policies</i>. Many States regulate the development of new  			 insurance products as well as the development of life care and continuing care  			 facilities. While these regulations exist, they do not appear to be a  			 substantial barrier to the development of LTC products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Medicaid programs</i>. Because Medicaid programs provide  			 substantial LTC benefits, the existence of these programs may dampen the demand  			 for private LTC financing products. It is likely that any policy attempting to  			 encourage private financing for LTC will have to include changes in Medicaid  			 eligibility rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Market factors</i>. The development of pooled financing  			 mechanisms may be slow due to certain market forces. These included limited  			 knowledge of LTC utilization patterns and the costs of providing LTC insurance,  			 the need to market these plans individually, and limited knowledge about the  			 potential market for these products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Consumer information</i>. Consumer surveys indicate that many  			 elderly consumers overestimate the benefits of Medicare and private Medicare  			 supplemental insurance policies. Consequently, many elderly consumers do not  			 perceive the need for LTC financing products.</p>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h2>B. PHASE II</h2>
<h3 align="CENTER">1. Background</h3>
<p>At the same time that the number of potential users of LTC is increasing  		more rapidly than at any time in our history, the government has assumed a  		growing role in financing these services. For example, as discussed in the  		Phase I report, only 45 percent of LTC was financed by private expenditures in  		1982. With the projected size of the budget deficits in the 1980s, the Federal  		budget cannot support the potential scale of the LTC outlays implied by the two  		trends. New alternatives and existing alternatives for the private financing of  		LTC will have to be developed and expanded.</p>
<p>This report examines potential barriers to the private financing of LTC,  		in particular the barriers to the use of personal resources in financing LTC  		services. In addition, the report examines the potential effect of reducing  		these barriers. These barriers include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Annuity rigidity</i>. The elderly receive almost one-half of  			 their cash income in the form of fixed monthly payments, such as social  			 security payments and pension benefits. This may be a barrier to private LTC  			 financing as these funds are not available as a lump sum at the time when large  			 expenditures become necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Illiquid assets</i>. Many elderly individuals have substantial  			 assets, usually in the form of a home, which are illiquid. However, home equity  			 is not usually considered to be an available asset because elderly individuals  			 must have housing for their remaining lives, and because they may have a spouse  			 who requires housing. Therefore, these assets are not usually available to the  			 elderly when expenditures for LTC become necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Laws and regulations providing incentives to divest</i>. It is  			 often thought that estate tax laws and Medicaid eligibility factors create  			 incentives for the elderly to divest their assets. In the case of Medicaid  			 eligibility, it is widely understood that transferring available assets to  			 other family members reduces the need for an individual to use those assets to  			 finance their own LTC. Any incentives to divest assets mean that funds are not  			 available to finance LTC when the need arises.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All of these factors potentially increase the elderly's reliance upon  		public financing for LTC services.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying the potential impact of the reduction of the  		barriers identified above, ICF also developed a model which estimates the  		effects of increased private LTC financing on government costs. In this report,  		we present estimates of potential Medicaid savings if there were an increase in  		the number of elderly individuals purchasing LTC insurance.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">2. Key Findings</h3>
<p>Analysis of Barriers. This report analyzes the potential barriers cited  		above to the private financing of LTC. Analysis of these barriers indicates  		that:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Reduction of annuity rigidity</i> from pensions does not seem to  			 be a viable means of increasing private sector financing of LTC  			 <i>currently</i> because only about one-third of the elderly receive pension  			 benefits and, on average, the benefits are not large. For example, only about  			 15 percent of elderly families' income currently comes from pension benefits.  			 This means that benefits would have to be reduced substantially to provide a  			 substantial lump sum which would be used for LTC. <i>However, the number of  			 families receiving pension or IRA benefits will increase substantially in the  			 future</i>. In addition, the amount of pension benefits is expected to increase  			 over time. For example, the number of individuals age 65 receiving over $10,000  			 (in 1983 dollars) in annual pension benefits will increase from approximately 4  			 percent in 1985 to over 25 percent by 2005. As a result, methods to reduce  			 annuity rigidity will prove more beneficial in the next two decades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Home equity conversion programs</i> would have an even smaller  			 impact on the ability of the elderly to privately finance LTC services although  			 we found that over one-half of elderly families have over $10,000 in home  			 equity. We looked at two types of home equity conversion programs, reverse  			 annuity mortgages and sale/leaseback plans. Looking at the typical plans  			 available, we found that, for example, if an individual owned a $50,000 home,  			 he or she could expect to receive an annuity upon conversion of between $195  			 and $475 per month, depending upon the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Current Federal tax law</i> provides few incentives to divest  			 income or assets prior to the need for LTC. State tax laws, while they differ  			 from Federal law in some States, do not heavily tax the estates of most  			 individuals if the estate is passed on to a spouse or children at the time of  			 death. State tax laws provide few additional incentives to divest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Medicaid eligibility rules</i> may be barriers to the private  			 financing of LTC. These include State Medicaid policies regarding the transfer  			 of assets and other asset considerations. For example, many individuals divest  			 their assets in order to become eligible for Medicaid LTC benefits. Federal  			 regulations have no restrictions regarding transfer of assets. However, all but  			 five States (Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Georgia and the District of Columbia)  			 have restrictions on the transfer of assets for less than fair market value  			 solely for the purpose of becoming eligible for Medicaid. Some States have  			 transfer of asset regulations which put the burden of proof on the State to  			 show that the transfer of assets was made solely for purposes of becoming  			 eligible for Medicaid. Other States specify that the individual show that they  			 did not transfer assets to become eligible. The difference in where the burden  			 of proof lies has an impact on how these regulations can be enforced. If the  			 burden of proof were on individuals, eligibility would be harder to  			 obtain.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Thus, our analyses indicate that there are significant barriers to the  		elderly in the use of their personal resources to finance LTC services. Pension  		and social security benefits are provided in a way that does not make it easy  		for the elderly to obtain a lump sum payment to use for LTC. As pensions become  		a more important source of income, insurance companies are likely to adopt new  		lump sum annuity options if there is sufficient consumer demand. The elderly  		have much more of their resources locked up in their home equity. Home equity  		conversion programs have not been used widely for a variety of reasons. It may  		be possible for financial institutions to develop plans whereby the elderly can  		use part of their home equity upon demand (like a line of credit). Finally, we  		found that the ability to transfer assets to become eligible for Medicaid is a  		large barrier to the use of personal resources to finance LTC services.</p>
<p><i>Impact on Medicaid Costs</i>. In exploring opportunities to  		substitute private LTC financing for public sources, we recognize that not all  		groups of the population or types of LTC services are potential candidates for  		such alternatives. However, there is a significant group of the elderly  		population that enters a nursing home and pays for the early part of their stay  		using private resources and eventually shifts to Medicaid after spending down  		their liquid assets and income to meet medically needy eligibility standards.  		If only a fraction of this group can be encouraged to defer their shift to  		Medicaid or extend the period of private support for even a brief period, this  		will contribute substantially to the current and future LTC financing picture.  		In this project, we developed a LTC financing model which we used to measure  		the potential impact of increased private financing on government costs.</p>
<p>Using this model, we examined the impact of one form of private  		financing, LTC insurance, on government LTC costs. We developed a model to  		simulate LTC expenses and source of payment for a cohort of individuals aged  		67-69 in 1981. The model uses data on representative individuals in this age  		group to simulate the sources and levels of payment for LTC services. The model  		also simulates the decision to buy insurance and its effects on the source and  		levels of payment for nursing home services. Our analysis indicates that:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Under current financing methods (no LTC insurance)</i>, we expect  			 that Medicaid would pay for 43 percent of the total cumulative nursing home  			 expenditures for the age 67-69 cohort, individuals would pay for 55 percent of  			 total cumulative nursing home expenditures out-of-pocket, and Medicare would  			 pay for 2 percent of expenditures.<font size="-2"><a href="#note1">1</a></font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>If LTC insurance were purchased by about 20 percent of this  			 cohort</i>, total cumulative Medicaid expenditures (in nominal dollars) would  			 decline by approximately 8 percent. The policy we simulated would provide a  			 nursing home benefit of up to $40 per day for up to four years of nursing home  			 coverage for a cost of $480 per year. Both the benefits and premiums were  			 assumed to increase with the CPI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>If LTC insurance were purchased by approximately half of the  			 individuals in this cohort</i>, total cumulative Medicaid expenditures would  			 decline by approximately 23 percent. This would represent a decline in  			 cumulative nursing home expenditures for this small cohort of the elderly of  			 almost $9 billion (in nominal dollars).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This indicates that LTC insurance could have a significant impact on  		Medicaid expenditures. Significant savings would occur even if only 20 percent  		of the elderly purchase the insurance. Larger savings would result if more of  		the elderly purchased the insurance or if the elderly with fewer resources  		purchased it (we assumed the 20 percent of the elderly who had the highest  		income and assets purchased the insurance).</p>
<p>If properly structured and integrated with modifications to Medicaid,  		more of the elderly might purchase this insurance, which would lead to larger  		savings. At the same time, we note that aggregate dollars spent on nursing home  		care might increase slightly as private pay days are substituted for Medicaid  		days. This would also increase the revenues of nursing homes and provide an  		incentive for the expansion of these homes.</p>
