<hr /><h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Although the current difficulties in developing an adequate system of  		long-term care are extensive, they pale in comparison to the challenges ahead  		as the "baby boomers" come of age. To explore these issues this paper reports  		the results of research predicting disability among older people through the  		year 2020, focusing on the policy issues and challenges that will be associated  		with providing long-term care in the twenty-first century. Topics addressed  		include system structure and financing, the service and technology interface,  		the role of family, and ethical issues in the provision and allocation of  		long-term care.</p>
<hr /><p>Determining how best to meet the long-term care needs of an aging  		America has become a lively topic in aging and health policy circles. Ever  		increasing costs, concerns about quality of care, and the rising population in  		need of long-term care have clearly brought this issue to the forefront of  		public policy debate. A bipartisan commission, numerous legislative bills,  		considerable mass media attention and volumes of policy and research articles  		attest to the widespread concern about the long-term care difficulties in the  		U.S. Although the current problems faced in developing an adequate system of  		long-term care are extensive, they pale in comparison to the challenges ahead,  		as the "baby boomers come of age". To explore these challenges, this paper  		briefly reviews the results of research predicting disability among older  		persons up through the year 2040, then focuses on the policy issues and  		challenges that will be associated with providing long-term care in the  		twenty-first century.</p>
<h2>LONG-TERM CARE DISABILITY</h2>
<p>On any given day, the average person performs countless activities of  		daily life. From the morning shower to the midnight snack, our days are  		typically filled with tasks of life. Most of us rarely think about the effort  		required to complete these activities. Yet it is precisely these areas that  		constantly challenge those with long-term care needs. Research studies have  		consistently shown that the majority of long-term care services are provided to  		assist with tasks of daily living (Kemper et al, 1987). The ability to perform  		these functional tasks has been consistently identified as a critical factor  		affecting the need for long-term care (Branch, 1977; Greenberg et al, 1980;  		Applebaum and Harrigan, 1986). Thus, any discussion of future long-term care  		policy issues needs to begin with an understanding of the demographic changes  		that are anticipated to shape the care delivery system.</p>
<p>To project the size of the over 65 population expected to have long-term  		disability, a simulation model was developed (Kunkel and Applebaum, 1989). This  		work attempted to build on the estimation models developed in several previous  		studies (Manton and Liu, 1984; Rivlin et al, 1988; McBride, 1989). Each of  		these studies attempted to develop a baseline disability level for the over 65  		population and then a projection model to estimate the size of future  		populations. This study varies from the previous works by combining two changes  		in approach. First, this study employs a model in which life expectancy and  		rates of disability can be altered over time, rather than using a constant  		model where the rates of disability and mortality are assumed to remain the  		same throughout the projection period. Second, this research treats the  		projection of long-term care needs as an issue related to, but separate from,  		where people live (whether in an institution or at home in community). Since  		the residential mix may change in the future, projections of need for long-term  		care should be separate from the issue of where and what type of care is  		currently provided. These estimates will then provide the basis for a policy  		discussion concerning the structure and delivery of long-term care in future  		decades.</p>
<h2>PROJECTION MODEL</h2>
<p>Estimating future rates of disability and mortality is unquestionably a  		speculative process. Numerous societal changes in a range of areas such as  		public health, medical technology, the environment, social structure, and the  		economy cannot be predicted, yet will clearly affect rates of disability and  		mortality.</p>
<p>Our assumptions for mortality used three of the Bureau of the Census  		assumptions about longevity patterns: a rapid improvement in life expectancy, a  		middle mortality assumption, and a slow improvement in life expectancy  		(Spencer, 1989). However, no such source was available for the estimation of  		future rates of disability. To develop estimates of future disability rates we  		completed a review focusing on the longitudinal studies of disability conducted  		in the United States and Canada (Verbrugge, 1984; Wilkins &amp; Adams, 1983).  		Based on this review we identified three generic scenarios in predicting future  		rates of disability. First, there could be an Increase in the rate of  		disability, anticipated to occur as a negative by-product of increased  		longevity. A second scenario predicts a decrease in the rate of disability,  		anticipated as a result of effective preventive health practices, and  		technological advances in medicine and public health. A third scenario  		anticipates that future disability rates for the over 65 population would  		remain essentially the same.</p>
<p>Combining mortality and disability assumptions creates a number of  		possible of scenarios that can be used to generate projections. This work  		reports on three diverse scenarios: 1) a constant model--with mortality and  		disability trends continuing under current rates; 2) a longer life/lower  		disability model--assuming faster improvement in mortality and lower levels of  		disability; 3) a longer life/higher disability model--assuming faster  		improvements in mortality and higher levels of disability.</p>
<p>Results of the model estimates are presented in <a href="boomers.htm#table1">Table  		1</a>. Numbers for 1986 indicate that about 2.6 million older people had a  		moderate disability and about 2.5 million were severely disabled. In the  		constant model, with no changes in current disability or mortality rates, the  		sheer force of population aging will result in 4.9 million older people  		estimated to have a severe disability by 2020; with another 4.8 million having  		a moderate disability. The longer life/lower disability model generates the  		lowest estimates of disability for 2020, predicting 4.8 million severely  		disabled older people and 4.6 million with moderate levels of disability. This  		represents an increase of about 84 percent, from the current 5.1 million to 9.4  		million.</p>
<p>Estimates of the over 65 population expected to have a long-term  		disability in 2040 range from 14.8 to 22.6 million people. This compares to 5.1  		million older people in that category today, (an increase ranging from 190 to  		343 percent). Although the differences in the estimates generated by the models  		are considerable, what is most interesting is that the numbers generated under  		any of the models represent substantial increases. Regardless of the scenario  		projected, by the year 2040 when the baby boomers reach their 80's and 90's,  		there will be a massive number of older Americans with long-term care  		disabilities.</p>

<p>These projections present a critical challenge for a long-term care  		system that has already been subject to considerable scrutiny, particularly  		concerning financing and quality. When combined with other social and  		demographic trends, such as lower fertility rates and changes in the family  		structure, these estimates suggest that the challenges of providing adequate  		long-term care to an aging America are truly monumental. Given this scenario,  		what then are the policy issues that need to be addressed as the long-term care  		needs of the nation expand?</p>
<p>We have identified a series of critical policy issues that the system  		will face as the size of the population with long-term care needs continues to  		grow. Our discussion of these issues is organized according to the following  		major topics: 1) the long-term care system itself, including its current  		structure, methods of financing, availability of personnel, and regulatory and  		quality assurance efforts within the system; 2) the interface of long-term care  		needs with technology; 3) the role of family in the provision of long-term care  		services; and 4) ethical considerations. Although these issues are not new to  		the long-term care policy arena, they are magnified and reshaped by the  		projected demographic changes. This paper seeks to go beyond highlighting the  		importance of each of these issues by focusing on the need for a creative  		solution to the challenges of long-term care in the twenty-first century.  		Innovation and new ways of thinking about long-term care are absolutely  		necessary. Extrapolating from a cogent summary of problems in the financing of  		long-term care, we clearly see that "the fundamental policy question is whether  		we can come up with a system ... that is better than just multiplying the  		current unsatisfactory system by three or four" (Weiner, 1990).</p>
<h2>LONG-TERM CARE SYSTEM</h2>
<p><b>LTC System Structure and Financing</b>. It has become almost a cliche  		to talk about the system of long-term care as an irrational "non-system" of  		care delivery. Although the current approach to delivering long-term care may  		not be rational, it is costly. With over 40 billion dollars spent on  		institutional long-term care and an estimated 8 billion on community based  		long-term care, long-term care expenditures have clearly become a primary  		component of federal, state and local budgets (Sabatino, 1989). The  		multiplicity of funding streams, administrative and regulatory agencies, and  		service providers means that is difficult for both the consumers and funders  		alike to master the system. Critics of the current structure consistently focus  		on the lack of service coordination.</p>
<p>Although there are a number of delivery system issues that arise when  		thinking about providing long-term care in the future, perhaps the most  		fundamental questions focus on the nature of the service delivery system  		itself. For example, what does adequate long-term care assistance to those in  		need actually look like? Do we provide care primarily in institutional or  		community settings? And how is this balance determined? How should  		accessibility to and receipt of a long-term care benefit be determined? How  		does the delivery of long-term care interface with the provision of acute  		health care? Despite numerous long-term care demonstrations and research  		projects, we know very little about how to deliver and allocate long-term care  		services. Although the answers to these questions are not clear cut, it is  		clear that such issues need to be addressed prior to the tremendous expansion  		of the population expected to experience long-term care needs. As the number of  		older people in need of long-term care doubles and then triples, and possibly  		quadruples, the development of a coherent system of care will be essential.</p>
<p>The limitations of simply multiplying our current system to account for  		the growth of the disabled older population is well illustrated by looking at  		nursing home utilization. In 1986, approximately 1.3 million older persons were  		residents of nursing homes (Schick, 1986). Considering that there were 2.5  		million severely disabled older people in 1986, the nursing home figure roughly  		represents one nursing home bed for every two <b>severely</b> disabled older  		persons. Put another way, there were enough nursing homes beds for  		approximately 52% of the severely disabled older population. Use of such  		figures is somewhat limited, since not all nursing home beds are occupied by  		severely disabled older people; some moderately disabled older persons, and  		some younger people live in nursing homes. Despite the limits of such  		calculations, it is instructive to note that, in order to simply continue  		current nursing-home utilization ratios, we would need about 2.8 million  		nursing home beds by the year 2020, and 4.4 million by 2040. Keep in mind that  		the "'1 for 2" ratio used in these calculations does not include the moderately  		disabled older persons who might need institutionally based long-term  		care.<sup><font><a href="boomers.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Financing institutional-based care for 1.3 million older persons is a  		problem today; it is painfully clear that current financing strategies and the  		current system of long-term care delivery will not be adequate for the  		approximately 8 million severely disabled older persons projected to need care  		in 2040. Without question the financing issue has dominated the recent  		long-term care policy debate. Continually escalating long-term care costs  		coupled with rising deficits have placed long-term care financing issues on the  		national agenda. At the heart of the debate is the ideological issue of who  		should be responsible for those with chronic disabilities? Is ensuring that  		each individual has proper long-term care an individual's responsibility or is  		it the responsibility of government? Clearly the same philosophical debate  		exists for acute health care as well.</p>
<p>The current long-term care system has used a mixed approach, relying  		first on the individual and then, following depletion of resources, the  		Medicaid program. Although debating the pros and cons of any health or  		long-term care funding strategy is common practice among policy analysts, there  		is little disagreement that the current funding mechanism is flawed, criticized  		for being both ineffective, and inequitable. The "all or nothing" system of  		support for institutional care, which requires individuals to spend almost all  		of their resources before governments' responsibility begins, is the source of  		concern. The system thus ensures that many older people live their final years  		as dependents of the state, despite the values and preference for independence,  		or at least shared independence expressed by the majority of the population,  		(GAO, 1977; Weiner, 1990; McConnell, 1990). The nature of this eligibility  		process encourages inequity. Some decide that since they will require Medicaid  		support they should transfer or shield assets, while others use all of their  		resources prior to Medicaid utilization. In fact an army of attorneys and  		financial planners have appeared as more and more of the population understands  		the nature of the current system of funding long-term care. Other typical  		financing horror stories have focused on the restrictive nature of Medicaid,  		which prior to recent legislation required spouses in some states to divorce  		their dependent spouse in order to avoid poverty.</p>
<p>Although there is wide agreement that the current system is not  		acceptable, there is a lack of consensus on solutions. Proponents of an  		increased national role have proposed expanded long-term care coverage,  		financed by the federal government. Critics of this approach believe that such  		a plan is too expensive and would add more expenditures to an already costly  		system. Thus, the suggestion that the development of private insurance coverage  		is the appropriate response. The policy challenge is compounded by the need to  		not only develop a system for today, but for tomorrow's needs as well. Given  		the budgetary struggles of 1990 this may be an insurmountable task for the  		current polity.</p>
<p><b>LTC Personnel</b>. Current providers of long-term care have begun to  		discuss a growing service delivery problem: a shortage in the supply of  		paraprofessional workers. Both nursing homes and home health providers have  		identified difficulties in the recruitment and retention of those individuals  		responsible for providing the personal care to those with long-term care needs.  		Because personal care assistance dominates the long-term care needs of the  		chronically disabled person, staffing challenges have serious implications for  		both quality and cost of care.</p>
<p>As is the case with employees in any area, the supply of workers is  		affected by two major factors: 1) the demography of the labor force, and 2) the  		nature of the economy and the work environments it engenders. Brannon and Smyer  		(1990) describe the changing labor force as older and more diverse. "Over 80%  		of the net labor force growth during the next 10 years is projected to come  		from three sources: women, minority youth, and immigrants" (Brannon and Smyer,  		1990:64). Clearly long-term care employers must face the challenge of  		attracting and retaining employees from among these groups.</p>
<p>One of the factors that will influence the competitiveness of long-term  		care employers is the nature of other employment opportunities. In a service  		economy with increasing competition for skilled workers, long-term care  		employers have an opportunity to provide an appealing work setting for  		non-skilled workers (Brannon and Smyer, 1990). In order to realize such an  		opportunity, long-term care employers must enhance several aspects of work  		life, including wages and benefits, working conditions, the nature of the work,  		status of the job, ability to advance, opportunity for other jobs, and the  		intrinsic value of performing the work task. Many of the factors affecting  		long-term care workers and the workplace are influenced by long-term care  		policy. For example, reimbursement rates have a direct effect on salary and  		benefits. Regulatory requirements affect the tasks, activities, levels of  		supervision, and work load of long-term care employees. Opportunities to  		advance and perform new and varied tasks are also affected by regulatory  		activities.</p>
<p>Critics of the existing system suggest that efforts to enhance the  		quality of work-life is minimally emphasized in the long-term care field. For  		example, wages for nursing home and home health aides are low. A recent study  		commissioned by the Older Women's League, indicated that the median wage for  		home health aides in the U.S. was four dollars per hour (OWL, 1988). Employee  		benefits such as health insurance, vacation or sick time, and training support  		are typically not available for paraprofessional long-term care workers.  		Workers also report a number of on-the-job frustrations; a lack of control over  		rules, staffing shortages, poor training, resistive or hard-to-care-for  		clients, and an unsafe work environment (Canalis, 1987).</p>
<p>Thus, in looking at the provision of long-term care we see that the work  		of the paraprofessionals, while a key component in delivering successful  		long-term care, has not been highly valued. Combining these employment  		conditions with a reduction in the fertility rate and more competition for  		service industry employees has resulted in reported shortages of long-term care  		workers. States with low unemployment rates appear particularly challenged by  		recruitment and retention problems. Given the projected rates of disability and  		projected changes in the labor force, it is clear that issues of personnel  		supply will accompany the policy issue of financing as a dominant future issue.  		A number of public policy issues ranging from long-term care reimbursement and  		regulation to immigration policy will influence personnel needs in the future.  		Once again, exactly how these public policies should be shaped is not clear;  		however, it is clear that the projected size of the disabled population,  		combined with anticipated shortages of workers, will necessitate a coherent  		policy.</p>
<p><b>Quality Assurance and Regulation</b>. Efforts to regulate and ensure  		the quality of care have become a dominant theme in long-term care service  		delivery. Independent quality commissions, revised survey and certification  		procedures, new training and regulatory requirements, and alternative  		reimbursement approaches have all received considerable attention in recent  		years. For those working in long-term care, the term "OBRA regulations" have  		become the most widely spoken words in the field. Despite this keen interest in  		assuring quality, the provision of long-term care, particularly institutional  		care, remains subject to a substantial amount of criticism. Responses to  		concerns about quality have resulted in increased regulatory activity in the  		long-term care arena. Coupling the current regulatory environment with the  		projected increase in those needing long-term care creates some interesting  		questions concerning future quality assurance efforts. </p>
<p>The current approach to assuring the quality of long-term care has been  		characterize by a hierarchical strategy, dominated by a series of structural  		regulations developed and enforced at the federal and state levels. Under this  		approach, a series of rules and regulations have been developed as the primary  		mechanism to ensure that care is of high quality. In both institutional and  		home health care an annual survey, designed to enforce the array of  		regulations, has been the cornerstone of the quality assurance strategy.</p>
<p>Our efforts to regulate nursing homes provide the bulk of experience on  		this approach. Despite the intense regulatory environment, criticism of the  		quality of nursing home care is considerable. Changes in structural areas, such  		as fire safety and personnel training have contributed to some industry-wide  		improvement in conditions. However, these efforts do not seem to address many  		other aspects of long-term care that are important to the quality of the care  		recipient's life. Thus, we are left with a highly regulated system that remains  		the subject of almost daily criticism from consumers, advocates and regulators  		themselves.</p>
<p>As we look to the future it is clear the number of older people  		receiving formal long-term care services, whether in an institutional or  		community setting will continue to increase. Given current difficulties in the  		states' ability to adequately staff such regulatory efforts, questions about  		future capacity are certainly appropriate. For example, a study of the home  		health regulatory system in California reported that in 1988, only 7 percent of  		currently licensed home health agencies received their annual surveys  		(Harrington &amp; Grant 1990). As more providers are added to the system and if  		improvements in staffing are made to address the personnel shortages currently  		experienced, it will be necessary to add a large number of new workers to  		sustain the regulatory system as it now stands. However, experience suggests  		that such a regulatory strategy, while costly, does not appear to assure  		quality of care for long-term care service recipients. Thus, it is clear that  		the expansion of the long-term care delivery system will need to be accompanied  		by an alternative view of how to provide and ensure the quality of care  		provided.</p>
<h2>TECHNOLOGY AND LONG-TERM CARE</h2>
<p>Although the increase in the proportion of the over 65 population  		experiencing a disability is substantial, it is likely that in the future  		technological advances will help provide some of the long-term care assistance  		needed. Robotics, "smart houses", continued refinement of prosthesis,  		specialized medical equipment, and other such developments are appearing on the  		scene in 1990. For example, combining voice-activated personal computers with  		robotics has been a recent development that is allowing disabled people to  		complete many functions of daily life without assistance. One can only imagine  		innovations that could exist by the year 2020 and beyond when George Jetson  		needs long-term care.</p>
<p>The development of new technology has both potential benefits and  		limitations. If technology can be developed to maximize independence and  		enhance individual and family interactions, it could provide a key element of  		the solution to the long-term care challenges. If, however, mechanical support  		and interaction becomes a substitute for human interactions, such innovations  		could serve to further isolate the population experiencing disabilities. The  		increase in the proportion of older people expected to need long-term care  		assistance will create an environment in which we are likely to attempt to  		reduce the number of personnel needed to deliver long-term care. Whether  		long-term care can be restructured such that technology can support the key  		elements of good care, rather than substitute for it, will be the key policy  		challenge in this area. Thus, it is clear that a practice and policy interface  		with those developing new long-term care technology will be essential.</p>
<h2>ETHICAL ISSUES SURROUNDING THE DELIVERY OF LONG-TERM CARE</h2>
<p>Spurred on by major changes in medical technology and increases in life  		expectancy, ethical issues surrounding the provision of care have come to the  		forefront of health and long-term care policy. Ethical debates initially  		focused on whether terminally ill individuals should have the right to refuse  		medications or resuscitation assistance. This issue was then extended to  		question whether life support or life sustaining nutrition could be removed.  		Recently, the ethical dilemma has moved to a new plane; should individuals have  		the right to take their own life or the life of a physically ill or cognitively  		disabled loved one? Cases of mercy killings and the more recent "suicide  		machine" are examples of this next level of end-of-life ethical issues.</p>
<p>In addition to individual or case-by-case ethical issues, a series of  		policy questions addressing the delivery of health resources have been raised.  		For example, the book <i><b>Setting Limits</b></i> (Callahan 1987) received  		considerable attention because of its suggestion that a mechanism for rationing  		the resources allocated to health care should be implemented. The book suggests  		that age should be used as the primary criterion to allocate health resources  		and benefits. Recent policies in the state of Oregon, which attempt to control  		high cost benefits such as organ transplants for the medically indigent under  		the Medicaid program, have shifted the rationing debate to the state policy  		arena. High resource expenditures occurring near the end of life, coupled with  		concerns about inadequate funding for health coverage for all age groups,  		particularly children, have created the impetus for this rationing-of-care  		debate.</p>
<p>The ethical discussion in 2020 may move to a different level. It is  		quite possible that our ethics debate of the future will focus on whether the  		receipt of long-term care is an individual's right. Rather than the current  		debate about whether and when we should limit life-saving or life-sustaining  		acute care, the issue may very well be whether we should limit the receipt of  		long-term care. Based on 1990 philosophy, the "ethical" question of 2020 might  		be: Can we afford to provide long-term care to this large number of older  		people when other age groups of the society are facing serious resource  		constraints?</p>
<h2>DEVELOPMENT OF FAMILY POLICY</h2>
<p>Research has identified the critical role that families play in the  		provision of long-term care. Described in a number of state and national  		surveys and demonstrations (Applebaum 1988) data indicate that families and  		other informal caregivers provide a considerable amount of care to older people  		experiencing chronic disabilities. For example, about three quarters of the 5.1  		million older persons with a chronic disability reside in the community, and  		approximately half of the 2.5 million severely disabled older people reside in  		the community. With a level of disability that is similar to those residing in  		nursing homes, these severely disabled older people are able to remain in the  		community through a combination of family caregiving and formal services.</p>
<p>Family and friends provide a considerable amount of care, but this  		delivery of long-term care also presents major challenges and costs for the  		family. Women, who have provided the majority of long-term care in this  		country, are now more likely then ever to work outside the home. Discussions  		concerning the sandwich generation--women caught between jobs, children, and  		older parents--have become common in both the gerontological literature and the  		mass media (Brody, 1987; Newsweek, 1990). Adult children provide a significant  		amount of caregiving; spouses and adult children combined provide approximately  		80% of the daily care received by older adults. Seventy-five percent of family  		caregivers are women, and these women often find themselves in precarious  		financial and health situations. An estimated one-third of women caregivers are  		categorically poor, and about one-half are in poor health (Shields and Summers,  		1988). The tremendous burden of unrelieved caregiving is clear from such  		statistics, and is painfully illustrated by the testimony of women who are in  		these situations. It is obvious that any long-term care system must find a way  		to support family caregivers in their efforts. Beyond the difficulties of  		fulfilling that role on a day-to-day basis, the health and financial deficits  		that caregivers bring into their own old age are of enormous consequence for  		our long-term care system. Women who have forfeited financial resources and  		health in order to provide care will themselves have great long-term care  		needs.</p>
<p>In the future, families will likely remain heavily involved in long-term  		caring. However, several social and demographic factors will continue to place  		pressure on family care-giving. It appears that the trend of two-worker  		households will continue. This development will increase pressure on both  		families and employers to develop a work style and benefit packages that allow  		for the longer time commitment that long-term care for an older family member  		may represent. Compounding this challenge are reduced fertility rates. In the  		1970's and 80's; for example, the 1984 total fertility rate of 1.8 children per  		woman was half of the 1955 figure of 3.6 children per woman (Weeks, 1989).  		Obviously these fertility changes will result in a smaller pool of potential  		family caregivers. Combining these factors with continued expectations about  		longevity and disability suggests that the sandwich generation may become the  		pancake generation; flattened by the pressures from both sides.</p>
<p>Recent discussion surrounding family policy has become prominent public  		policy debate. Issues such as leaves for family members to deal with caregiving  		at both ends of the age spectrum, employer flexibility in the structure of the  		work place, employer day care for a range of ages, tax credits or incentives  		for caregiving, and expanded community service coverage for respite and home  		care, are all examples of proposed policy recommendations. Questions  		surrounding both specific policies and the proper role of government in the  		development of these policies will continue. Although the options are varied,  		the need to develop a coherent policy to support family involvement in  		long-term care is quite clear.</p>
<h2>THE ROAD TO THE FUTURE</h2>
<p>Policy analysts have discussed repeatedly the incremental nature of  		public policy development in the United States. We are continually reminded  		that the U.S. has lagged behind the rest of the industrial world in its efforts  		to develop public policy on retirement, health care, and other critical policy  		areas. Unfortunately, there is no evidence to suggest that long-term care  		challenges will inspire an alternative policy development process. However, if  		there is one consistent theme of this analysis, it is that the demographic  		challenges are so critical that the need for a coherent and long range policy  		is paramount. The projections, which call for a doubling of the long-term care  		population by 2020 and a tripling or quadrupling by 2040, are quite real. In  		fact, all of the people included in these projections have already been born.  		The question that we now need to ask is whether the incremental system can  		develop a policy strategy with a time line that extends beyond the next  		congressional election. The irony is that future long-term care needs for the  		generation of boomers, who are accustomed to immediate gratification, will rely  		on a longer range planning process than we have ever been able to implement or  		even conceptualize as a nation.</p>
