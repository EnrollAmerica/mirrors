</dl><h2><a name="summary" id="summary">I. SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>The foster care policy area encompasses an important set of issues which  		are likely to be addressed during this session of Congress. Interviews  		conducted with a wide range of persons concerned with the issues surrounding  		foster care and adoption revealed that there are likely to be committee  		hearings and proposed legislative changes. The primary participating groups  		include pertinent Congressional subcommittees, children and youth advocacy  		organizations, and various public interest groups. </p>
<p>The role of the Federal government in foster care is presently the  		subject of a great deal of Congressional and advocacy group criticism. With the  		passage of Public Law 96-272 in 1980, HHS became involved in the administration  		of the foster care system to an unprecedented extent. It seems unlikely that  		the Federal government will become less involved with the administration of  		foster care, but the degree of its influence, and the methods by which it will  		exert influence on State delivery systems, are a subject of debate. </p>
<p>Prior to the passage of PL 96-272 the primary debate surrounding foster  		care focused on the contention that an inordinate number of children were  		unnecessarily languishing in the system, and that often the rights of these  		children and their parents were being overlooked. Although the number of  		children in care at any one point in time has dropped since 1977, lately the  		number has begun to rise once again. More recently the debate has focused on  		the quality of care children receive while they are in the system. </p>
<p>Although nearly all actors involved in this issue believe that the 1980  		legislation represented a step in the right direction, it is widely felt that  		in many areas the full intent of the law has not been met. The coming ten-year  		anniversary of the authorizing legislation seems to mark a point at which those  		with an interest in foster care will precipitate a re-evaluation of PL 96-272  		concerning the following issues: </p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Determination of the appropriate level of Federal expenditures  			 for foster care</b>. Although the average monthly number of children served by  			 title IV-E only increased from 102,991 to 111,879 during the seven fiscal years  			 following passage of PL 96-272, title IV-E administrative and training costs  			 have dramatically increased both in absolute terms, and in relation to the  			 average foster care maintenance payment per child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Effective development of the adoption and foster care data  			 collection system currently awaiting clearance from OMB</b>. The system will  			 require States to report certain information about their foster care system to  			 the Federal government. HHS has been criticized in legislative hearings for not  			 collecting adequate information concerning the number of children in foster  			 care nationwide, and the adequacy of this care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Methods for improving the design, implementation, and  			 administration of the title IV-B section 427 Federal review process of States'  			 foster care systems</b>. From FY 1982 to FY 1987, 152 such reviews have been  			 conducted. During this time period 16% of the reviews resulted in a total of  			 approximately $13.4 million in disallowances imposed on those States that  			 failed the review. The Department and OMB have been unable to agree on the  			 specific review guidelines for this process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Continuation of the Federal funding of the independent Living  			 Program on a yearly basis</b>. This program, which is designed to teach the  			 skills that are necessary for foster care adolescents to function independently  			 as adults, has received yearly congressional appropriations of $45 million  			 since FY 1987, despite objections from the Department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Addressing what is widely perceived as a systemic breakdown of  			 the child welfare system</b>. Virtually all States are plagued by shortages in  			 two critical areas; child welfare workers, and foster parents. These shortages  			 are made even more acute by the significant increase in substantiated child  			 abuse cases reported to Child Protective Services (CPS). Because of the high  			 stress demands placed on child welfare workers, the profession has a high  			 "burn-out" rate. Moreover, the relatively low monetary compensation received by  			 these workers makes it difficult to recruit new personnel in this area.  			 Therefore most child welfare workers are given responsibility for an extremely  			 high caseload. Not only does this lead to additional burn-out, but it also  			 drastically comprises a worker's ability to take action in each child's best  			 interest. Moreover, individual child welfare workers responsible for action or  			 inaction that results in harm to a child are being increasingly litigated. </p>
<p>The chronic shortage of available foster parents (which has worsened  			 in recent years) is an additional systemic problem facing the foster care  			 system. Personnel in one State asserted that because of this shortage, at times  			 they are forced to place children with foster parents that have a history of  			 abuse themselves. The shortage also causes children to be placed in group  			 homes, and institutional settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Developing strategies for addressing a number of growing social  			 problems that challenge system effectiveness</b>. The systemic problems  			 confronting the foster care system are exacerbated by a number of social  			 problems that are leading to increased, specialized caseload demands. These  			 include the negative effects of drug abuse, the growing incidence of children  			 with AIDS, and the rising number of homeless families. Children placed in  			 substitute care as a result of any one of these social problems require  			 specialized foster care. </p>
<p>For example, the DC Department of Human Services reports that  			 approximately 80% of all requests for foster care originate from homes in which  			 there is some kind of drug involvement. In addition, an increasing number of  			 children are born drug-addicted, and/or suffering from related serious  			 disabilities--such as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome--because of maternal drug and  			 alcohol use during pregnancy. The effects of such disabilities persist  			 throughout these childrens' developmental stages. Since the mothers of  			 drug-addicted infants are at high risk of having inadequate parenting  			 skills--and the infants pose difficult care problems and continuing  			 developmental disability problems-the newborns frequently enter foster care  			 either as "border babies," or as early CPS cases. </p>
<p>Proper and adequate placement facilities for foster care children  			 infected with the AIDS virus need to be developed. As of October 10, 1988 a  			 total of 1,198 children have been diagnosed as HIV seropositive, and this  			 number is projected to reach 3,000 pediatric AIDS cases by 1991. Many of these  			 children do not have mothers--or extended family--that are able to adequately  			 care for them. Caring for these children exclusively in hospitals is often a  			 misuse of public resources. Harlem Hospital reports an average daily cost of  			 $500 per child for such care. </p>
<p>The experiences of homeless foster children almost always result in  			 emotional disturbances, and an array of developmental difficulties. A recent  			 State-by-State survey conducted by the Department of Education estimated that  			 nationwide there are 220,000 homeless school-age children, and that 65,000 of  			 these do not attend school regularly. The National Coalition for the Homeless  			 conducted a similar survey and estimated a total of 500,000 to 750,000 homeless  			 children. Yet another study commissioned by the State of New Jersey found that  			 fully 33% of the children in foster care were placed because of homelessness,  			 or were provided services aimed at preventing homelessness. In 7 of the 21  			 counties this percentage was more than 50%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Encouraging the replication of successful pilot programs aimed at  			 preventing family dysfunction and substitute care placement before it is  			 necessary to remove children from their home</b>. Such programs are aimed at  			 addressing the problems which place families at high risk of child welfare  			 system intervention. The intent of those drafting PL 96-272 was to provide  			 Federal funding and oversight to insure permanency planning; that children did  			 not languish in foster care unnecessarily. As a direct result of reform the  			 legal reasons which warrant the removal of children from their home are  			 interpreted more conservatively, and efforts to reunite foster care children  			 with their original parents have been enhanced. Comparatively little Federal  			 and State emphasis has been placed on averting family dysfunction by employing  			 preventative techniques that attempt to alleviate a family's problems. In  			 addition, it has not been determined if the problems that caused children to be  			 removed are often adequately resolved to make reunification effective in the  			 majority of cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Re-thinking the entire child welfare system in terms of system  			 linkages</b>. One example of such an effort is the comprehensive child welfare  			 program currently being piloted by the Casey Foundation. The New Futures  			 program will be designed to provide a common access point for youth and their  			 families in need of services in the areas of juvenile justice, education,  			 social services, and developmental disabilities. A social worker will be  			 assigned to each case to determine which services are necessary for the client,  			 act as an advocate, and garner the needed resources. Many of those involved in  			 this issue area envision the nationwide replication of such a child welfare  			 system in the future. </p>
</li>
</ol><p>In addition to identifying and explaining key issues, this paper  		presents the priority policy issues of key groups that are expected to play an  		active role in the debate of these issues. This information was gleaned from  		Congressional hearings, and interviews conducted with Departmental personnel,  		legislative staff members, and representatives of children and youth advocacy  		organizations. A complete listing of these sources is included as  		<a href="frfoscar.htm#appendB">Appendix B</a>. <a href="frfoscar.htm#appendA">Appendix A</a> explains  		the array of Federal programs that comprise the foster care system. </p>
<h2><a name="system" id="system">II. SYSTEM OVERVIEW</a></h2>
<p>Currently Federal financing of the foster care system is provided by  		titles IV-B and IV-E of the Social Security Act. In addition, each State spends  		a portion of its title XX funds for foster care. Foster care children  		qualifying for coverage under title IV-E also qualify for Medicaid benefits.  		According to a September, 1988 study conducted by the American Public Welfare  		Association (APWA) entitled "Analysis of Child Welfare Services Expenditure  		Data and Child Day Care Expenditure Data," in FY 1985 Federal, State, and local  		governments spent an estimated $4.2 billion on the six primary child welfare  		service areas of adoption, substitute care, protective services, various  		preventative services, pregnancy/parenting services, and services for juvenile  		delinquents. </p>
<p>Ideally the foster care system can be viewed as a safety net to care for  		the children of dysfunctional families. Although the legal reasons which  		warrant the removal of children from their families are interpreted more  		conservatively as a direct result of reform, it is the purpose of this system  		to care for children that are removed by placing them with foster parents  		(69%), in a group home (15%), or in an institutional setting (5%) (FY 1985  		percentages).<sup><font><a href="frfoscar.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The intent of the current system is to provide permanency planning; that  		such placements are temporary lasting only until the children are re-united  		with their original family, or are adopted by another family, following the  		termination of the parental rights of the original mother and father. If  		parental rights are terminated and the child is not adopted, it is the system's  		responsibility to care for them until they turn 18 and are "emancipated" from  		foster care. In such cases the purpose of foster care is to provide services to  		these children so that they can make an effective transition to independent  		adult living. System administration is criticized when it is perceived that  		these goals are not being met in many instances. </p>
<p>Of the cumulative total of 452,810 children in the foster care system as  		of FY 1985, 177,602 (39%) left the system that year. Of those that left:</p>
<ul><li>66% were reunited with their family;</li>
<li>8% were adopted;</li>
<li>8% were emancipated from the system (most turned 18);</li>
<li>18% either ran away, married, were discharged to another agency, were  		  incarcerated, or had legal guardianship established.</li>
</ul><p> Because the foster care system is supposed to serve as a safety net it  		is subject to the impact of any number of factors that can cause family  		dysfunction. In the recent past the system has experienced an enormous influx  		of children due to changes in the prevalence of child abuse reporting. The  		Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1974 provided funds to States that  		established comprehensive child abuse and neglect reporting and investigatory  		systems. As a result it became mandatory for physicians and social workers to  		report all cases of suspected child abuse. The number of reported cases of  		child abuse reported each year is 50 times greater than it was in 1962. </p>
<p>Currently most children continue to enter the system because they are  		victims of abuse and/or neglect from a member of their original family. During  		FY 1985 there were a total of 187,000 children placed in foster care  		nationwide. Of these placements:</p>
<ul><li> 61% resulted from abuse or neglect;</li>
<li>15% resulted from a parental condition such as illness, death,  		  disability, or imprisonment;</li>
<li>8% resulted from status offenses (legal offenses resulting from a  		  child's non-adult status) such as delinquency, truancy, or running away from  		  home;</li>
<li>2% resulted from a child's disability;</li>
<li>14% either resulted from an unknown cause, because of a parent/child  		  conflict, or because of the child's need for home maternity care etc. </li>
</ul><h2><a name="ominous" id="ominous">III. OMINOUS TRENDS</a></h2>
<p>According to those interviewed for this paper, currently the foster care  		system is facing new systemic crises. First, the increase in the number of  		reported and substantiated child abuse and neglect cases is causing a rise in  		the number of children entering substitute care. These demands are causing the  		child welfare decision process to become more complex. Second, it is perceived  		by some that the foster care system is ill-equipped to address this rise in  		cases because of a general system "break down" caused by overworked child  		protective service professionals, and a shortage of foster and adoptive  		parents. Moreover, the impact of these problems will worsen in the near future  		due to the impact of three social crises looming on the horizon. These are the  		growing negative impact of drugs on the family, the increasing prevalence of  		AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), and the increasing number of  		homeless families. Such problems represent ominous trends that will impact an  		already overburdened foster care system. Effective methods to plan for these  		challenges need to be developed. </p>
<h3>Systemic Challenges</h3>
<p><i><b>Increase In Substantiated Child Abuse Cases: </b></i></p>
<p>During the last two decades public recognition of child abuse has lead  		to efforts to alleviate its harmful effects. In response to a Congressional  		mandate contained in the Child Abuse Amendments of 1984 (PL 98-457), the "Study  		of National Incidence and Prevalence of Child Abuse-and Neglect" (NIS) was  		sponsored by the National Center on Child Abuse and. Neglect (NCCAN) of Human  		Development Services (HDS). Completed in 1986 by WESTAT Inc., the study  		assessed the current national incidence of child abuse and neglect to determine  		changes in the severity, frequency, and character of child maltreatment from  		1980 to 1986. When data from these two years are compared the primary  		conclusions of the study are:</p>
<ul><li>countable cases of child maltreatment increased significantly (by  		  66%). This increase primarily reflected a significant increase in the incidence  		  of child abuse (74%);</li>
<li>the incidence of physical abuse increased by 58%, and sexual abuse  		  increased by more than three times;</li>
<li>no reliable changes in the incidence of emotional abuse, nor any form  		  of child neglect were discerned. </li>
</ul><p> Although the prevalence of child abuse has increased significantly  		since 1980, the study attributed this primarily to a growth in child abuse  		reporting. This is a direct result of the heightened sensitization of  		professionals working with children to the recognition of abuse, especially in  		its earlier stages. Therefore, it is the contention of the NIS that children  		are not more likely to be abused than they were in 1980, and that it is now  		more likely that their abuse will be recognized by adults in a position to  		report their suspicions to Child Protective Services (CPS). Currently the  		Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) is  		conducting a re-analysis of the NIS to determine the validity of this  		hypothesis. </p>
<p>CPS professionals are charged with the responsibility of investigating  		all reports of child abuse and neglect to determine--according to State  		law--whether or not child maltreatment occurred. In those cases where abuse is  		substantiated, these staff are faced with a difficult decision because services  		and support systems for dysfunctional families are in short supply in many  		communities and States. The child welfare worker must weigh the prospect of  		leaving such children with the family while providing intensive services and  		treatment resources, against the option of removing these children from the  		abusive environment while working with the family to achieve reunification.  		</p>
<p>These decisions are always complicated as they must take into account  		the seriousness of abuse and/or neglect, the level of family dysfunction, and  		the available resources of the community to support the family with needed  		services. Moreover the difficulty of these decisions are worsening due to the  		social crises such as drug abuse and family homelessness (discussed later in  		this section) which are placing additional demands on the child welfare  		systems. </p>
<p><i><u><b>Child Welfare System Breakdown: </b></u></i></p>
<p>One disturbing finding of the NIS was that there are some large apparent  		gaps discerned between abuse recognized by personnel working with children, and  		the reporting of these cases to CPS. Therefore not all recognized cases were  		investigated. Perhaps this is a reflection of the widely perceived breakdown of  		an overburdened child protection system. This NIS finding will also be  		addressed in ASPE's secondary analysis of the study. </p>
<p>Public awareness of the problems associated with the current array of  		services comprising child welfare is growing. CPS and foster care only  		represent small elements of this range of services. A recent television  		documentary "Children in Crises" aired during the Summer of 1988, confirmed a  		number of cases in which children have been abused after they were placed in  		the foster care system. </p>
<p>In addition, the documentary focused on the acute shortage of available  		foster parents that compromises the effectiveness of the system. For instance,  		in telephone conversations for this paper personnel in one State asserted that  		the shortage of available foster parents forces social workers to accept some  		parents that have a history of abuse themselves, employing ongoing counseling  		in an attempt to modify their behavior. Shortages also cause foster children  		who might otherwise be placed in foster families, to be placed in group homes  		and institutional settings. The shortage of available foster parents is due  		partly to the low monetary reimbursement they receive, and to a general drop in  		such civic activities which results from several reasons including the growing  		prevalence of two-worker families. This shortage has worsened in recent years.  		</p>
<p>The Association for the Children of New Jersey completed a statewide  		study on the effectiveness of their child welfare system in 1988 entitled  		"Splintered Lives, A Report on Decision-Making for Children in Foster Care."  		Some of the pertinent findings include the following:</p>
<ul><li>during foster care placement 40% of New Jersey children had two  		  different caseworkers, and 26% had three or more in a 20 month period;</li>
<li>each of the State's project offices had a vacancy rate of five  		  positions at any one time. In Edison, NJ 10 - 12 positions were vacant for  		  several months, and the office lost 50% of its staff from June, 1986 to July,  		  1987;</li>
<li>long delays in filling these vacancies were common. On average it  		  took 6 - 8 months to fill a vacancy when a worker resigned, and 6 - 12 months  		  when one was promoted;</li>
<li>staff vacancies resulted in increased caseload sizes. In 1987 the  		  average actual caseload in Edison was 52, compared to an allocated level of 35  		  cases when all staff positions were filled. </li>
</ul><p>The staff turnover represented in these statistics comprise a vicious  		cycle evident in many States. Because of the high vacancy rate, social workers  		are given too many investigatory and placement cases. This overburdening of  		human resources means that children in a crises situation are often not given  		the services they desperately need. Moreover, this leads to a high CPS  		personnel "burn-out" rate resulting in yet more unfilled vacancies. In  		addition, the pay received by social workers is usually not commiserate with  		the stress they encounter on the job, making it additionally hard to fill  		vacancies. The study attributed virtually all of the State's CPS problems to  		this high staff turnover phenomenon. </p>
<p>According to HDS, an additional problem exacerbating the situation is  		that child welfare workers responsible for action or inaction that results in  		harm to a child are being increasingly litigated. In some instances workers may  		be held directly liable for what in reality are system inadequacies such as  		poor training, excessive caseload levels, and staff shortages. If such lawsuits  		become widespread State and county organizations will undoubtedly have trouble  		recruiting new staff, and retaining current child welfare workers. Although a  		recent Supreme Court ruling on <b>DeShaney v. Winnebago County</b> absolved the  		State of Wisconsin in such a case, damages against welfare workers may still be  		sought in State courts. </p>
<h3>Social Challenges</h3>
<p><i><u><b>Drug Abuse </b></u></i></p>
<p>Drugs can cause family break-up when they are abused and/or openly sold  		within the family to such an extent that children are either abused, neglected,  		or otherwise endangered. In other instances children are placed in substitute  		care when they are born drug-addicted, or their parents are imprisoned on drug  		charges. </p>
<p>Locally, a newly-released survey conducted by the Metropolitan  		Washington Council of Governments attributed some of the recent growth in the  		demand for foster care placements directly to the growth in drug abuse in the  		metropolitan area. In the outlying area of Southern Maryland, and the counties  		of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, Montgomery and Prince George's, requests for  		foster care increased on average by 71% from 1985 to 1987. Comparatively in the  		District of Columbia--which is currently experiencing a large growth in the  		illegal drug trade--the number of infants in need of foster care increased by  		105%, and the increase in adolescent need was 120% during this same three-year  		period. The DC Department of Human Services reports that approximately 80% of  		all requests for foster care originate from homes in which there is some kind  		of drug involvement. </p>
<p>In addition, an increasing number of children are born drug-addicted,  		and/or suffering from related serious disabilities --such as Fetal Alcohol  		Syndrome--because of maternal drug and alcohol use during pregnancy. Since  		these mothers are at high risk of having inadequate parenting skills (and the  		infants pose difficult care problems characterized by high irritability during  		drug withdrawal and continuing developmental disability problems) the newborns  		frequently enter foster care either as "border babies," or as early CPS cases.  		</p>
<p>These babies require highly specialized foster parenting skills. If they  		are placed with relatives there is a need for continuing support and  		coordination with medical services, and respite care. Moreover, research is  		documenting that in the long-term these children are likely to require  		specialized medical, mental health, and educational services. There is some  		overlap between these children and those that are born HIV positive--discussed  		in detail below--but in most major cities the drug-addicted baby population is  		placing the most additional demands on the foster care system. In a September,  		1988 application submitted to the Administration for Children, Youth, and  		Families (ACYF) the California State DSS stated that in the first half of 1988,  		each month 40 - 50 newborns were identified with positive toxicologies for  		illicit drugs--mostly cocaine--at Martin Luther King Hospital in the city of  		Los Angeles. This represents just 30% of that county's total such cases. </p>
<p><i><b>AIDS: </b></i></p>
<p> The rise in drug-related activities has not only led to an increase in  		the incidence of family dysfunction caused by such factors as child abuse and  		neglect, but also to an increase in the number of foster care children who test  		positive for the AIDS virus. According to the Surgeon General's workshop, 73%  		of the children that acquire AIDS come from families in which at least one of  		the parents is an intravenous (IV) drug user. </p>
<p>Presently a small number of infants are abandoned in the hospital at  		birth by AIDS-infected mothers who are unable to care for them. These  		AIDS-infected "boarder babies," and older AIDS-infected children that cannot be  		cared for by their families are placed in the foster care system. Most  		estimates predict that at least half of the babies of Human Immunodeficiency  		Virus (HIV) positive mothers will test seropositive themselves. Although most  		infected babies and young children die relatively soon, some survive into  		adolescence. </p>
<p>AIDS surveillance data gathered by the Center for Disease Control (CDC)  		shows that as of January 2, 1989 a total of 1,681 children have been diagnosed  		as AIDS-infected. The CDC projects 3,000 cases of pediatric AIDS by 1991, and  		that 10,000 to 20,000 children and infants will be infected by that year. The  		Abandoned Infants Assistance Act (S 945) authorizes $10 million for FY 1989 and  		$12 million for FY 1990 for grants designed to meet a variety of the needs of  		boarder babies. However, no money has been appropriated under this program.  		</p>
<p> Currently the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation (ASPE) is undertaking a study to determine the number of children in  		foster care in each state that test HIV seropositive. The report will include  		eight case studies of certain States to ascertain their programmatic responses  		to the problem. This study will follow-up on exploratory research conducted by  		the office in this area that was completed on March 31, 1988 in a report  		entitled "AIDS Children and Child Welfare."<sup><font><a href="frfoscar.htm#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Besides the lack of knowledge about the precise number of foster  		children infected with AIDS, the virus poses a number of additional challenges  		to the foster care system. First, as with drug-addicted babies, infected  		children require specialized attention and expensive care on a regular basis.  		Currently foster care payments do not provide compensation for the extensive  		demands placed on the caregiver, or the additional expenses incurred for  		regular trips to the hospital, baby sitters, and respite care. For instance,  		although the amounts vary according to a foster child's age and condition, in  		the District of Columbia a foster family receives between $3,581 and $5,880 per  		year, a Maryland family receives an annual stipend of $3,430 - $4,906, and in  		Virginia this same amount averages $2,208. </p>
<p>States that are making a serious effort to increase the supply of  		specialized foster homes for such children offer enhanced payment rates for HIV  		seropositive foster children. In New York City these rates are $13,608 annually  		compared with the regular range of $1,980 - $4,104. In New Jersey the enhanced  		annual rate is $10,800. The actual costs for caring for such children in a  		foster family environment have not been determined. </p>
<p>Second, the recruitment and training of foster parents to care for HIV  		seropositive children can be difficult. Although agencies differ greatly in  		their efforts to recruit and train foster parents to care for AIDS-infected  		children, currently some have demonstrated considerable success in this area.  		One example is Leake and Watts in Yonkers, New York (a non-profit agency  		specializing in the adoption placement of foster children with AIDS) which has  		received funding from the State and from the Children's Bureau of HDS to  		recruit, train, and support foster parents. Leake and Watts, utilizes an  		approach that incorporates both formal and informal means, and utilizes  		community networking. To be recruited prospective foster parents must be well  		informed about the disease, not afraid of contagion, and must have some medical  		or nursing background. In terms of support they must be well paid for their  		efforts, and also have intensive medical and social service backing. In  		addition, the agency workers that they rely on must have a small caseload. The  		State of New Jersey has begun using medical social workers and nurses as case  		managers. While this is relatively expensive by traditional child welfare  		standards, the cost of one month of such care is less than two days of hospital  		care. </p>
<p>Third, the type of care that is appropriate for these children is an  		issue. Although HIV seropositive children are often in need of specialized  		care, it is not necessary, nor appropriate, that they reside in a hospital all  		of the time. As is the case with all children, these children are best cared  		for in foster family homes--as opposed to institutions--both for their own  		development, and to contain costs. For instance, an analysis of the cost of  		caring for HIV seropositive children housed in Harlem Hospital found an average  		daily cost of $500 per child, with a range varying from $300 to $2,400. An  		estimated 30% of the total time such children spent in hospital care--and 20%  		of the total cost--were unnecessary. </p>
<p>However, some agencies are developing congregate care facilities for HIV  		seropositive children because traditional approaches to foster parent  		recruitment have not been successful. Although such care is less expensive than  		the hospital alternative, it also is not inexpensive, nor entirely appropriate.  		One such congregate care site in New Jersey--St. Claire's Home for  		Children--reports a cost of $240 per day per child. The staff of the home view  		such care as only temporary because it is not a family environment that  		approaches normalcy, the risk of illness is too high for the children, and  		because such a solution implicitly condones the isolation of AIDS-infected  		individuals. In addition, community resistance to the placement of such homes  		can be quite high. </p>
<p><i><b>Family Homelessness: </b></i></p>
<p>A third social trend negatively impacting the foster care system is the  		growing number of homeless families with children. Homeless children pose  		specialized foster care problems. Their experiences almost always result in  		emotional disturbances, and an array of developmental difficulties. </p>
<p>A recent State-by-State survey conducted by the Department of Education  		estimated that nationwide there are 220,000 homeless school-age children, and  		that 65,000 of those do not attend school regularly. The National Coalition for  		Homelessness conducted a similar study and estimated a total of 500,000 to  		750,000 homeless children. A Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) and  		Traveler's Aid study completed in 1987, found that homeless children were more  		likely to be abused and neglected as a result of family stress; and/or parental  		mental illness, and behavioral problems. Other contributing factors include the  		fact that often these children suffer from emotional, behavioral, and  		developmental problems. The study concluded that fully 43% of the homeless  		school-aged children studied were not attending school, and that their  		substitute care rate was 3 to 6 times higher than the general population. </p>
<p>While no national statistics on the subject have been collected, a 1987  		New Jersey DYFS Bureau of Research study found that at the conclusion of the  		previous year 33% of the children in foster care in the State were placed  		because of homelessness, or were provided services aimed at preventing  		homelessness. In 7 of the 21 counties this percentage was more than 50%. </p>
<p>These ominous systemic and social trends represent challenges to the  		incoming administration. The alleviation of these problems should be addressed  		before their impact on child welfare systems worsens. </p>
<h2><a name="reform" id="reform">IV. SUMMARY OF THE PRIMARY INTENT OF REFORM AND ITS  		EFFECTS</a></h2>
<p>Federal involvement in the foster care system was first initiated in  		1935 when services were made available to foster children and their families  		under the Child Welfare Services Program (now contained in title IV-B of the  		Social Security Act). In 1961 Congress expanded the system coverage by amending  		the Act to include the title IV-A Aid to Families with Dependent Children  		(AFDC). Under this program, maintenance payments were also made available to  		those AFDC children in need of foster care. This reform was followed by the  		1974 enactment of the title XX Social Services amendments allowing States to  		expand the service scope of the foster care system to include non-AFDC  		children. Title XX represents the single largest source of Federal funds  		available for foster care. At least 20% of this $2.5 billion Federal  		appropriation is spent collectively on child welfare by the States, including  		the provision of foster care. </p>
<p>The concern that foster care children were needlessly and  		inappropriately languishing in foster care, and that often the rights of these  		children and their parents were being overlooked, fueled further system reform  		efforts with the passage of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare  		Amendments of June 17, 1980 (PL 96-272). The passage of this legislation  		represents the most comprehensive foster care reform effort to date. As a  		direct result the Federal government became involved to an unprecedented extent  		in many aspects of a disparate system that continues to be administered at a  		State or county level. A detailed explanation of the law and its programmatic  		components is included in <a href="frfoscar.htm#appendA">Appendix A</a>. </p>
<p>A primary impetus to this reform were several critical studies authored  		by a number of independent researchers, individual States, the Children's  		Bureau of HHS, Child Welfare League of America (CWLA), the American Public  		Welfare Association (APWA), and the Children's Defense Fund (CDF). These  		studies found that the foster care system existing at that time was inadequate  		because:</p>
<ul><li>little was known about who was in foster care, why they were placed,  		  where they were placed, and the length of their placement time;</li>
<li>case planning and periodic reviews of children in care was virtually  		  non-existent;</li>
<li>too many children were labeled "unadoptable" for inadequate  		  reasons;</li>
<li>linkages between the child welfare, mental health, and other  		  child-serving agencies were non-existent. </li>
</ul><p>The intent of PL 96-272--through additional Federal funding and  		oversight--was to insure that the unnecessary placement of children in foster  		care was prevented, that appropriate services were made available to foster  		care children, and that all such children were provided with permanent homes.  		As a direct result of reform the legal reasons which warrant the removal of  		children from their home are interpreted more conservatively, and efforts to  		reunite foster care children with their original parents have been enhanced. If  		neither option is possible, additional payments are provided to parents that  		adopt foster care children with "special needs" since these children stayed in  		foster care the longest and were the least adoptable. </p>
<p>Both the number of children in foster care, and the length of time they  		spend in the system, has declined from its peak in 1977. But as the following  		table show these two trends seem to be independent of the implementation of PL  		96-272 in 1980. <a href="frfoscar.htm#table1">Table 1</a> shows the number of children  		residing in foster care dropped steadily from 1977 to 1983, and increased  		slightly in 1984 and 1985. Simultaneously, from 1977 to 1985 the median length  		of time that children spent in foster care has also dropped at a decreasing  		rate. Such comprehensive data has not been reported since 1985. </p>

</tr></table><p>Despite reform efforts, foster care continues to provide more than just  		temporary care for many children. However, most statistics show an improvement  		in this area since the late 1970's: According to a December 1987 MAXIMUS study  		conducted for ASPE entitled "State Child Welfare Abstracts  		1980-1985,"<sup><font><a href="frfoscar.htm#note3">3</a></font></sup> in FY 1985  		39% of the foster care children had been in the system for a time period that  		exceeded two years, and 45% of the foster care caseload was older than 13. In  		addition, 18% of this population had one or more "special needs" (defined in  		<a href="frfoscar.htm#appendA">Appendix A</a>), and 47% were minorities validating that  		such children are over-represented in the system in comparison to the general  		population. One contributing reason is that these children represent those that  		are the least adoptable. Of all children awaiting adoption 71% were older than  		six years of age, 47% were minorities, 51% had one or more special needs, and  		79% had been waiting to be adopted for a time period that exceeded six months.  		</p>
<p>Furthermore it appears that the number of children in foster care has  		continued to rise since 1985. A January 18, 1988 background paper by Robert M.  		Goerge, Rosemary C. Sarri, and Friedhelm H. Wulczyn, stated that the States of  		New York, Illinois, and Michigan have reported substantial increases in the  		size of their foster care caseload. These three States ranked second, third,  		and fifth respectively in terms of their share of the total foster care  		population at the conclusion of 1985. From 1984 to 1987 New York's annual count  		of cases increased by 18%, and from 1981 to 1987 Michigan reported that their  		caseload grew by 30% with the majority of that increase taking place after  		1984. </p>
<h2><a name="priority" id="priority">V. PRIORITY AREAS OF THE PRIMARY ISSUE  		PARTICIPANTS</a></h2>
<p>Since the passage of PL 96-272 the debate surrounding foster care issues  		has focused on the quality of the existing system, and the appropriate level of  		Federal involvement in the provision of this care. The primary issues which are  		a priority to the actors involved in this debate were determined by the  		frequency of agreement among those interviewed, the emphasis which they placed  		on their concerns, the policies they have forwarded in the past, and those they  		plan to advocate in the future. An overview of the results is included in the  		following brief outline. </p>
<p><i><b>The Department of Health and Human Services: </b></i></p>
<ol><li>Containment of escalating administrative and training costs  		  associated with title IV-E;</li>
<li>Encourage community--or State-wide--responses to the problems that  		  cause family dysfunction;</li>
<li>Encourage States to develop preplacement prevention--and family  		  treatment--programs to reduce the flow of children into foster care;</li>
<li>Continue to emphasize effective reunification strategies for those  		  children that are removed from their original home. </li>
</ol><p><i><b>Pertinent Legislative Committees: </b></i></p>
<ol><li>Development of information systems on which to base appropriational  		  decisions and policy reform;</li>
<li>Determination of the Federal government's long-term commitment to the  		  Independent Living Program;</li>
<li>Improved quality of the current care system through the strengthening  		  of the title IV-B section 427 review process in terms of content and  		  administration. </li>
</ol><p><i><b>Children and Youth Advocacy Organizations: </b></i></p>
<ol><li>Increased Federal funding of titles IV-B, and XX;</li>
<li>Retention of title IV-E as an open-ended entitlement program;</li>
<li>Expansion of allowable title IV-E administrative and training  		  costs;</li>
<li>Enhanced Federal support of programs to prevent family  		  dysfunction;</li>
<li>Piloting comprehensive child welfare programs that include multiple  		  service system linkages. </li>
</ol><h3>DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH &amp; HUMAN SERVICES:</h3>
<p>HHS offices are increasingly alarmed by the rapidly rising Federal costs  		associated with the title IV-E administrative and training provisions of PL  		96-272. It is the Department's contention that at least some States are no  		longer bearing their rightful share of the program's cost by administering  		either inefficient programs, and/or exploiting the open-ended entitlement of  		title IV-E by claiming costs--or even entire programs-which these funds are not  		intended to cover. </p>
<p><i><b>1. Cost Containment of title IV-E Administrative and Training  		Expenditures: </b></i></p>
<p>In an attempt to study the rapidly rising title IV-E administrative and  		training costs, the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) issued a report  		entitled "Foster Care Administrative Costs" that was completed in 1987. Most  		importantly the OIG report concluded that States were not guilty of illegal  		practices, but were rather attempting to maximize Federal reimbursement. The  		report found that Federal expenditures for title IV-E administrative costs--and  		training costs for State workers to administer the program--have been much  		greater than was expected when PL 96-272 was passed. Although it was expected  		that Federal costs would rise with the passage of the law, as is shown in  		<a href="frfoscar.htm#table2">Table 2</a>, between FY's 1981 and 1987 these costs rose by  		868.1%; from $30.4 million to $294.3 million. During this time the average  		number of title IV-E children served each month rose by only 8.6% from 102,991  		to 111,879. </p>
<p>Another method to determine the reasonableness of this cost increase is  		to compare the ratio of the average title IV-E administrative and training  		costs to the average foster care maintenance payment per child. During the  		seven fiscal years following passage of PL 96-272 the value of this ratio  		increased from .11 to .70. This means that the cost of administration and  		training (at least somewhat analogous to service "overhead") in relation to  		maintenance payments (analogous to service provision) increased in percentage  		terms by 536.4%. The value of this IV-E ratio is much higher than those of  		other comparable programs such as Medicaid, AFDC, and Food Stamps. </p>
<p>However, several program-specific considerations should be taken into  		account when such cost measurements are made. First, the use of nationwide  		averages mask the fact that wide expense variations exist from State-to-State.  		Undoubtedly at least some of this variation appears not to be the result of  		State differences in relative program efficiency, but rather because of  		differing State strategies, or because of their relative ability to claim  		costs. Evidence of the former is given by the fact that the OIG report found  		that some States have chosen to deliberately underclaim costs in order to  		transfer such title IV-E "savings" to title IV-B expenditures; an allowable  		practice. As for the latter, some States have developed--and  		utilize--accounting procedures that are more proficient at charging allowable  		expenses to the Federal government which may unfairly shift some of the child  		welfare burden to the Federal government. Many of these costs apply to foster  		children in general, regardless of whether or not they are AFDC-eligible.  		Therefore the proportion of these costs that should be charged to title IV-E is  		debatable. </p>

</tr></table><p>Second, certain precautions should be taken when the percentage change  		in title IV-E administrative and training cost is used to measure relative cost  		growth over time. For instance many States have an artificially low base in the  		years immediately following the implementation of PL 96-272 due both to their  		inability to claim all appropriate costs and because preplacement prevention  		services were required only after the law was amended in 1983. As States became  		more sophisticated in developing expense accounting procedures (such as cost  		allocation procedures required by PL 96-272) they became more proficient at  		expensing certain allowable administrative and training costs to the Federal  		government. </p>
<p>A third consideration is that Federal reimbursement for title IV-E costs  		include a wide variety of program and service activities that are not included  		in similar programs such as AFDC, Medicaid, and Food Stamps. Examples include  		the cost of referral to services, preparation for and participation in judicial  		determinations, placement in foster care, development of a case plan, and  		recruitment and licensing of foster care homes and institutions. Therefore  		comparisons to other "similar" programs are inappropriate. </p>
<p>In an attempt to take these program-specific considerations into account  		HDS sought to narrow the scope of allowable administrative and training costs  		by requiring that the expense of such activities be prorated on the basis of  		IV-E to non-IV-E children. However, a March 1987 decision concerning a case  		brought by the State of Missouri before the HHS Departmental Grant Appeals  		Board on the matter appears to have seriously limited the controlling of such  		costs in this manner. Staff offices within the Department have never determined  		whether or not this problem could be solved by changing appropriate  		regulations, or requiring statutory changes. </p>
<p>A Departmental proposal that may be forwarded to Congress this session  		seeks to contain administrative costs through a legislative change that would  		limit the amount at which States could claim such costs. Specifically, this  		proposal would combine Federal title IV-E administrative and training  		authorizations--and the Independent Living Program--into a title IV-B Child  		Welfare Services State formula grant program that would require no state match.  		Instead States would be expected to continue their current level of service  		expenditures through a "maintenance of effort" provision. Non-administrative  		and training title IV-E foster care maintenance payments would remain  		open-ended. </p>
<p>Under this proposal the title IV-B child protections would remain in  		effect, and the current allowable amount of a State's allotment could be  		garnered in the first year following implementation of the legislation if it  		was determined in section 427 reviews that it did not comply with these  		requirements. The amount that could be garnered would subsequently increase by  		20% in the third year--and an additional 20% in the fourth year-following  		legislative implementation. The title IV-B trigger capping mechanism of title  		IV-E (which only goes into effect if title IV-B is fully appropriated; see  		<a href="frfoscar.htm#table3">Table 3</a>) and the ability of States to transfer unused  		title IV-E funds to title IV-B would be eliminated. </p>
<p>To control escalating Federal expenditures, allowable foster care  		administrative and training expenses would be frozen at current levels,  		adjusted each subsequent year for inflation. It is the Department's belief that  		the implementation of this proposal would not adversely effect children in  		foster care because future Federal appropriations would allow States to  		continue to operate the system at their current level of administration and  		training. This is based on the assumption that enough time has elapsed since  		the implementation of PL 96-272 for States to reach a sufficient level of such  		expenditures relative to foster care maintenance payments. In addition, title  		IV-E foster care maintenance payments would remain an open-ended entitlement.  		</p>
<p>Furthermore, combining title IV-E and title IV-B administrative and  		training expenses would make accounting procedures less burdensome to States,  		reducing some of their administrative costs. The proposal would also allow them  		a greater degree of flexibility in expending foster care finds. </p>
<p>Although this proposal was developed by HHS for FY 1989, due to an  		agreement with Congress to not submit major new legislative entitlement  		proposals for that year, it was never forwarded to Congress. However, it has  		been resubmitted to OMB for approval as part of the HHS FY 1990 budgetary  		proposal. As is discussed later, advocacy and key legislative personnel  		reactions to this proposal are not expected to be generally supportive. In  		particular representatives of children and youth advocacy organizations stated  		that such a proposal would reduce the amount of services otherwise available to  		foster children and their parents in the future. </p>
<p><i><b>Use of title IV-E Funds in non-Traditional Foster Care Systems:  		</b></i></p>
<p>A closely related problem in many States is that an increasing number of  		older adolescents are entering child welfare systems. These children--often  		adjudicated delinquent--have traditionally been placed in the juvenile justice  		system. Increasingly they are now being placed in foster family homes, group  		homes, and child care institutions. If such children are title IV-E eligible,  		many States are financing them with these funds. In addition, an unknown number  		of States appear to be utilizing title IV-E funds to finance the out-of-home  		care of eligible children placed in the juvenile justice system. </p>
<p>Because the authorizing statute does not define "out-of-home care"  		solely as foster care in the traditional sense, currently the practice is legal  		if the affected children receive such child protections as title IV-B section  		427 reviews. Moreover, it is desirable that such children receive access to the  		same services designed for all foster care children, such as Independent Living  		Programs. </p>
<p>While it is known that this funding source is currently being utilized  		by the State of California, the extent to which this practice will spread to  		other States--and the impact that this will have on Federal expenditures--is  		not known. The use of foster care funds in this manner should be monitored by  		the incoming administration. </p>

</tr></table><p><i><b>2. Prevention of Family Dysfunction: </b></i></p>
<p>Communities should be encouraged to identify families at high risk of  		dysfunction before the point at which the child welfare system currently  		intervenes. The reasons which often result in child abuse and neglect--such as  		drug abuse--are becoming increasingly complex and severe. By the time a child  		has been removed from the home the family has usually suffered severe damage,  		and correcting or ameliorating the situation requires the utilization of a  		broad range of social services over many years. Therefore, community-based  		strategies should be encouraged that identify high risk families before it is  		necessary to remove the children. Currently very few such programs exist, and  		none are coordinated at a State level. Successful programs would require the  		commitment of a broad range of social services (such as child care, parent  		education, respite care, and housing) that directly impact a family's ability  		to nurture its children. </p>
<p><i><b>3. Substitute Care Placement Prevention: </b></i></p>
<p>Public Law 96-272 required that States develop--and  		implement--preplacement preventative services for foster children financed with  		title IV-B funds when this funding source was fully appropriated at $266  		million. However, title IV-B funding has never reached this level (see  		<a href="frfoscar.htm#table3">Table 3</a>). As of October 1, 1983, it was required that  		foster children financed with title IV-E funds be provided with preplacement  		prevention services, as well as court certification that reasonable efforts had  		been made to prevent out-of-home care placement. At the time PL 96-272 was  		drafted the exact form--and effectiveness--of such preventative programs was  		not known and so they were not well-defined in the legislation. Instead those  		that drafted the law listed a number of social service examples (such as  		counseling and financial assistance) that they thought would be helpful  		examples. </p>
<p>However, over the past few years a number of family-focused strategies  		have been developed which seem to effectively prevent the placement of  		high-risk children in foster care. Although the programs vary, according to the  		Family Preservation Network (a working group convened by CWLA to study such  		strategies) they share a number of the following characteristics:</p>
<ul><li>a family focus not just limited to the children;</li>
<li>a home service delivery model;</li>
<li>an ecological perspective which translates into mobilizing the  		  provision of community services;</li>
<li>the services hours are flexible including evenings, and 24 hour  		  availability;</li>
<li>case plans are developed with family involvement. These include  		  counseling, skill training, and assisting the family obtain needed  		  resources;</li>
<li>the service provision duration is short-term, but intensive;</li>
<li>the staff have small caseloads;</li>
<li>the overriding commitment is to empower families, and enhance their  		  ability to cope with the problems confronting them. </li>
</ul><p>Approximately ten States have received demonstration grants from ACYF  		through their discretionary funding program, and the National Resource Center  		for Family Based Services, to develop such programs. Funded since 1985, these  		prevention programs are aimed at providing training, consultation, and  		technical assistance directly to States and communities. Two major evaluations  		of these programs have also been funded. ACYF estimates that currently half of  		the States have a least a pilot program in operation, but that only a few have  		such services available on a State-wide basis. </p>
<p>Such services are relatively expensive--estimates range from $1,000 to  		$5,000 per family--because the social workers are highly-trained and only have  		a small number of caseloads, and because the services provided are intensive.  		However, they have an estimated success rate of 80% - 90%. Personnel from ACYF  		assert that these statistics show that such programs are cost effective. </p>
<p><i><b>4. Continue to Emphasize Effective Reunification Strategies:  		</b></i></p>
<p>When efforts to prevent placement are unsuccessful, children are removed  		from their home and placed in substitute care. Public Law 96-272 requires that  		States provide services aimed at improving the conditions in the original home  		to the parents, children, and foster parents, thereby facilitating the  		reunification of the family. Ideally these services are provided throughout the  		time children are in foster care, and during the time of adjustment when they  		are returned to their original home. If this fails another permanent placement  		is arranged. </p>
<p>It is ACYF's assertion that several agencies have verified that  		intensive reunification services that utilize the same strategies as those  		outlined under the preceding section reduce the time children spend in  		substitute care, and the rate at which foster children re-enter the foster care  		system. This reduces future costs of out-of-home care. Because it is cost  		effective and beneficial to the child, States should be encouraged--and  		provided with incentives--to utilize title IV-B and title XX funds for such  		services. </p>
<h3>CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES:</h3>
<p>There are three types of Congressional committees which have taken  		leading roles on foster care issues in the Legislature:</p>
<ul><li>authorizing committees (House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Public  		  Assistance and Unemployment Compensation, and Senate Finance Subcommittee on  		  Family Security);</li>
<li>appropriational committees (House Committee on Education and Labor,  		  and Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources);</li>
<li>select committees (House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and  		  Families) that frequently act as a forum to advocate the majority political  		  party's position on foster care issues. </li>
</ul><p>Only House staff to the committees listed in <a href="frfoscar.htm#appendA">Appendix  		A</a> were interviewed for this paper, although care was taken to interview  		both majority and minority party staff. </p>
<p><i><b>1. Lack of Foster Care System Data: </b></i></p>
<p>The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Public Assistance and  		Unemployment Compensation, and the House Select Committee on Children, Youth,  		and Families held a joint public hearing on foster care issues in may of 1988.  		One of the critical points made in that hearing was the lack of information on  		the exact number of children in foster care, and their needs. Currently data on  		foster care children and special needs adoptions is voluntarily supplied by  		States to the American Public Welfare Association (APWA). First funded by HHS  		in 1982, such information is made available by the APWA from this Voluntary  		Cooperative Information System (VCIS). However, the data are not reported by  		all States, and the States that do participate do not all utilize common  		definitions and cost categories. </p>
<p>Although it is widely agreed that the voluntary data collection system  		is as good as can be expected, virtually all of the legislative staff  		interviewed for this paper expressed frustration about the lack of appropriate  		foster care data that currently forces them to operate in a "information  		vacuum" in which they cannot be assured of program effectiveness to base  		appropriational, and policy decisions. </p>
<p>This dilemma will at least be partially rectified by legislation enacted  		by Congress to require the Secretary of HHS to develop a mandatory adoption and  		foster care data collection system. The system was to be based on the  		recommendations of an advisory committee composed of people involved with child  		welfare issues. Last year this advisory committee submitted a report containing  		their recommendations to the Secretary of HHS and Congress. </p>
<p>Currently the Secretary's Report to Congress which outlines the proposed  		collection system has been developed and sent to OMB for final clearance.  		However, due to differences in opinion concerning the data to be collected, the  		December 31, 1988 deadline for the promulgation of regulations authorizing the  		data collection will not be met. </p>
<p>The development of this data collection system, and its final  		implementation, will be a major task facing the incoming administration. The  		primary issues that will need to be resolved are the information that will be  		required of the States, and the proportion of the subsequent cost for the  		collection of this data that will be covered by the Federal government. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Long-Term Federal Commitment to the Independent Living Program:  		</b></i></p>
<p>Because Congressional authorizing and appropriational decisions  		concerning the Independent Living Program (ILP) continue to be made on a yearly  		basis, the future of the program is uncertain. Currently among House personnel  		it appears that support for this program is closely related to one's political  		party affiliation. During interviews conducted for this paper, majority staff  		of the subcommittee charged with Congressional oversight of ILP were convinced  		of the-need for this program and advocate its continued funding. In comparison,  		although minority staff have favored ILP appropriations in the past, they are  		increasingly unsure if they will continue to support the program in the future.  		They assert that the primary purpose of the ILP initiatives were to provide  		seed money to assist States in the design and implementation of such programs  		in States where they did not previously exist. It is their understanding that  		the program was never meant to be institutionalized at a Federal level. </p>
<p>Although the aim of the program is to assist adolescents in the  		successful transition from foster care to independent adulthood, because no  		follow-up data is currently collected, there is no way to determine if ILP  		participants are making this transition successfully. In addition, very little  		data is reported by the States concerning the ethnicity, gender, and  		disabilities of the target population served because most States do not collect  		this type of data. </p>
<p>Such data is not mandated in the ILP Report to Congress that is being  		prepared by HDS. This, and the recent congressional expansion of the ILP  		coupled with the straight-line yearly appropriations that have continued since  		the program's inception in FY 1987, will undoubtedly intensify the debate  		concerning the determination of the proper level of Federal commitment in this  		area. </p>
<p><i><b>3. Improving the Quality &amp; Administration of Title IV-B  		Section 427 Reviews: </b></i></p>
<p>As a result of such recent television documentaries as "Children in  		Crises" and the Lisa Steinberg case in New York (both documented cases of  		children who were abused while they were in foster care) perceived deficiencies  		in the array of services to protect children from abuse in are receiving a  		higher degree of public criticism. Title IV-B section 427 reviews are intended  		to insure that certain Federal safeguards are adhered to when a child enters  		foster care, yet there is nearly universal criticism of the efficacy of these  		reviews. </p>
<p>George Miller (D-Calif.), Chairman of the Housen Select Committee on  		Children, Youth, and Families is especially critical of what he terms the  		inefficacy with which the title IV-B section 427 review process is currently  		administered. A member of his staff noted that these reviews have not yet taken  		in place in a number of States and large cities that comprise a significant  		share of the foster care caseload. In a recent Christian Science Monitor series  		on the current state of the child welfare system, Representative Miller was  		quoted as saying that in the future he would lobby for Federal title IV-B  		appropriations to be directly tied to the fulfillment of stringent section 427  		compliance by the States. </p>
<p>It is the contention of one majority staff member of the Subcommittee on  		Public Assistance and Unemployment Compensation, that section 427  		appropriations are not incentive-based as was the original intent of PL 96-272.  		Because of the back-log of section 427 reviews that need to be conducted by  		HDS, Federal funds for section 427 compliance are awarded to participating  		States before they are forced to undergo a review. When a review is conducted,  		currently a state is "fined" some percentage of its past appropriations based  		on the degree to which it was in noncompliance rather than being awarded the  		amount by which it jg in compliance. The situation is further complicated by  		the fact that a State could be penalized for past practices even if its current  		practices are in better compliance. Other participants in the debate state that  		this funding was never meant to be incentive-based, and that the original  		intent has not been subverted. This situation is exacerbated by the lack of  		regulations which, as mentioned previously, have not been cleared by OMB. </p>
<p>However, the majority staff member asserts that the very nature of this  		interaction subverts what is meant to be an incentive-based Federal-State  		interaction; a Federal "carrot" has been turned into a "stick." The crucial  		determination that needs to be made is whether or not this changed interaction  		effects the stringency with which section 427 reviews are conducted, and the  		degree with which States enforce statutory provisions. </p>
<p>One state has at least partially substantiated that this is the case.  		Personnel from the State of Ohio report that compliance with section 427  		regulations is never clear, and that during section 427 reviews the State's  		degree of compliance (and therefore the amount of its title IV-B disallowance)  		isn't so much determined, as it is negotiated. In addition, State personnel  		claim that what is allowed, and what isn't, is not predictable from  		review-to-review. Specific section 427 compliance regulations have been  		developed by HHS, but they were not approved because OMB determined the  		allowable miss rate to be too high (see <a href="frfoscar.htm#appendA">Appendix A</a>).  		</p>
<p>In general, it is widely felt that the current section 427 review  		process is not as effective as it could be. During the next legislative session  		proposals to make substantive changes to these reviews may be advanced. It is  		the contention of some legislative staff members that the information currently  		collected is overwhelmingly quantitative in nature and is predominantly  		collected in checklist form. In addition, State personnel felt it would be much  		more helpful if they were able to hold frank, qualitatively-oriented  		discussions about their state's foster care system concerning its strengths and  		weaknesses, and develop strategies for improvement in a cooperative manner. In  		terms of service delivery they assert such an orientation would be much more  		effective than the current interaction which doesn't always determine the real  		strengths and weaknesses of a State's foster care system. However, HHS staff  		assert that qualitative criteria are difficult to interpret and enforce, and  		often lead to similar disputes between Federal and State reviewers. </p>
<p><i><b>Conclusion: </b></i></p>
<p>HHS should focus on three issues in this area. First, the Department  		should determine if it is possible for HDS to get current on its backlog of  		section 427 reviews. Second, HDS should take the initiative on developing  		detailed, comprehensive regulations to guide these reviews by re-proposing the  		original guidelines to OMB. Third, HDS should solicit suggestions on improving  		the current review system from State personnel during these reviews, and  		determine if their comments are implementable. </p>
<h3>ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS:</h3>
<p>Children and youth advocacy organizations (which for this paper include  		public interest groups as well) have both short-term and long-term goals. In  		the short-term they advocate increased Federal funding of the foster care  		system, the retention of title IV-E as an open-ended entitlement, and the  		expansion of allowable Federally-matched title IV-E administrative and training  		expenses to include costs incurred by foster care parents who require  		additional training to care for and/or adopt special needs children. However  		advocacy organizations tend to view these measures as incremental, stop-gap  		adjustments to a well-intentioned (but flawed) system in need of comprehensive  		overhaul. It was repeatedly expressed in interviews that the problems with the  		current foster care system are substantive proof of the need to develop a  		comprehensive child welfare system which places an increased emphasis on  		services to prevent family dysfunction. Ideally, in the long-term foster care  		would be only a part of this system. In addition, some key members of Congress  		favor the implementation of such a child welfare system. </p>
<p><i><b>1. Increased Funding of Titles IV-B and XX:</b></i></p>
<p>As <a href="frfoscar.htm#table3">Table 3</a> shows, Federal appropriations for title  		IV-B are not equivalent to the amounts that were authorized when PL 96-272 was  		passed. Advocacy groups in particular anticipated that the level of  		Congressional appropriation would be a closer approximation of the amount  		initially authorized. However, not only did appropriations slightly decline  		from FY 1985 to 1986, but appropriated FY 1988 funding levels have still not  		reached an amount that was authorized for FY 1985. Advocates assert that title  		IV-B components function imperfectly because they were only fully funded in FY  		1981. Other issue participants assert that it was never the intent that the  		amount appropriated should equal the amount authorized. They portray the title  		IV-B full authorization levels as simply the point at which title IV-E  		expenditures are capped. </p>
<p>However, during the coming legislative session children and youth  		advocacy organizations will undoubtedly lobby for increased Federal title IV-B  		appropriations. In addition, undoubtedly these organizations will continue  		their support of an increased Federal title XX appropriation which is used to  		varying degrees by the States to fund their foster care systems. </p>
<p><i><b>2. Retention of title IV-E as an Entitlement Program: </b></i></p>
<p>All representatives of advocacy organizations interviewed expressed  		skepticism of any HHS proposal which would seek to contain foster care  		administrative and training costs by changing the entitlement nature of title  		IV-E in any way. These groups assert that the implementation of such a change  		would work to the detriment of children in foster care. In addition, it was  		repeatedly argued that the current foster care system is underfunded by the  		Federal government, and that the administrative and training costs of title  		IV-E fund a host of activities not covered by other welfare programs. Those  		interviewed conclude that the intent of PL 96-272 was to decrease the foster  		care caseload by providing additional services covered by title IV-E  		administrative and training funds. </p>
<p>Rather than capping allowable title IV-E administrative and training  		expenditures, in general advocates favor expanding its coverage to include the  		training of foster--and adoptive--parents who care for special needs children.  		In fact, several advocates favor expanding title IV-E administrative and  		training expenditures to include foster children currently covered only by  		title IV-B Federal appropriations. Additionally, the HITS cost containment  		proposal is not a high priority of key house staff members among the  		legislative staff interviewed. Therefore, the future of this proposal that was  		discussed earlier is uncertain. </p>
<p><i><b>3. Expansion of Allowable title IV-E Administrative and. Training  		Costs: </b></i></p>
<p>As was mentioned above, in the coming legislative session advocacy  		organizations may lobby for the expansion of Federally-matched title IV-E  		expenses to cover the training costs faced by foster care parents that care for  		and/or adopt special needs children (see <a href="frfoscar.htm#appendA">Appendix A</a> for  		a listing of covered administrative and training costs). Cases of neglect have  		been documented in which such parents were vastly under-prepared for the  		responsibilities associated with the adoption of a special needs child. </p>
<p>A closely related problem is foster care recidivism, caused by children  		re-entering the system after they have exited. Primarily this occurs because  		family reunification does not work, or--if the child is adopted--because the  		adoptive family is no longer able to care for the child who often has many  		physical and/or psychological disabilities. According to VCIS data, the  		re-entry rate of foster care children has risen since PL 96-272 was  		implemented. In 1983 16% of the caseload entering that year had previously been  		in foster care. This same percentage rose to 29% in 1984, and 30% in 1985. The  		reasons for foster care recidivism have not been studied at a Federal level in  		detail, and it is not known to what extent recidivism results from an  		over-reliance on family re-unification, or the inadequate training of adoptive  		parents caring for special needs children. </p>
<p>According to State personnel in Ohio, there have been a number of cases  		in which families have been overwhelmed by the demands placed on them by  		special needs children a number of years after they are adopted. In such cases  		these now-adolescent children re-enter the foster care system. However, their  		title IV-E eligibility is no longer determined on the basis of their original  		family's income, but rather on their present adoptive family's income, even if  		these children still exhibit the special needs precipitating the labeling (such  		as ethnicity or disabilities--see <a href="frfoscar.htm#appendA">Appendix A</a>).  		Therefore, the child returning to the foster care system is no longer eligible  		for title IV-E funding, and his or her adoptive or foster parents would not  		receive this subsidy. The Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) is aware of  		this dilemma and has stated that one method of alleviating this problem would  		be to expand title IV-E eligibility by basing a child's eligibility solely on  		the original family's income, and the child's special needs condition. </p>
<p><i><b>4. Enhanced Federal Support of Programs to Prevent Family  		Dysfunction: </b></i></p>
<p>The intent of PL 96-272 was to provide Federal funding and oversight to  		insure permanency planning; that children did not languish in the foster care  		system unnecessarily. Primarily this intent has been met with a conservative  		interpretation of the legal reasons which warrant the removal of children from  		the home, and enhancing efforts to re-unite foster children with their original  		parents as soon as possible if removal does take place. </p>
<p>Advocacy groups state that although many small innovative programs  		throughout the country are providing family dysfunction preventative services  		(such as counseling to families that are especially at-risk of breaking down)  		such preventative services have not been institutionalized at a Federal level  		in legislation, or in appropriations ear-marked for this purpose. Examples of  		such programs include Homebuilders, HELP, and Project SAFE of Youth Services  		Inc. Children and youth advocates agree that an enhanced Federal emphasis  		should be placed on children before their family's environment deteriorates to  		the point where they are forced to enter out-of-home care. </p>
<p>In an attempt to alleviate family dysfunction, for the past several  		years CWLA has convened a group of approximately 20 agencies called the Family  		Preservation Network. Funded by a grant from the Edna McConnell Clark  		Foundation, the purpose of the network is to identify and develop strategies of  		effective crises intervention to be provided when a child is at imminent risk  		of removal from the home. Their programmatic conclusions are listed in this  		section under the "Substitute Care Placement Prevention" priority issue of the  		Department of Health and Human Services discussed earlier in this section. </p>
<p>Such efforts represent an attempt to identify, study, and implement  		effective preventative measures. Advocacy organizations are expected to lobby  		that in the long-run such efforts receive Federal support and/or oversight.  		However, it should be noted that several minority legislative staff expressed  		skepticism that preventative measures can work effectively. In addition, some  		fear that such efforts may not adequately protect children that need to be  		removed from their home environment. </p>
<p><i><b>5. Support for Comprehensive Child Welfare Pilot Programs:  		</b></i></p>
<p>In the long-run advocacy groups view the perceived shortcomings of the  		current foster care system as symptomatic of problems that are inherent to a  		child welfare "non-system" in which a number of child welfare subsystems  		(including foster care) work in isolation from each other. For instance these  		groups charge that the juvenile justice, mental health, developmental  		disabilities, and educational systems do not work in tandem, but often even  		operate in a manner which is detrimental to the child being served. Instead  		advocates argue that such systems need to be reorganized so that they become  		subsystems of a larger, comprehensive child welfare system. Such a system would  		involve the collaboration of service systems that currently operate in  		isolation from each other. </p>
<p>Although representatives from the advocacy organizations interviewed did  		not identify an existing program that could serve as a prototype, one such  		attempt to pilot a collaborative child welfare system has been undertaken by  		the Annie E. Casey Foundation. The New Futures program will involve substantial  		Foundation investment and will operate up to five years in five localities,  		including Prince George's county in Maryland. Efforts will be made in each of  		these localities to provide a common access point for at-risk youth and their  		families. A social worker will be assigned to each case to act as an advocate  		and to garner the needed resources and services for the youth. </p>
<p>Recently the Governor of Maryland, William Donald Schafer, announced  		that the State was awarded a five-year, $7.5 million grant from the Foundation  		to improve family and children's services. To date Maryland and North Dakota  		are the only two States to receive this grant. The grant will support a  		demonstration interagency service delivery system for 200 underserved families  		in a targeted section of Prince George's County. Specifically the Secretary of  		the Maryland Department of Human Resources reports that efforts are being made  		to link the juvenile justice, education, and developmental disabilities systems  		into one comprehensive system. This child welfare system would necessitate the  		support of differing levels of government. Children and youth advocacy  		organizations envision the eventual implementation of such a child welfare  		system nationwide. They plan to monitor pilot efforts in this area, and develop  		effective ways in which the implementation of such a system at a Federal level  		might be advocated. </p>
<h2><a name="major" id="major">VI. MAJOR ISSUES FACING THE INCOMING  		ADMINISTRATION</a></h2>
<h3>Immediate Action:</h3>
<p>Initially the administration will be directly involved in two foster  		care issues during the current legislative session. These include the title  		IV-E cost containment proposal, and the development of the mandatory adoption  		and foster care data collection system. The cost containment proposal has been  		resubmitted to Congress for legislative approval as part of the Reagan  		administration's HHS FY 1990 budgetary proposal, however it is not included in  		the Bush administration's budget. Currently it is expected that advocacy groups  		will oppose the measure, and that key legislative staff will not place a high  		priority on the measure. </p>
<p>In addition, the development of the data collection system will be a  		major task facing the incoming Administration. The debate surrounding the  		inclusion of certain data elements will center directly on the appropriate  		Federal oversight role in foster care. Congressional pressure on the Federal  		government to assume a more aggressive role results from perceived inadequacies  		with the current foster care system. Presuming the proposed system is approved  		the implementation of the data collection system will be a longer-term  		administrative undertaking. </p>
<p>Due to public and legislative concern with the foster care system it is  		recommended that HHS focus on two issues involving title IV-B section 427  		reviews. First, the Department should determine if it is possible for HDS to  		get current on its backlog of section 427 reviews. Second, HDS might take the  		initiative on developing detailed, comprehensive regulations to guide these  		reviews by re-proposing the original guidelines to OMB. This proposal could  		clearly specify the reasons that a certain allowable State miss rate is  		necessary. Legislative staff have stated that the Department will regain some  		of the stature it lost during the joint House hearings if it takes these steps.  		</p>
<h3>Intermediate Action:</h3>
<p>Issues of secondary importance are decisions concerning the Federal  		commitment to the Independent Living Program, the expansion of title IV-E  		expenses to cover the training of special needs foster--and adoptive--parents,  		and the retention of title IV-E eligibility of special needs children despite  		the failure of their foster--or adoptive--placement. </p>
<p>In the past--over the objections of the Administration--Congress has  		continued funding the ILP. In addition, the HHS Secretary's ILP Report to  		Congress does not mandate the collection of data requested by Congress. This,  		the recent expansion of the program, and the straight-line yearly  		appropriations that have continued since the program's inception in FY 1987  		will undoubtedly intensify the debate concerning the Federal commitment in this  		area. The incoming administration must decide if it will alter its commitment  		to the program. </p>
<p>During the legislative session advocacy organizations may lobby for the  		expansion of Federally-matched title IV-E expenses to cover the training costs  		faced by foster care parents that care for and/or adopt special needs children.  		Cases of neglect have been documented in which such parents were vastly  		under-prepared for the responsibilities associated with the adoption of a  		special needs child. Given the current nature of title IV-E (to insure that  		incentives exist to adopt such children), and the fact that the successful  		adoption of these children seems to be an administrative priority, seems to  		make this an area in which the Federal government should review its current  		policy. </p>
<p>Finally, the incoming Administration should review the situation in  		which title IV-E adoptive children lose their eligibility if they re-enter  		foster care because their adoptive parents decide they are no longer able to  		care for them. Presuming that the factors which precipitated their  		classification continue throughout their childhood, it seems they should not  		lose this eligibility. </p>
<h3>Long-Term Action:</h3>
<p>Throughout the next four years the Administration should assess the  		impact that a number of growing social problems will have on the foster care  		system, as well as the increasing number of substantiated child abuse cases. In  		addition strategies for improving the supply of foster parents and/or child  		welfare workers should be proposed, and the effect of certain preventative  		programs on family dysfunction should be studied and their replication should  		be advocated. Lastly the current orientation of the current child welfare  		system should be re-considered. </p>
<p>In the near future the administration needs to plan their strategy to  		address the significant impact that the current drug epidemic, the AIDS virus,  		and family homelessness will have on the foster care system. In many States  		existing foster care is under-equipped to address the special needs of the  		growing number of children that will enter the system as a result of these  		problems, and as a result of abuse and neglect. Therefore the appropriate  		Federal role in these problems needs to be delineated. </p>
<p>Proposals should also be developed to increase the supply of foster  		parents, which has dwindled in recent years. The incoming administration should  		also determine if the Federal government can assist localities in enhancing the  		child welfare profession to attract more child welfare professionals. </p>
<p>Although many small innovative programs throughout the country are  		providing family dysfunction preventative services (such as counseling to  		families that are especially at-risk of dysfunction) such preventative services  		have not been a priority of Federal child welfare appropriations. Children and  		youth advocates agree that increased Federal emphasis should be placed on  		families before they deteriorate to the point where their children are forced  		to enter out-of-home care. Because of some promising preliminary findings, the  		effectiveness of such services should be studied by the Department. As a  		continuing policy the administration should encourage the replication of those  		pilot programs it deems successful. </p>
<p>Finally, the administration should re-think the current child welfare  		system. In the long-run children and families might be better-served by a  		system in which juvenile justice, mental health, developmental disabilities,  		and educational sub-systems worked in tandem and not in isolation. The  		administration should consider making this a long-term evolutionary goal of the  		child welfare system. Continuing, marginal movements in this direction could be  		encouraged. </p>
<h2><a name="appendA" id="appendA">APPENDIX A. PUBLIC LAW 96-272, RECENT MODIFICATIONS,  		AND THE INDEPENDENT LIVING PROGRAM</a></h2>
<p>Public Law 96-272 consolidated Federal foster care authorities in  		several titles of the Social Security Act, simultaneously increasing the amount  		of Federal foster care matching funds available to States. Some of the more  		important modifications to the system in existence prior to 1980 were the:</p>
<ul><li>inclusion of certain Federally-mandated protections for children in  		  foster care, tied directly to part of each State's title IV-B Child Welfare  		  Services funding;</li>
<li>transfer of the foster care program provisions existing in the title  		  IV-A AFDC program to a newly-created title IV-E of the Social Security  		  Act;</li>
<li>establishment of an adoption assistance program for AFDC children  		  with special needs in title IV-E. </li>
</ul><p>Additionally, in 1986 an Independent Living Program was established to  		provide older foster care children in the process of emancipation from the  		system with services to assist them in an effective transition to independent  		adulthood. </p>
<h3>Title IV-B:</h3>
<p>Although it was amended by PL 96-272, some form of the child welfare  		services--currently contained in title IV-B--have been a part of the Social  		Security Act since its inception in 1935. These funds cover a broad range of  		preventative and protective services to abused, neglected, and exploited  		children. Appropriations also provide for the needs of all children placed in  		the foster care system. </p>
<p>Title IV-B is a formula grant program. Each State is allotted its  		proportionate share of title IV-B appropriations. The Federal government  		reimburses 75% of a State's qualifying foster care expenses up to this allotted  		total. </p>
<p>Although the programmatic administration of foster care is the  		responsibility of each State, section 427 of title IV-B provides Federal  		oversight in the form of administrative reviews. The reviews, which encompass  		all of the children in a selected State's public foster care system, are  		conducted by Federal employees in conjunction with State personnel. </p>
<p>This review process includes the determination of whether a State  		has:</p>
<ul><li>conducted an inventory of the children in foster care;</li>
<li>implemented a statewide information tracking system for each  		  child;</li>
<li>implemented a review system that includes a case review every six  		  months, and a judicial review within six months of placement into the  		  system;</li>
<li>implemented a service program to place children back into their home,  		  or into an adoptive home. </li>
</ul><p>Although this language is included in the authorizing statute, the above  		points have not been elaborated in specific regulations. Therefore they serve  		simply as HDS guidelines during the review process. Although specific  		regulations were developed by HHS they were not cleared by the Office of  		Management and Budget --and were therefore not published--because OMB asserted  		that the proposed allowable "miss rate" (cases in which States did not meet the  		above criteria) was too high. The absence of implemented regulations may be  		causing some friction between the Department and State agencies responsible for  		administering the legislation. </p>
<p>Depending on the degree of a State's compliance with these objectives,  		it is awarded its allotment of Federal funds minus any disallowances it  		receives. In FY 1988 the amount that could be disallowed States was $98 million  		of the total $239 million title IV-B Federal appropriation. Since the reviews  		were instituted in FY 1982, a cumulative total of approximately $13.4 million  		has been disallowed States. </p>
<p>Each State is to be reviewed by HDS for the first two years that they  		utilize their allotment of the $98 million that causes them to be eligible for  		review. Subsequent reviews are to take place every third year. The miss rate  		allowed to each State declines with each subsequent section 427 review in which  		it participates, but never reaches 0% as OMB stipulates is appropriate. This  		stalemate concerning the appropriate rate of allowable error continues between  		the Department and OMB. </p>
<p>Currently all States except Massachusetts, Wyoming, and Puerto Rico have  		elected to utilize the portion of title IV-B funds subject to Federal  		disallowances, thereby becoming eligible for section 427 reviews. From FY 1982  		to FY 1987, the Office of Human Development Services (HDS) conducted 152 such  		reviews and determined that in all but 25 instances (16%) the States met an  		allowable level of service effort. The States which did completely fail the  		review did so primarily because of the untimeliness with which periodic case  		reviews and judicial dispositional hearings were conducted for foster care  		children. </p>
<h3>Title IV-E:</h3>
<p>Unlike the formula grant title IV-B, title IV-E is an open-ended Federal  		entitlement which provides a State for a portion of the direct services and  		administrative expenses of each foster child originating from a family eligible  		for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) residing in licensed or  		approved foster care homes or institutions. In addition, title IV-E authorizes  		the adoption assistance payments of foster children originating from  		Supplemental Security Income (SSI) eligible families. As of FY 1985, such  		Federal appropriations provided funding to an average of 39.2% of the children  		in foster care. Thus, while title IV-B funds can be utilized by all children in  		need of child welfare services, title IV-E funds can only be utilized by those  		who are categorically eligible. The program has two primary components:</p>
<ul><li>Foster Care Maintenance payments;</li>
<li>Adoption Assistance payments for "special needs" children. </li>
</ul><p>The first component is the foster care Federal authorization that  		existed in the AFDC program prior to 1980. First authorized in 1961, foster  		care maintenance payments reimburse each State's proportional cost at its  		Medicaid match rate (which can vary from 50% to 83%) for income-eligible foster  		children. Fifty percent of the State administrative cost for both foster care  		maintenance payments, and adoption assistance payments is paid by the Federal  		government, as is 75% of the cost for training State workers to administer both  		of these programs. </p>
<p>The second component--adoption assistance payments--reimburses a State  		at the Medicaid match rate for the subsidy given parents that adopt AFDC and/or  		SSI children eligible that also have special needs. A state determines that  		these adoptive children have "special needs" if they are one of the  		following:</p>
<ul><li>ethnic minorities;</li>
<li>older children (adolescents);</li>
<li>medically impaired;</li>
<li>physically disabled;</li>
<li>mentally disabled or retarded;</li>
<li>emotionally disturbed or maladjusted. </li>
</ul><p>In FY 1987, adoption assistance payments were made for an average of  		31,000 special needs children per month at an estimated total Federal cost of  		$71.6 million. When the program began in FY 1981, such Federal expenditures  		totaled less than $500,000 for that year. </p>
<p>Following the passage of PL 96-272 States became more proficient at  		shifting more child welfare system costs to the Federal government by charging  		the costs of foster care services arguably covered by the Federal government.  		Over time States became more knowledgeable of expenses allowed under title  		IV-E. Therefore administrative program costs increased exponentially. This cost  		increase took place (see <a href="frfoscar.htm#table1">table 1</a>) even as both the number  		of children in foster care, and their length of time in the system declined  		(see <a href="frfoscar.htm#table2">table 2</a>). </p>
<p>In response, HHS instituted title IV-E fiscal reviews to determine if  		appropriate foster care maintenance and adoption assistance payments, are being  		made to States on behalf of eligible children, and if they are paid to eligible  		foster homes and institutions meeting licensing standards. There are two stages  		to the review. Stage I consists of a review of 50 sampled payments in a  		selected State. If it is determined that the number of payments made in error  		exceeds 10t, the second stage of the review is conducted. Stage II requires the  		sampling of an additional 150 to 250 randomly selected payments. The results of  		the two stages are added together, and the combined total is used to  		extrapolate the total disallowance for the State. </p>
<p>As a result of these fiscal reviews, disallowances totaling over $3  		million have been assessed against 26 States, and over $16 million in  		disallowances is currently pending. Most disallowances result because foster  		children claimed under title IV-E are determined to be income-ineligible, or  		because they have not been properly removed from their homes according to  		statutory requirements. </p>
<p>Title IV-E continues to be fine-tuned as a result of recent changes in  		the tax law. On April 14, 1988 HHS published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  		(NPRM) that would amend title IV-E to require States to reimburse parents for  		up to $2,000 of the nonrecurring expenses associated with adopting a special  		needs child. Nonrecurring expenses are "reasonable and necessary" adoption  		fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other expenses that are directly related  		to the legal adoption of a special needs child. Fifty percent of the costs  		incurred by States are covered by Federal matching funds as an administrative  		cost of title IV-E. Previously these expenses had been allowable tax deduction  		on the adoptive parents' income tax form as President Bush has re-proposed.  		</p>
<h3>Independent Living Program:</h3>
<p>One final programmatic element of the foster care system is the  		Independent Living Program (ILP), which was enacted on April 7, 1986 as a part  		of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (PL 99-272). An  		annual amount of $45 million was appropriated in FY 1987 and in FY 1988, to  		provide States with the resources to establish and implement services to assist  		AFDC eligible children age 16 and over make the transition from foster care to  		successful independent living at the age of 18. No state matching funds are  		required for the program. </p>
<p>Congressional passage of the ILP was precipitated by a class action  		lawsuit against the State of New York in which the plaintiffs' claim that the  		State was not adequately preparing foster care children for their emancipation  		was upheld. An HHS report to Congress on this program found that prior to the  		implementation of the ILP, 25 States provided some form of basic living skills  		training. Currently all 50 States are developing such programs for foster care  		children. In 18 of these States educational initiatives are being developed,  		and 15 other States are developing employment initiatives. </p>
<p>Approximately 40% of the children in foster care are adolescents. A 1981  		study by Hornby and Collins estimated that fewer than 20% of foster care  		adolescents will be re-unified with their parents, and that fewer than 1-in-20  		is likely to be adopted. In FY 1985, 8% (approximately 14,208) of the 177,602  		children that left foster care reached the age of 18, or were otherwise  		emancipated from the system. According to a 1985 American Public Welfare  		Association (APWA) report, fewer than one-half of these youth received ILP  		services, which targeted over 20,000 foster care children in FY 1987. </p>
<p>In a paper entitled "Trends and Needs in Programming for Independent  		Living," WESTAT Inc. research analyst Ronna J. Cook states that: </p>
<blockquote><p>"because [foster care] agencies are oriented towards protection and  		  care, recommendations and decisions about youths' needs are generally made at  		  an administrative level and through interagency agreements. This creates an  		  environment in which adolescents perceive themselves as having diminished  		  control over their lives, lessening the opportunity for them to learn skills  		  necessary for daily living...Unfortunately, most youth in the foster care  		  system do not have the option of remaining in a protected family environment  		  until they are ready and able to live independently of a family support  		  structure...this situation is compounded by past rejections, unstable  		  placements, and poor interpersonal relationships." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently the ILP has been reauthorized, and the scope of its program  		components have been expanded. Following the October 21, 1988 legislative  		passage of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (HR 4333) PL  		100-647 was enacted. The law's provisions regarding the ILP include the  		following:</p>
<ul><li>extension of the authorization of the ILP through FY 1989 at $45  		  million;</li>
<li>permission for States to provide ILP services to non-title IV-E  		  eligible foster youth over the age of 16;</li>
<li>permission for States to provide these services up to six months  		  after youth are emancipated from foster care. </li>
