<hr /><h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>
<p>As life expectancy at older ages increases, the United States and other  		developed countries are experiencing what Olshansky and Ault (1986) term the  		fourth stage of the epidemiologic transition, the "age of delayed degenerative  		diseases." Accordingly, the organization and financing of long-term care for  		the elderly is becoming a priority issue for health policyrnakers. This article  		is based on the findings of a 1986 cross-national study of long-term care  		policies by the Health Care Financing Administration for the Permanent  		Committee on Medical Care and Sickness Insurance of the International Social  		Security Association (ISSA), supplemented by more recent research for the  		Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). </p>
<h2>METHODOLOGY AND ISSUES </h2>
<p>A questionnaire was sent to ISSA member organizations concerned with the  		financing of health services in their respective countries. Data obtained from  		the replies were supplemented with data from published sources, including  		government statistics and reports obtained from a network of contacts in the  		various countries. </p>
<p>The questionnaire was distributed in October 1984 to ISSA member  		organizations in 27 countries, covering all regions of the world and including  		less developed as well as more developed countries. The 18 replies received  		were primarily from the more developed countries. Great Britain did not  		participate in the original ISSA survey (and therefore is not included in some  		of the comparative tables presented, but it was included in subsequent research  		for OECD that focused on long-term care financing policies. </p>
<p>Analysis of the questionnaire replies and supplemental material covered  		a wide variety of issues, not all of which will be discussed. The focus of this  		article is on what was learned with respect cross-national variations in  		elderly institutionalization rates. These differential patterns of  		institutional use are of particular interest because the most frequently cited  		long-term care policy concern in most of the countries surveyed was the high  		cost of institutional services. In addition, most of the advanced industrial  		countries surveyed considered their institutional long-term care use rates to  		be higher than necessary or desirable. Most also reported pursuing deliberate  		policies to expand home- and community-based long-term care services as a means  		of reducing institutional use. </p>
<h2>COMPARATIVE INSTITUTIONALIZATION RATES </h2>
<p>Institutionalization refers to extended stays in any type of inpatient  		facility or residential care setting. Nearly all the advanced industrial  		countries judged their elderly institutionalization rates to be too high.  		However, the actual reported institutionalization rates in these countries  		varied considerably--from a low of 3.6-4.5 percent in the Federal Republic of  		Germany (FRG) to more than double that rate at 8.7-10.5 percent in Sweden and  		10.9 percent in The Netherlands. </p>
<h2>DEFINITIONAL ISSUES </h2>
<p>The questionnaire asked ISSA member agencies to report use rates among  		the elderly population (those 65 years of age or over) for long-term care in  		medically oriented residential facilities (e.g., chronic-care hospitals,  		geriatric wings of acute care hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation  		hospitals) and nonmedical residential facilities (e.g., homes for the aged,  		frail ambulant homes, personal care homes, board and care homes). In addition,  		the questionnaire asked for use rates for the following: </p>
<ul><li>Other sheltered living arrangements (e.g., foster care or  		  family-style living arrangements with nonrelatives who are paid to provide such  		  services, and small group-shared housing for the elderly). </li>
<li>Subsidized housing for the disabled elderly (e.g., apartment  		  complexes with special services or design features). </li>
<li>Professional nursing and therapy services at home (provided by  		  licensed or certified nurses and therapists specializing in physical, speech,  		  or occupational therapy). </li>
<li>Nonprofessional nursing services at home (aides who help with  		  bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, mobility, or who provide day or night  		  sitting services). </li>
<li>Homemaker or chore services (help with shopping, cooking, cleaning,  		  laundry, and errands). </li>
<li>Day care for the elderly (day program of social and/or medical  		  services). </li>
<li>Meals (e.g., meals delivered to the elderly person's home or in a  		  readily accessible central location). </li>
</ul><p>Most countries were able to supply institutional use rates, but only a  		few countries were able to supply rates of use for noninstitutional services.  		Only for Australia, Israel, France, The Netherlands, Sweden, and New Zealand  		(and in later research, for Britain), was it possible to obtain reasonably  		up-to-date national measures of use rates for nonmedical long-term care  		services (principally, homemaker or chore services). </p>
<p>The questionnaire defined institutionalization in terms of generic  		facility categories (i.e., medically oriented versus nonmedical residential  		care) and presented examples of what such facilities might be called. This was  		done because an initial literature review and discussions with experts on  		particular countries had revealed a wide variety of terminology used to label  		long-term care institutions. It quickly became apparent that a question about  		nursing home use, for example, could produce misleading results. In many  		countries, this term is not used to characterize long-term care facilities for  		the elderly or has a much more limited meaning than it does in the United  		States. In Britain, for example, the term "nursing home" is only used to refer  		to freestanding, private proprietary facilities of which, until quite recently,  		there were still very few. Thus, a British reply to a question about nursing  		home use would exclude information about hospital-based long-term care provided  		in geriatric wards of National Health Service hospitals or care provided in  		"local authority" homes for the aged. </p>
<p>Indeed, an analysis of the various terms used to describe long-term care  		facilities and the reality that lies behind these labels reveals much about the  		changing nature of long-term care as a distinct service. To get a sense of the  		evolution of long-term care policy both within and across countries, one must  		understand what different types of facilities are called in a given country,  		whether their names reflect the type of care they provide now or the type of  		care they provided in the past, and how the balance of care provided in  		different types of institutional settings has shifted. It is through this type  		of analysis, that one comes to understand that Belgian "rest homes" are no  		longer purely residential facilities as the name would imply; but, through a  		deliberate policy referred to as "medicalization," they are being converted  		into facilities similar to what we in the United States would call nursing  		homes. </p>
<p>The questionnaire also sought to uncover hidden forms of  		institutionalization by asking questions about the use of mental hospitals for  		long-term care of the elderly (especially elderly suffering from dementia  		disorders) and about the unintended use of acute care hospital beds for  		long-term care. It is important to distinguish between care provided in  		hospital-based long-term care facilities and long-term care that is provided in  		general hospitals simply because there is no place for an older person in need  		of long-term care to go following an acute episode. The former is a deliberate  		component of the long-term care delivery system; the latter is a problem  		arising out of the health-care system's failure to address explicitly the  		long-term care needs of the elderly. Both Britain and the FRG are quite  		concerned about such inappropriate use of hospitals for long-term care. The  		problem appears particularly severe in Britain, where so-called bed blockage by  		the elderly is blamed for limiting the access of younger patients to hospital  		care. In particular, it is said to cause excessively long waiting times for  		elective surgical procedures. A still different situation is represented by  		Japan. Until very recently, when concerns about rising hospital costs began to  		emerge, the difference between acute care and long-term care had not been  		considered particularly significant. Neither policymakers nor practitioners  		thought it important to ensure that only acute illnesses were treated in the  		hospital and long-term care needs met in separate settings. </p>
<p>The role of the hospital and the mental hospital in long-term care is an  		important question, again, for understanding how the nature of the medical,  		social, and other care needs of the elderly have been and continue to be  		redefined. Analysis of historical institutionalization rates of the elderly in  		the United States, for example, show a very different pattern if one looks at  		nursing home use in the broader context of changing use rates for mental  		hospitals, county homes for the aged, and retirement hotels. (Office of the  		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, 1981). An examination of  		nursing home use alone gives the erroneous impression that institutionalization  		of the elderly rose dramatically during the 1950's and after 1965 with the  		passage of Medicaid. If one looks at the broader pattern of  		institutionalization of the elderly, however, it becomes clear that (with the  		exception of the elderly 85 years of age or over among whom actual rates of  		institutional use did increase) institutionalization of the elderly did not  		increase with the passage of Medicaid. Rather, what actually occurred was a  		massive shift in the types of institutions in which the elderly were to be  		found--a shift away from State mental hospitals as well as religious or  		county-run homes for the aged that provided little medical or nursing care  		toward the use of private for-profit or nonprofit nursing homes that conformed  		to a medical model of institutional long-term care. At the same time, the  		declining availability of retirement hotels since the 1950's decreased the  		supply of sheltered housing alternatives available to low-income, frail elderly  		not in need of medical or nursing services. </p>
<p>Given the current emphasis on alternatives to institutionalization for  		the elderly as a policy goal in most developed countries, it is especially  		important to capture--insofar as possible--the full range of institutions and  		sheltered housing arrangements that provide long-term care to the elderly. From  		this, it can be determined whether institutionalization is actually on the  		decline or whether one type of institution is declining only to be replaced by  		another as the nature of the long-term care needs of the elderly are redefined.  		</p>
<p>For all the countries included in the study, data were requested that  		would permit the computation of a global institutionalization rate that  		included all major institutional settings. For some countries, the  		questionnaire reply supplied reasonably complete data on the full range of  		institutional settings. In other cases, it was possible to fill in the gaps in  		the questionnaire reply from other sources. In a few cases, most notably the  		Federal Republic of Germany, the data supplied were incomplete and/or not up to  		date. Where different sources of data on institutionalization rates cite  		different figures, a country's institutionalization rate is given as a range  		between the highest and lowest reported figures. </p>
<h2>EXPLAINING VARIATION IN INSTITUTIONALIZATION RATES </h2>
<p>The study sought to gauge how much of the variation in reported  		cross-national institutionalization rites can be attributed to demographic  		factors such as population age or sex structure (that is older and more heavily  		female populations). This was done by projecting the institutional use rate of  		the elderly 65 years of age or over for each country as if its age- and  		sex-specific institutional use rates were the same as those in the United  		States as measured by the National Center for Health Statistics (1979). This  		procedure, in effect, adjusts elderly medical institutional use rates for  		cross-national differences in the age structure of the elderly population  		(i.e., relative proportion of the population 65 years of age or over that is in  		the age cohorts 65-69 years, 70-79 years, and 80 years of age or over) and for  		differences in male versus female longevity and use of services. </p>
<p>In projecting use rates for nonmedical institutions (variously known in  		the United States as personal care homes, domiciliary care facilities, and  		board and care homes), I was unfortunately hampered by the lack of an equally  		precise, reliable source of U.S. data as exists for nursing homes. Although I  		might have chosen to use age- and sex-specific rates for residence in  		nonmedical group quarters from the U.S. census, there is good reason to  		believe, based on other surveys, that census figures somewhat underestimate the  		percentages of U.S. elderly in nonmedical residential long-term care  		facilities. Accordingly, I have used the best estimates of the elderly 65 years  		of age or over in these facilities in 1980 derived from special studies  		(Sherwood, Mor, and Gutkin, 1981; Stone, 1984). These estimates are for the  		population 65 years of age or over as a whole; they are not age- or  		sex-specific. Then future projections were based on the ratio of residents in  		nonmedical facilities to residents in medical facilities (0.27). </p>
<p>Use of U.S. age- and sex-specific institutionalization rates as the  		comparison standard should not be interpreted as having normative significance.  		That is, I do not in any way mean to imply that other countries'  		institutionalization rates should be more like those of the United States. The  		study employed U.S. age- and sex-specific rates of nursing home use as the  		standard of comparison only because these rates were more readily available.  		</p>
<p>Two methodological points should be noted before moving to a discussion  		of the tables. First, for purposes of consistency, United Nations (U.N.)  		population figures have been used to make the projections. Use of U.N.  		population figures results in a slightly lower use rate for nursing homes in  		the United States than the official figures typically quoted in U.S.  		publications. U.S. Government reports typically round off the  		institutionalization rate found in the 1977 Nursing Home Survey (National  		Center for Health Statistics, 1979) to a flat 5 percent. More specialized  		publications present slightly varying figures, depending on the year being  		projected and whether or not projections forward from 1977 have been age  		adjusted only or also sex adjusted. Thus, Manton and Liu's (1984) age- and  		sex-adjusted projection for 1980 is 4.6 percent, whereas the U.S. Bureau of the  		Census (Taeuber, 1983) age-adjusted projection for 1982 is 4.9 percent. The  		United Nations' population figures for the United States used in this analysis  		yield a projected rate of 4.5 percent for 1980 because they slightly  		underestimate the numbers of elderly in older age cohorts, compared with the  		Social Security Administration's figures that Manton and Liu used in making  		their projection of institutionalization as of 1980. In addition, U.N.  		population figures do not disagregate age cohorts above 80 years of age. The  		institutionalization rate for the U.S. elderly in the age cohort 80-84 years is  		a little more than 10 percent--the institutionalization rate more than doubles  		to almost 24 percent among the elderly 85 years of age or over. Lack of age  		breakdowns for cohorts over 80 years of age in the U.N. population figures will  		likely result in some underestimating of the effects of population age  		structure on institutionalization rates in the following analysis. </p>
<p>The tables of cross-national projected institutional use rates, based on  		U.S. age- and sex-specific institutional rates, indicate that the differences  		in use rates that would be anticipated because certain countries have older,  		more female elderly populations are considerably less than the variations in  		actual use rates (Tables 1-3). As for 1980, only France and The Netherlands  		would be expected to have higher use rates of long-term care facilities based  		on population characteristics alone, although the differences (0.3 percent in  		the case of France) are minor. Only Costa Rica, Israel, and Japan would be  		expected to have more than negligibly lower institutional use rates based on  		elderly population characteristics (<a href="intpersp.htm#table1">Table 1</a>). By 1985,  		however, somewhat greater differences begin to appear, with Belgium, France,  		the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), and Switzerland showing increases in  		projected use rates of long-term care institutions that are more than slightly  		above U.S. rates because of population aging and greater proportions of elderly  		females (<a href="intpersp.htm#table2">Table 2</a>). </p>
<p>When the actual use rates reported for each country are compared with  		the projected use rates (<a href="intpersp.htm#table3">Table 3</a>), it appears that  		differences in age and sex population structure alone explain little of the  		variance. Population characteristics alone would suggest quite similar use  		rates for the United States, The Netherlands, and Sweden, yet both of these  		countries use institutional services at almost twice the rate of the United  		States. In The Netherlands, however, use of medical institutions is one-third  		less than the U.S. rate, and the use rate of nonmedical institutions is  		6½ times greater. The Swedish use rate of medical institutions is quite  		similar to the U.S. use rate of such facilities, but the Swedish use rate of  		nonmedical facilities is four to rive times as great as the U.S. rate. In  		contrast, the use rate of all long-term care institutions in the Federal  		Republic of Germany--but especially medical facilities--is considerably less  		than that in the United States, at least 20 percent less and perhaps as much as  		one-third less. </p>
<p>The institutionalization rate reported here for the FRG is the only rate  		in the study that I have reason to suspect represents significant  		underreporting. The questionnaire reply from the FRG indicates that as much as  		10 percent of acute hospital days represent inappropriate use of the hospital  		for long-term care. OECD (1985) data on average length of hospital stays  		further indicate that the average lengths of hospital stay in the FRG was--at  		18.4 days as of 1980--the highest among European countries and more than twice  		as high as the average length of stay in U.S. hospitals (7.3). In contrast to  		Japan, where an estimate (Ikegami, 1982) of the amount of long-term care  		provided in general hospitals was obtained, I was unable to factor this into  		the institutionalization rate for the FRG. </p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the use rates of long-term care facilities in the  		less industrialized countries of Costa Rica, Spain, and especially Argentina,  		Greece, and Turkey are considerably lower than the U.S. rate. Although  		population characteristics alone would make Costa Rica's actual use rate appear  		20 percent lower were it actually the same as the U.S. rate, it is, in fact,  		less than one-half the U.S. rate. Very little of the differences in  		institutional use rates among the United States, Greece, and Spain appear to be  		attributable to population characteristics. </p>
<p>In sum, relatively little of the cross-national variation in  		institutionalization rates can be explained by such demographic factors as the  		differential age and sex compositions of the elderly populations in different  		countries. It is important to bear in mind, however, that I was unable to  		obtain sufficient data to test the explanatory power of certain demographic  		variables that might prove to be more significant predictors of institutional  		use--in particular, differential rates of the never-married and childless  		elderly. Thus, according to Rosenwaike (1985), a cross-national comparison of  		marriage rates among women 85 years of age or over found that 21 percent in  		Sweden had never married, compared with 11 percent in France and 8 percent in  		the United States. It may be, for example, that the unusually high percentages  		of elderly Swedes who never married is a significant factor explaing why Sweden  		has such comparatively high use rates of institutional long-term care. If this  		is the case, then I would expect that, as future age cohorts with higher  		marriage rates reach the age when long-term care needs become prevalent,  		Sweden's institutional use rates will naturally decline, regardless of social  		policy efforts. </p>
<h2>REDEFINING CONCEPTS OF CARE </h2>
<p>Earlier, in the section on definitions, it was observed that attempts to  		arrive at standardized definitions of "institutional long-term care" both  		within and across countries can help reveal the evolution of long-term care  		policy. An earlier study by Project Hope (U.S. Senate, 1984) of comparative  		cross-national institutionalization rates noted the much higher use of  		nonmedical residential facilities in Europe, compared with the United States.  		The author interpreted this as an indication of the U.S. tendency to impose a  		medical institutional model on long-term care. The Project Hope study  		considered only medically oriented facilities as institutions and classified  		both the older (indeed "old-fashioned") nonmedical homes for the aged and the  		newer forms of sheltered housing (what the Europeans call "service flats" and  		we in the United States call "congregate care" or service-enriched senior  		citizen apartments) as group quarters. </p>
<p>The classification framework used in the present study was quite  		different because, in this author's view, it is important to look behind labels  		to see whether the care being provided in a given setting is actually medical  		or social and whether, in the particular country in question, a setting is  		considered to be institutional or noninstitutional. In the course of this  		study, it was often difficult to differentiate medically oriented from  		nonmedical residential long-term care settings. It was also difficult, in some  		instances, to decide which nonmedical residential facilities should be counted  		as institutions and which as sheltered housing. This was particularly the case  		for Sweden, where many elderly persons are being deinstitutionalized in place  		as older homes for the aged are converted into service flats with supportive  		services. Swedish officials insist that, unlike the older homes for the aged,  		the service flats are not institutions.<sup><font><a href="intpersp.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup> The distinction between institutional and  		noninstitutional housing often is a matter of interpretation. For example, the  		central office of a complex of service flats may be equipped with a lightboard  		so that the management can monitor the flushing of residents' toilets: Failure  		to record a toilet flush at least once per day triggers an investigatory visit  		to make sure that the resident is all right. One could question whether this  		sort of bureaucratic monitoring of intimate bodily functions is correctly  		classified as noninstitutional in character. Yet Swedish officials maintain  		that this system represents a much less obtrusive form of protective  		surveillance than the methods typically used to keep tabs on residents in  		institutional settings. Similarly, service flats with supportive services are  		not considered institutions because the providers of nursing, personal care,  		and homemaker or chore services do not work for the building management but  		rather are municipal employees whose service district for in-home care happens  		to be a particular building. </p>
<p>In grappling with these sorts of definitional problems, it became  		increasingly clear that they stemmed only in part from difficulties of distance  		and ambiguous or untrustworthy secondary data. Rather, the more fundamental  		problem is one of trying to classify phenomena in process of change. In many  		instances, facilities whose names suggest that they provide nonmedical care  		turned out either to have been deliberately medicalized in recent years  		(France, Belgium) or the literature on resident and/or staffing characteristics  		indicates that they have turned into de facto nursing homes because their  		populations have become more disabled and the facilities have been forced to  		respond by adding appropriate staff (FRG, Britain). A recurrent theme in the  		European literature is the problem of homes built to care for the independent  		elderly that are increasingly forced to cater to disabled populations without  		sufficient funds to provide needed nursing care. </p>
<p>Why European countries historically developed so many more nonmedical  		institutions than the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand is an  		issue the author does not have space to go into in detail here. A major factor  		was clearly Europe's older, less modem housing stock. Until quite recently,  		large numbers of elderly people in Europe, especially in rural areas, lived in  		housing without such things as running water, indoor plumbing, or modern  		bathing facilities. Moreover, in The Netherlands, during the post World War II  		period of severe housing shortages, government policy encouraged the elderly to  		move into homes for the aged to free up housing for young families. As housing  		in Europe has been modernized and the economic position of the elderly has  		improved, the need for purely residential institutions has greatly decreased.  		</p>
<p>Accordingly, the balance both of medical to nonmedical institutions and  		of nonmedical institutions to less institutional forms of sheltered housing is  		shifting. Increasingly, it appears that the low-income elderly who are still  		independent in activities of day living, though perhaps in need of help with  		instrumental activities of daily living, are residing in service flats and  		other sheltered housing arrangements rather than in nonmedical institutions.  		The movement to phaseout nonmedical institutions in favor of service flats has  		been particularly striking in Britain and, most recently, in Scandanavia. The  		medicalization of the institutional sector has been particularly strong in  		France, Belgium, and Great Britain. The net result is that, within the  		institutional sector of the advanced industrial countries, there is a growing  		emphasis on medically oriented facilities, which reflects the older, more  		functionally dependent populations in these countries. </p>
<p>In the less industrialized countries of Greece, Spain, Turkey,  		Argentina, and Costa Rica, long-term care institutions tend still to be largely  		nonmedically oriented and, indeed, often accept only the independent elderly.  		This then raises the question of where the chronically impaired elderly are  		receiving care. It is difficult to imagine that all the functionally impaired  		elderly who in the United States or The Netherlands or France would be in a  		nursing home or equivalent facility are being cared for at home by family  		members when institutions exist for the care of nonfunctionally impaired  		elderly. One hypothesis is that medically oriented long-term care of the  		elderly is not differentiated from acute inpatient care and that both types of  		care are provided in general hospitals (although care of the demented may be  		provided in mental hospitals). Data on length of stay in general hospitals  		collected by OECD (1985) indicate that average lengths of stay in Turkish and  		Greek hospitals are similar to that of the FRG (18 days). This would indicate  		that, as in Germany, there is more long-term care provided in hospitals than is  		typical of other European countries, but much less long-term care is provided  		in hospitals in Greece and Turkey than is the case in Japan. </p>
<h2>EVOLUTIONARY TRENDS </h2>
<p>Overall, the issues that emerged in the course of trying to define and  		measure use rates for institutional long-term care suggested that patterns of  		use of various kinds of institutions for long-term care should be viewed in a  		developmental perspective. In the past, efforts to interpret the rise of  		nursing homes and homes for the aged in a historical, developmental perspective  		emphasized the alleged breakdown of family structure and the social isolation  		of the elderly brought about by industrialization. Subsequent research on  		patterns of family caregiving in the industrialized countries have shown these  		interpretations to be, at best, greatly exaggerated (Shanas, 1979; Brody, 1985;  		Doty, 1986). That is, there is considerable evidence from research on family  		caregiving in the United States, Australia, and Europe, (e.g., Stone,  		Cafferata, and Sangi, 1986; Kendig and Rowland, 1983; Conférence des  		Ministres Européens chargés des Affaires Familiales, 1985) that  		informal caregiving remains at a very high level in industrialized countries.  		The perspective being suggested here is one that focuses rather on the  		evolution of health care policy and the organizational structure of the health  		services sector both in the light of each country's own individual history and  		relative, cross-national stage of development. </p>
<p>Medically oriented long-term care institutions, as distinct from  		residential homes for the aged, appear to arise within a country's health care  		system as hospitals develop more and more of a short-term, acute care versus  		chronic care focus, as hospitals become more specialized and more technology  		intensive; as hospital costs rise; and as the level of concern mounts in regard  		to the cost and health insurance financing implications of lengthy hospital  		stays. </p>
<p>Indeed, it appears that a prime force in the development of specialized  		medically oriented long-term care facilities has been the drive to cut hospital  		costs. This policy has been most explicitly pursued during the 1980's in  		Belgium and Great Britain. In most countries, hospital costs for the elderly  		are covered under public health insurance programs, whereas only in The  		Netherlands is nursing home care given anything approaching comparable  		coverage. Thus, a movement to create specialized medically oriented long-term  		care facilities to replace care given in geriatric or regular wards of  		hospitals or in mental hospitals can be a means to relieve rising costs  		experienced by the health care scheme if, as is typically the case, the health  		care scheme is not then given responsibility (or is given only very limited  		responsibility) for financing the costs of specialized medically oriented  		facilities. Conversely, a few countries--most notably the FRG and Japan--appear  		to have a higher political and economic tolerance for rising hospital costs  		than others. So long as this tolerance is sustained (there are indications that  		it is breaking down in Japan because of the rapid aging of the population), the  		drive to cut hospital lengths of stay and costs by banishing chronic care from  		the hospital setting is not as strongly in evidence as it is elsewhere. </p>
<h2>FINANCING MODES </h2>
<p>In the United States, health services analysts generally assume that use  		of medical services, including nursing homes, is strongly influenced by the  		availability of government financing. One might therefore theorize that higher  		use rates of long-term care institutions in some countries relative to others  		may be associated with more generous government financing in the countries with  		the higher use rates. Such a hypothesis would be in line with the widespread  		belief here in the United States that most other advanced industrial countries  		finance long-term care under their national health insurance programs. This  		would imply that, in other countries, long-term care is considered to be part  		of a broad entitlement to health care and that cost-sharing requirements are  		similar to what they arc for hospital and physician care. It was found in the  		present study, however, that most other countries do not cover long-term care  		under national health insurance. Moreover, those that do offer it, impose  		either very significant limitations on coverage and/or cost-sharing  		requirements that are more sizable than those required for acute care services.  		</p>
<p>Government funding for institutional long-term care in about one-half  		the countries surveyed is provided on a welfare basis rather than on an insured  		entitlement basis. This means that, as in the United States, elderly persons  		who are not receiving cash assistance must rust use up all their private income  		and assets paying for institutional long-term care before they become eligible  		for government funding. In a majority of the remaining countries, private  		payments, including payments by individuals using their social security  		pensions, remain a major source of financing for institutional care, but  		government funding is not contingent on all private resources being exhausted.  		For example, in Canada, elderly persons must contribute their social security  		pensions toward the cost of care, but they are not required to contribute other  		income or assets. In the Scandanavian countries, elderly residents of long-term  		care facilities are required to contribute their social security pensions plus  		a percentage (ranging from 60 to 80 percent ) of all other income toward their  		care, but they are not required to liquidate or exhaust their assets. In  		France, the medical component (on the average 14 percent and, at maximum, 50  		percent of long-term care facility costs) is funded through national health  		insurance, but elderly individuals are responsible for paying the nonmedical or  		room-and-board component of care. If elderly individuals cannot afford to pay  		privately for room and board in a long-term care facility, they must apply for  		welfare assistance. </p>
<p>Institutionalization rates tend to be lower in countries with less  		generous (i.e., means-tested) government financing; however, this is far from a  		simple relationship. For example, The Netherlands has the highest overall rate  		of institutionalization of all the countries studied. Yet the rate of use of  		the "AWBZ" homes (the equivalent of U.S. skilled nursing facilities), which are  		covered under national health insurance with low cost-sharing, is only 3  		percent; whereas the use rate for less medicalized facilities, where residents  		must pay privately until they have exhausted their resources, is 8 percent.  		Further exploration suggests that the relationship between financing and  		institutionalization rates is strongly mediated by institutional bed supply.  		Indeed, it seems likely that controls or lack of controls on the  		bed-to-population ratio has more impact on variations in institutional use  		rates than the eligibility, coverage, or cost-sharing rules associated with  		government financing of institutional care. </p>
<p>Availability of government-funded noninstitutional long-term care is  		highly variable and much more difficult to measure than institutional bed  		supply. As is the Medicare home health benefit, home nursing is typically  		covered by national health insurance programs with little or no patient cost  		sharing required. On the other hand, use rates of home nursing services vary  		greatly, ranging from 30-40 home nursing service users per 1,000 elderly in the  		United States, Israel, and Sweden to 164 users per 1,000 elderly in The  		Netherlands. Home-delivered nursing is a relatively recent phenomenon in  		France, having only been included in national health insurance coverage since  		1981. Home nursing is also a relatively new benefit in the FRG; and, in Japan,  		coverage of home nursing under national health insurance is still under  		discussion. Just as in the United States, however, professional home nursing  		care in most European countries appears to be primarily a short-term service  		used mainly by persons recovering from an acute illness that required  		hospitalization. </p>
<p>In virtually all countries, there seems to be resistance to covering  		nonmedical long-term care services under the rubric of health programs. New  		Zealand, where all types of home-care services are frequently authorized by and  		coordinated out of hospital-based geriatric assessment units and funding is  		provided by local hospital boards, is a partial exception to this rule,  		although, even here, hospital-board funding for the nonmedically oriented  		services is less uniform and is more likely to be allocated on the basis of  		financial need. In addition, a number of Canadian provinces make available a  		range of noninstitutional long-term care services through their health  		insurance programs. </p>
<p>In most European countries, however, nonmedical home- and  		community-based long-term care services are generally characterized as social  		services, and they are administered locally, though they are likely to be paid  		for by a combination of central and local government financing. Such funding  		appears to be most generous in the Scandanavian countries and Britain. Although  		eligibility for these services is not means-tested in Scandanavia,  		income-related copayments are required. Sliding-scale cost sharing is also  		required from home-help clients in France, where close to 5 percent of all  		elderly living in the community receive such care. In Britain, publicly funded  		home help is targeted primarily toward the low-income elderly who have heavy  		disabilities and live alone. </p>
<h2>HOME-CARE ALTERNATIVES </h2>
<p>The question of whether publicly financed home care does or can provide  		alternatives to institutionalization is a complicated one, but, on balance,  		this analysis suggests that reported policy initiatives to promote  		noninstitutional alternatives to institutional long-term care have had only  		very limited success. There is some evidence, primarily from Sweden and the  		other Scandanavian countries, that home delivered services, especially those  		provided in sheltered housing environments (e.g., service-flats) can be used to  		reduce use rates of old-fashioned nonmedical homes for the aged. Only in the  		case of Britain has there been a historic association between an emphasis on  		funding home help and comparatively low institutionalization rates. Here again,  		however, the evidence suggests that it was primarily political decisions to  		limit the availability of bed supply that kept institutional use rates low more  		than the elderly and their families choosing to use institutions less because  		home- and community-based alternatives were available. For many years, both the  		growth in National Health Service geriatric beds and the local authority home  		residential beds failed to keep pace with population growth and aging. The  		private nursing home building boom of the 1980's in Britain and the extension  		of social security means-tested financing to cover the costs of care in private  		nursing homes indicate, however, that demand can be artificially restrained  		only so far. Although Britain (at 4-5 percent) still has one of the lowest  		levels of elderly institutional use among the Western industrialized countries,  		the British case may well represent the limits of effective, adequate  		substitution of home- and community-based care for institutional care (Hobman,  		1981; Larder, Day, and Klein, 1986). </p>
<p>Most countries that have expanded or are in the process of expanding  		either services in the home or such halfway services as day hospitals claim to  		be doing so in order to reduce institutionalization rates. The data  		suggest--albeit in most cases more by inference than by direct measures--that  		home- and community-based services complement, rather than substitute for,  		institutional-level care. Thus, greater availability of public funding for  		noninstitutional services is not systematically associated with lower  		cross-national use rates of institutional care. Indeed, use rates of these  		noninstitutional services tend to be especially high in those countries that  		also have above-average institutional use rates (e.g., Sweden, The  		Netherlands). It is therefore inferred that the populations typically served by  		home-care programs tend to be more moderately disabled than those in  		institutions, and most such clients are probably not at imminent risk of  		institutionalization. The association between above-average institutional use  		rates and more generous funding for home-care services probably means that both  		are indicative of a greater political will to spend government funds on  		long-tem care generally. </p>
<p>There appear to be a number of reasons for the limited success of home-  		and community-based care as a true alternative to institutionalization. Two  		factors that stand out as being potentially amenable to policy change are the  		insufficiency of the services offered and the lack of coordination among  		providers and payers of medical versus social services. </p>
<p>In general, the types and amounts of home-care services currently being  		offered better serve the needs of the mild-to-moderately disabled than they do  		the needs of persons imminently at risk of institutionalization. Everywhere,  		these are almost exclusively oriented toward providing either professional  		nursing care (injections, dressings, etc.) or a few hours per week of  		assistance with instrumental activities of daily living (homemaker or chore  		services). The kinds of intensive (i.e., 20 hours or more per week, including  		nights if needed) nonprofessional nursing or personal care required by persons  		with severe impairments in ability to perform activities of daily living  		(bathing, dressing, toileting, eating) are typically not widely available in  		any of the countries surveyed, including those generally thought of as  		providing comparatively generous financing for home-care services. In part,  		this is because European countries are no more willing than the United States  		to spend more per person, per day on noninstitutional care than on  		institutional care. (Comité Européen de Santé, 1985).  		Recently, some of the Scandanavian countries have become conscious of the  		limitations of existing services, and they have tried to increase their  		usefulness to the severely disabled by offering some night and weekend  		coverage, albeit still on a limited basis. </p>
<p>Inadequate coordination of the different types of services provided or  		financed by medical versus social services agencies or by different levels of  		government (national, regional, and local) was cited as a problem by most  		countries replying to the ISSA questionnaire. Although New Zealand, Denmark,  		and a few of the Canadian provinces have made greater progress toward  		integrated long-term care delivery systems than other countries, fragmentation  		of long-term care services organization and financing is a perceived problem in  		virtually all countries. </p>
<h2>SUMMARY </h2>
<p>Use rates of institutional long-term care among the elderly in advanced  		industrial countries vary almost threefold. The United States (along with  		Japan, Britain, and the FRG) has one of the lowest use rates for institutional  		long-term care among industrialized countries, whereas Sweden and The  		Netherlands have the highest use rates. </p>
<p>Cross-national variation in use rates of nonmedical institutions is  		greater than that of medically oriented facilities. Population  		characteristics--that is, older, more female elderly populations--account for  		only part of the higher institutionalization rates in some countries. Although  		institutionalization rates are generally lower in countries where public  		financing for institutional long-term care is available only on a means-tested  		basis, it appears that the relationship between government financing and  		institutional use rates is mediated by bed-supply policy. Tight bed supply  		controls can curb the use of long-term care facilities generously financed by  		nation insurance, and use rates of more generously supplied facilities are much  		higher even where public financing is means-tested. Generous public financing  		for home care is more often associated with countries also having above-average  		institutionalization rates--suggesting that both are related to greater  		political willingness to spend public monies on long-term care services across  		the board. </p>
<p>The lack of a systematic association between generous home-care  		financing and below-average institutional use indicates that policy initiatives  		aiming at reducing institutional use through increased public funding of home  		care services have not been particularly successful. There is some evidence,  		however, from the Scandanavian countries, that it is possible to use home care  		in combination with sheltered housing to reduce the use rates of nonmedical  		institutions, particularly where use rates of such facilities have been  		especially high. </p>
<p>The following two countervailing evolutionary trends are observable:  		</p>
<ul><li>Increased medicalization of the institutional long-term care sector,  		  particularly in countries that historically had relatively few freestanding  		  medically oriented facilities and most medically oriented long-term care was  		  provided in hospital or mental hospital settings. </li>
<li>A move to phase out nonmedically oriented institutions in favor of  		  sheltered housing (elderly service flats). </li>
</ul><p>The net result for the future is likely to be that the institutional  		long-term care sector in most countries will be more medically oriented.  		Overall, institutional rates may rise somewhat in countries with historically  		low use rates--especially where the lack of specialized, medically oriented  		long-term care has caused the unintended use of general hospital beds for  		long-term care, and this phenomenon has not been measured sufficiently well to  		figure in the calculation of national institutionalization rates (e.g., FRG and  		Britain). On the other hand, overall institutionalization rates may well drop  		somewhat in those countries with historically above-average use rates of  		nonmedical institutional facilities (Sweden, The Netherlands), even if use  		rates of medical facilities rise as many of the nonmedical facilities are  		phased out and replaced with noninstitutional sheltered housing. </p>
