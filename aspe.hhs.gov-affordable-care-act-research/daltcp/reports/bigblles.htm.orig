<hr /><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<p>This study examines very expensive hospital stays (those with charges  		more than $25,000) for persons under 26 years old in California, based on the  		1987 state all-payor discharge data base for acute care, psychiatric and  		alcohol/drug treatment hospitals.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> Although cases with hospital charges exceeding  		$25,000 were only 2.0% of the 1.06 million discharges for young people, these  		very high cost cases comprised 34.7% of the total $3.84 billion in hospital  		charges (see <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>).<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> The risk of such a high cost hospitalization  		is low: less than one-fifth of 1% of the population under 26 will have such a  		problem in a year, although the risk is about nine times higher for infants  		under 1 year of age. With a mean hospital length of stay of 59 days, these are  		seriously ill children with a variety of medical, surgical and mental health  		problems.</p>
<p>A particular focus of this paper is <b>who</b> is paying for care,  		especially who are the people without insurance. In the California data base,  		hospitals have coded the expected principal payor, which may differ from the  		eventual payment sources. Nonetheless, since we expect that hospitals will be  		careful in trying to identify possible payors for expensive cases, this roughly  		indicates the insurance status of these patients and their families.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure1" id="figure1"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68291/bigblfg1.gif" /></a></div>
<p>Deciding who is and who is not insured is more complicated than might be  		expected. For analytical simplicity we grouped the 12 reported expected  		principal payors into four major categories, as shown in the left half of  		<a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>. <b>Private Insurance</b>, including Blue  		Cross/Blue Shield, commercial insurance and Health Maintenance Organizations  		(HMOs), and <b>Medicaid</b> represent groups that we would usually call  		insured. However, some Medicaid patients may arrive at the hospital without  		insurance and only have Medicaid eligibility determined after entry (e.g.,  		through spending down to the Medically Needy program or becoming qualified for  		SSI after a long hospital stay). <b>Other Government</b> includes Medicare,  		Workers' Compensation, Title V (Maternal and Child Health Block Grant) and a  		subcategory of other government programs, including CHAMPUS (medical coverage  		for civilian dependents of military personnel), and various other Federal,  		state and local funding sources, including California's Short-Doyle program for  		mental health services. A small portion of the Other Government group is  		clearly insured (those in Medicare or CHAMPUS). Some are partly insured;  		workers are insured for work-related illness under Workers' Compensation, but  		not necessarily for other problems. Others may not have regular public or  		private insurance, but a government program can finance care. The fourth major  		category is <b>No Insurance</b>, including Self-Payment, No Charge (e.g.,  		charity care, research, etc.), Other Non-Government (foundations, charities,  		etc.), and Indigent Care, a small State/county program in California. (We refer  		to these medical indigency cases as uninsured, since being uninsured is one of  		the eligibility criteria and eligibility is determined only after admission to  		the hospital.) We presume that the payors in this group were payors of last  		resort for uninsured people with no alternative funding.</p>
<p>For beneficiaries, insurance should provide assurance of financial  		support for illnesses. From the perspective of patients and families, members  		of the No Insurance group and some members of the Other Government group (and  		even some in the Medicaid group) were uninsured since they had grave illnesses  		and were uncertain of who (if anyone) would pay for their medical care. From  		the perspective of hospitals, far fewer of the patients (only those in the  		Self-Pay and No Charge groups) were uncompensated, since an expected source of  		payment was identifiable from governmental or non-governmental sources.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure2" id="figure2"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68291/bigblfg2.gif" /></a></div>
<p>As seen in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>, about half of the very high  		cost cases (with charges over $25,000) were privately insured and a third had  		Medicaid coverage. A seventh were in the Other Government category, which  		includes Title V (Maternal and Child Health Program) and California's  		Short-Doyle mental health services. About 9% of the cases with charges over  		$25,000 were in the No Insurance group and 5% were classed as self-pay. Since  		very few families can pay such high bills out-of-pocket, most self-payment  		cases are probably uncompensated.</p>
<p>In contrast, about 15% of cases costing less than $5,000 have no  		insurance and 11% are self-pay. As shown in <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>,  		the share of cases with no insurance declines steadily as the cost of cases  		rises. Three possible causes include: (1) Hospitals do not serve seriously ill  		children without insurance or provide lower cost service to them; (2) Hospitals  		and/or patients more aggressively seek alternative payment sources for  		expensive hospitalizations (e.g., they find charities or government programs to  		pay for particular cases or patients' families may spend down into Medicaid  		eligibility) and (3) Families without insurance seek less care for seriously  		ill children. There is some evidence of all three situations, but it is beyond  		the scope of this project (and data base) to fully determine the causes of the  		differences in levels of insurance between low and very high cost  		hospitalizations.</p>
<p>Only half of all California children's hospitalizations are expected to  		have private insurance and government financing is almost as large (with the  		small balance being self-pay and miscellaneous sources). Even if we assume a 9%  		undercount of HMO patients, the share of private patients is still about half.  		In contrast, national survey data for 1987 indicate that about two-thirds (69%)  		of persons under 25 had private insurance (Short, Cantor and Beauregard, 1989).  		The large role of other government programs is larger than expected. Although  		programs, such as Title V and the Short-Doyle mental health program, are  		usually viewed as small, they may finance a disproportionate share of high cost  		hospitalizations for children. It is not clear if the surprisingly large role  		of other government programs is a unique situation for California or is a  		broader phenomenon not previously identified due to lack of comparable analyses  		in other States.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure3" id="figure3"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68291/bigblfg3.gif" /></a></div>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure4" id="figure4"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68291/bigblfg4.gif" /></a></div>
<p>The level of uninsured care for very high cost cases is not evenly  		distributed across the age spectrum. <a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>  		demonstrates that the share of very high cost cases without insurance is  		highest for young adults 21 to 25 years old. The share of cases paid by  		Medicaid drops sharply as age increases. The share of cases paid by private  		insurance rises for the 11 to 20 year age range and drops again for the 21 to  		25 age range.</p>
<p>Other research indicates that about half of those without insurance in  		the U.S. are under 25 years old (Bureau of the Census, 1990). The age trends  		seen in these data are roughly consistent with national data indicating that  		lack of insurance is greatest among those 18 to 24 years old (30.2% in 1987)  		and that public insurance (i.e., Medicaid, CHAMPUS, Medicare) coverage declines  		with age of child (from 15.8% for those under 6 to 6.5% for those 18 to 24)  		(Short, Monheit and Beauregard, 1989). The share of the uninsured is similar  		for the non-elderly with and without Activities of Daily Living limits (Griss,  		1988), although the disabled have more Medicaid and less private insurance.  		These data suggest that many of the uninsured may still have care financed by  		another government or non-government program.</p>
<p>As shown in <a href="#figure5">Figure 5</a>, different payors cover  		different types of very high cost care, as based on the principal diagnoses.  		Injuries and poisonings comprise almost half (42%) of the group without  		insurance, about three times higher than for the other groups. Far fewer of  		those without insurance have diagnoses relating to pregnancy or newborn care  		(including congenital abnormalities, neonatal intensive care and maternal care)  		and mental disorders (including mental retardation, drug/alcohol dependence and  		other psychiatric disorders) than for other payors. About half of the Medicaid  		cases are related to pregnancy and newborn care. In the Other Government  		category, a large proportion of cases have mental health diagnoses, probably  		due to California's Short-Doyle mental health program. The actual role of  		Medicaid is probably somewhat greater than shown here, since some Short-Doyle  		mental health expenditures are eventually reimbursed by Medicaid.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure5" id="figure5"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68291/bigblfg5.gif" /></a></div>
<p>In part, these differences in diagnoses may be attributable to the age  		differences in the insured and uninsured populations. The uninsured group is  		older and has more injuries which are more common to that group. Similarly, the  		uninsured have fewer problems for the very youngest, e.g., pregnancy and  		newborn problems. In part, the diagnosis differences may reflect differences in  		the types of problems for which hospitals are willing to provide expensive care  		to uninsured people.</p>
<p>There are modest differences in types of discharges by payor, as shown  		in <a href="#figure6">Figure 6</a>. The uninsured have fewer routine discharges  		and more transfers to other acute care hospitals or other facilities (Skilled  		Nursing Facilities (SNFs), Intermediate Care Facilities (ICFs) and other  		facilities) than the insured groups; they also have somewhat more deaths.  		Private hospitals may transfer uninsured patients to public hospitals or  		institutions for further care. However, data quality is weak for this  		variable.</p>
<p>Patients without insurance have the shortest lengths of stay in  		hospitals and the lowest mean charges, but the highest charges per day, as  		shown in <a href="#figure7">Figure 7</a>. In effect, the uninsured have intense  		medical services, but are discharged somewhat sooner. This may be a cost-saving  		measure taken by hospitals or may reflect the different age and case mix  		between insured and uninsured patients. For example, psychiatric patients may  		have relatively low costs per day, but may have very long stays.</p>
<p>This exploratory study indicates some problems in access for hospital  		care for very high cost children and young adults without insurance. Lack of  		insurance is most acute for young adults. The relatively small share of mental  		disorders among uninsured patients may indicate particular problems in access  		to care for the uninsured with psychiatric problems. Those without insurance  		are more likely to be admitted on an emergency basis and to be transferred to  		another acute care hospital. Those with no insurance have shorter hospital  		stays, but receive intense services during their stays.</p>
<p>Finally, we should remember that a large proportion of these very high  		cost disorders are preventable. Many pregnancy/newborn problems can be  		prevented through better prenatal care, improved nutrition, prevention of  		substance use (including tobacco, alcohol and drugs) and genetic screening.  		Most injuries and poisonings are preventable through measures, such as improved  		auto safety and use of seat belts. Many mental health and other  		medical/surgical disorders are either preventable or could be identified  		earlier and treated in less intensive settings. While it is natural to be  		concerned about treatment of these problems, prevention programs can and should  		play an important role too.</p>

<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>This report is one part of a larger project on severely disabled  		children and their health care needs being conducted by  		SysteMetrics/McGraw-Hill under contract to the Office of Social Services  		Policy, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. Most of  		the project examines the experience of severely disabled children in the  		Medicaid program. This exploratory report looks at the broader experience of  		severely ill children whether on Medicaid, privately insured or uninsured.</p>
<p>The data base for analysis is the 1987 California State Abstracts, which  		include all hospital discharges for all payors. Hospital costs are a dominant  		share of all medical costs, especially for the non-institutionalized. In this  		case, the severely disabled children are selected if the charge for a single  		hospital stay exceeds $25,000. While not corresponding precisely with standard  		definitions of disabled children (based on functional/developmental limitations  		or on chronic conditions), these serious illnesses with long hospital stays  		certainly reflect at least a temporary disability. More generally, we might  		think of these very serious illnesses as largely indicating the onset of a  		potential disability (e.g., a neonatal defect, a serious injury or severe  		infection) or the consequence of a disabling condition (e.g., kidney  		transplants due to renal defects or other sequelae of congenital and chronic  		conditions, or psychiatric problems, including drug or alcohol dependence).</p>
<p>The definition used for very high cost cases, hospital charges over  		$25,000, is stricter than usual definitions of catastrophic expenses. McManus  		(1986) cites various standard definitions:</p>
<ul><li>Out-of-pocket expenses greater than some dollar level, such as  		  $2,000,</li>
<li>Out-of-pocket expenses greater than a percent of family income, such  		  as 10 to 15%,</li>
<li>Total medical expenses greater than some annual level, such as  		  $10,000.</li>
</ul><p>Hospital discharge data only give us charges per stay. We cannot  		ascertain out-of-pocket expenses and costs other than inpatient care. However,  		we certainly know that the very high cost patients are very sick children whose  		families generally must bear crushing expenses for medical care. The particular  		virtue of hospital discharge data is that the samples are huge. Such children  		are quite rare (about 0.2% of the population under 26 years in California) and  		only administrative data bases can provide enough cases for analysis.</p>
<p>This study includes children between 0 and 25 years of age, which is  		broader than standard definitions of childhood. This reflects some interest in  		young adults (21 to 25 years old), as part of the continuum of child  		development.</p>
<p>These analyses basically seek to answer two sets of questions:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Who is paying for the hospital care for these very high cost cases?  			 Especially, how many children are uninsured?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the differences in the characteristics of very high cost  			 cases among those who are privately insured, publicly insured and those without  			 insurance? What are the differences in age, diagnosis, type of discharge,  			 length of stay, and so on?</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Unfortunately, we cannot definitely say that differences are due to  		insurance status. Level and cost of medical care are intricately entangled with  		insurance status. For example, very high medical bills can enable people to  		become Medicaid eligible through spend down. Disabled children are more likely  		to be eligible for Medicaid through SSI disability. Parents whose children have  		serious medical problems are more likely to try to maintain private insurance,  		even if it means keeping a poorer job. Some catastrophic expenditures may not  		be covered by private insurance due to special exclusions, such as pre-existing  		conditions or maximum benefit levels. Finally, while hospitals may be willing  		to write off a portion of their bills for uninsured persons as bad debt or free  		care, they are more likely to try to identify a payment source for expensive  		patients.</p>
<p>To further complicate matters, in some cases those without insurance may  		avoid hospital care, depressing their prevalence. In some cases, the uninsured  		may delay care and arrive sicker, which may increase expenses or mortality  		rates. As a consequence of these and other confounding factors, these findings  		should be considered exploratory in nature.</p>
<h2>SOURCE OF DATA AND METHODOLOGY</h2>
<p>The California State 1987 Abstracts data base contains all hospital  		discharges from California acute care, psychiatric and alcohol/drug treatment  		hospitals in Calendar Year 1987, as collected and edited first by the Office of  		Statewide Health Planning and Development and then by SysteMetrics/McGraw-Hill.  		All California hospitals are required to submit discharge records for all  		patients within 6 months of the close of each year. Each record corresponds to  		a single hospital discharge and contains information, such as: age, diagnosis,  		length of stay, expected principal payor and charges.</p>
<p>For this project, SysteMetrics first extracted all cases 25 years old or  		younger; this includes 1.06 million discharges. For analysis of all cases,  		regardless of cost, we selected a 10% random sample with 105,985 records. For  		analyses of very high cost cases, all discharges with total charges over  		$25,000 were extracted; there were 21,453 such cases. All cases with missing or  		miscoded data had been excluded. In general, there was an extremely low level  		of missing data, e.g., less than 0.5% for any data category.</p>
<p>The one exception is missing charge data. About 9% of all cases  		(including adults) were missing total charges and excluded from analysis. These  		are mostly patients enrolled in Kaiser-Permanente health maintenance  		organization (HMO) plans who are treated in Kaiser hospitals. Unlike most HMOs,  		Kaiser owns hospitals which are mostly used to treat persons enrolled in Kaiser  		plans. Since these are capitated patients who are treated in-house, no one is  		billed and no charges are generated. The net effect of this exclusion is that  		HMO patients are underrepresented in these analyses. However, since we are  		classifying cases by cost, there is no simple alternative.</p>
<p>Defining insurance/payor groups was more difficult than expected.  		California hospitals indicate twelve specific categories of expected principal  		payor. For analytical simplicity, we compressed these into two variables with  		eight and four categories, as shown below:</p>
<table><tr><td colspan="2"><font><b>PAYOR</b></font></td>
<td colspan="2"><font><b>PAYOR8</b></font></td>

<td>Self-PayNo Charge</td>
<td rowspan="2"><font>}</font></td>
<td rowspan="2">No Insurance</td>
</tr><tr><td>Other Non Govt.Indigent Care</td>
</tr></table><p>Some of these categories are relatively broad. Other Governmental  		programs (aside from Medicare, Title V and Worker's Compensation) may include  		Migrant Health, special funds for AIDS, alcohol, drug treatment, special State  		or local government programs, etc. An important and relatively unique program  		in California is the Short-Doyle program, a State/county mental health program  		which covers inpatient, outpatient and community services. In some counties,  		Short-Doyle funds essentially fund the public mental health hospital. When  		Short-Doyle services are provided to Medicaid patients, Medicaid subsequently  		reimburses them. Thus, some mental health claims eventually covered by Medicaid  		may appear in the Other Government category. By some definitions, many of the  		patients in the Other Government category may be considered uninsured, e.g.,  		those with Title V or Short-Doyle funding. However, some of these might be  		considered somewhat insured, in the sense that they may have been assured of  		coverage prior to entering the hospital. Others are insured, e.g., CHAMPUS and  		Medicare. Some are at least partly insured, e.g., the worker's compensation  		patients who are insured for these work-related problems. Thus, the Other  		Government categories are uncertain with respect to their insurance status.</p>
<p>Other Non-Government funding may include foundation or specially raised  		funds, e.g., funds for muscular dystrophy or an earmarked hospital charity  		fund. California also operates Section 17000, a State/county medically indigent  		program for hospital care of poor uninsured persons, such as adults without  		children and illegal aliens. We have grouped these cases with the No Insurance  		category since their eligibility is determined after hospital admission. Thus,  		they entered the hospital with no assurance of medical coverage.</p>
<h2>CAVEATS</h2>
<p>There are several caveats regarding these data:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>The unit of analysis is a single hospital inpatient discharge. Since  			 personal identifiers are missing, we cannot follow a patient over the year.  			 Some disabled children with catastrophic expenses may have repeat  			 hospitalizations or may transfer from one institution to another. These  			 analyses miss the patterns of multiple admissions. These charges include the  			 few hospitalizations lasting more than a year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only inpatient hospital costs are measured. The data do not include:  			 outpatient care, physician charges, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, special  			 diets, institutional care, home care, physical therapy, etc. They also fail to  			 count other social costs imposed by severe children's illnesses, such as home  			 modification, missed parental work days, transportation, child care, special  			 education or tutoring, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maternal and infant discharges and costs cannot be linked if the  			 mother and infant have separate bills. Maternal obstetric bills usually do not  			 include more than routine hospital costs for neonatal care. Fragile babies who  			 receive neonatal intensive care generally have separate bills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost data are total hospital charges. "Charges" are the amounts that  			 the hospital wants to be paid for services rendered, based on the resources  			 used and their standard charge rates. In light of complex hospital review and  			 reimbursement policies, charges may be much higher (and sometimes lower) than  			 actual "payments" made by payors. Generally, charges are somewhat better at  			 indicating actual resource utilization by different patients, since they are  			 relatively individualized, while payments may be averaged out, especially in  			 prospective payment systems. In 1987, California Medicaid paid with prospective  			 payments to selected hospitals, which offered lower prices for care in the  			 selective contracting process. HMOs also often pay discounted rates. Blue  			 Cross/Blue Shield usually pays the actual "cost" of the stay, somewhat less  			 than charges. Commercial insurers (e.g., Prudential, John Hancock, etc.) often  			 pay the charges billed.</p>
<p>Charges do not accurately reflect the actual cost to a payor for  			 services. But charges are an appropriate and relatively equitable measure of  			 cost for comparisons across payors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payor type is the hospital's expected principal payor. This does not  			 include all payors for a given bill. For example, a typical privately insured  			 patient may have the bulk of his or her bill paid by the insurer, but has to  			 pay the deductible (and perhaps co-payments) out-of-pocket. A Medicaid patient  			 with private insurance may have the bulk of the bill paid by the private  			 insurer and have deductibles and co-payments reimbursed by Medicaid. Complex  			 cases may have a variety of public and private payors, including Title V  			 (Maternal and Child Health Block Grant), charities and research funding.</p>
<p>Further, the expected payor may not be the actual payor. A privately  			 insured patient's bill may be rejected (e.g., due to a pre-existing condition  			 or some other uncovered service) and eventually be billed directly to the  			 patient (and perhaps be unpaid) or become eligible for Medicaid reimbursement  			 as the patient spends down. California Medicaid has no limits on the number of  			 days per stay, but does use periodic utilization review to limit hospital  			 stays.</p>
<p>Expensive claims, which are the focus of this report, are more  			 complex than lower cost claims. Insurers give them closer review and they are  			 also more prone to problems, such as exceeding maximum claims levels.</p>
<p>The net effect is that the share of costs borne by private insurance  			 is probably overrepresented in the data base and the share of costs eventually  			 assigned to free care/bad debt is underestimated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data are static and cross-sectional. Over a longer time period,  			 e.g., 10 years, a higher proportion of the population will have catastrophic  			 expenditures at some point. Similarly, a higher proportion of the disabled  			 population is without insurance at <b>some</b> time than is without insurance  			 in 1987.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These analyses underrepresent HMO cases, since we excluded the cases  			 without charge data. As noted earlier, this is mostly HMO patients being served  			 in HMO hospitals in which no charges are reported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data quality are limited by the accuracy and knowledge of medical  			 records staff who record these data. Discharge status may be an especially weak  			 field. This field is not needed for billing.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>To get a sense of the implications of some of these caveats, we can  		compare the analyses for California children with annual Medicaid expenditures  		over $25,000 in 1986, reported by Burwell and Herz in an earlier report from  		this project (1990). Noninstitutionalized children (not in long-term care  		facilities) averaged 3.2 discharges in the year, while institutionalized  		children with inpatient hospital stays averaged 2.1 discharges in the year.  		However, for noninstitutionalized children, hospital care represented 90% of  		the Medicaid costs (Ellwood and Herz, 1990).</p>
<p>Even so, the total number of Medicaid children with annual expenditures  		over $25,000 in 1986 was 6,409, which is almost <b>identical</b> to the 6,428  		patients identified as having hospital stays with charges over $25,000 with  		Medicaid as the expected principal payor in 1987. Presumably, the major  		offsetting factor is that Medicaid payments are well below the charge levels  		for these very high cost cases. As an example of the magnitude of these  		differences, Johns (1985) notes that for nine California hospitals in  		California, the Medi-Cal payment rates were 55 to 60% of charges. Since  		Medi-Cal generally pays a negotiated per them rate which is uniform for all  		types of patients, then we should expect that the ratio of payments to charges  		will be even lower (perhaps below 50%) for these difficult cases. For other  		payors, actual payments will be somewhat closer to charges. Prospective payment  		systems will almost inherently underpay expensive cases, as high cost cases are  		averaged against low cost cases.</p>
<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<h3>Comparisons of Lower and Higher Cost Hospital Stays</h3>
<p>Very high cost cases are important both because they form a large  		fraction of the cost of hospital care and because the patients are among the  		sickest persons, with complex medical and social needs. The severity of their  		illnesses and the high cost of their care lends potential for case management  		services to either decrease costs and to improve the quality of care,  		especially coordination between hospital and non-hospital care.</p>
<p>We begin by examining general differences between the very high cost  		cases (over $25,000 per stay) and lower cost stays. <a href="#table1">Table  		1</a> (corresponding to <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> in the Summary)  		presents the distribution of pediatric cases by cost category. Although cases  		with charges over $25,000 are only 2% of the cases, they form more than a third  		(37%) of the total charges for hospital care. In fact, the very highest cost  		cases (over $100,000) were one-third of 1 percent of the cases, but about a  		seventh (13%) of the total charges. Since some private insurance plans have  		maximum benefit levels of $100,000, this gives an idea of the small number of  		people who might be affected, but the large dollar levels involved.</p>
<p>In total, these very high cost pediatric cases racked up total charges  		over $1.3 billion in 1987, compared to $3.8 billion for all cases for persons  		under 26 years old and $20.4 billion for all hospitalizations for patients of  		all ages in California in 1987.</p>

</tr></table><p>Corresponding to our interest in the payors for care, we can analyze who  		is paying for different levels of hospital care. As seen in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> (and <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a> in the Summary  		section), there are differences in the payors for low and high cost care. In  		the higher cost categories, the shares in the Medicaid and No Insurance  		category decline and the share in the Other Government category grows. Below  		$25,000, the No Insurance group is 15.7% of cases, while it diminishes to 10.1%  		for cases over $25,000. More specifically, the self-pay group declines from  		11.1% of cases with costs below $25,000 to 5.5% of cases with costs above  		$25,000.</p>
<p>The decline in the role of the No Insurance and self-pay groups as costs  		rise is important, although the interpretation is difficult. Alternative  		explanations include: (1) Hospitals may be unwilling to treat uninsured  		seriously ill patients or provide lower cost care to uninsured patients. Under  		an increasingly competitive environment, hospitals, especially private  		hospitals, may be unwilling to treat the uninsured. There is strong evidence  		that hospitals provide less care to uninsured persons. Weissman and Epstein  		(1989) found that, controlling for diagnoses, age, and other factors,  		non-elderly uninsured people in the Boston area had 7% lower lengths of stay  		and 7% fewer procedures than privately insured patients, although this was not  		true for public hospitals. (2) Hospitals probably are more aggressive in  		seeking potential payors for high cost cases. The increase in the role of the  		Other Government payors may indicate attempts by hospitals to bill these  		programs for high cost uninsured patients. In many cases, high cost patients  		may be eligible for Medicaid through spending down their income and/or assets.  		(3) A final possibility is that families without insurance seek less care for  		seriously ill children. There is substantial evidence that increasing  		out-of-pocket costs decreases the demand for health care (Leibowitz, et al.,  		1985). However, we would not normally think this applies for such serious  		illnesses. Nonetheless, the possibility exists that some of the effect is due  		to decreased consumer demand, as opposed to hospital policies.</p>

</tr></table><p>Below the $25,000 mark, Medicaid pays for 33.7% of the cases, but above  		$25,000 it only pays for 28.1%. We had expected that the share of Medicaid  		cases would rise as costs increased, since middle-class families were more  		likely to spend down into eligibility or take advantage of SSI  		institutionalization rules with high cost cases. One possible explanation is  		that, since Medicaid is a relatively poor payor, hospitals reduce the level of  		care to Medicaid patients or seek alternative payment sources. Another, is  		that, although there are special eligibility rules for high cost cases to enter  		Medicaid, they are rarely used because the Medicaid eligibility system is so  		complicated.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising finding is the important role of Other  		Government programs as costs rise. Other Government programs (including  		Medicare) cover 5.1% of cases below $25,000, but 15.2% above $25,000. Although  		the data do not permit refined analysis, these may reflect impacts of two key  		programs: California's Title V program and its Short-Doyle mental health  		program. The Title V program, specifically the California Children's Program,  		does pay for hospital care for disabled children with no other insurance  		source. Its income criteria are broader than Medicaid's, going as high as  		$40,000. In Fiscal Year 1987-88, the program paid for 2,800 hospitalizations  		with a mean cost of $6,700, which is about double the overall mean cost of  		child hospitalizations ($3,700) (Martin Green, CCS, personal communication,  		July 1990). The Short-Doyle program covers inpatient (as well as outpatient)  		psychiatric care, which is usually expensive due to long hospital stays. Thus,  		the Other Government programs appear to have a disproportionate role in  		financing high cost care.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Overall, private insurance is the expected principal payor for only  		about half of the cases (all charge categories), which is less than expected.  		(Again, bear in mind that we excluded about 9% of cases whose charges were  		missing, but these appear to mostly be HMO cases.) The 1987 National Medical  		Expenditure Survey (Short, Monheit and Beauregard, 1989) indicate that about  		two-thirds of children under 19 have private insurance (67.5% for those under  		6, 71.8% for those 6 to 18, and 63.3% for those 19 to 24 years). Analyses cited  		by Griss demonstrate that among the non-elderly, the level of uninsurnance is  		similar between those with and without disabilities, as measured by Activities  		of Daily Living (Griss, 1988). However, those with disabilities were more  		likely to have Medicaid and less likely to have private insurance. This may be  		because the disabled are more likely to be eligible for Medicaid (e.g., through  		SSI) and less likely to have private insurance, if they or their parents cannot  		work or if they are uninsurable due to their conditions.</p>
<p>If California insurance coverage is like the nation's we would expect  		that private insurance ought to pay for two-thirds of the hospitalizations.  		Similarly, public programs are the expected payor much more often than  		expected. The NMES found that 6 to 16% of the children had only public  		insurance (15.8% for those under 6, 11.3% for those 6 to 18 and 6.5% for those  		19 to 24), while we find that government programs are expected to pay for about  		two-fifths of the hospital stays. California has a relatively generous Medicaid  		program, so we might expect somewhat higher public insurance levels in that  		state. These discrepancies may indicate the greater health problems of the poor  		and the greater probability of having health conditions requiring  		hospitalization.</p>
<p>These findings are at variance with findings for newborns from the 1984  		National Hospital Discharge Survey (Kozak and McCarthy, cited by McManus,  		1986), who found higher levels of uninsured status as costs increased. They  		reported that 17% of all newborn discharges were expected self-pay, 15%  		Medicaid, 61% private insurance, and 6% other sources, but for those with  		hospital stays over 14 days, 25% were self-pay, 22% were Medicaid and 42% were  		private, indicating that self-pay and Medicaid burdens increase as costs rise.  		In contrast, our California data for infants under 1 find 11% self-pay for all  		infant discharges, falling to 4% for those with charges over $25,000. Medicaid  		rises slightly from 35% for all infants and 38% for infants with charges over  		$25,000 and private insurance falls slightly from 48% to 43%.</p>
<p>Part of the differences are Medicaid-related. California has a generous  		Medicaid program and nationally Medicaid coverage of infants and pregnant women  		has widened since 1984, which reduces the uninsured level. The other difference  		may be that hospitals have become more cost-conscious and competitive since  		1984. Buffeted by the Medicare Prospective Payment system and competition in  		the private and Medicaid markets, they may have been less willing to treat  		uninsured patients, reduced care to uninsured patients and/or tried harder to  		find payors for expensive cases to reduce their uncompensated care levels.</p>
<p><a href="#table3">Table 3</a> indicates differences in age ranges across  		different charge categories. The most noteworthy finding is the U-shaped share  		of patients under 1 year of age. Infants are about half of the $0 to $5,000  		range discharges, decline in importance for the mid-range stays ($5,000 to  		$25,000), then rise again, becoming a majority of the cases over $100,000. This  		probably reflects two basic modes of hospital care for infants: normal neonatal  		and infant care, which is relatively inexpensive, vs. neonatal intensive care  		and its sequelae (e.g., technology dependent infants), which can be very  		expensive. Children 1 to 10 years old are relatively healthy and comprise a  		small share of the hospital cases across the range of costs. Older children and  		adolescents tend to comprise a growing share of the hospital cases as costs  		rise. This may be because important diagnoses in this age range, psychiatric  		and injuries, are often expensive hospitalizations.</p>
<p><a href="#table4">Table 4</a> briefly indicates the type of hospital  		used across the cost categories. General acute care hospitals provide the great  		majority of care in all cost ranges, but psychiatric and alcohol/drug treatment  		hospitals grow in importance as costs rise. Psychiatric hospitals comprise  		about a fifth of cases with costs over $25,000 per stay.</p>

</tr></table><h3>Who Are the Very High Cost Patients?</h3>
<p>At this point, we can start to describe more fully the very high cost  		patients (with charges over $25,000 per stay). The following analyses are based  		on the extract of <b>all</b> discharges with charges over $25,000 for persons 0  		to 25 years of age. In some cases, the numbers differ very slightly from those  		presented in the previous section. The analyses of all pediatric cases was  		based on a 10% sample and is subject to sampling error. The following analyses  		of very high cost cases uses the whole population of very high cost  		patients.</p>
<p><a href="#table5">Table 5</a> compares the age distribution for all  		Californians under 26 years and the very high cost patients. Roughly a third of  		the very high cost cases are under 1 year old and a third are 11 to 20 years  		old, with the remaining third split the other ages. However, it may be most  		useful to think in terms of a population prevalence rate, the number of very  		high cost hospital cases per 100,000 population of that age range. Overall, the  		average chance of a young person having a very high cost hospitalization is  		quite small - 198 per 100,000 or about 0.2%.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> However, the prevalence is about 9 times  		higher for infants under 1 year old, almost 2% of all infants have such  		expensive hospitalizations. Young children are the least likely to have very  		expensive hospital stays, less than 100 per 100,000. As they age to older  		adolescence and young adulthood, the risk rises to 160 to 180 per 100,000. Also  		shown in the far right column is the percent of very high cost cases  		represented by the different ages.</p>
<p><a href="#table6">Table 6</a> and <a href="#table7">Table 7</a> show the  		racial/ethnic and gender distributions for the very high cost patients. Black  		children are overrepresented among the very high cost children. While they  		comprise 12% of the very high cost cases, blacks are 7.5% of all  		Californians.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup> Hispanics  		and other people of color appear to be distributed roughly proportionate to  		their distribution in the overall population. Whites appear somewhat  		underrepresented. These findings are consistent with many findings of greater  		health burdens in the black community. Males constitute about three-fifths of  		the very high cost cases. Similar traits were found in our Medicaid  		analyses.</p>

<p><a href="#table8">Table 8</a> presents the percent of cases, percent of  		total charges and mean charge per stay for 21 groups of principal diagnoses for  		the very high cost pediatric cases in California. For these complex cases,  		there may be secondary or lower level diagnoses which indicate other problems,  		complications or underlying conditions. For analytical simplicity we used  		principal diagnoses. There are three groups which represent more than 10% of  		the cases or the charges: mental disorders (25.5% of cases and 18.6% of total  		charges), other condition originating in perinatal period (22.2% of cases and  		27.6% of charges and injuries and poisonings (15.3% of cases and 14.9% of  		charges). It is noteworthy that AIDS and related conditions form less than 1%  		of the cases and total charges for this group.</p>
<p>In subsequent analyses we grouped these into four broad categories:</p>
<table><tr><td nowrap="NOWRAP">1. Pregnancy/Newborn  </td>
<td>Complications of pregnancy, childbirth &amp;  			 puerperium; congenital anomalies; premature/inadequate birthweight; and other  			 conditions originating in the perinatal period, Thus, this grouping includes  			 both maternal and infant disorders and congenital abnormalities which may  			 extend beyond the first year of life.</td>
</tr><tr><td nowrap="NOWRAP">2. Mental Disorders</td>
<td>Mental disorders; mental retardation.</td>
</tr><tr><td nowrap="NOWRAP">3. Injuries &amp;  			 Poisonings  </td>
<td>Injuries and poisonings</td>
</tr><tr><td nowrap="NOWRAP">4. Other Disorders</td>
<td>All other diagnoses, including infections, neoplasms  			 (cancers and tumors), respiratory, digestive and circulatory problems, AIDS,  			 etc.</td>
</tr></table><p>In general, pregnancy/newborn disorders comprise over a third of the  		very high cost cases (34.4%) and an even larger share of the costs (41.9%).  		These problems are disproportionately expensive. In contrast, although mental  		disorders are over a quarter of the cases, they are less than a fifth of the  		costs. They are less costly per case. Readers should recall that these data do  		not depict the overall prevalence or costs of these diagnoses for all pediatric  		patients. This is a sample only for those with charges over $25,000.</p>

</tr></table><p>Three other ways to view patients are in terms of the type of medical  		facility treating them, the type of admission and type of discharge. These are  		shown in <a href="#table9">Table 9</a>, <a href="#table10">Table 10</a> and  		<a href="#table11">Table 11</a>, respectively. The great majority of cases were  		treated in general acute care hospitals, although about a fifth were seen in  		psychiatric hospitals and less than 1% seen in alcohol/drug treatment  		hospitals. Admission status can be useful as a sign of the relative urgency of  		the disorder; it is somewhat unexpected that a sixth of the very high costs  		cases were classified as elective.</p>
<p>Discharge status is one crude sign of outcomes of the hospital stay.  		About three-quarters of the stays were classified as routine discharges. About  		8% were transferred to another acute hospital. Reasons for transfer may  		include: shifting a patient to a more medically appropriate facility, e.g., as  		a transfer of a complex case to a tertiary care hospital; transfer to a  		facility more convenient for the patient or physician, e.g., transferring a  		patient to a hospital closer to home after a patient is stabilized; and  		transfer for economic reasons, e.g., transfer of an uninsured patient from a  		private to a public hospital, this is sometimes called "dumping." It is a  		little surprising that less than 3% of these serious cases were discharged to a  		nursing facility (ICF or SNF) or with home health care. However, discharge  		status data is often considered poor quality; medical records staff are often  		not informed on the actual status of a patient. Hopefully, more actually  		obtained subsequent nursing home or home health care than are reflected in  		these data. Only 6% were coded as died. Considering the severity of the  		illnesses among these very high cost children, this rate seemed relatively low.  		Finally, about 5% left against advice. This may indicate patients who left  		because they were discontent with their medical care, who felt that they were  		all right to go home or who felt compelled to leave early for economic  		reasons.</p>
<h3>Differences Among Expected Principal Payors</h3>
<p>At this point, we can examine whether different payors serve different  		types of patients and whether their care varies according to payor. Again, we  		warn that these findings are essentially exploratory and that differences in  		case mix, cost, etc. may not be due to the payor, but to some other confounding  		factors.</p>

Again, we underestimate private coverage  		by about 9%, due to the exclusion of the cases with missing charges, which are  		mostly due to Kaiser patients treated at Kaiser hospitals.</p>
<p>As children age, the mix of payors for high cost cases changes greatly.  		As shown in <a href="#table13">Table 13</a> (and <a href="#figure4">Figure  		4</a>), the share of cases paid by Medicaid consistently declines as children  		age. This is probably a function of the greater poverty among young families  		and the somewhat looser eligibility rules for Medicaid for children. The share  		in the No Insurance category rises beginning in the 11 to 20 year age range and  		becomes the highest in the 21 to 25 range. These older groups are often losing  		both family insurance coverage and Medicaid and gain eligibility to the  		Medically Indigent program as uninsured adults. Even so, they also have the  		highest range of self-pay for high cost cases. Private insurance peaks for the  		11 to 20 age range and then drops precipitously by 21 to 25. Although we have  		extended the analyses to those over 25, it seems likely that insurance status  		improves with older age, as people become either more economically secure or  		become Medicaid eligible again through the birth of children. The risk of  		uninsurance is greatest among the young adults. This may be a particular  		problem, since, as noted earlier, the rate of very high cost illnesses per  		100,000 population is about twice as high in this age range as in the 1 to 10  		age range.</p>
<p>There are very distinct patterns of the types of medical disorders paid  		for by different insurers, as seen in <a href="#table14">Table 14</a> and  		<a href="#figure5">Figure 5</a>. Unlike all other groups, almost half (42%) of  		the No Insurance group discharges are due to injuries and poisonings. Only  		about 10% of the No Insurance cases were for mental disorders. For both  		Medicaid and Other Government Programs, just under half of the high cost cases  		are related to pregnancy or newborn disorders and about one-eighth are due to  		injuries and poisonings. However, Other Government was associated with far more  		mental health cases (34%) than Medicaid (13%), while Medicaid had more cases of  		other disorders. Private insurance had the highest share of mental health cases  		(35%).</p>

It appears that a major reason for this emphasis is  		California's Short-Doyle program, the state/county program covering inpatient  		and community mental health services (though not substance abuse services). The  		state allocates funds to counties who may use them in public mental health  		hospitals or contract out to private hospitals. The level of Medicaid funding  		for mental health may be somewhat underestimated since Short-Doyle may  		initially cover a hospitalization, but eventually be reimbursed by Medicaid  		when treating a Medicaid recipient. All Californians are eligible for  		Short-Doyle services, although the program seeks third-party payors and screens  		people for income to establish a sliding fee scale for uninsured services.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, much of the explanation for these differences is due to the  		different age mix for each payor. <a href="#table15">Table 15</a> shows the  		relation of age and type of diagnosis. Three basic patterns are seen:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Under 1 Year</b>. Dominated by pregnancy/newborn  			 problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>1 to 10 Years</b>. Dominated by other medical problems, such as  			 neoplasms, infections, respiratory and digestive problems. Congenital anomalies  			 are also relative common in the 1 to 3 age range (18.6%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>11 to 25 Years</b>. Mental disorders and injuries and poisonings  			 are more common, although other disorders are still common.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Thus, the high proportion of injuries and poisonings among the No  		Insurance group is partly attributable to the fact that the uninsured include  		many older children and young adults. Of course, to the extent that insurance  		changes access to care, the age mix is confounded by insurance type also.</p>
<p>The type of admission is a sign of the relative urgency of the medical  		disorder. We would expect that many hospitals may be unwilling to provide care  		to uninsured people unless the situation is an emergency and that uninsured  		people will delay care and have a disproportionate level of emergency care.  		<a href="#table16">Table 16</a> displays the type of admission among different  		payors. Indeed, the rate of emergency admissions in the No Insurance group is  		almost twice as high as for those with private insurance. This is also  		consistent with the profile of older patients with more injuries and  		poisonings. In a way, it is unexpected that there is any elective care in the  		No Insurance group.</p>

</tr></table><p>Discharge status is a crude measure of the outcome of a hospitalization.  		As noted before, there may be data quality problems for this variable.  		<a href="#table17">Table 17</a> and <a href="#figure6">Figure 6</a> show the  		discharge status for the very high cost pediatric cases. The noteworthy finding  		is that those in the No Insurance group are about 50 to 100% more likely to be  		transferred to another acute care hospital than those with private insurance or  		Medicaid. The most likely explanation is that private hospitals are  		transferring uninsured patients to public hospitals. In general, uninsured  		patients are more likely to be transferred to another setting, including other  		hospitals or nursing homes. Insofar as the first hospital has already provided  		substantial care (more than $25,000 worth), this probably means that these  		patients have been stabilized and received much treatment. Thus, there may not  		be a problem in terms of quality of care, as such. Finally, the No Insurance  		and Medicaid groups had slightly higher mortality rates than the Private  		Insurance and Other Government groups. One likely explanation is that uninsured  		and Medicaid patients had more medical/surgical (and fewer psychiatric  		diagnoses) which are more likely to be fatal.</p>
<p>Finally, we examine the differences between expected principal payors in  		terms of the mean length of stay, mean charges per hospital stay and mean  		charges per day of hospitalization. These measure the resources used by these  		very expensive patients and are depicted in <a href="#table18">Table 18</a> and  		<a href="#figure7">Figure 7</a>. Those in the No Insurance group have by far  		the lowest mean length of stay and the lowest mean charges per stay, but have  		the highest mean charges per day. Although these uninsured people have  		<b>intensive</b> services while they are in the hospital, they are discharged  		relatively quickly. This may indicate a cost-saving strategy by hospitals  		through earlier discharge of uninsured people. However, it may also be  		reflective of the casemix of patients, e.g., many trauma victims who require  		intensive services while in the hospital, but relatively shorter stays.</p>

</tr></table><p>In contrast, the Other Government group has the highest length of stay,  		but the lowest charges per day. This is partly because this group includes many  		psychiatric patients. Psychiatric patients may have no expensive procedures,  		but very long periods of hospitalization. Private patients and Medicaid  		patients had similar charges per day, but Medicaid patients had slightly longer  		stays, leading to slightly higher charges per stay.</p>
<p>There is substantial evidence that many medical procedures and many  		hospital days are medically inappropriate or unnecessary. The fact that some  		groups have shorter lengths of stay, lower rates of hospitalization or lower  		costs does not necessarily mean that they are receiving poorer quality care or  		that their outcomes are worse. Nonetheless, these data suggest large  		differences in the way that the medical care system handles children and young  		adults depending on how they are insured.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p>This exploratory study has two main purposes. First, it provides a broad  		view of hospital care for seriously ill children and young adults, which can be  		used for comparison with Medicaid analyses. Second, it particularly looks at  		problems of the uninsured. This exploratory study has revealed a multitude of  		differences in the nature of very expensive hospitalizations among children and  		young adults in California, depending on their insurance status. We focused on  		cases in which the total hospital charges exceeded $25,000 per stay among  		persons 0 to 25 years old at the time of discharge. Although the very high cost  		cases are only 2% of the hospitalizations, they account for more than a third  		of the charges. The rate of very high cost hospitalization is highest among  		infants under 1 year of age, due to a variety of expensive neonatal  		conditions.</p>
<p>Very high cost patients were roughly split between public and private  		payors. The role of private insurance was somewhat smaller than expected and  		the role of other government programs was larger than expected. Part of this,  		however, may be unique to California, which has a generous Medicaid program and  		other health care programs, compared to other states.</p>
<p>It was harder to classify insurance status than expected. The main  		variable used was expected principal payor, as listed by the hospital. About  		three-quarters of the very high cost cases had insurance as we usually define  		it: private insurance, HMO coverage, Medicaid or Medicare. Just under one  		quarter had a broad mix of payor sources, including Title V, worker's  		compensation, CHAMPUS, self-pay, no charge, other non-government and  		California's Short-Doyle mental health program and Section 17000 medically  		indigent program. By some definitions, many or most of these may be classified  		as uninsured people. For this study, we created a group, Other Government  		Programs, which included Medicare, Title V, worker's compensation and other  		government programs. We also created another group, the No Insurance group,  		which included self-pay, no charge, other non-government (e.g., foundations)  		and the indigent care program. We do not know how well the expected principal  		payor corresponds with actual payors.</p>
<p>The analyses indicated various, related problem areas for those without  		insurance:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>As hospital stays become more expensive, the share of patients  			 without insurance or who are self-pay declines. This may indicate that those  			 without insurance have reduced access to care for serious illnesses, that  			 hospitals are more aggressive in identifying payors for expensive cases or that  			 those without insurance seek less care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Young adults 21 to 25 years old appear to be at greatest risk of  			 high cost cases without insurance. They often lack either private insurance or  			 Medicaid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to inpatient mental health care may be a special problem for  			 the uninsured. Access for trauma victims may be better; almost half of the high  			 cost cases in the No Insurance group were being treated for injuries and  			 poisonings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those without insurance may have more difficulty in being admitted  			 without an emergency condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a greater probability of being transferred to another acute  			 care hospital among the uninsured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those without insurance appear to be discharged earlier and to have  			 lower cost stays, although they may have intensive services during their  			 hospital stays.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Current health policy discussions tend to focus on two aspects of very  		high cost cases and disabled children. On one hand, discussions emphasize the  		need for expansion of public and private insurance coverage to ensure adequate  		care for the needy children and to avoid financially devastating expenses to  		their families (e.g., Newacheck and McManus, 1988, American Academy of  		Pediatrics, 1987, Rosenbaum, 1987, Griss, 1988). This study does reveal some  		access problems among the uninsured. However, the number of self-pay patients  		was smaller than expected, largely due to the larger than anticipated role of  		other government programs. This study focused on hospitalizations, which are  		usually much better covered than outpatient care, drugs, medical devices,  		nursing home or home health care, counseling, etc.). However, a recent survey  		by Fox and Newacheck suggests that private insurance policies may be broadening  		coverage for home care and other cost-effective services in recent years (Fox  		and Newacheck, 1990). We could not examine problems in other forms of health  		care or in high out-of-pocket costs among families of disabled children. Our  		data shed some light on maximum insurance benefits, which sometimes start as  		low as $100,000.</p>
<p>On the other hand, discussions emphasize the potential for cost  		containment in these high cost cases. The greatest savings are achievable in  		cases which cost the most. Much discussion today focuses on medical case  		management (Henderson, et al, 1988) or rationing (Medicine &amp; Health, 1990).  		Usually in case management, a nurse or other health professional is assigned to  		a patient with severe illnesses to oversee and coordinate care between the  		hospital, outpatient settings and the home. The case manager authorizes care  		and is empowered to provide non-standard benefits (such as home modification or  		special therapy) which will improve the quality of care and/or reduce costs. A  		principal goal of case management is helping to get people out of hospitals  		sooner, generally the most expensive treatment setting, and into lower cost  		(and often more appealing) community settings. Many of these very high cost  		cases, especially the high risk newborns are probably amenable to case  		management services. However, case management can sometimes cost more than it  		saves. These data showed surprisingly few discharges involving nursing homes or  		home health care. Hopefully, this an artifact of poor data quality and  		discharge planning is more thorough than it appears. From the perspective of  		rationing, the issue is whether it is worthwhile to spend large amounts for a  		small number of people, many of whom are likely to die anyway. These data  		confirm that a small fraction of people incur a large portion of costs.  		However, only 6% have the discharge status of died. While it seems likely that  		this code would be more accurate than the nursing home and home health codes,  		data quality is an issue. Rationing is controversial and raises vexing ethical  		issues.</p>
<p>It would be an injustice to conclude without mentioning that many,  		perhaps the majority, of these very high cost problems are preventable. Most of  		the injuries and poisonings are preventable. Key efforts include improved auto  		safety design and use of seat belts. Many of the pregnancy and newborn problems  		could be avoided through better prenatal care, improved nutrition, prevention  		of substance use (including tobacco, alcohol and drugs), and genetic screening.  		Many of the mental health and other medical/surgical disorders could be  		prevented (e.g., AIDS and substance use prevention) or at least be identified  		earlier and treated in less intensive settings than the hospital. While  		policy-makers should consider how to widen coverage for disabled children and  		how to contain health care costs through case management, they should not  		forget the importance of prevention and public health programs which can reduce  		the incidence and costs of treatment in the long term.</p>
