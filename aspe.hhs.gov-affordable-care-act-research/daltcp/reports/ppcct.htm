</dl><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Child care has in recent years been the subject of considerable research  		as well as of debate within the policy making community. Issues surrounding  		child care are of particular interest at present as a consequence of the  		passage of the Family Support Act, which strengthens work requirements in the  		Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program while expanding access  		to child care. As the program changes occasioned by FSA are currently being  		implemented, it is timely to consider research on the child care decisions made  		by welfare mothers, and the association between these decisions and long-term  		welfare dependency.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the research to date on child care behavior has employed  		cross-sectional data, and has been concerned with identifying factors  		associated with choices of alternative modes of child care. Prominent themes in  		the prior research include the role of price, income, and attributes of care  		modes as relative determinants of choices (see, for example, Robins and  		Spiegelman 1978; Yaeger 1979; Lehrer 1983; Connelly 1988; Hofferth and Wissoker  		1990). A closely related line of research has investigated the effect of child  		care costs on female labor supply (Heckman 1974; Connelly, 1989; Blau and  		Robins 1988a).</p>
<p>Among the rare studies of child care from a longitudinal perspective are  		those of Floge (1985) and Blau and Robins (1988b). Floge's study, based upon a  		small sample of New York City mothers of preschool children, found that these  		mothers made frequent changes of child care arrangements. These findings are  		based upon a series of "snapshots" of the child-care arrangements in use at  		each of three interview dates. The data used did not, however, reveal how many  		times care arrangements had changed, or the ultimate duration of any of the  		arrangements used. Somewhat dissimilar findings emerge from the work of Blau  		and Robins (1988b), who study patterns of changes in employment status,  		employer, marital status, fertility, and child care arrangements. The data used  		provide counts of the number of changes of each of these behavioral dimensions  		during each of the first three years of a sample of childrens' lives. Blau and  		Robins's data indicate relatively low turnover rates in child care  		arrangements; in each of a child's first three years of life the expected  		number of child care arrangement changes is less than 0.1, for the sample as a  		whole.</p>
<p>This paper uses longitudinal data drawn from a sample of women on Aid to  		Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) at a point in time (August 1983),  		following their welfare, employment, and child care usage over the subsequent  		14-month period. It is thus able to address a number of issues of direct  		relevance to current issues in welfare policy. The data come from several  		sources: two interviews, during each of which the respondents were asked  		detailed questions about their recent patterns of work, schooling, job search  		and child care arrangements as well as numerous other questions about their  		preferences regarding child care attributes, family and household situation,  		and related topics; and official welfare case records containing information on  		AFDC grants, income disregards, and child care subsidy and reimbursement  		amounts. These data are described more fully below.</p>
<p>In our earlier analyses of these data, we have analyzed the mothers'  		preferences for various attributes of child care arrangements, their level of  		satisfaction with the arrangements actually used, and the correlates of both  		exit from AFDC and exit from child care arrangements (see Sonenstein 1989 and  		Sonenstein and Wolf 1988, forthcoming). Joesch (1989) has used a subsample of  		the same data to estimate a model of female labor supply, taking account of the  		complexities of the AFDC budget constraint, particularly as it relates to the  		reimbursement of child care costs. In a companion paper (Sonenstein and Wolf  		1990) we present a series of descriptive analyses, focusing upon who, within  		the welfare population, uses child care, how much and what kind of child care  		is used and the extent of turnover in child care arrangements.</p>
<p>In this paper the analysis consists mainly of multivariate models of  		exit from and entry into child care arrangements. The specific questions  		addressed here include:</p>
<ul><li>what are the correlates of "persistence" of a child care arrangement,  		  particularly those related to policy variables such as cost and type of care;  		  </li>
<li>how are a mother's subjective ratings of child care quality related  		  to the probability of changing, or ending, her current child care arrangement;  		  and </li>
<li>to what extent do perceived barriers to finding suitable child care  		  arrangements "explain" a mother' s subsequent likelihood of beginning an  		  episode of child care usage? </li>
</ul><p>Throughout, we concentrate on mothers of preschool children, since child  		care decisions for such children are of a very different nature than those of  		older children. Moreover, it is the mothers of very young children who have  		been the subject of the most intense debate regarding recent and prospective  		changes in the welfare system.</p>
<p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: first, we describe  		the phenomenon to be analyzed in more detail, relating it to the sampling plan  		for the data. We then lay out a variety of statistical models appropriate to  		the analysis. This is followed by a description of the variables used in the  		analysis. We then present the results of the analysis, discussing first the  		models of transitions out of child care arrangements among child care users,  		followed by the models of transitions into child care among users. A summary  		and discussion concludes the paper.</p>
<h2><a name="problem" id="problem">THE ANALYTIC PROBLEM</a></h2>
<p>As noted above, this paper focuses upon the correlates of two types of  		child care transitions: transitions out of child care arrangements, among women  		who use child care, and transitions into child care, among women not using  		child care. These are clearly problems that must be addressed with longitudinal  		data. Our approach to the analysis is to some extent dictated by the sampling  		and observation plan used to assemble the data. Here we discuss these issues in  		detail.</p>
<p>As noted already, the study from which our data are drawn began with the  		selection of a sample of mothers on AFDC during August 1983. The sample was  		drawn from AFDC records in three cities: Boston, Charlotte, and Denver. The  		sample was also highly stratified with respect to the mothers' employment  		status that month. Consequently, all of our analysis is based upon weighted  		statistics.</p>
<p>Once selected into the sample, the women were interviewed twice. The  		first interview, conducted during the summer of 1984, covered a number of  		topics and produced a detailed matrix of activities for the eight-month period  		September 1983-April 1984. Employment, schooling, job search, and child care  		"episodes" were retrospectively identified and recorded to the nearest  		half-month time unit.</p>
<p>The interview also included extensive questioning regarding the mothers'  		attitudes regarding several attributes of child care and their ratings of the  		child care arrangement then in use (if any) . Also, mothers who had used  		<b>no</b> child care during the 8-month retrospective period covered in the  		first interview were asked questions about perceived barriers to obtaining  		satisfactory care arrangements, and about their preferences regarding specific  		attributes of care arrangements. These items are of particular interest in the  		analysis that follows.</p>
<p>A second interview was conducted in 1985, which repeated many of the  		items from the first interview, and included an additional six-month "activity"  		module of the sort described above. As a result, the data from the two surveys  		combined provide a 14-month, or 28 "period", history of turnover in the  		sample's work, welfare, schooling, and child-care usage experience.</p>
<p>Also linked to the survey data are information from the women's AFDC  		case files including grant amount, reported earnings, disregards including any  		for child care expenses, and other information concerning child care payment  		policies such as the use of prepaid slots in liscenced day care centers. Note  		that members of the sample were interviewed whether or not they remained on  		AFDC. In fact, a substantial fraction of the sample did leave AFDC during the  		14-month follow-up period, and a number of these were subsequently observed to  		return to AFDC also within the follow-up period.</p>
<p>As indicated above, a major focus of the present analysis is the  		predictive power of the several attitudinal and perceptual indices administered  		in the interviews. These survey items can only be sensibly used in a  		<b>prospective</b> manner, that is as antecedent variables which may or may not  		help to predict outcomes observed later in time. When first interviewed, the  		respondents were asked the various attitudinal items concerning the child care  		arrangement in use at the end of April 1984; those respondents not using any  		child care arrangements at that time were asked separate items concerning  		perceived barriers to obtaining the type of care arrangement most preferred.  		Thus the logic of the questions asked compels us to analyze turnover in child  		care usage <b>after</b> April 1984, conditioning upon the situation in April  		1984. Furthermore, our knowledge of any child care turnover after April 1984  		comes only from the retrospective "activity" module administered in the second  		wave of the survey. This, in turn, forces us to restrict our analysis to child  		care arrangements observed <b>between</b> the first and second interviews, in  		other words over a six-month period.</p>
<p>Because of the survey-design features outlined above, we are not able to  		use all recorded episodes of child care use, nor all periods of child care use  		within episodes, in the analyses that follow. Excluded are any child care  		episodes that ended prior to April 1984, and, among any child care episodes  		that were in effect at the end of April 1984, we exclude the half-month periods  		that preceded that date. These features are illustrated in <a href="ppcct.htm#Figure1">Figure 1</a>. In this figure, four hypothetical child care  		histories are plotted on a time axis, the units of which are half-month  		periods. Periods in which child care is not being used are represented with a  		".", and periods in which child care is being used are represented with either  		a "-" for periods <b>excluded</b> from our analysis or a "x" for periods  		<b>included</b> in the analysis. A vertical line between periods 16 and  		17--i.e. indicating the end of April 1984--denotes the critical period used to  		include or exclude child care episodes from the analysis.</p>
<p>The first case, labeled (i), in <a href="ppcct.htm#Figure1">Figure 1</a> pertains  		to a woman whose child-care episode is already underway at the start of the  		14-month "window" of observation; the episode in question ends prior to period  		16 and therefore is excluded from the analysis. The second case depicts a child  		care episode which begins prior to period 16, but ends after period 16. Only  		the periods after number 16, however, are included. Case (iii) shows a child  		care episode which is observed to begin after period 16; this episode also  		remains in progress at the end of our observational window, a phenomenon known  		as right censoring. This presents no particular problems for the analysis. The  		final hypothetical case history in <a href="ppcct.htm#Figure1">Figure 1</a> illustrates  		a respondent who never uses child care during the observation period.</p>

</tr></table><p>The outcomes we seek to explain in our statistical analyses are the  		patterns of turnover in child care arrangements after period 16, that is, to  		the right of the vertical line separating periods 16 and 17 in  		<a href="ppcct.htm#Figure1">Figure 1</a>. Our model of "exits" from child care  		arrangements uses cases such as (ii); for that case note that there are eight  		"x"s, indicating child care usage, followed by "."s indicating that the  		arrangement has ended. In this case we consider a transition to have occurred  		in period nine. Our model of "entries" into child care uses cases such as (iii)  		and (iv) in <a href="ppcct.htm#Figure1">Figure 1</a>. Case (iii) is observed to begin a  		child care arrangement after two periods of non-usage (a transition in period  		three), while case (iv) is observed for 12 periods throughout which no child  		care arrangement is used (no transition) We now turn to a discussion of  		appropriate statistical tools for use with such data.</p>
<h2><a name="models" id="models">STATISTICAL MODELS</a></h2>
<h3>A Basic Discrete-Time Event-History Model</h3>
<p>The basic model used in most of our analysis is a discrete-time  		event-history model based upon a logistic regression model. The data  		corresponding to one observation, denoted by the subscript i, consists of a  		series y<sub><font>i1</font></sub>, y<sub><font>i2</font></sub>, ..., y<sub><font>iT</font></sub>,  		representing the outcome, and a corresponding series x<sub><font>i1</font></sub>, x<sub><font>i2</font></sub>, ...,  		x<sub><font>iT</font></sub>, representing the explanatory variables.  		The outcome is coded either 0, indicating no transition, or 1, indicating that  		a transition has occured. Since we are only examining those episodes of child  		care usage (or nonusage) in progress as of period 16 of our data, it follows  		that for each observation the outcome variables are a series of zeros which may  		or may not end with a 1; each observation provides us with, at most, one  		observed transition. Note also that the number of periods in a history (T) can  		vary from observation to observation. Recalling our discussion of  		<a href="ppcct.htm#Figure1">Figure 1</a>, T will always be equal to 12 (its maximum  		value in our analysis) if no transition occurs as of the end of the observation  		period.</p>
<p>As noted above we use a logistic regression for each element of the  		series y<sub><font>i1</font></sub>, y<sub><font>i2</font></sub>, ..., y<sub><font>iT</font></sub>. In  		particular, this regression model is of the form</p>
<p><b>(1a)</b>: prob[y<sub><font>it</font></sub> =  		1] = p<sub><font>it</font></sub> = exp(x<sub><font>it</font></sub>ß) / [1 + exp(x<sub><font>it</font></sub>ß)] </p>
<p>and</p>
<p><b>(1b)</b>: prob[y<sub><font>it</font></sub> =  		0] = q<sub><font>it</font></sub> = 1 / [1 + exp(x<sub><font>it</font></sub>ß)]. </p>
<p>Thus the probability of observing one respondent's entire sequence is  		merely the product of the probabilities of observing each element within it,  		that is,</p>
<p><b>(2a)</b>: prob[y<sub><font>i1</font></sub> =  		0, y<sub><font>i2</font></sub> = 0, ..., y<sub><font>i,T-1</font></sub> = 0, y<sub><font>iT</font></sub> = 1] =  		q<sub><font>i1</font></sub>q<sub><font>i2</font></sub>...q<sub><font>i,T-1</font></sub>P<sub><font>it</font></sub></p>

<p><b>(2b)</b>: prob[y<sub><font>i1</font></sub> =  		0, y<sub><font>i2</font></sub> = 0, ..., y<sub><font>i,T-1</font></sub> = 0, y<sub><font>iT</font></sub> = 0] =  		q<sub><font>i1</font></sub>q<sub><font>i2</font></sub>...q<sub><font>i,T-1</font></sub>q<sub><font>iT</font></sub></p>
<p>when i is not observed to make a transition in period T. This approach  		to analysis of event- history data is described in Allison (1982), and has been  		widely used in applications.</p>
<p>In our analysis we use the simplest possible form of this event-history  		framework, one in which we do <b>not</b> control for duration. By this we mean  		that. we do not include in the vector x<sub><font>it</font></sub> any  		variables representing the time elapsed since the previous event (i.e. since  		the last entry into child care, if we are analyzing exit from child care, or  		since the last exit from child care, if we are analyzing entry into child  		care). This constant-probability model is the baseline model against which any  		more complex models incorporating "duration dependence" would be tested. Our  		reasons for adopting this specification are several: (1) we do not always have  		reliable measures of elapsed time since the start of an episode, particularly  		for those which began prior to our 14-month "window"; (2) our earlier work  		(Sonenstein and Wolf 1988) did not find systematic evidence of duration  		dependence; (3) the statistical problems involved in models incorporating  		duration dependence with data on episodes sampled in progress, such as  		ours--that is, "left- censored" data--are formidable; and (4) apparent duration  		dependence can result from unmeasured heterogeneity. Due to the potential  		importance of unmeasured heterogeneity, we now describe a more complex  		statistical model which takes account of it.</p>
<h3>A Panel Logit Model with Heterogeneity</h3>
<p>The expressions for the event histories given in (2a) and (2b) are valid  		only if it is assumed that for a given respondent, the probability of a child  		care transition is independent, after taking account of all the variables  		included in the x-vector, from period to period. While this assumption is  		commonly made, it is a questionable one: it assumes, in effect, that there are  		no relevant omitted variables whose values persist from period to period. If  		there were an omitted variable whose value were fixed, for example, and this  		variable was related to the probability of a child care transition, then the  		joint probability of the sequence y<sub><font>i1</font></sub>,  		y<sub><font>i2</font></sub>, ..., y<sub><font>iT</font></sub> is something other than the simple product of the  		period-by-period probabilities p<sub><font>i1</font></sub>, ...,  		p<sub><font>iT</font></sub>.</p>
<p>Here we provide a brief description of a more general model, described  		more fully in Wolf (1987). In this model we assume that all relevant omitted  		variables have fixed values and can be collectively represented by a single  		factor z<sub><font>i</font></sub>. An individual's value for  		z<sub><font>i</font></sub> is not observed, of course, so we are  		required to assume a specific probabilistic distribution for the z's throughout  		the sample. In particular, we assume that z-takes on only integer values 0,  		..., N, with probabilities given by the binomial density with parameters N and  		r, that is</p>
<p><b>(3)</b>: prob(z<sub><font>i</font></sub> =  		k) = f<sub><font>k</font></sub> = N! [k! (N - k) !] <sup><font>-1</font></sup>r<sup><font>k</font></sup> (1 - r)  		<sup><font>N-k</font></sup>.</p>
<p>In (3) N is required to be a positive integer, and r is bounded by 0 and  		1. Note that if N equals 1, an individual' s value of z can be either 0, with  		probability 1-r, or 1, with probability r. This is the special case in which z  		represents an unmeasured dummy variable.</p>
<p>In order to implement this model it is necessary to fix the parameter N,  		at which point the remaining parameters of the model can be estimated using  		standard maximum-likelihood techniques. A typical approach would be to begin by  		fixing N=1, then estimating the remaining parameters; the value of N would be  		successively increased, and the model reestimated. The process should be  		continued until there is no appreciable increase in the value of the likelihood  		function. Note that as N approaches infinity, the distribution of z approaches  		normality.</p>
<p>The unmeasured factor represented by z<sub><font>i</font></sub> appears in the logistic regression for y<sub><font>it</font></sub>, as though it were an element of x<sub><font>it</font></sub>, that is we now have</p>
<p><b>(4a)</b>: prob[y<sub><font>it</font></sub> =  		1|z<sub><font>i</font></sub> = k] = p<sub><font>ikt</font></sub> = exp(x<sub><font>it</font></sub>ß +  		§k) / [1 + exp(x<sub><font>it</font></sub>ß +  		§k)]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><b>(4b)</b>: prob[y<sub><font>it</font></sub> =  		0|z<sub><font>i</font></sub> = k] = q<sub><font>ikt</font></sub> = 1 / [1+ exp(x<sub><font>it</font></sub>ß + §k)] </p>
<p>Equations (4a) and (4b) are <b>conditional</b> probabilities, with  		conditioning on the value of z<sub><font>i</font></sub>. The  		<b>unconditional</b> probability of a given respondent's event history now  		becomes</p>
<p><b>(5a)</b>: prob[y<sub><font>i1</font></sub> =  		0, ..., y<sub><font>i,T-1</font></sub> = 0, y<sub><font>iT</font></sub> = 1] = Ê<sub><font>k</font></sub>f<sub><font>k</font></sub>q<sub><font>ik1</font></sub>...q<sub><font>ik,T-1</font></sub>p<sub><font>ikT</font></sub></p>
<p>when i is observed to make a transition in period T, and</p>
<p><b>(5b)</b>: prob[y<sub><font>i1</font></sub> =  		0, ..., y<sub><font>iT</font></sub> = 0] = Ê<sub><font>k</font></sub>f<sub><font>k</font></sub>q<sub><font>ik1</font></sub>...q<sub><font>ikT</font></sub></p>
<p>when i is not observed to make a transition in period T. The unknown  		parameters of the model represented by (5a) and (5b) are ß, §, and  		r. As noted already, these are estimated using standard maximum-likelihood  		techniques.</p>
<p>Within this modeling structure there are a number of alternative ways to  		assess whether unmeasured heterogeneity is an important factor. one is to  		conduct likelihood-ratio tests, based upon chi-square statistics, for the model  		including heterogeneity against the simpler model in which it is not present  		[i.e the model given by (5a) and (5b) against that given by (2a) and (2b)].  		Furthermore, if the estimate of r is very close to 0 or 1, then the implied  		binomial distribution is one in which most people are alike, or nearly so, with  		respect to the value of the omitted factor. Finally, if the estimate of the  		parameter § is very small in absolute value or statistically no different  		from zero, we might tentatively conclude that unmeasured heterogeneity is not  		"important." This conclusion must, however, be qualified by the findings  		presented in Wolf (1987), which include evidence from a Monte-Carlo study of  		this model which indicate that the estimates of the heterogeneity parameters (r  		and §) are very imprecise.</p>
<h3>Interpretation of Results</h3>
<p>The regression coefficients--the ß vector, above--indicate the  		quantitative relationship between explanatory variables and the log-odds of the  		probability of a child care transition, that is the logarithm of the quantity  		pr[transition] / pr[no transition]. Somewhat more interpretable is a comparison  		of the predicted probabilities of a transition obtained when two alternative  		arrays of the explanatory variables, say x<sub><font>1</font></sub>,  		and x<sub><font>2</font></sub>, are substituted into the logistic  		response function, equation (la), along with the estimated values of the  		ßs. By varying just one of the explanatory variables, the difference in  		the computed probabilities, say p<sub><font>1</font></sub> and  		p<sub><font>2</font></sub>, can be interpreted as the partial effect  		of that explanatory variable on the probability of a child care transition.</p>
<p>Further inferences can be obtained by relating the estimated transition  		probabilities to the dynamics of child care episodes. Since the models we are  		estimating assume a constant transition probability from period to period, the  		duration of a child care episode will have a geometric distribution with mean  		length 1/p periods. This provides only a rough guide to mean spell length,  		however, since some of the explanatory variables (notably the mother's and the  		child's ages) do not remain constant throughout the spell.</p>
<p>Finally, "survival functions" showing the proportion of child care  		spells attaining a given duration can be computed. For a fixed x, implying via  		(lb) a fixed q--the probability of <b>not</b> making a transition in a given  		period--the probability of going t periods without making a transition is  		simply q<sup><font>t</font></sup>. The survivor function for child  		care episodes described by a fixed x is simply the sequence q, q<sup><font>2</font></sup>,  		q<sup><font>3</font></sup>, ... This sort of computation, like that  		described in the previous paragraph, must be viewed as only an approximation  		since the models we estimate include some time-varying variables.</p>
<h2><a name="variables" id="variables">VARIABLES USED IN THE ANALYSIS</a></h2>
<p>In this section we discuss the data and variables used in the analysis.  		We begin by defining subsample selection for the two types of child care  		transitions studied, then provide names and detailed definitions for the  		variables used in the multivariate analyses.</p>
<h3>Population At Risk</h3>
<p>Our analysis is restricted to mothers of preschool children. A  		respondent was classified as "at risk" of using child care arrangements if her  		"index child" was less than 6 at some point during the 14-month follow-up  		period of the study. The index child was the youngest child found in the AFDC  		records from which the sample was originally drawn. In some cases an even  		younger child appears during the follow-up period, either by being born to the  		respondent or by moving into the household. Of the 523 respondents in the  		entire sample, 357 were classified as "at risk" according to this  		criterion.</p>
<h3>Child Care Episodes</h3>
<p>As noted earlier, not all those at risk appear in our analysis. Again,  		the analysis of exits from child care is confined to mothers using child care  		at the end of April 1984, that is during period 16 of the 28-period (14-month)  		follow-up interval of the study. The analysis of entry into child care is  		confined to mothers who had <b>not</b> used child care at any time during  		periods 1-16.</p>
<p>We also limit our attention to child care used while the mother is  		either working, looking for work or in school. In our sample there are a few  		instances of child care used while the mother is not working, looking for work,  		or in school. In such instances the child care is used for only a few hours a  		week, and is likely to be short-lived, highly erratic with respect to  		scheduling, and consequently subject to quite different supply conditions and  		usage decisions. For these reasons such episodes of child care usage are not  		included in our analysis.</p>
<p><i><b>Transitions out of child care arrangements</b></i>. Of the 357  		women at risk, 140 were using child care, while simultaneously either working  		or enrolled in school, during period 16 and therefore appear in the analysis of  		transitions out of child care. We have classified child care arrangements into  		four types according to the relationship between child and caregiver and the  		location of the care (more details on this typology appear below). An important  		feature of our analysis of transitions out of child care is that such  		transitions are defined to occur either (1) when a child's care arrangement  		changes type <b>or</b> (2) when the care arrangement ends altogether.</p>
<p>Of the 141 child care episodes analyzed, 80 "exit" transitions were  		observed by this definition. <a href="ppcct.htm#Table1">Table 1</a> presents a  		tabulation of the pre- and post-transition child care arrangements, with  		percentages based on weighted frequencies.</p>
<p>The four types of arrangements listed are fairly self-explanatory.  		"Relatives at home" refers to care given by <b>any</b> relative of the child,  		in the child' s home, while "relatives away" means that the relative provides  		care outside the child's home. Care by nonrelatives consists mainly of family  		day care arrangements, although a very few situations of paid babysitters in  		the child's home are included in this category. "Center" care refers to the  		formal child care sector, including all types of licensed day care and  		child-development centers, nursery schools and so on. As <a href="ppcct.htm#Table1">Table 1</a> indicates, only a minority of the exits consist of  		transitions to no care. The type of child care arrangements most likely to end  		altogether are care given by relatives in the child's own home (44.6 percent),  		yet the range from the highest to lowest such percentages (the lowest being for  		care by nonrelatives at 31.5 percent) is rather small. When arrangements  		consisting of either care by relatives outside the child's home, or care by  		nonrelatives, end, the most likely transition is into center care. Moreover,  		when any of the four types of care arrangements end, the least likely  		transition is into care by nonrelatives. Together these patterns suggest, but  		by no means prove, that center care seems to be the most preferred arrangement,  		followed by care given by relatives in the child's home. Judging by the  		relative frequency of transitions in this sample, family day care is the least  		preferred arrangement. This tabulation, however, pertains only to those cases  		in which an actual transition took place, and fails to control for any of the  		other determinants of turnover.</p>

</tr></table><p><i><b>Transitions into child care</b></i>. In this analysis a transition  		into child care is defined as the beginning of <b>any</b> type of arrangement,  		providing that the child care is used in conjunction with the mother's work or  		enrollment in school. Of the 357 women at risk, 120 met the criterion for  		inclusion in this analysis, but of these 120 women only 20 were actually  		observed to begin a child care arrangement during the relevant time period.  		These 20 constitute a group too small to permit meaningful classification  		according to the type of arrangement begun.</p>
<h3>Explanatory Variables</h3>
<p>In the remainder of this section we list the variables used in the  		models of exit from, and entry into, child care arrangements. The variables  		listed all appear in one or more of the regressions reported later. There are,  		of course, numerous additional variables in the data set which might be  		relevant to turnover in child care arrangements, some of which were explored  		and rejected during the course of the research. One such variable deserves  		mention, namely that indicating any reimbursement or subsidy of child care  		costs through AFDC. This does not appear in the following analysis, due to the  		fact that such subsidies clearly depend upon the mother's AFDC status, which is  		in turn an endogenous variable. In order to reduce the complexity of the model,  		we have chosen not to explicitly represent AFDC status, and therefore must  		exclude any other variables whose value would depend upon AFDC status.</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: variables used in the "exit" analysis only are indicated  		with a single asterisk, those used in the "entry" analysis only are indicated  		with a double asterisk, and those used in both are indicated with a triple  		asterisk.</p>
<p><i><b>Socioeconomic, demographic, and background  		characteristics</b></i>.</p>
<p>AGEIND*** -- age of the index child (i.e. youngest child), in years.</p>
<p>BLACK*** -- dummy variable distinguishing blacks from all other  		races.</p>
<p>BOSTON*** -- a dummy variable indicating respondents living in  		Boston.</p>
<p>DENVER*** -- a dummy variable indicating respondents living in  		Denver.</p>
<p>JOBMOM*** -- a dummy variable indicating respondents whose mothers  		worked while the respondent was growing up.</p>
<p>AFDCFAM** -- a dummy variable indicating respondents who lived in a  		family that received AFDC while they were growing up.</p>
<p>TEENMOM*** -- a dummy variable indicating respondents whose first child  		was born at age 19 or less.</p>
<p>TEENSIT** -- a count of the number of teenagers in the household, a  		measure of potential supply of babysitters.</p>
<p>ADULTSIT** -- a count of the number of adults in the household, also a  		measure of potential supply of babysitters.</p>
<p>RELSABLE*** -- a dummy variable indicating the existence of nearby  		relatives able to provide child care if asked.</p>
<p>PWAGE** -- predicted wage of the mother, in dollars per hour; this is  		the predicted value based upon a supplementary analysis of wage rates among all  		respondents classified as "at risk" and is corrected for selectivity bias; see  		<a href="ppcct.htm#AppendixA">Appendix A</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>Characteristics of mother's activity, and of child care  		used</b></i>.</p>
<p>RELSAWAY* -- a dummy variable indicating that child care is provided by  		relatives outside the child's home.</p>
<p>NONRELS* -- a dummy variable indicating that child care is provided by  		nonrelatives, whether in or outside the child's home.</p>
<p>CENTER* -- a dummy variable indicating care in the formal child-care  		sector.</p>
<p>DOL/HR* -- cost of child care, in dollars per hour (including zeros for  		unpaid care).</p>
<p><i><b>Subjective ratings of child care: preferences, ratings, and  		barriers</b></i>.</p>
<p>ASSESS* -- an index summing respondents' assessment of their most recent  		child care arrangement on five dimensions: (1) Experience of caregiver (very  		experienced = 3, experienced = 2, some experience = 1, and little experience =  		0); (2) Child's feelings about arrangement (very happy = 3, happy = 2,  		indifferent = 1, not too happy = 0) ; (3) Child's opportunity to learn new  		things (most of the time = 3, frequently = 2, occasionally = 1, never = 0); (4)  		Child's feeling about the caregiving person (loving = 3, friendly= 2,  		indifferent = 1, and dislikes = 0); and (5) Safety precautions taken to prevent  		accidents (extremely careful = 3, careful = 2, somewhat careful = 1, and in  		need of improvement = 0). In a factor analysis using respondents' assessments  		of child care on 14 dimensions these five variables all loaded above .5 on a  		factor that explained 64 percent of the variance in the assessment scores.  		(Range of index = 0 - 15).</p>
<p>CONVENIENT* -- an index summing respondents' assessment of the  		convenience of the location of their child care arrangement and the convenience  		of the hours of care (very convenient = 3, convenient = 2, not very convenient  		= 1 and very inconvenient = 0). In a factor analysis of respondents, assessment  		of child care on 14 dimension these two variables loaded at .4 on a f actor  		that explained 15 percent of the variance in the assessment scores. (Range of  		index = 0 - 6).</p>
<p>HOME_UNA* -- days missed from work (school or training) in the last 8  		months because child care was unavailable. (Range = 0 - 60 days).</p>
<p>KIDS/ADULT* -- the ratio of the number of children care or together at  		the same time (group/class size) to the number of adults supervising the  		children (teachers/adults always at home). (Range = .25 - 12).</p>
<p>TRAINING* -- a dummy variable indicating that the person caring for the  		child had received special training in caring for children.</p>
<p>SATISFIED* -- respondent's reported general satisfaction with child care  		arrangement for youngest child (completely satisfied = 3, mostly satisfied = 2,  		somewhat satisfied = 1, not very or not at all satisfied = 0).</p>
<p>HOWHARD** -- in index summing the respondents' answers to questions  		about how easy would it be to find child care with the following  		characteristics: (1) affordable cost, (2) during the hours you need it, (3)  		with a person experienced in taking care of children, (4) with a warm and  		loving person, (5) that your child would like, (6) where discipline would be  		provided, (7) enough adult supervision, (8) dependably available (9) clean and  		safe, (10) where child learned new things, (11) where child could be cared for  		when sick, (12) with a person with special training in looking after children  		and (13) where all R's children could be looked after together. The response  		codes for each item were: very easy = 1, easy = 2, hard = 3 and very hard = 4.  		(Range of index = 12 - 48).</p>
<p>CHOICE_5** -- a dummy variable indicating that the respondent's first  		choice of type of day care is center care.</p>
<p>KNOW_NO** -- a count of the number of "no" responses given to a series  		of three survey questions dealing with programmatic aspects of AFDC. The  		questions are 'Can recipients of Aid for Families with Dependent Children  		(AFDC) earn up to a certain amount of money and still receive some AFDC  		payments?'; 'Are recipients of AFDC eligible for help in paying for child care  		if they work?'; and 'If you work while you are on AFDC will the [agency] deduct  		your child care expenses from the amount you earn when they figure out your  		grant payment?' In all cases a "no" response is incorrect, so that high scores  		on this index are associated with a lack of knowledge of the provisions of  		AFDC.</p>
<p>KNOW_DK** -- a count of the number of "don't know" responses given to  		the preceding series of three AFDC knowledge questions. Like the preceding  		variable, a high score on this is indicative of a lack of knowledge about  		AFDC.</p>
<h3>Descriptive Statistics</h3>
<p>Average values of the variables used in the multivariate models appear  		in <a href="ppcct.htm#Table2">Table 2</a>, with separate columns for the 141 respondents  		who appear in the "exit" analysis and the 120 who appear in the "entry"  		analysis; these are nonoverlapping subsamples of the mothers at risk. It should  		be noted that those in the exit sample appear an average of 8.9 times, due to  		the pooling over half-month periods, while the corresponding number is 10.4  		appearances per respondent in the entry analysis. Nonetheless each respondent  		appears only once in <a href="ppcct.htm#Table2">Table 2</a>; the observation used is  		that pertaining to period 16, the initial observation for each respondent.</p>
<p>There are slight differences between the two subsamples on a few of the  		indicators; for example, a higher proportion of those in the exit sample are  		black, and a higher proportion has relatives living nearby able to provide  		babysitting if asked. Both traits turn out to be associated with a greater  		tendency to use child care. Slightly under one-third of the mothers in the exit  		sample have their index child in center care. About 15 percent use nonrelative  		care (i.e. family day care), and the rest use care by relatives, either in the  		home (the omitted category, not shown) or away from the child's home. Thus it  		is not surprising that the average cost of care is so low, only 31 cents per  		hour. In fact, about half of the care used in this subsample costs the  		respondent nothing, although it must be remembered that some of the mothers  		have their children in fully-funded day care slots paid for by welfare/social  		service agencies.</p>

<p>We present our results in three parts; first, we discuss estimates of  		some simple models of exit from child care arrangements, and consider some of  		the quantitative implications of those findings. We then present a parallel  		discussion of the findings for entry into child care. The section concludes  		with a brief discussion of more complex models incorporating unmeasured  		heterogeneity.</p>
<h3>Basic Model of Exits</h3>
<p><i><b>Results of logit estimates</b></i>. <a href="ppcct.htm#Table3">Table 3</a>  		presents the coefficients and test statistics for three alternative logistic  		regressions for exit from child care arrangements. Equation (1) is a basic  		model, with explanatory variables limited to background characteristics and  		attributes of the child care arrangement itself. Equation (2) adds to this an  		overall index of the mother's satisfaction ("SATISFIED"), while equation (3)  		adds, instead, a series of five more fundamental indicators of the mother's  		rating of the child care arrangement. In preliminary work (not reported) using  		factor analysis we have found that these five indices--ASSESS, CONVENIENT,  		HOME_UNA, KIDS/ADULTS, and TRAINING--represent distinct underlying factors.</p>

</tr></table><p>In these results a positive coefficient indicates a variable which  		<b>raises</b> the per-period probability of exit, that is, the probability that  		the child care arrangement will end. A negative coefficient has the opposite  		effect, of reducing the probability of exit and hence of lengthening child care  		episodes. Thus positive coefficients can be associated with <b>less</b> stable  		arrangements, and negative coefficients with <b>more</b> stable  		arrangements.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that our indicator of "exits" makes no  		distinctions regarding the reasons for the exit. If the mother is concurrently  		working, the child care episode may end because the job ends, making the child  		care unnecessary (or, more likely, unaffordable), and the job ending, in turn,  		might reflect either the employer's or employee's decisions. On the other hand,  		the child care episode might end because the provider is no longer available.  		These several possibilities must be borne in mind when interpreting the  		findings in <a href="ppcct.htm#Table3">Table 3</a>.</p>
<p>In equation (1) we find significant site differences: child care spells  		appear to be less stable, and thus shorter on average, in Boston than in  		Charlotte (the omitted group). The child care arrangements used by blacks are  		also less stable. Women whose own mothers worked have more stable arrangements.  		It is tempting to interpret this as evidence that having a working mother  		causes young women to have more stable employment when they become mothers  		themselves. The results shown in <a href="ppcct.htm#Table3">Table 3</a> are consistent  		with, but not conclusive proof of, this interpretation.</p>
<p>The child care arrangements of older children (within the 0-5 age range  		considered here) are less stable. However this finding should not be discussed  		in isolation from the results for the various attributes of the care  		arrangement itself. Equation (1) shows that care provided by nonrelatives (i.e.  		family day care) is considerably less stable than other types (the omitted  		category, again, is care by relatives in the child's home). Care provided by  		relatives outside the child's home is also significantly more likely to end  		than is relative care in the home. The coefficient on center care is not  		statistically significant. However, the coefficient on day care costs (i.e. on  		DOL/HR) is highly significant although small in magnitude. Since older children  		are more likely to be in centers than in other arrangements, and since centers  		are more likely to involve out-of-pocket costs (and to cost more on average),  		the overall effect of using center-based care is probably shared across the  		coefficients on the child's age and the cost of care.</p>
<p>The results in equation (1) are, by and large, preserved in equations  		(2) and (3). In equation (2) the coefficient on the overall satisfaction index  		is large, negative, and highly significant. More satisfactory child care  		arrangements are also more stable and longer-lived arrangements. Some caution  		is probably in order with respect to this result, however. We do not control  		for the duration of the child care arrangement from its inception until the  		survey date, the date at which the satisfaction scale is administered. To an  		unknown extent mothers may become more and more satisfied with child care  		arrangements the longer they last. In other words there may be some reverse  		causality, with pre-survey duration (an unmeasured variable) "causing" high  		levels of reported satisfaction. At any rate, the <b>post</b>-survey durations  		of more satisfactory arrangements are longer than the post-survey durations of  		less satisfactory arrangements.</p>
<p>The possibility of reverse causality seems less severe in equation (3),  		in which SATISFIED is replaced by five somewhat more concrete measures  		(although these, again, represent the mother's ratings of the care arrangement  		in use as of the survey). The results indicate that of the five components of  		satisfaction with child care arrangements, the convenience dimension bears the  		strongest relationship to the per-period probability of exit.</p>
<p><i><b>Implications of exit models</b></i>. Some quantitative  		implications of the results shown in <a href="ppcct.htm#Table3">Table 3</a> appear in  		<a href="ppcct.htm#Table4">Table 4</a>. Here are shown predicted per-period  		probabilities of exit from child care, as well as mean spell length and  		survival probabilities at t=6 and t=12 months. The exit probabilities are  		obtained by simply substituting into the logistic response function [equation  		(la)] the estimated regression coefficients and a particular set of values of  		the explanatory variables. The mean spell lengths and survival probabilities  		are, in turn, derived from these exit probabilities as explained earlier.</p>

</tr></table><p>In <a href="ppcct.htm#Table4">Table 4</a> we use, for purposes of illustration,  		the coefficients from equation (2) in <a href="ppcct.htm#Table3">Table 3</a>, and the  		mean values from the "exit" sample shown in <a href="ppcct.htm#Table2">Table 2</a>. The  		first row of <a href="ppcct.htm#Table4">Table 4</a> shows a baseline case, in which the  		sample mean from <a href="ppcct.htm#Table2">Table 2</a> is used. This is a somewhat  		artificial example, since the computed probability refers to an individual,  		while the x-vector used in the computation refers to a sample mean, one in  		which a proportion is from each of three cities, each of two racial groups, and  		so on. The exit probability shown can, then, be interpreted as the <b>expected  		value</b> of the exit probability attached to an individual selected at random  		from the exit sample. As <a href="ppcct.htm#Table4">Table 4</a> shows, this baseline  		probability is rather high, 0.064 per half-month period. This, in turn, implies  		an average child-care spell of 7.8 months. The survival probabilities show that  		in a sample of identical such individuals, 45 percent of child care spells are  		expected to last as long as 6 months, and only 20 percent are expected to last  		a year. Again, recall that the latter computations can only be viewed as rough  		approximations.</p>
<p>In the rest of <a href="ppcct.htm#Table4">Table 4</a> we show the effects of  		replacing selected explanatory variables with indicated values while leaving  		all other variables at their average values. This allows us to view the  		<b>marginal</b> effects of the variables. For example, we see that the exit  		probabilities of blacks are higher than of other races (0.076 compared to  		0.043), other things held constant. This implies that blacks have child care  		spells shorter, on average, than do others. For each of the variables  		illustrated in the table we see substantial effects on per-period exit  		probabilities.</p>
<p><a href="ppcct.htm#Figure2">Figure 2</a> provides an additional illustration of  		the results. Here we see plotted survivor curves for three of the four types of  		child-care arrangements coded in the model: care by relatives at home, care by  		relatives away from home, and care by nonrelatives (the fourth type, center  		care, is not shown because its survivor curve is nearly coincident with that  		for relatives away from home). The probabilities used to compute these survival  		curves are those shown in <a href="ppcct.htm#Table4">Table 4</a>. The curves indicate  		that the median length of nonrelative care (i.e. family day care), care by  		relatives away from home, and care provided by relatives in the child's home  		are about 6, 11, and 15 months, respectively.</p>

<p><i><b>Results of logit estimates</b></i>. Estimates of three alternative  		entry-into-child-care equations are shown in <a href="ppcct.htm#Table5">Table 5</a>.  		Although the episodes analyzed here are defined by the use or nonuse of child  		care, it must be remembered that in most cases use of child care coincides with  		employment. Thus to some extent our child care entry equation is an employment  		entry equation.</p>
<p>Somewhat loosely, the explanatory variables investigated in this  		analysis fall into three categories; (1) subjective indices of the mother's  		perceptions of and information about barriers to obtaining child care, and of  		the mother's preferences for alternative child care arrangements; (2) the  		mother's potential market wage, theoretically of great importance in  		determining the woman's choice to work, and an unobserved attribute which must  		be imputed using auxiliary multivariate analyses; and (3) other fixed  		background and socioeconomic traits, many of which are in turn used to impute  		the potential market wage. The need to estimate an auxiliary wage function  		leads to an identification problem in the child-care entry equation, since at  		least one of the variables used in the wage-predicting equation must be  		excluded from the child care equation. There is an inherent arbitrariness in  		any exclusion used to identify the child care equation, and our experience  		suggests that the results obtained are rather sensitive to the choice of  		identifying restrictions. The results chosen for inclusion in <a href="ppcct.htm#Table5">Table 5</a> are fairly representative and "reasonable." However  		it should be acknowledged that equation (3) is the only one, among several  		alternatives that were tested, in which the predicted wage variable is  		statistically significant.</p>
<p>Equation (1) in <a href="ppcct.htm#Table5">Table 5</a> does not include the  		predicted wage variable, and does not include any variables used in computing  		the predicted wage. Most of the variables in equation (1) pertain to the  		preferences and perceptions indices of key interest in our analysis. The  		coefficients on ROD and CHOICE_5, both of which are positive and significant,  		appear to be counterintuitive. The first of these coefficients indicates that  		mothers who think that the type of care they most prefer is hard to obtain are,  		nonetheless, more likely than other mothers to begin a child care arrangement.  		The second can be interpreted similarly, since it shows that mothers whose  		preferred arrangement is center care, presumably a more demanding preference to  		satisfy than its less formal alternatives, have significantly higher  		probabilities of beginning a care arrangement.</p>

</tr></table><p>A possible rationalization of the results for HOWHARD and for CHOICE_5  		is that women with preferences and perceptions of this sort are better informed  		about the nature of the child care market, perhaps because they are actively  		engaged in search for a job and/or a child care arrangement. They may also have  		more previous experience of this market (a possibility which our data  		regrettably prevent us from testing). This "knowledge" interpretation happens  		to dovetail nicely with the results for the two indicators of lack of knowledge  		concerning the child- care reimbursement provisions of AFDC. Both of the AFDC  		knowledge indicators show that less-informed mothers are less likely to  		commence a child care episode, although the result is statistically significant  		[in equation (1)] only for the second of these two variables.</p>
<p>The coefficient on the child's age is negative, indicating a lower  		probability of beginning child care; this is the mirror image of the  		corresponding result in the exit equation, where it was found that the care  		arrangements of older children are relatively more likely to end.</p>
<p>Equation (2) adds a number of background characteristics to the  		equation, several of which turn out to be statistically significant. Three  		family-background factors--having grown up with a mother who worked, having  		grown up in a welfare family, and being a teenage mother oneself--all appear to  		inhibit entry into child care arrangements. But by far the largest effect in  		equation (2) is the race effect, which shows that black mothers are much more  		likely than mothers of other races to begin a child care arrangement.</p>
<p>Equation (3) is similar to equation (2), but it includes the predicted  		wage while excluding the race indicator. Based upon several unreported  		equations, it appears that only by excluding the race variable does the  		predicted wage become statistically significant. In general, however, the  		predicted wage has the theoretically anticipated sign (positive).</p>
<p><i><b>Implications of entry models</b></i>. We have not included a table  		of illustrative probabilities, analogous to <a href="ppcct.htm#Table4">Table 4</a>, in  		the case of the entry equations. The reason for this is the apparently highly  		skewed nature of the implied entry probabilities. When we substitute sample  		mean values (from <a href="ppcct.htm#Table2">Table 2</a>) into an entry equation [in  		particular equation (2) in <a href="ppcct.htm#Table5">Table 5</a>] we find that the  		"representative" per-period probability of beginning a child care episode is  		only 0.0001. Since the actual number of child care entries in the sample is 20,  		in a sample containing approximately 1200 "units" of exposure (i.e. 120  		observations with an average of 10.4 periods per respondent in the sample) ,  		the empirical average entry probability, while quite low, is nonetheless higher  		than 0.0001. A likely explanation for this situation is that the great majority  		of the sample has extremely low entry probabilities, while a small group has  		rather high probabilities; the logit model, a nonlinear model, appears not to  		capture the average of these two groups very well. Note that the <b>average  		probability</b> in the sample need not equal the probability attached to an  		<b>average individual</b> in this nonlinear model. Another possibility is that  		the estimates shown in <a href="ppcct.htm#Table5">Table 5</a> imply unexpectedly low  		average probabilities due to the failure of the estimates to control for  		unmeasured heterogeneity in the sample. Consequently we now turn briefly to a  		discussion of this issue.</p>
<h3>Models With Unmeasured Heterogeneity</h3>
<p>Our efforts to estimate the random-effects panel logit model described  		earlier, and represented by equations (3) through (5b), have so far met with  		only limited success. We have estimated variations on an exit model, one  		containing only two fixed covariates: JOBMOM and CONVENIENT. These are two  		variables which generally emerge as statistically significant in the simpler  		models presented earlier. The questions addressed in this exercise are (1) is  		there evidence of unmeasured heterogeneity, and does its presence in the model  		alter our conclusions about other measured variables? and (2) how does the  		model perform as we alter N, the (preset) parameter representing the number of  		points in the unmeasured-heterogeneity distribution?</p>
<p>Concerning the second of these questions, our limited experience to date  		suggests that the model is little affected by changes in N. The model (with two  		measured covariates as noted in the preceding paragraph) was estimated for N=1,  		N=2, and N=5. For these three variants, at least, the maximized value of the  		likelihood function changed only in the thousandths.</p>
<p>Parameter estimates for the second of these models (with N=2) are shown  		in <a href="ppcct.htm#Table6">Table 6</a>.</p>
<p>The most immediately apparent findings in <a href="ppcct.htm#Table6">Table 6</a>  		are the enormous standard errors of the two parameters that represent  		unmeasured heterogeneity, r and §. Note that neither is estimated  		directly; rather, we estimate a logistic transform of r--that is, exp(r) / [1 +  		exp(r)]--in order to guarantee that r lies between 0 and 1, as required, and  		the natural logarithm of §, in order to impose the constraint  		§&gt;0.</p>

<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">DISCUSSION</a></h2>
<p>In this study we have investigated f actors associated with turnover in  		the child care arrangements of AFDC mothers. The phenomenon under study is an  		extremely complicated one, in view of the fact that welfare mothers seek child  		care arrangements in combination with a variety of productive activities  		including work, schooling or training programs, and job search. The correlates  		of entry into and exit from any of these types of activities therefore become,  		indirectly, correlates of turnover in child care arrangements. A further  		complication arises because each of these activities is linked to the process  		of entry to and exit from AFDC itself, which in turn alters the availability  		and net price of child care, and does so differently according to the type of  		care.</p>
<p>Our approach to these issues has been to simplify the problem in several  		respects, particularly by focusing simply upon the determinants of ending or  		beginning a child care arrangement, regardless of reason or type of concurrent  		activity.</p>
<p>A particular concern in our study has been to take account of mothers'  		preferences, perceptions, and knowledge about child care arrangements, both the  		actual arrangements used--among those in our sample observed to be using child  		care when interviewed--and potential arrangements--among those not using child  		care when interviewed, some of whom later began to use it.</p>
<p>The findings indicate that the mothers' perceptions are strongly related  		to their patterns of child care use. Among those using care when interviewed,  		those most satisfied with their care--measured with a four-point global  		satisfaction scale--had significantly lower probabilities of ending their child  		care arrangement per half-month period. A more disaggregated representation of  		satisfaction with care revealed that the convenience of the arrangement was the  		most important of several dimensions of satisfaction. Controlling for these  		scales, we found additional differentials in exit probabilities according to  		type of care: care by nonrelatives, which is in effect "family day care",  		emerged as significantly less durable arrangement than other types.</p>
<p>Considering those mothers not using child care when first interviewed,  		once again we found several indices of preferences and perceptions which appear  		to be significant predictors of entry into child care. An unexpected finding is  		that mothers who scored high on an index measuring their perceptions of the  		difficulty of finding satisfactory care were also more likely to begin a child  		care arrangement. Similarly, mothers whose most preferred type of care was  		center care-care in the formal service sector--were more likely to begin using  		care than were mothers preferring other types of arrangements.</p>
<p>Both these findings, however, seem consistent with an interpretation  		such, that better-informed mothers are more likely to use care. This  		interpretation is further supported by additional findings which show that  		women unaware of the child-care subsidy provisions of AFDC are less likely to  		begin using care than women who know about those provisions.</p>
<p>Our data do not, unfortunately, provide us with sufficient observations  		to make a systematic investigation into the agreement between stated  		preferences and the actual arrangements obtained. This would be an obvious area  		in which further investigations would be useful. Nonetheless, as they stand our  		findings seem to offer several insights into current child care policy issues.  		One is that policies which lower the cost of care will probably lead to more  		stable child care arrangements. Our "exit" equations consistently show that the  		higher the out-of-pocket cost of care, the greater is the likelihood that the  		care will end in a given period. However, the durability of child care would  		undoubtedly be enhanced either through lowering its cost, or through successful  		efforts to increase wage rates.</p>
<p>Another conclusion supported by our fin dings is that type of care may  		be less crucial than other attributes as an influence on the durability of  		care. Moreover, not all attributes appear to be equally important. For example,  		policies that succeed in raising adult/child ratios, or in mandating more  		stringent training or credentialing requirements on the part of providers,  		might contribute little to turnover patterns, at least within the welfare  		population, if they fail to lead to improved convenience as perceived by the  		mothers using the care. And, finally, it seems reasonable to conclude that the  		work behavior of welfare mothers would be promoted by policies which enhance  		those women's level of knowledge concerning the range of available child care  		services, and, equally important, the range of programmatic options open to  		them through the welfare program.</p>
<h2><a name="AppendixA" id="AppendixA">APPENDIX A: PREDICTED WAGE ANALYSIS</a></h2>
<p>Our estimation of a predicted-wage equation uses data from the entire  		sample of women defined as "at risk" according to the criteria spelled out in  		the text. A wage equation was estimated using a subsample of at-risk women who  		were observed to have a wage rate at any point during the 14-month follow-up  		period of the study. Wherever possible we selected the wage rate observed at  		the <b>start</b> of an episode of employment. When this was not possible we  		controlled for the woman's tenure on the job for which the wage was observed.  		Using this approach we are able to predict a woman's <b>starting</b> wage were  		she to begin employment. The wage equation was estimated (in logarithmic form)  		using the "Mill's-ratio" approach to correction for subsample selectivity as  		outlined in Heckman (1976).</p>
<p>The estimates of both the selection and the wage equation are presented  		in <a href="ppcct.htm#TableA1">Table A1</a>. This table also includes the sample mean  		values for the variables used, for both the full sample (used-in the selection  		equation) and the subsample for which wages were observed.</p>
<p>The variables used in these equations include some not previously  		defined, including:</p>
<p>AGE -- respondent's age, in years.</p>
<p>AGESQ/100 -- respondent's age, squared (in 100s).</p>
<p>GRANDPAR -- a dummy variable indicating the presence in the household of  		the index child's grandparents).</p>
<p>YRS_ADDR -- the number of years the respondent has lived at her current  		address (as of the second interview).</p>
<p>YRS_AFDC -- the number of years the respondent has received AFDC in her  		lifetime (as of the second interview).</p>
<p>ED&lt;12 -- a dummy variable indicating those with less than a  		high-school education.</p>
<p>ED=12 -- a dummy variable indicating those with exactly a high-school  		education.</p>
<p>ED&gt;12 -- a dummy variable indicating those with more than 12 years of  		schooling (the omitted category pertains to those with missing information on  		years of education).</p>
<p>TENURE -- job tenure (in years) on the job currently held.</p>
<p>HOURS -- hours of work on the job currently held.</p>
<p>The variable LAMBDA appearing in the wage equation represents the Mill's  		ratio term used to correct the equation for sample selectivity. Although the  		wage equation estimated controls for both job tenure and hours of work, the  		predicted wage entered in the logistic regressions reported in the paper set  		tenure to zero and hours to 16; the former is done in order to represent  		entry-level wages, while the latter is done in order to standardize the wage  		for hours of work. Any fixed number of work hours could be used for this  		purpose, and the number 16 was chosen because it is close to the sample mean  		for those respondents actually observed to work.</p>
