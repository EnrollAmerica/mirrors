<h2><a name="chapI" id="chapI">I. DEMAND FOR CHILD CARE AND CONCEPTUAL MODEL</a></h2>
<h3>A. The Demographics of Labor Force-Related Child  		Care<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup></h3>
<h4>Numbers of Children</h4>
<p>The demand for child care is influenced by many factors.  		Demographically, the post-World War II baby boom resulted in record numbers of  		births between 1946 and 1964. And although the birth rate and fertility rate of  		women have decreased since 1960, these baby boomers are now having children of  		their own. As a result, the number of preschool children (less than six years  		old)--previously declining from the mid 1960s to the late 1970s--is increasing  		once again and expected to reach 23 million by 1990 (only slightly lower than  		the number of preschoolers at the height of the baby boom).<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> In addition, the number of  		school-age children declined until 1985, after which the numbers are expected  		to increase to almost 45 million into the 1990s (see <a href="#figureI-1">Figure I-1</a> and <a href="#figureI-2">Figure I-2</a>).</p>
<h4>Numbers of Working Mothers</h4>
<p>While the numbers of preschool and school-age children declined during  		the seventies, the rate at which the -mothers of these children have entered  		the labor force has consistently increased since 1970 (see <a href="#tableI-1">Table I-1</a>).</p>

</ol></td>
</tr></table><p>Robins attributes this increase to social factors, including the  		development and increased use of the contraceptive Pill, which may have led to  		delayed childbearing and reduced fertility. There has also been a reduced  		stigma in leaving young children in the care of others; most research indicates  		that it does not have harmful developmental effects on children. Finally,  		divorce has forced increasing numbers of mothers into the work force.</p>
<p>Robins also notes economic factors influencing a women's decision to  		enter (or re-enter) the work force. Changes in the job market over the last 10  		years, including a rise in women's real wages and increased service jobs with  		flexible schedules, have made working more desirable. Second, the desire to  		maintain or obtain a higher standard of living has led many women to enter the  		labor force. Finally, increased subsidization of child care costs, through tax  		credits and program expenditures, has helped mothers to work and obtain help  		with their child care needs.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<h4>Children with Employed Mothers</h4>
<p>These increased <b>labor force participation rates of mothers</b> have  		more than compensated for the decline in the <b>total number of children</b>,  		resulting in consistently increasing numbers of <b>children with employed  		mothers</b>. The number of preschool children with mothers in the labor force  		has grown by 75 percent over the past 15 years (from 6 million in 1970 to 10.5  		million in 1985). In addition, the number of school-age children (6-17) with  		mothers in the labor force has increased 22.4 percent over the same period. The  		most recent projections show that these numbers will continue to rise into the  		next decade, as trends in total numbers of children <i>and</i> labor force  		participation rates begin to reinforce each other, accelerating the number of  		children with employed mothers (see <a href="#figureI-1">Figure I-1</a> and  		<a href="#figureI-2">Figure I-2</a>).</p>

<p>These statistics elicit concern about the care of the children of these  		working mothers. Since mothers have traditionally been primary caregivers,  		researchers have always been concerned about the impact their absence has on  		children.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>B. Understanding Determinants of Child Care Choice</h3>
<p>If we can understand why certain families choose different types of  		care, we can better estimate future trends in the patterns of care used by all  		families, which would prove useful to child care program planners, private  		providers of care, and public agencies concerned with child care issues.</p>
<p>The overall observed demand for care is simply the aggregate of  		individual families' choices of care. Approaching the demand for child care at  		this micro-level requires asking: "What characteristics of the family, mother,  		and child influence their choice of care arrangements?" This section  		incorporates the implicit and explicit theories of the reviewed researchers and  		presents a conceptual model outlining the variables affecting the demand for  		child care.</p>
<p>The choice of child care arrangements is the result of a decision-making  		process involving:</p>
<ol><li>assessing the <i>preferences</i> for child care (considering type of  		  care and hours of care desired), and</li>
<li>reviewing the obtainable set of options, as determined by the  		  family's <i>budget constraints</i>.</li>
</ol><p>Generally the type of child care <i>demanded</i> is determined by the  		<b>type of care preferred</b>, and the <b>hours the care is desired</b> (both  		total amount and <i>which</i> hours). The <b>type of care preferred</b> is  		often related to the age of the child: there appear to be stages of care that  		differ for infants, toddlers, and older preschoolers. Parents may prefer to  		have their younger children (especially infants and toddlers) in nurturing,  		family-like environments. Parents of older preschoolers (3 5 years old) may  		wish to have their children exposed to other children to begin to develop their  		social skills. Also, the number of children of each age helps determine the  		preferred type of care.</p>
<p>One factor that helps determine the <b>hours of care desired</b> is the  		age of the child: preschoolers require more continuous care while school-age  		children are likely to require care only when they are not in school (their  		primary arrangement), to "wrap-around" the hours the parents are unable to care  		for them.</p>
<p>These required hours of care consist of time the parent can care for the  		child and time that other "outside" arrangements must be made. The search for  		potentially available caregivers presumably begins in the home, with the  		parents. Consequently, the presence of another adult in the household may  		result in his or her being used to provide care rather than arrangements  		outside the home.</p>
<p>Finally, the extent to which the parent(s) or other close relatives work  		and the shifts of those work hours constrain the hours they are able to care  		for their child(ren) themselves, and outside arrangements are more likely to be  		pursued.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The family's <i>budget constraints</i> are defined by the <b>costs of  		available care</b> (influenced by the current supply of different types of  		care) and the <b>family's ability to pay</b> for alternative forms of care.  		Therefore, the type of care ultimately chosen is determined by the family's  		unconstrained demand for certain arrangements, tempered by the financial  		realities affecting their ability to achieve these preferences.</p>
<p>All the researchers reviewed in this paper have either implicitly (by  		reporting child care usage rates by different social and economic variables) or  		explicitly (through multi-variate analyses) determined the <i>age of the  		child</i>, the <i>mother's employment</i><sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup> and <i>marital statuses</i><sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup> and <i>family income</i> to be  		the most influential factors in a family's child care arrangement  		decisions.<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup> The  		schematic on the following page highlights these as the primary determinants of  		care choice (see <a href="#figureI-3">Figure I-3</a>).</p>
<p>This figure also includes the <i>mother's education</i> and  		<i>occupation</i>, <i>her age</i>, <i>race</i>, and <i>location</i> (region and  		whether a metropolitan area) as tertiary variables having more indirect or  		questionable effects on these decisions. When excluded from the analyses, these  		"indirect" factors probably express their influence through these other more  		"direct" variables.</p>

<h2><a name="chapII" id="chapII">II. CHILD CARE ARRANGEMENTS</a></h2>
<p>In the past, when people discussed "child care," they most likely were  		referring to child care in centers. They perceived child care in terms of  		formal arrangements, perhaps defining it by whether or not payment was  		required. Yet some forms of care are less "formal" (like relative and sitter  		care) and often require no form of payment (like relative care). Since these  		are inarguably forms of child care--indeed, often very prevalent forms--this  		paper reviews patterns of both formal and informal arrangements.</p>
<p>This paper presents patterns of <b>primary care arrangements</b>, that  		is, arrangements used most by the respondent during the survey reference  		period. These arrangements have been categorized as: parental care (care by  		either the father or mother, including if she works at home or cares for the  		child at work), relative care (care by any of the child's relatives, either in  		or out of the child's home, excluding sibling care), sitter or nanny care (care  		by a nonrelative in the child's home), family day care (care by a nonrelative  		in their home), and center or nursery school care (formal programs at a  		designated child care center or school).</p>
<h3>A. Trends in Child Care Arrangements</h3>
<p>The past twenty years brought a growth in the number of children with  		mothers in the labor force. Simultaneously, it has brought a change in the  		<i>patterns</i> of care for the children of these employed mothers. "Between  		1965 and 1982, there was a gradual decline in care by a relative (including  		parents), a large decline in care by a non-relative in the child's home  		(sitter), modest increase in care by a non-relative in their home (family day  		care home), and an enormous increase in care in a day care center or nursery  		school."<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup></p>
<p>As presented in the conceptual model, the demand for these types of  		primary care varies considerably with the age of the child for whom the care is  		needed. It is not useful (and indeed, may be misleading) to discuss  		collectively the care arrangements for a two-year-old and a ten-year-old, for  		instance. Researchers recognize this and usually report separate analyses on  		the child care arrangements used for preschoolers<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup> from those used for school-age children.  		Since most parents report that school-age children are in elementary school as  		their "primary" arrangement, those data do not support very insightful  		analysis. This paper focuses on the primary care arrangements for preschoolers  		only.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The way the data were presented by the researchers precluded determining  		trends in the prevalence of each type of care for <i>each</i> employment and  		marital status of the mother, income level, race, etc. However, comparisons  		were possible for preschool children of mothers working part-time with those  		working full-time. Reviewing these trends are useful.</p>
<p>In 1965, the largest share of <b>preschoolers, with full-time (FT)  		employed mothers</b> were in relative care (36.0 percent), either in or out of  		the child's home. The fewest could be found in center care (8 percent). By  		1985, relative care slipped to be the third most frequently-used type of care  		for preschoolers with FT-employed mothers (24.0 percent). Most of these  		children were in center care (30 percent) and family day care (27 percent) in  		1985 (see <a href="#tableII-1">Table II-1</a>). <i>Thus, for the first time  		since these data have been collected, the "formal" arrangements of family day  		care and center/nursery school care became the most frequently used type of  		care for these children by 1985 (see <a href="#figureII-1">Figure  		II-1</a>)</i>.</p>
<p>In 1965, among <b>preschoolers with part-time (PT) employed mothers</b>,  		over half (55 percent) were cared for by their parents, and 25 percent were  		cared for by other relatives (both in and out of the child's home). These  		arrangements continued to be the two most prevalent over time: in 1985, 36  		percent of the children of PT-employed mothers were cared for by parents and 27  		percent were cared for by other relatives. The interesting trends occurred  		among the remaining types of care. Sitters (nonrelatives in the child's home),  		who were after parental and relative care in usage in 1965, were the least used  		form of care as early as 1977. At that time, family day care became the next  		most heavily used care (after parental and other relative care) and remained  		such until 1985, when center care ranked third (see <a href="#tableII-1">Table  		II-1</a>). <i>As with FT-employed mothers, child care arrangements among  		PT-employed mothers with preschool children are becoming more formal and less  		"family-based." However, informal, family-type arrangements still constituted  		about 70 percent of all care used by PT-employed mothers in 1985 (see  		<a href="#figureII-2">Figure II-2</a>)</i>.</p>

<p>Hofferth and Phillips (1987) investigated patterns of <i>nonparental</i>  		child care use among mothers working part- and full-time for preschoolers less  		than three and 3-4 years old. This age distinction allows investigation of each  		group's different usage patterns and determination of which age population is  		driving this growth in formal care.</p>
<h4>Center/Nursery School Care</h4>
<p>Hofferth and Phillips found that among <i>all</i> employed mothers,  		older preschoolers (3-4 years old) were consistently more likely than younger  		preschoolers (&lt;3 years old) to be found in center care. Full-time-employed  		mothers were also more likely than part-time-employed mothers to use center  		care--regardless of the age of their preschooler. There was phenomenal growth  		in the use of centers by mothers of both employment statuses and both groups of  		preschoolers between 1965 and 1982, with <b>full-time-employed mothers of  		3-4-year-olds</b> and <b>part-time-employed mothers of infants and toddlers  		(&lt;3)</b> accounting for most of it (+345 percent and +209 percent,  		respectively. See <a href="#tableII-2">Table II-2</a>).</p>
<h4>Family Day Care</h4>
<p>Findings also showed that family day care has, consistently over time,  		been used more often for children less than three than for older preschoolers.  		It has also been used slightly more often for children of FT-employed mothers  		than of PT-employed mothers, with one exception: in 1982, <b>PT-employed  		mothers with older preschoolers</b> used family day care slightly more often  		than FT-employed mothers with older preschoolers (26.5 percent versus 21.8  		percent, respectively). Indeed, this former group is responsible for the  		largest increase in the use of family day care by all families (+73 percent  		from 1965 to 1982), while family day care use among <b>FT-employed mothers with  		3-4-year-olds</b> actually declined somewhat during this period (from 24  		percent to 22 percent. See <a href="#tableII-2">Table II-2</a>).</p>

<p><a href="#tableII-3">Table II-3</a> provides the distribution of types  		of primary care arrangements by age of child for 1985.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup> Unlike Hofferth and Phillips (1987), this  		table <i>includes</i> parental care as a primary care arrangement, as well as  		breaking out infants from toddlers in the &lt;3 category, but it does  		<i>not</i> provide a breakdown by mother's employment status.</p>
<p>Most <b>infants (less than a year old)</b> had relatives other than  		their parents as their primary caregivers in 1985 (28.1 percent). Parents were  		the next most frequently used (26.3 percent). Centers were used for only 14.1  		percent of infants. <b>Toddlers (ages one and two years old)</b> were found in  		similar proportions in family day care (26.9 percent), other relative care  		(25.9 percent), and parental care (24.3 percent). Centers were more often used  		for toddlers (17.2 percent) than for infants. Finally, <b>older preschoolers (3  		and 4 years old)</b> were most often found in centers (32.7 percent), with  		parental and other relative care the next most often used (22.8 and 21.3,  		respectively).</p>
<p>These data appear to support the conceptual model which postulates that  		parents prefer to have their youngest children in more family-like arrangements  		and their older preschoolers in the more social setting of centers.</p>

</tr></table><p>Brush (1987) attempted to determine systematically which demographic and  		financial variables affect child care arrangement decisions. She ran probit  		regressions of each individual type of care used on these variables.<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup> The degree to which the  		variables determined the likelihood of using the type of care varied--not  		surprisingly--with the type of care being analyzed. In summary, Brush (1987)  		found:</p>
<h4>Father Care</h4>
<ul><li>Fathers are much more often used when mothers work part- rather than  		  full-time.</li>
<li>Not surprisingly, single mothers, whether or not they live with  		  another adult, are less likely to use father care than are married  		  couples.</li>
<li>The greater the number of children under ten, the more likely the  		  family is to use father care.</li>
<li>Mothers with coursework beyond college were less likely to use father  		  care than <b>less</b> educated mothers.</li>
<li>Father care is <b>least</b> prevalent in the South than in the  		  remaining regions.</li>
</ul><p>These results suggest father care is most frequently used in families  		where the father is present, where the hours a mother works have less overlap  		with the hours a father works, and in regions of the country where center care  		is either less readily available or more costly.</p>
<p>Interestingly, family earnings was not a significant predictor of use of  		father care. This does not mean there is no income effect; rather, the effect  		may be completely picked up by the education and occupation variables. For  		instance, higher educated-educated mothers and those commanding a relatively  		higher salary (in technical and sales occupations) tend to be married to  		fathers with similar characteristics, rendering father care a financially  		unwise or infeasible option.<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup> Reviewing patterns of care by family  		earnings, <b>without</b> education and occupation to confound results, a clear  		income effect is evident: those with higher incomes use consistently less  		parental care (see <a href="#figureII-3">Figure II-3</a>).</p>
<h4>Grandmother Care</h4>
<p>The patterns of variables that predict grandmother care are not as  		consistent across the age of children as some of the models predicting the use  		of other care. Given this inconsistency, some patterns that emerge are:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Single mothers with another adult present in the household (probably  			 the grandmother?) are more likely to use grandmothers than are married  			 couples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Families with lower earnings and children 1-10 years old use  			 grandmothers more often than families with higher earnings; somewhat  			 surprisingly, families with higher earnings and infants (&lt;1 year old) use  			 grandmothers more frequently than families (with infants) with lower  			 earnings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grandmothers are used more frequently the fewer the number of  			 children there are between 0 and 6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mothers under age 35 are more likely to use grandmother care than  			 are mothers over age 35.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mothers in labor or craft occupations are more likely to use  			 grandmothers than mothers in technical and sales occupations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among school-age children, there is more frequent grandmother care  			 in nonwhite than white families.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These results seem to imply that where grandmothers are available, they  		are often used, particularly by families whose finances constrain them to such  		free or low cost care. In families with infants and in nonwhite families,  		grandmother care may be the unconstrained preference.<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<p><a href="#figureII-3">Figure II-3</a> shows that in single parent  		families there appears to be a distinct substitution of other relatives for the  		father (in two-parent families), particularly in low-income families. An income  		effect is especially likely for two-parent families when the mother is working  		full-time.</p>
<h4>Family Day Care (care in a nonrelative's home)</h4>
<ul><li>Single mothers with no other adult in the household use family day  		  care more frequently than do married couples.</li>
<li>Full-time working mothers use family day care more often than  		  part-time working mothers.</li>
<li>Families with higher earnings use family day care more often.</li>
<li>Families in the North Central states use family day care more  		  frequently than families in the South.</li>
</ul><p>Complementing the results found about users of father care, when  		full-time care is required, it is more likely for parents to find sources  		outside the family. This is especially the case for the single, full-time  		employed mother with no other adults in the household. Also, since most  		nonrelatives require payment for care, families more able to pay for care use  		nonrelatives more often than families who cannot afford it.<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>
<p><a href="#figureII-3">Figure II-3</a> reveals family day care is used  		more often by FT- than PT-employed mothers, except among the very poorest FT  		mothers of two-parent families, who rely on fathers and relatives 70 percent of  		the time.</p>
<h4>Center Care/Nursery School</h4>
<ul><li>Full-time working mothers use centers/nursery schools more frequently  		  than part-time working mothers.</li>
<li>Families with higher earnings use centers/nursery schools more often  		  than lower earnings families.</li>
<li>Families in the South use more centers/nursery schools than families  		  in any other region of the country.</li>
<li>Centers/nursery schools are more frequently used in metropolitan than  		  non-metropolitan areas.</li>
<li>Families with fewer children use centers/nursery schools more often  		  than families with more children.</li>
<li>Mothers in service occupations use centers/nursery schools  		  <b>less</b> frequently than mothers in every other category of occupation.</li>
<li>Nonwhite mothers use centers/nursery schools more frequently than  		  white mothers.</li>
</ul><p>In terms of employment status and family earnings, the profiles of  		family day care users and center/nursery school users are very similar. Family  		day care is used more often by full-time employed mothers without other  		relatives immediately available than by full-time employed couples.  		Centers/nursery schools are used more frequently by families with fewer  		children and in metropolitan areas, especially in the South.<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><h4>Secondary Care Arrangements</h4>
<p>People concerned about child care policy sometimes express concern about  		families who must make multiple arrangements for particular children. This  		paper will only briefly discuss this issue here.</p>
<p>In 1985, 17 percent of families used a secondary care arrangement for  		their child, up from about 11 percent in 1965. Reviewing these arrangements by  		type shows that, in 1985, 16.2 percent of secondary arrangements were with  		sitters or nannies, <b>down</b> from 20 percent in 1965. Also, in 1985, center  		care comprised 20.2 percent of these secondary arrangements, also <b>down</b>  		from 26.9 percent in 1965. Use of family day care as a secondary arrangement  		stayed about the same (17.7 percent in 1965; 17.9 in 1985.<sup><font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></sup> It would appear from these data  		that while the use of secondary arrangements has increased form 1965 to 1985,  		these secondary arrangements are occurring more frequently in "family-like"  		environments (relative care and family day care).</p>
<h4>Future Directions in Arrangement Types</h4>
<p>The trends of increasing numbers of mothers with children entering the  		labor force is likely to continue--indeed, accelerate--into the 1990s. Hofferth  		observes that "infants (less than 1 year old) and toddlers (1-2) are  		experiencing the most rapid growth in the need for child care" and concludes  		"parents' choices of care for these age groups will greatly determine the  		future demand for child care."<sup><font><a href="#note20">20</a></font></sup> Hofferth acknowledges the impact of the  		mother's employment status and predicts "because full-time employed mothers  		constitute over two-thirds of mothers in the labor force with children under 3,  		this shift toward the use of group programs suggests that there will continue  		to be a rapid growth in demand for centers. On the other hand, among part-time  		employed mothers with infants and toddlers, family day care homes--and to a  		lesser extent relatives--are showing the greatest increase in use. Family day  		care is thus also likely to grow, though probably at a lower rate than center  		care (Hofferth and Phillips, 1987)."<sup><font><a href="#note21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<p>We will see in the next section that while the number of children in  		center care has grown tremendously, the cost for such care has remained  		relatively constant over time (adjusting for inflation). This indicates that  		the increased demand has been sufficiently compensated for by increased supply  		of centers, resulting in no net increase in (real) cost over time.</p>
<h3>C. Summary</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Relative care was most often used among <i>low-income</i> families:  			 fathers were used in two-parent households, and grandmothers were used in  			 single parent households with other adults present (most likely, the  			 grandmother). Family caregivers seemed most often used when available and when  			 budget constraints encouraged free or low-cost care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family day care and center care were used most frequently by  			 families with <i>higher incomes</i> and with mothers employed <i>full-time</i>.  			 Therefore, families in which the mother's ability to care for her child(ren)  			 was constrained by her work hours, and who could pay for more "formal",  			 consistent care, opted for family day care and center care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the extent that greater numbers of mothers with preschool  			 children enter the labor force full-time, the use of centers is likely to  			 continue to grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part-time employed mothers are likely to continue to use family day  			 care (and relatives, to a lesser extent) for their preschoolers.</p>

</ul><h2><a name="chapIII" id="chapIII">III. COSTS OF CHILD CARE</a><sup><font><a href="#note22">22</a></font></sup></h2>
<p>Federal expenditures on child care consist of child care tax credits and  		deductions, and the financing of child care programs (primarily through the  		social services program grants to states). These Federal expenditures have  		almost quadrupled in real terms from 1970 to 1984 (from about $1.25 billion to  		$4.75 billion).</p>
<p>Tax expenditures have been the major source of increase in Federal  		expenditures on child care. Increasing consistently (from $500 million in 1972  		to $2.7 billion in 1984), these tax expenditures have also represented an  		increasingly larger share of all Federal expenditures on child care: from 22  		percent of Federal expenditures in 1972 to 57 percent in 1984.</p>
<p>Personal expenditures on child care have more than doubled in real terms  		from 1970 to 1984: from $5.8 billion to $12.75 billion, respectively. These  		private expenditures represented about 76 percent of all expenditures during  		the early 1970s. By 1979, they represented about 71 percent, and this share has  		remained relatively constant throughout the early 1980s (see  		<a href="#figureIII-1">Figure III-1</a>).</p>
<p>In previous sections, we discussed the kinds of care for which these  		private expenditures were made. <i>Which</i> families pay for care? <i>What</i>  		is the average weekly payment made by families for this care, and <i>what  		proportion</i> of their income does this represent? This section reviews the  		characteristics of those families who pay for care, their average total weekly  		expenditures, as well as the proportion of their income ("budget share") spent  		on child care arrangements.</p>

<h3>A. Trends in Payment for Care</h3>
<h4>Who Pays?</h4>
<p>Not all families with an employed mother pay for their child care  		arrangements. In 1965, payment was made for 83 percent of the <b>children</b>  		under six and for 62 percent of the children over six.<sup><font><a href="#note23">23</a></font></sup> By 1985, 77 percent of <b>families</b> paid  		for care for their youngest child under 5 and 57 paid for care for their  		youngest over 5 years old. <i>Therefore, payment for care was slightly less  		prevalent in 1985 than it was in 1965, with preschoolers still requiring  		payment quite a bit more often than school-age children</i>.<sup><font><a href="#note24">24</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Full-time employed mothers are more likely to pay for care than  		part-time employed mothers, regardless of the type of care. In 1965, 76 percent  		of <b>children</b> with full-time employed mothers required payment; 64 percent  		of children with part-time employed mothers required payment.<sup><font><a href="#note25">25</a></font></sup> By 1985, 72 percent of  		full-time employed <b>mothers</b> paid (cash) for care, while 60 percent of  		part-time employed mothers made some (cash) payment. Again, <i>frequency of  		payment has declined for both full- and part-time employed mothers, with the  		former consistently paying more often</i>.<sup><font><a href="#note26">26</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Hofferth (1987) predicted the probability of paying for care as a  		function of the age of the child(ren) for whom the care was required, the type  		of care bought, and other socioeconomic variables. She estimated that in 1985,  		80 percent of all surveyed mothers paid for care. The most influential factor  		for who paid was the type of care chosen. Children in family day care, sitter  		care, or day care centers paid for care about equally as often, and all of  		which were paid for more often than relative care.</p>
<p>The next significant variable, number of children, was positively  		related to the probability of paying for care. Also highly significant, the  		number of nonparental adults in the household was negatively related to the  		probability of paying for care, indicating their likelihood of being used  		before costly alternatives. Interestingly, the age of the youngest child and  		mother's employment status were quite a bit less important (and less  		statistically significant) in determining who paid for care than these other  		variables. <i>Most surprisingly, weekly family income had virtually no effect  		on the likelihood of paying for care</i>. Perhaps after controlling for the  		type of care bought (<b>itself</b> determined by age of child, employment  		status, and income, as we have seen), age of child, mother's employment status,  		and weekly family income have little or no additional effect.</p>
<h4>How Much?<sup><font><a href="#note27">27</a></font></sup></h4>
<p><b>Average total weekly expenditures</b> depend on the amount of hours  		per week the care is used as well as the unit cost of care. Reviewing costs of  		child care arrangements should concentrate on costs <i>per hour</i> of care,  		ie. controlling for the hours used. One way to control for the hours of care  		used is to review only full-time mothers' payment patterns. Presumably, this  		sufficiently limits the analysis to families using about the same amount of  		care per week, making total weekly cost estimates comparable.</p>
<p>In 1965, full-time mothers spent, on average, about $54 per week on  		child care.<sup><font><a href="#note28">28</a></font></sup> By 1975,  		their average cost was $46.<sup><font><a href="#note29">29</a></font></sup> In 1985, average weekly expenditures on care  		for full-time employed mothers was approximately $47. Average cost seems to  		have remained constant, at least from 1975 to 1985.<sup><font><a href="#note30">30</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Hofferth (1987) reports that the most influential factor affecting total  		weekly expenditures was the type of care. Hofferth calculated an <b>average  		hourly payment</b> for each type of care to control for the number of hours of  		care used per week. She found:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><i>Relative care</i> has remained the least expensive form of child  			 care (averaging $.68 per hour in 1975 and $1.14 in 1985). This 67 percent  			 increase in average hourly payments coincided with a decrease in the average  			 hours used, resulting in an increase in average weekly expenditures over the  			 period (from $24 to $30).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Sitters</i>--the second least expensive form in 1975 ($.99 per  			 hour)--became the most costly form of care in 1985, at $1.59 per hour.  			 Interestingly, despite this 61 percent increase in sitter hourly payments,  			 sitters became more heavily used--from an average of 15 hours per week in 1975  			 to 26.5 hours per week in 1985. As a result, average weekly expenditures for  			 sitters rose from almost $15 in 1975 to $42 in 1985.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hourly payments for <i>family day care</i> experienced the least  			 growth from 1975 to 1985 ($1.05 per hour to $1.17 per hour). A slightly  			 increased usage resulted in a 20 percent increase in average weekly  			 expenditures for family day care (from $30 to $37).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, while (private) hourly payments made for <i>center and  			 nursery care</i> increased 20 percent during this period, its use actually  			 declined sufficiently to result in very little change in the average weekly  			 expenditures on center/nursery care between 1975 and 1985 (about $37 each  			 reference year).<sup><font><a href="#note31">31</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>B. Current (1985)</h3>
<p>Current research investigates the "strength" of many demographic and  		socioeconomic variables in determining who pays for care and how much they pay,  		both in absolute dollar amounts and as a proportion of total income ("budget  		share").</p>
<h4>Who Pays?</h4>
<p>Brush (1987) modeled the probability of paying for care similarly to  		Hofferth, except she did not control for the <b>type of care</b> being used, as  		did Hofferth. Since the probability of paying depends heavily on the type of  		care used, and to the extent that Brush's included variables determine the type  		of care used (as presented in the first section), these same variables are  		likely to show significance in determining <b>who pays</b> for care.</p>
<p>In Brush (1987), the number of young children (0 to 6 years old) turned  		out to be the most statistically significant factor influencing the likelihood  		of paying for care. The next significant variable was the number of children  		11-14: the more older children, the less likely were the mothers to pay for  		care. Other variables, in order of their predictive significance, were:</p>
<ul><li>Full-time mothers were more likely to pay for care than part-time  		  mothers.</li>
<li>Family earnings: the higher the earnings, the more likely to  		  pay.</li>
<li>Single mothers with no other adult in the household are more likely  		  to pay for care than are married mothers.</li>
<li>Mothers under 35 are more likely than older mothers to pay.</li>
<li>Mothers in the service industry were significantly less likely to pay  		  for care than mothers in professional, craft/labor, and sales  		  occupations.<sup><font><a href="#note32">32</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p>In comparison, Hofferth (1987) also found number and age of children,  		and mother's employment status as significant predictors of who pays, while  		both Brush and Hofferth determined race to be an insignificant predictor. By  		contrast, Hofferth (1987) found the number of nonparental adults in the  		household affected likelihood of paying, though marital status per se did not.  		Unlike Brush, Hofferth excluded mother's age, education, occupation, and  		location from her analysis and included type of arrangement, which turned out  		to be the most significant predictor of who pays. (See <a href="#tableA-1">Table A-1</a> in the <a href="#appendA">Appendix</a> for a  		comparison of the variables used by Brush and Hofferth in predicting who pays  		for care and how much is paid.)</p>
<h4>How Much?</h4>
<p><b>Dollar Amount</b></p>
<p>Brush (1987) found that among families who paid for care, they paid a  		<b>weekly average</b> of $39.34.<sup><font><a href="#note33">33</a></font></sup> Once again, the number of children under six  		was the most significant predictor of how much a mother paid for care: the more  		preschoolers, the more was paid. The next most significant variable was  		employment status: full-time mothers paid significantly more than part-time  		mothers. The remaining significant variables, in order of importance, were:</p>
<ul><li>Mothers living in metropolitan areas paid more than mothers in  		  non-metropolitan areas.</li>
<li>Young mothers (&lt;26) paid more than did mothers over 26.</li>
<li>Mothers with education beyond college paid more than mothers with  		  less advanced (or no) degrees.</li>
<li>Whites paid more than nonwhites.</li>
<li>Families earnings were positively related to the amount paid for  		  care.<sup><font><a href="#note34">34</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p>Hofferth (1987) agrees that the number of children, mother's employment  		status, household composition, family income, and race significantly affect the  		average weekly expenditures on child care. However, Hofferth's introduction of  		the type of care into the model predicting how much is paid for care relegated  		the age of the child as an insignificant determinant (most likely due to the  		high degree of correlation between these two variables).</p>
<p>As with likelihood of paying for care, Hofferth found type of care to be  		the most influential predictor of weekly expenditures. She reports that in  		1985, average total weekly expenditures on child care by <b>all</b> employed  		mothers was $34.61.<sup><font><a href="#note35">35</a></font></sup>  		This ranged from about $30 per week for relative care to $42 per week for  		sitter care, with family day care homes and center/nursery school care at about  		$37 per week. In terms of <b>average hourly payments</b> in 1985, relative and  		family day care payments were smallest (about $1.14 and $1.17, respectively),  		sitter care the most expensive (almost $1.60 per hour), and payments for center  		and nursery school care were in between at about $1.40 per hour.<sup><font><a href="#note36">36</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Proportion of Income</b></p>
<p>On average, those who paid for care of their children of all ages in  		1985 spent <b>9 percent of their income</b> on this care.<sup><font><a href="#note37">37</a></font></sup> Brush (1987) determined the  		most significant variable affecting the proportion of income spent on care was,  		not surprisingly, the family's earnings, which was negatively related to the  		budget share spent on child care. Low-income families (less than $5,000 per  		year) spent over 25 percent of their income on child care, comparable to the  		budget share spent on housing. Higher income families ($40,000) spent less than  		5 percent of their income on child care.<sup><font><a href="#note38">38</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The next most influential variable was marital status: single mothers,  		with or without another adult present, spent a significantly bigger chunk of  		their income on child care than do married couples. The remaining significant  		variables, in order of importance, were:</p>
<ul><li>The number of children 0-6 was positively related to the budget share  		  spent on care.</li>
<li>Full-time employed mothers spent a greater share of their income on  		  care than do part-time employed mothers.<sup><font><a href="#note39">39</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><p>Hofferth (1987) reports that in 1985, families with a youngest child  		under five spent 11 percent of their income on child care. Those with the  		youngest child 5 or older spent 9 percent of their income on child  		care.<sup><font><a href="#note40">40</a></font></sup> She identifies  		the most important factors associated with the proportion of income spent on  		child care of all children to be:</p>
<ul><li>Partner status (married or cohabitating couples spent a  		  <b>smaller</b> share of their income on child care than did single mothers,  		  with no other adult present),</li>
<li>Those using centers, sitters, and family day care homes spent a  		  larger share on child care than did those using relative care,</li>
<li>Mothers employed full-time spent proportionately more than did  		  mothers working part-time,</li>
<li>Income (lower-income families spent proportionately more than  		  higher-income families),</li>
</ul><p>Hofferth did not find the age of child significantly affecting the  		budget shares spent on child care.</p>
<h3>C. Summary</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Federal expenditures on child care have increased continuously over  			 the last fifteen years (from less than $1 billion in 1972 to $5.75 billion in  			 1986).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax expenditures have increased from $500 million in 1972 to $2.7  			 billion in 1984. These tax expenditures represented 22 percent of Federal  			 expenditures in 1972 to 57 percent in 1984.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal expenditures on child care have increased more rapidly than  			 Federal expenditures between 1966 to 1986 (from $3.5 billion to $12.75  			 billion). Almost half of that growth occurred between 1980 and 1986  			 alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Families' payment for their preschoolers' child care was slightly  			 less prevalent in 1985 than in 1965 (77 percent of families compared to 83  			 percent, respectively).</p>
</li>
<li>Families <b>most</b> likely to pay for child care are those with:

<li> Mothers <i>not</i> in service occupations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In terms of <b>types of care</b>:

<li> Families using relative care are <b>least likely to  				pay</b>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Families with the <b>highest weekly expenditures</b> on child care  		  are those:
<ul><li>With many children under six years old,</li>
<li>With full-time (as opposed to part-time) employed mothers,</li>
<li>With higher earnings,</li>
<li>With younger (less than 26 years old) mothers,</li>
<li>With higher-educated mothers,</li>
<li> Who are White.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In terms of the <b>types of care</b>:
<ul><li>Families with the <b>highest weekly expenditures</b> are those  				using sitter care, center care, or family day care,</li>
<li> Families using relative care have the <b>lowest weekly  				expenditures</b>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Families with the <b>largest budget shares</b> spent on child care  		  are those with:
