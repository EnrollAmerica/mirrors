<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Prior to the 1960's, children and adults with mental retardation and  		other developmental disabilities either lived in large institutions or with  		their families. In general, people with severe disabilities were isolated from  		society and not a part of the public consciousness. Few received any services  		other than routine or custodial care regardless of where they lived.</p>
<p>The past two decades have witnessed extraordinary changes in our  		understanding of the needs and capabilities of people with disabilities,  		especially those with severe handicaps, and in the system of services available  		to them. Parents, other advocates and disabled people themselves have lobbied  		hard for services that actively promote individual development. Numerous  		lawsuits have been filed to secure the rights of people with disabilities. Many  		large public institutions have closed, and those that remain house a population  		half the size of what it was 20 years ago. Thousands of young people with  		developmental disabilities have moved through the public school system and are  		emerging with expectations for a meaningful adult life. A new system of  		services in the community is evolving including expanded educational programs,  		supports to families and new opportunities for employment.</p>
<p>A number of critics have questioned whether public policies,  		particularly Federal financing policies, have kept pace with the dramatic  		changes that have occurred in the field. The conclusion of this report is that  		the critics are largely right. The most significant Federal program  		specifically designed to finance services, the Intermediate Care Facilities for  		the Mentally Retarded (ICF/MR) program, is institution-based; to be eligible  		for services, individuals must be placed outside their homes and be in need of  		"active treatment" and 24 hour supervision. Three quarters of the persons  		served by this program are in large, (average size 155 beds) costly State  		mental retardation facilities which are segregated from the rest of society.  		These institutions frequently are unable to provide opportunities for  		independence, productivity and integration into the community, the Federal  		policy goals expressed in the Developmental Disabilities Act Amendments of  		1984, and reaffirmed in 1987 amendments.</p>
<p>In contrast to the relatively generous Federal expenditures for  		institutions, Federal support for family care and community-based residential  		arrangements is limited. Responsibility for community services is fragmented  		across a widely divergent array of Federal, State and local programs. In many  		areas of the country, particularly in rural areas, community services, other  		than special education, are not readily available.</p>
<p>There is growing impetus to expand Federal financing of community-based  		services for people with developmental disabilities. Legislation to accomplish  		this goal has been introduced in the last two sessions of Congress, most  		recently in September 1987 when Senator Chafee introduced the Medicaid Home and  		Community Quality Services Act (S. 1673). This bill currently has 24  		co-sponsors. Seventy-five members of the House are co-sponsors of a companion  		bill introduced by Congressman Florio. While there may be disagreement about  		the exact shape of needed reforms, there is a growing consensus that the time  		for change has arrived.</p>
<h3>PURPOSE OF THE REPORT</h3>
<p>This report analyzes the impact of current Federal policies and programs  		on the growth of community living arrangements and supportive services for  		people with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities. It  		supports the goals of the Developmental Disabilities Act and asks how Federal  		financing policy can be brought more in line with these goals in a fiscally  		responsible manner. It also analyzes the anticipated costs and effects of  		reforming Federal policies.</p>
<p>There are several points about the report that should be highlighted.  		First, it focuses on people with developmental disabilities who, with  		appropriate supports, can live successfully in family and community settings.  		Second, it uses a functional definition of developmental disability: severely  		handicapping conditions occurring prior to birth, in childhood, or in  		adolescence, and which limit functioning in several major life activities. A  		large proportion of this target population is mentally retarded; yet there are  		also people with cerebral palsy, spina bifida and other severe physical  		impairments who are not mentally retarded but need considerable support.  		Conversely, not all people with mental retardation and related conditions are  		significantly limited in their functioning. The important point in defining the  		population is to assess the extent to which a person's functioning is impaired  		and results in a need for assistance over an extended period, often a  		lifetime.</p>
<p>The third point is that the report does not directly address the  		circumstances and needs of people whose developmental disabilities result in  		severe medical problems. Many of these people may require constant care and  		medical supervision in specialized health care facilities. The analyses  		presented here assume that Federal financing should continue to permit  		reimbursement for medically related services to the extent they are needed.  		<b>However, the report begins with the promise that the overwhelming majority  		of people with developmental disabilities does not require care that is  		predominantly medical in orientation and that Federal financing policy should  		reflect this</b>.</p>
<p>Finally, during the course of this study we have gained a renewed  		appreciation for the limits of Federal policy in shaping the characteristics of  		the service delivery system. While Federal financing is extremely important,  		the initiative and preferences of State government, communities, service  		providers, and disabled people and their families also determine how public  		dollars are spent. Despite its significant influence, Federal reform cannot  		substitute for State and local initiative.</p>
<h3>THE SECRETARYS MANDATE</h3>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) transmitted a report  		to Congress in January 1986 on <i>Policies for Improving Services for Mentally  		Retarded and Other Developmentally Disabled Persons under Title XIX of the  		Social Security Act</i> called for in the 1984 Developmental Disabilities Act.  		As a follow-up to the report, the Secretary of HHS approved the establishment  		of a Departmental Working Group comprised of senior policy officials from the  		Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the Social Security Administration  		(SSA), the Office of Human Development Services (OHDS), the Public Health  		Services (PHS) and the office of the Secretary. The Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation chaired the Working Group. <b>The Working Group was  		instructed to analyze Federal policy barriers to community living and to  		develop cost-effective policy options to enhance the independence, community  		integration and productivity of persons with mental retardation and other  		developmental disabilities</b>.</p>
<h3>ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT</h3>
<p>The chapters which follow describe:</p>
<ul><li>the size and characteristics of the population with developmental  		  disabilities;</li>
<li>the organization of the services delivery system and the types of  		  services provided;</li>
<li>Federal financing policies;</li>
<li>implications for policy development; and</li>
<li>options for reform.</li>
</ul><p><a href="mrddwges.htm#appendA">References</a> and <a href="mrddwges.htm#appendB">related  		research questions</a> are included in the Appendices.</p>
<p>The Working Group has developed two major options for policy reform. The  		first proposes a significant departure from the Federal Government's existing  		approach to financing services for persons with developmental disabilities. It  		would replace Medicaid as the primary source of Federal financing by  		establishing an entirely new program targeted to developmentally disabled  		persons with severe impairments. The second option outlines incremental policy  		changes designed to promote improved support of community-based services to  		this population. In addition, two Congressional Medicaid reform initiatives are  		described and analyzed.</p>
<p>The Working Group expects this report to serve as a basis for  		reconsideration of the Federal financing role and hopes it will contribute to a  		more effective, equitable and efficient system of services and support for  		individuals with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities.</p>
<h2><a name="population" id="population">II. POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS</a></h2>
<p>Chapter II defines developmental disabilities and uses various  		techniques to estimate the size of the developmentally disabled population.</p>
<h3>DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES DEFINED</h3>
<p>The definition of developmental disabilities (DD) as outlined in the  		Developmental Disabilities Act has changed over the years. The original  		definition was <b>categorical</b> and utilized diagnostic categories (i.e.  		mental retardation, cerebral palsy and epilepsy, with autism added later). The  		1978 legislation established a <b>functional</b> definition. It described  		persons with <i>severe, chronic physical or mental impairments or a combination  		of physical and mental impairments, likely to continue indefinitely, who  		experience substantial functional limitations in three or more major life  		activities</i> including self care, language, learning, mobility,  		self-direction, independent living and economic self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>The functional definition focuses on people whose disability occur red  		before birth or early in life and who are likely to need a range of services  		throughout their lives. While States are required to use the Federal DD  		definition for certain purposes, most <b>State service systems</b> focus on  		people with mental retardation.<sup><font><a href="mrddwges.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup> A majority of States operate <i>mental  		retardation</i> rather than <i>developmental disability</i> systems; some  		operate DD systems using the Federal or similar definitions; and a few operate  		dual systems. The lack of uniformity has contributed to the frequent  		interchange of the labels "mental retardation" and "developmental  		disabilities," for example, in studies of residential services.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of overlap among the categories associated with  		developmental disabilities. For example, Gollay identified more than three  		dozen health-related problems contributing to or causing developmental  		disabilities (Gollay, 1981). While many persons with developmental disabilities  		exhibit mental retardation, there is a high prevalence of multiple handicaps  		among the population.</p>
<h3>THE SIZE OF THE POPULATION</h3>
<p>It is difficult to estimate the size and characteristics of the  		population with developmental disabilities. First, there is no generally  		accepted standard for what constitutes a "substantial functional limitation" as  		there is for determining significantly sub-average intelligence in the  		assessment of mental retardation. Second, even if there were consensus, there  		are no national or State level surveys of this population.<sup><font><a href="mrddwges.htm#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Most data bases categorize individuals by diagnosed major handicapping  		condition without measures of functioning level. This is true, for example, of  		State reports on handicapped children served in special education programs.  		These provide statistics on the basis of primary diagnosis, but do not report  		on the number of students meeting the Federal definition of developmental  		disability nor levels of severity within diagnostic categories. Reports on the  		1984-85 school year note that the 4,363,031 handicapped children receiving  		services included 717,785 students with mental retardation; 71,780 students  		with multiple handicaps; and 69,118 students with other health  		impairments, for a total of 858,683 (U.S. Department of Education, 1987).  		This information, however, does not indicate limitations in functioning. Since  		many students with mental retardation are mildly retarded, the actual number of  		students receiving special education services who would meet the criteria for  		developmental disability is presumably much lower.</p>
<p>There is a wide variation in published estimates of the developmentally  		disabled population that is mentally retarded. These range from 35 percent  		(Gollay, 1981) to 90 percent (Lakin and Hill, 1985). The lower estimates are  		based on primary diagnosis while the higher estimates reflect use of the mental  		retardation/developmental disabilities (MR/DD) service system. For example, a  		New York State study of about 44,000 recipients of residential, developmental,  		habilitative and support services from both public and private MR/DD agencies  		found that less than 5 percent of clients had a diagnosis of autism, cerebral  		palsy or epilepsy without a concurrent diagnosis of mental retardation  		(Jacobson and Janicki, 1983). The California DD council reported similar  		findings. It estimated that 90 percent of the individuals receiving MR/DD  		services in that State are mentally retarded (California State Council on  		Developmental Disabilities, 1981).</p>
<p>Although the broad category of developmental disabilities includes  		people with a number of different impairments, <b>there is evidence that the  		overwhelming majority of clients in State service systems are persons with  		mental retardation</b>.</p>
<p><b><i>Estimating Techniques</i></b></p>
<p>Three methods are available to estimate the size of the developmentally  		disabled population. The first is based on the prevalence of various  		developmentally disabling conditions among the general population. The second  		method uses data on MR/DD beneficiaries in the Supplemental Security Income  		(SSI) and social security Disability Income (SSDI) programs. The third method  		synthesizes data on prevalence, SSI and SSDI beneficiaries, and participation  		in the MR/DD service system. Estimates based on these methods are discussed  		below.</p>
<p><b>Prevalence Estimates</b></p>
<p>The prevalence of categorical diagnoses commonly associated with  		developmental disability in the general population, as supported by numerous  		studies, is approximately as follows:</p>
<ul><li>mental retardation - 1 percent or 2,387,400 people; (mild mental  		  retardation - .5 percent)</li>
<li>cerebral-palsy - .35 percent or 83,559 people;</li>
<li>epilepsy - .75 percent or 179,055 people; and</li>
<li>autism - .05 percent or 11,937 people.</li>
</ul><p>However, the mere presence of such conditions does not in itself reflect  		the degree of resulting limitations. For example, most epilepsy is reasonably  		well controlled by medication and would not result in "substantial functional  		limitation" (Lakin and Hill, 1985).</p>
<p>Population estimates based on functional criteria have produced  		estimates similar to those based on categorical criteria. One notable effort to  		study the prevalence of functional disabilities was that of Boggs and Henney  		(1981). Using data from the Bureau of the Census Survey of Income and Education  		(SIE), Boggs and Henney developed proxies for "substantive functional  		limitations" in each of the areas reflected in the Federal categorical  		definition of developmental disabilities. This process yielded a prevalence  		estimate of 1.6 percent, or approximately 3.8 million individuals based on  		current population figures. State Developmental Disability Planning councils  		use a variety of prevalence rates generally ranging from 1 to 2 percent. For  		example, the Minnesota council presents three estimates for planning purposes,  		ranging from a high rate of 2.4 percent to a low rate of I percent (Minnesota  		Developmental Disabilities Planning Council, 1987).</p>
<p>Prevalence data on mental retardation are much more available than data  		on other developmental disabilities. As noted above, there is now general  		consensus that mental retardation is found in approximately 1 percent of the  		population or 2.4 million individuals (Birch et al., 1970; Dingman and Tarjan,  		1960; Farber, 1968; Lindberg, 1976; MacMillan, 1977; Mercy, 1973; Tarjan et  		al., 1973). Within the MR population prevalence rates have been differentiated  		for four levels of retardation (Abramowicz and Richardson, 1974; Lakin and  		Hill, 1985; Maloney and Ward, 1979; Stein and Susser, 1975):</p>

</tr></table><p>The population with mild mental retardation -- measured IQ's ranging  		from about 50 to 68 with deficits in adaptive behavior includes many  		individuals whose handicap is not severe enough to meet the functional criteria  		of developmental disability, especially in the absence of other handicapping  		conditions. Many people with mild retardation are identified as such only  		during their student years, when they participate in special education  		programs. Most of these people make acceptable adjustments to adulthood  		although they do remain vulnerable in times of economic and personal difficulty  		(Conley, 1985). Because many people move in and out of the mental retardation  		service system over their lifetimes, they may be designated as a  		<i>transitory</i> mentally retarded population.</p>
<p>In contrast, individuals with moderate, severe, or profound mental  		retardation -- measured IQ of 50 or below with concurrent deficits in adaptive  		behavior -- can be considered a stable mentally retarded population,  		characterized by a high likelihood of ongoing need for treatment and care due  		to the degree of their impairments. Persons identified as moderately, severely  		and profoundly retarded almost always retain the recognition as retarded and  		are usually provided formal and informal services from childhood and throughout  		their lives. The overwhelming majority would meet functional criteria for  		developmental disability. The prevalence of stable mental retardation has been  		estimated by a number of studies of specific catchment areas.<sup><font><a href="mrddwges.htm#note3">3</a></font></sup> It is estimated that .5 percent  		of the general population, or about 1.2 million persons, are mentally retarded  		at a level that will necessitate lifelong assistance.</p>
<p>A subgroup within the stable mentally retarded population, those  		experiencing severe and profound mental retardation with a measured IQ of 36 or  		below on a standardized intelligence scale, has been identified by the Working  		Group as individuals most in need of specialized assistance in order to reach  		their developmental potential. Based on accepted prevalence rates, this  		subgroup would include approximately 390,000 individuals. People affected at  		comparable levels of severity by other developmentally disabling conditions  		would increase the size of this subgroup to approximately 450,000 individuals,  		including 270,000 adults and 180,000 children (Lakin, 1987). Two important  		points to note about this population are</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Nearly 1/3 of this subgroup lives in ICFs/MR, about 110,1000 or 76  			 percent of the 145,000 ICF/MR residents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the 180,000 children live at home with their families and  			 receive the bulk of their services through the public education  			 system.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The comprehensive reform proposal outlined at the conclusion of this  		report recommends that a limited entitlement to services be extended to this  		particularly vulnerable subgroup.</p>
<p><b>Social Security Data</b></p>
<p>Most developmentally disabled adults living in the community receive  		social Security benefits, usually through the Supplemental Security Income  		(SSI) program and/or the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program.  		Two diagnostic groups used in the disability determination process likely to  		include developmentally disabled persons are mental retardation and congenital  		anomalies. A limited number of people who might be considered developmentally  		disabled may also be counted in other diagnostic categories.</p>
<p>In 1985, new regulations were issued to establish eligibility for Social  		Security on the basis of a diagnosis of mental retardation or autism  		(<i>Federal Register</i>, August 28, 1985). These require that deficit(s) be  		first "manifested in the developmental period" (i.e., before age 22) with an  		upper IQ limit of 70, as well as other limitations depending on IQ level, as  		shown in <b><a href="mrddwges.htm#exhibit1">Exhibit 1</a></b>:</p>

Nevertheless, it is important to note that these data are generally  		consistent with identified prevalence rates, in particular for mental  		retardation.</p>
<p><b>Synthesis and Summary</b></p>
<p>Although precise estimates of the total size of the target population  		are lacking, estimates of national prevalence rates and participation in income  		maintenance and service programs based on diagnoses highly related to  		developmental disabilities provide useful proxies. From these data we infer  		that nationwide there are <b>about 800,000 adults with developmental  		disabilities </b>who might be potential consumers of services targeted to the  		presence of developmental disabilities. We also estimate there are <b>400,000  		children (birth through age 21)</b> who are moderately to profoundly mentally  		retarded or who function at a similar level and who are likely to need  		long-term support, for a total of 1,200,000. Another 1,200,000 children might  		be considered eligible under a broad <i>categorical</i> definition of  		developmental disabilities including children and youth with less severe  		handicaps such as mild mental retardation or learning disabilities as well as  		children with autism and cerebral palsy but with no retardation.</p>
<p>Most of the estimated 1,600,000 children with developmental disabilities  		will not require extensive services beyond those provided through the education  		system. The estimated 400,000 children and adults with severe and profound  		mental retardation or other comparable functional limitations can be expected  		to require services throughout their lifetimes. The types of programs and  		services needed by these and other developmentally disabled people are  		described in the following chapter.</p>
<h2><a name="service" id="service">III. THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM</a></h2>
<p>This chapter examines those forces which have changed the way services  		are delivered, how State service systems are organized, where developmentally  		disabled people live and how this affects their access to services. Finally, it  		summarizes some of the research which substantiates the advantages of community  		care.</p>
<h3>THE EVOLUTION OF THE MR/DD SYSTEM</h3>
<p>Twenty-five years ago it was common practice to place both children and  		adults with severe or profound mental retardation, as well as others with less  		severe developmental disabilities, in institutional settings (Lakin et al.,  		1986b). This out of home care was typically provided by State and local  		governments and by charitable organizations. Placements in institutional  		settings peaked in 1967. At that time, the average daily population of people  		in State mental retardation institutions was 194,650 (Lakin, 1979).</p>
<p>Since then the appropriateness of institutional care for all but those  		whose disabilities are associated with severe medical problems has been called  		into question. As a result, the average daily population in State mental  		retardation institutions had dropped to 100,190 by 1986 (White et al.,  		1987).</p>
<p>Several important social and philosophical concepts underlie this shift  		away from institutional care. The first of these is the<i> normalization</i>  		principle which contends that for both humane and habilitative reasons, people  		with developmental disabilities should live and function in ways that are as  		close as possible to those of the rest of society's. The second, <i>the right  		to habilitation</i>, argues against mere "warehousing" of people and supports  		opportunities for individualized training and personal growth. Closely related  		is the <i>least restrictive alternative</i> which emphasizes the promotion of  		optimum development through opportunities to participate in programs and living  		arrangements that enhance independence and integration.  		<i>Deinstitutionalization</i> has evolved as a social policy and as a  		reflection of these concepts. Parents and other advocates have effectively used  		these changing ideas in advocating for more family and community-based  		services, in promoting legislation and in taking legal action.</p>
<p>Litigation has been a significant force in shaping the service delivery  		system. Among the important legal cases is <i>Wyatt vs. Stickney</i> (1972)  		which established the right to treatment of an individual committed to an  		institution without a trial. In another important case, <i>Romeo vs.  		Youngberg</i> (1976), the Supreme Court found that involuntarily detained  		mentally retarded persons have the following constitutionally protected rights:  		reasonably safe conditions of confinement, freedom from unreasonable bodily  		restraints and minimally adequate training. A related case, <i>Halderman vs.  		Pennhurst School and State Hospital</i> (1977), resulted in court-ordered  		deinstitutionalization. The use of the courts to affect residential services  		has continued. At the present time, 30 States are operating under some form of  		consent decree from the courts covering residents in State-operated ICFs/MR  		(GAO, 1987a).</p>
<h3>SERVICE DELIVERY ORGANIZATION</h3>
<p>The MR/DD service system is comprised of a wide array of services and  		supports including income maintenance for basic subsistence (housing, clothing  		and food), health care, habilitation, education and training as well as a range  		of other services including advocacy, case management, transportation,  		counseling and social/ leisure services. <b><a href="mrddwges.htm#exhibit3">Exhibit  		3</a></b> illustrates a typical matrix of providers.</p>

</tr></table><p>The services provided to individuals with developmental disabilities are  		quite distinct from traditional long-term care with its heavy emphasis on  		custodial and nursing care. In contrast, the primary services considered  		essential to the MR/DD population in addition to food, shelter, and  		supervision, are habilitation, education, and vocational assistance.</p>
<p><b><i>State Roles</i></b></p>
<p>As illustrated in <b><a href="mrddwges.htm#exhibit4">Exhibit 4</a></b>, several  		different State agencies play key roles in the MR/DD system. However, the  		orientation and influence of these agencies on local service delivery varies  		dramatically from one State to another. In fact, the most dominant  		characteristic of the service delivery system is state variation -- in the  		amount of money spent per capita, in the types of services provided  		(particularly the extent to which institutions as opposed to community services  		are emphasized), in who is served and in how people get connected to services.  		For example, the State of Illinois places heavy emphasis on large public  		residential facilities, large private ICFs/MR, and nursing homes as the  		backbone of its MR/DD services system. Decision-making is centralized at the  		State level and there are no local service entities except in a few  		metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>In contrast, its neighbor Michigan has a system characterized by a high  		degree of decentralization with most community services administered by county  		level mental health authorities. The State Department of Mental Health plays a  		critical role in guiding the planning and implementation of community services  		policy. Since the late 19601s, Michigan has reduced the number of people in  		State-owned mental retardation facilities from 12,000 to 1,650.</p>

</tr></table><p>In fact, the proportion of residents in small vs. large MR/DD  		residential facilities varies significantly across the States. On June 30,  		1986, the proportion of residents in facilities for 15 or fewer individuals  		averaged 41.3 percent nationally, but ranged from less than 20 percent in  		Illinois, Kansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Virginia to more than 70 percent  		in Alaska, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, and Vermont (Lakin et al.,  		19!87).</p>
<p>There is equally remarkable variation in State use of the ICF/MR  		program. For example, Minnesota relies heavily on the ICF/MR program to fund  		its network of small community residential programs while none of Nebraska's  		174 MR/DD group homes is an ICF/ MR, although its one large State facility is.  		According to Lakin, as of June 1986 the proportion of residential placements in  		facilities certified as ICFs/MR ranged from a high of 92.7% it Louisiana to a  		low of 19.6% in West Virginia. In addition, 11 States had <i>no</i> small (15  		person or less) ICFs/MR, while over two-thirds of the MR/DD facility residents  		in five States (Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Vermont) were  		housed in small ICF/MR program to fund community living opportunities for  		persons with severe and profound mental retardation (Lakin et al., 1987).  		Finally, there are extreme variations across States in the annual per them  		costs of ICFs/MR which range from $12,061 per year to $87,141 per year.</p>
<p>A study carried out by Macro Systems for the office of the Assistant  		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) examined the determinants of State  		policy decisions with respect to MR/DD services. Findings suggest that the  		degree of emphasis States give to community-based service delivery results from  		a variety of related factors including:</p>
<ul><li>an historically strong commitment to human services generally and  		  community-based services in particular;</li>
<li>the presence of strong, well-organized advocacy groups; and</li>
<li>a healthy State economy at the time that services expansion is  		  considered (Jaskulski and Weader, 1987).</li>
</ul><p>While Federal policy is important -- as witnessed by the heavy reliance  		of many States on the ICF/MR program -- it is not the dominant factor in State  		decision-making regarding MR/DD services. Faced with the same Federal policy  		options, States have made very different choices.</p>
<h3>TYPES OF SERVICES AND SERVICE SETTINGS</h3>
<p>Services for the MR/DD population can be categorized according to the  		degree of restrictiveness or independence associated with a person's living  		arrangement. <b><a href="mrddwges.htm#exhibit5">Exhibit 5</a></b> illustrates the broad  		continuum of living arrangements available to the MR/DD populalation and the  		types of services typically available in those settings.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that where one lives does not always determine the  		types of service an individual can expect to receive. For example, some group  		home residents are competitively employed, while some children living with  		their natural families are still educated in separate "special" schools.  		However, there is enough association to warrant using living arrangements as a  		way of organizing a description of the MR/DD service system.</p>

<p><b>Community facilities</b> - less than 16 beds (average small  			 ICF/MR is 8 beds), with most services provided off-site by a mix of public and  			 private providers; most located in community neighborhoods; some certified as  			 ICFs/MR (20 percent of ICF/MR residents are in small facilities).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Family settings</b> - includes foster as well as natural and  			 adoptive family homes and independent living for adults; virtually all services  			 provided outside the home; ICF/MR support not available.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Large Institutions</i></b></p>
<p>Generally, large residential facilities represent the most restrictive  		form of living arrangement for disabled persons and remain the primary  		available residential service. In June, 1986, 147,314 people were residents of  		large institutions (Lakin et al., 1986). Typically, these large facilities are  		congregate care operations run by the States and located in rural areas. Many  		residents receive little more than custodial care, and few have access to  		programs and activities outside the institution.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the census of State institutions has significantly  		decreased as a result of deinstitutionalization. Between June 1977 and June  		1982, the number of people in large public facilities (16 or more residents)  		decreased 27,400, from 207,363 to 179,966 persons (Lakin, 1987). From June 1982  		to June 1986, the average daily population of State mental retardation  		institutions (16 or more residents) decreased from 151,537 to 100,190 persons  		(White et al., 1987). Between 1977 and 1985, however, the number of profoundly  		retarded people in State institutions decreased only from 69,100 to 59,306  		people (Lakin, 1987). Despite the overall decline in the size of large  		institutions, people with more severe impairments are less likely to have  		access to community residential settings.</p>
<p>Programming in large facilities varies. Many facilities, especially  		those in rural areas, provide most services on the grounds; residents of these  		facilities are often denied the opportunity to leave to attend school or to  		participate in community-based services or activities. While the Education for  		All Handicapped Children Act requires States to provide education services to  		school age residents of public and private facilities, investigations have  		shown that the children in State ICF/MR facilities have been particularly  		vulnerable to denial of their right to education (Lakin et al. 1982; Senate  		Subcommittee on the Handicapped, 1984).</p>
<p>Traditionally, adult residents of large facilities are likely to spend  		their days in social/recreational day activities and in gaining personal social  		skills (habilitation services). A limited number of persons in institutions are  		able to participate in sheltered workshops and work activity programs although  		most wage earnings have been insignificant (Whitehead, 1987a). Residents of  		large ICFs/MR typically have had access only to onsite day and vocational  		programs.</p>
<p><b>Nursing Homes</b></p>
<p>A significant number of developmentally disabled people also reside in  		nursing homes, most of which are Medicaid certified Intermediate Care  		Facilities (ICFs) or Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs). Nursing homes differ  		from ICFs/MR in that they are medically oriented and not specifically designed  		to meet the needs of developmentally disabled people.</p>
<p>An analysis of the 1977 National Nursing Home Survey indicated an  		estimated 44,000 mentally retarded residents in nursing homes. About 60 percent  		of the people with a diagnosis of mental retardation were less than 65 years of  		age (Lakin, 1986). The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Inventory  		of Long-Term Care Places (1986) revealed 39,500 persons with mental retardation  		in nursing homes. More recently the Health Care Financing Administration  		estimated that there were 140,000 mentally retarded persons in SNFs and ICFs in  		1985 (GAO, 1987a). In its review of nursing homes in three States, the General  		Accounting Office (GAO) found that the overwhelming majority of mentally  		retarded residents in need of active treatment were not receiving such  		services.</p>
<p>It is widely accepted that unless developmentally disabled people have  		medical needs which require specialized medical care, their placement in  		nursing homes is inappropriate. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987  		(P.L. 100-203) prohibits the admission of mentally retarded people to nursing  		facilities beginning January 1, 1989 <i>unless</i> the State MR/DD authority  		has determined that an individual requires nursing care because of a physical  		or mental condition. States will be required to develop pre-admission screening  		programs to determine whether nursing level care is required and, if so,  		whether the individual can benefit from active treatment. As of April 1, 1990,  		the case of each mentally retarded or other developmentally disabled nursing  		home resident will be reviewed to determine whether the placement is  		appropriate and active treatment is required. The law also mandates that those  		individuals who are inappropriately placed in nursing facilities and have lived  		there less than 30 months should be discharged and arrangements made for them  		to receive active treatment.</p>
<p><b><i>Community Residential Arrangements</i></b></p>
<p>Community living arrangements include group homes, supervised apartments  		and board and care homes. These vary according to the number of residents, the  		amount of care or protective oversight provided, and the functional level of  		the residents. Community residential alternatives are funded by a variety of  		sources, with increasing use of the ICF/1-M program. In 1982, there were about  		1,202 ICF/MR certified group homes. By June 1986, the number of ICF/MR group  		homes had more than doubled to 2,672 housing about 27 percent of the estimated  		77,800 group home residents (Lakin et al., 1987).</p>
<p>In group homes not certified as ICFs/MR, the Federal contribution  		generally includes SSI or SSDI payments (which pay for room and board),  		Medicaid or Medicare for medical care, and food stamps. State funds, both SSI  		supplements and general revenues, are also important funding sources. In some  		areas, county or other local funds are used as well.</p>
<p>Between 1982 and 1986, the number of small settings more than doubled  		and the number of residents increased by 60 percent. The University of  		Minnesota's June 1986 survey of mental retardation services identified 19,236  		small'(15 or fewer residents) public and private group residences, including  		boarding and semi-independent living arrangements. These housed 90,174 people  		(Lakin et al., 1987).</p>
<p>While it is difficult to estimate the population of developmentally  		disabled people in specific types of community facilities, estimates can be  		made of the number of individuals in specially licensed care settings. For  		example, there are about 19,100 persons with mental retardation in-specialized  		foster care. According to data collected in 1982, there are also about 4,000  		persons with mental retardation in specially licensed personal care homes and  		an unknown, but presumably large number, in personal care settings without  		mental retardation program licenses (Lakin et al., 1985).</p>
<p>In semi-independent living programs, clients typically reside in  		individual units or apartments, with supervisory staff in close proximity.  		These arrangements are sometimes used as training for independent or supported  		living but may also be long-term placements for persons who need monitoring for  		health, behavioral, or cognitive reasons. Supported independent living  		arrangements are even less restrictive. Clients live without on-site  		supervision although they usually receive supportive training, counseling  		and/or periodic supervision. Services provided to individuals include training  		or monitoring in independent living skills (e.g., cooking, shopping), and also  		may include home health/ homemaker types of services similar to those in  		semi-independent living programs. Supported independent living arrangements can  		function as a transition to more independent living.</p>
<p><b><i>Family Settings</i></b></p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of people with developmental disabilities live  		with their natural, adoptive or foster families. The number of children and  		youth (birth to 21 years) with mental retardation and other developmental  		disabilities in residential facilities has actually decreased in recent years,  		from over 110,000 in 1967 to 60,000 in 1982 (Lakin, et al 1985). The number has  		declined further with an estimated 48,000 children and youth in residential  		placements in 1986 (Lakin, 1987).</p>
<p>In the United States, foster or family care programs specifically for  		people with mental retardation can be traced back to 1920 (Lakin, Bruininks,  		and Sigford, 1981); however, few of these programs survived the Great  		Depression. With efforts to depopulate State MR/DD institutions in the late  		1960s, foster care regained popularity. In 1977, approximately 14,400 persons  		with mental retardation were in family care settings specifically licensed for  		people with mental retardation. By 1982, this number increased to 17,150,  		(Hill, B. et al., 1987). In 1986, States identified 19,000 persons in  		specialized foster care (Lakin et al., in preparation).</p>
<p>There are also many thousands of persons with developmental disabilities  		in generic foster care homes (i.e., homes not specifically licensed and/or  		contracted by States to provide services to persons with mental retardation). A  		comprehensive nationwide survey in 1980 identified approximately 23,000  		children and youth in generic foster care who were considered mentally retarded  		(Office for Civil Rights, 1981). As of December 31, 1985, States reported  		14,000 children (birth to 17 years) with mental retardation in generic foster  		care homes (Hill, B. et al., 1987).</p>
<p>State and local agencies increasingly offer programs providing training  		and support to families and other primary caregivers. Services for natural and  		foster families include respite care, special training in developmental service  		techniques and behavior management, support groups and counseling as well as  		information and referral services.</p>
<p>A 1984 survey of States indicated that all but Oklahoma had developed  		some form of supportive program for families of people with mental retardation  		although fewer than half of these were judged to be "extensive". About  		one-third of the States have developed family cash subsidy programs. These tend  		to be limited both in subsidy amount and in the number of participants,  		averaging about 115 clients statewide with a median subsidy of $250 per month  		and upper limits ranging from $115 to $500 (Agosta, Jennings and Bradley,  		1985).</p>
<p><b><i>Other Services</i></b></p>
<p>There are several services that are not tied specifically to residential  		settings. These include education, day programs, vocational training and case  		management.</p>
<p><b>Educational Services</b></p>
<p>As a result of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975  		(P.L. 94-142), children with mental retardation and other developmental  		disabilities are entitled to educational services through the local school  		district. Although a small number of children receive educational services at  		home, most go to school. Students may be in special classes all or part of the  		time. However, in more integrated school settings, disabled children have  		opportunities for interaction with their non-disabled peers.</p>
<p>Educational programs for teenagers and young adults may include  		vocational-training. When they leave school, they make the transition to  		employment or adult services, contingent on service availability.</p>
<p><b>Developmental/Vocational services</b></p>
<p>There are two general types of day habilitation programs for  		developmentally disabled adults: developmental (day activity/ work activity)  		programs and vocational (employment/employment training) programs. Day activity  		centers provide a range of skills training, including self-care, domestic,  		communication, social, recreational and prevocational activities. These  		services are used primarily by people with severe developmental disabilities  		and serve as an intermediate habilitation program for people who possess some  		vocational aptitude but whose productive capacity is considered less than 15  		percent of that of a non-handicapped worker (Whitehead, 1987a).</p>
<p>The goal of vocational services is economic self-sufficiency, through  		training and employment in the most integrated work setting possible given an  		individual's ability. In the past, employment in sheltered workshops was the  		dominant form of vocational activity, including workshops where disabled  		workers perform tasks geared to their perceived abilities and pay is generally  		pro-rated to individual productivity. However, this type of employment is  		segregated and provides limited opportunity for interaction with non-disabled  		people. A more recent approach, supported employment, includes training and  		ongoing support at a regular work site, and interaction with co-workers. There  		is some evidence that supported work alternatives provide increased earning  		opportunity to disabled workers at comparable or lower overall program costs  		(Hill, M. et al., 1987a).</p>
<p>Although supported employment shows promise for economic independence  		for many persons with developmental disabilities, State reports indicate that  		lack of stable funding threatens its viability as a long-term vocational  		program option (Hill, M. et al., 1987; Jaskulski and Weader, 1987; Laski and  		Shultz, 1987; Whitehead, 1987a).</p>
<p>About 250,000 developmentally disabled adults live in family settings  		and participate in State-funded day and vocational training programs (Buckley  		and Bellamy, 1985). Additionally, most of the adults who live in smaller  		community-based residential facilities also participate in day treatment or  		vocational training programs outside their residence.</p>
<p><b>Case Management</b></p>
<p>Case management is increasingly viewed as a critical component in the  		MR/DD service system. The case manager's key function is to ensure the  		coordination of services in meeting the individual client's program goals. Case  		management is widely available in institutions, where services require  		monitoring and coordination even though they are provided within the facility.  		Case management in the community, while less available in many areas, may be  		more important than in institutional settings because community-based MR/DD  		services are dispersed and the role of the case manager is more complex.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for a person to have two or more service plans. For  		example, children receiving special education services have an Individualized  		Education Plan (IEP) while those individuals living in ICFs/MR must have an  		Individualized Program Plan (IPP). When a person becomes eligible for  		vocational rehabilitation services, an Individualized Written Rehabilitation  		Plan (IWRP) is developed. Ideally, these various service plans should be  		coordinated to ensure continuity and complementary activities.</p>
<p>The extent of case management and its organization varies across the  		States. Frequently case management is provided by a public or quasi-public  		entity. The role of case manager is that of a broker operating to balance  		competing interests, including those of service consumers, of service vendors,  		and of service purchasers. The effectiveness of the case manager is influenced  		by the relationship of case management to the various parties involved. For  		example, there may be a potential conflict of interest between a service  		provider's incentive to maximize revenues and a client's changing service  		needs. As a result, some argue that the only way case management can  		effectively focus on the client's interests is to be "independent" from both  		payers and providers.</p>
<h3>THE RESEARCH CASE FOR COMMUNITY PROGRAMS</h3>
<p>There is considerable research evidence that advances in adaptive  		behavior and independent living skills are associated with: 1) community living  		arrangements in small family-like settings and 2) learning experiences which  		provide opportunities for interaction with non-disabled people. For example, in  		one controlled study (Close, 1977), eight of 15 residents randomly selected  		from an institution were placed in a community residence with a supplemental  		vocational program. A one-year follow-up found that the experimental group made  		significantly greater gains in self-care and social interaction areas than  		their institutionalized peers. A similar study found that after four years, 18  		severely retarded children from a large institution moved to "community"  		residential settings of 20 to 25 persons developed significantly better  		self-care and social skills than their matched peers who remained  		institutionalized (Kushlick, 1975). (See Appendix C.)</p>
<p>Two more recent studies of the effects of moving from an institution to  		community-based residence have supported these findings. As part of the  		Pennhurst longitudinal study, Conroy, Efthimiou, and Lemanowicz (1982) compared  		a group of 70 severely and profoundly retarded persons placed in community  		settings with a matched group of 70 who remained institutionalized. No  		significant differences existed between the groups at initial assessment, but  		at the end of two years the group who had moved to small community facilities  		(average of 3.2 residents each) showed significant increases in adaptive  		behavior skills, while the institution group's adaptive behavior remained  		essentially the same. More recently Rosen (1985) conducted a two year study of  		changes in adaptive behavior of two randomly selected groups of 58  		institutional residents each; one group was placed in small community-based  		residential and vocational services while the other group remained in the  		institution. Although no statistical differences existed between the two groups  		at the outset, by the end of the two-year period clients placed in the  		community were statistically superior in adaptive behavior.</p>
<p>Although the studies cited above are only a few of those conducted and  		involve a small fraction of the residential care population, their findings are  		consistent and reflect important behavioral change clearly associated with  		movement from institutions to community-based living arrangements. <b>More  		specifically, these studies demonstrate a consistent positive correlation  		between community integrated experience and the acquisition of adaptive  		behavior, particularly in the areas of self-care, social behavior, and  		communication</b>.</p>
<p>Given the tendency for measures of adaptive behavior to reflect  		behaviors and skills that are part of daily community living, these findings  		should not be surprising. None the less, there is substantial empirical data to  		support the philosophical and social principles of continued depopulation of  		institutional settings and the expansion of family and community care.</p>
<p>Similar evidence of the effectiveness of community-based vocational  		training programs is available. A rapidly growing body of research shows people  		with severe handicaps, including many who in past decades would have been  		considered unlikely employment program clients, are succeeding in real work  		activities (Bellamy, Showers and Bourbeau, 1983; Brown et al., 1984; Gold,  		1973; Hill, M. et al., 1987b; Katz, Goldberg and Shurka, 1977; Noble and  		Conley, 1987).</p>
<p>If policy is to seriously serve the goals outlined in the Developmental  		Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act -that is, "to enable (persons  		with developmental disabilities) to achieve their maximum potential through  		increased independence, productivity, and integration into the community" [Sec.  		101(a)(5)) -- it must include efforts to promote community-based services. The  		relationship between Federal policy and the MR/DD service system is examined in  		<a href="mrddwges.htm#federal">Chapter IV</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="federal" id="federal">IV. THE FEDERAL ROLE</a></h2>
<p>The Federal Government influences the services and support av4iiable to  		people with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities in two  		principal ways: through financing policy and through leadership. This chapter  		examines how these roles are exercised, particularly their effect on the MR/DD  		services system and its clientele.</p>
<h3>FEDERAL LEGISLATION</h3>
<p>Prior to 1965, Federal support for the construction of mental  		retardation facilities, including State institutions and some community service  		centers, was provided through the Hill-Burton Hospital Construction Program.  		About $32 million was spent under this program on MR/DD projects during the  		period of 1958-1971 (Braddock, 1987). In 1963 the Mental Retardation Facilities  		and Community Mental Health Centers Act (P.L. 88-164) authorized the  		construction of research centers and community-based mental retardation  		facilities. A total of $155.7 million was expended under this Act between FY  		1965 and FY 1971 (Braddock, 1987).</p>
<p>Federal involvement in financing MR/DD services in institutions expanded  		significantly with the enactment of the Medicaid program in 1965. This  		legislation allowed States to seek Federal financial participation (FFP) for  		mentally retarded "patients" in skilled nursing facilities (SNF). In 1967, a  		less expensive Intermediate Care Facility (ICF) benefit was authorized under  		Title XI of the Social Security Act. The ICF and SNF benefits were combined  		under Title XIX in 1971, and to this combination was added a little noticed,  		scarcely debated amendment which authorized an intermediate level of care  		specifically for persons with mental retardation, Intermediate Care Facilities  		for the Mentally Retarded (ICFs/MR).</p>
<p>The ICF/MR program has had a profound influence on the service delivery  		system. It provided Federal monies for upgrading the physical environment and  		quality of care in State institutions for the mentally retarded. It was the  		first open-ended funding source for services to mentally retarded persons. Its  		standards for active treatment and individualized habilitation plans have been  		major factors in the shift from custodial care to developmental programs in  		public institutions. It also permitted ICF/MR certification of small  		community-based facilities (15 beds or less). Forty-eight States and the  		District of Columbia participate in the ICF/MR program which is now the primary  		source of Federal financing for MR/DD services.</p>
<p>The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (P.L. 94142) is  		another landmark piece of Federal legislation. This Act radically changed the  		relationship between Federal, State and local education agencies in providing  		special education. First, it guaranteed access to a free and appropriate  		education for all handicapped children and youth from 3-21 years old. Second,  		it developed numerous and demanding procedural standards for the delivery of  		special education. Third, it provided Federal funding directly for special  		education. Fourth, it created special incentives and assistance to stimulate  		State and local development of non-mandated services of importance (e.g.,  		infant intervention). Finally, it supported research and demonstration  		activities directly related to the nature and quality of services provided  		under the Act.</p>
<p>P.L. 94-142 has greatly increased access to educational programs. For  		example, the total number of mentally retarded students receiving special  		education increased from 540,000 in 1966 (Mackie, 1969) to about 840,000 15  		years later (U.S. Department of Education, 1984). In doing so it has had a  		dramatic effect on the number of children and youth with mental retardation in  		institutional care. Their numbers decreased from over 110,000 in 1967 to about  		60,000 in 1982 and further declined to an estimated 44,000 in 1986 (Lakin et  		al., in preparation).</p>
<h3>OVERVIEW OF FEDERAL EXPENDITURES</h3>
<p>The previous chapter noted the dominant role of States in determining  		the mix of institutional and community services available to people with  		developmental disabilities. However, it is equally true that the Federal  		Government has assumed an instrumental role in financing services. Total  		Federal spending for MR/DD assistance programs in FY 1986 was about $8 billion  		(Braddock (1987). The distribution of these expenditures among Federal programs  		is illustrated in <b><a href="mrddwges.htm#exhibit6">Exhibit 6</a></b>. <b>Federal  		expenditures represent about one-half of total public (Federal-State-local)  		spending for the MR/DD population (Braddock and Hemp, 1986)</b>.</p>
<p>The first thing to note about Federal financing is that over one-third  		of the Federal pie -- roughly $3 billion in FY 1986 -- is allocated  		specifically for residential services through the ICF/MR program. Three  		quarters of this $3 billion finances care in large State operated institutions.  		Prior to 1971, public institutions for the mentally retarded were supported  		exclusively by State revenues. By 1986, Federal payments accounted for almost  		one-half of all MR/DD institutional spending. This clearly represents a  		dramatic shift in financing from the States to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>The other large Federal expenditures are for income transfers, primarily  		the Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI) and the Social Security  		Disability Insurance Program (SSDI). SSI and SSDI benefits are used by disabled  		people living in the community for basic subsistence such as room and board.  		SSI expenditures were about $2 billion in 1986 with an additional $1 billion  		paid as SSDI benefits. The remaining Federal expenditures are spread across a  		large number of programs including special education grants, social services  		block grants, HUD 202/8 loan and rent subsidies, State vocational  		rehabilitation grants, Medicaid Home and Community-Based Care (HCB) Waivers and  		food stamps.</p>

<p>This section describes the specific Federal programs which provide  		services to the MR/DD population.</p>
<p><b><i>ICF/MR</i></b></p>
<p>Since its creation in 1971, the ICF/MR program has grown from  		approximately $200 million to $5.2 billion in 1986 (Burwell, 1987). To be  		certified as an ICF/MR, an institution must provide among other things, health  		or rehabilitative services to persons with mental retardation and related  		conditions who require 24 hour supervision. Services may be provided by the  		facility or through contracts with other providers. Every resident must have a  		written plan of care and be receiving "active treatment." While there are both  		large and small ICFs/MR, the overwhelming majority of ICF/MR residents (123,000  		people or 85 percent) are in facilities with over 16 beds. The average size of  		these larger facilities is 155 beds (Lakin, 1987).</p>
<p>Medicaid eligibility for ICF/MR services includes categorical and  		financial criteria. ICF/MR recipients must first be determined categorically  		disabled according to SSI disability criteria. Their income and assets must  		also meet financial criteria established by each State Medicaid program. In  		actuality, however, virtually every person placed in an ICF/MR certified bed is  		eligible for Medicaid, and Medicaid pays for over 97 percent of the total cost  		of ICF/MR care (Burwell, et al., 1987). In addition, ICF/MR residents must be  		in need of active treatment with a diagnosis of mental retardation or "related  		conditions." Related conditions means a severe, chronic disability that meets  		all of the following conditions:</p>
<ol type="A"><li>
<p>It is attributable to: cerebral palsy or epilepsy or any other  			 condition, other than mental illness, found to be closely related to mental  			 retardation because this condition results in impairment of general  			 intellectual functioning or adaptive behavior similar to that of mentally  			 retarded persons, and requires treatment of services similar to those required  			 for these persons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is manifested before the person reaches age 22.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is likely to continue indefinitely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It results in substantial functional limitation in three or more of  			 the following areas of major life activity: self-care, understanding and use of  			 language, learning, mobility, self-direction, capacity for independent  			 living.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><b>SOURCE: 42CFRI Section 435.1009 (1986).</b></p>
<p>Several aspects of the ICF/MR program are particularly noteworthy:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>ICF/MR expenditures of $5.2 billion (including the Federal and State  			 shares) now constitute almost 13 percent of the total Medicaid budget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Growth in the ICF/MR program alone accounts for the increased  			 proportion of Medicaid spent for long-term care between 1975-1985.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relatively few people participate; there were roughly 145,000 ICF/MR  			 residents served in 1986 at an average annual cost of approximately $35,000  			 each.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ICF/MR expenditures overwhelmingly support care in large facilities  			 of 16 or more beds; 87 percent of the expenditures in 1986 were for care in  			 larger facilities and 75 percent were allocated to State operated institutions.  			 The average annual reimbursement per person in State-operated facilities was  			 $44,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The services paid for through the ICF/MR program are heavily  			 influenced by the health and welfare orientation of the Medicaid program. As a  			 result, there are gaps in client eligibility, (e.g., children living with  			 parents who are not poor, young adults transitioning from the school system who  			 do not need the level of care provided in ICFs/MR).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As noted in <a href="mrddwges.htm#service">Chapter III</a>, there is tremendous  			 variation among States in their use of the ICF/MR program. As a result, Federal  			 resources for persons with developmental disabilities are distributed unevenly  			 across States. For example, five States (New York, Minnesota, Massachusetts,  			 Rhode Island, and Louisiana), which account for 14 percent of the U.S.  			 population, receive over 31 percent all Federal ICF/MR dollars. New York  			 receives six Federal dollars per State resident for every one dollar received  			 by Indiana, West Virginia, or Hawaii (Burwell, 1987).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cost of ICF/MR care also varies significantly across States. In  			 1986, the average annual cost (reimbursement) per recipient ranged from $12,061  			 in West Virginia to $87,141 in Alaska. It is unclear the extent to which this  			 variation reflects differences in the quality of care provided and/or  			 differences in the actual cost of providing care., Some critics believe that  			 reimbursement systems, particularly care provided in State-operated facilities,  			 encourage the inefficient use of Federal resources for MR/DD services. It is  			 frequently argued that excessive amounts of ICF/MR dollars are spent on  			 administrative and other overhead costs, to the detriment of direct client  			 services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most significant growth in the ICF/MR program is occurring in  			 small facilities (under 15 beds), including the conversion of many  			 non-certified group homes to ICFs/MR.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Home and Community Care Waivers</i></b></p>
<p>The most significant source of Federal funding for community services  		are the Medicaid Home and Community Care Waivers which allow Federal Financial  		Participation (FFP) for community services if the State demonstrates the  		"cost-effectiveness" of such services as substitutes for institutional  		care.</p>
<p>To be eligible for waiver services, clients must meet the functional  		(level of care) criteria established by each State for ICF/MR placements. Most  		developmentally disabled recipients of waiver services reside in small group  		homes which are not Medicaid certified. Client SSI income generally covers the  		cost of room and board while the waiver is used to finance the cost of  		residential program staff, day programs and transportation to and from the day  		program facility. As of June 30, 1986, approximately one-third of the 23,050  		developmentally disabled waiver recipients were living with their natural  		families (Laudicina and Burwell, 1987). For these clients, the waiver usually  		pays for the cost of day program services and respite care. <b><a href="mrddwges.htm#exhibit7">Exhibit 7</a></b> shows the distribution of waiver  		expenditures by type of service.</p>
<p>Total Federal/State expenditures under the Home and Community-Based Care  		waiver for services to developmentally disabled people rose from $3 million in  		1982 to about $200 million in 1986. It should be noted that the average cost to  		Medicaid per waiver <i>recipient</i> in 1986 was less than $9,000 per year,  		approximately one-fourth the average annual cost of $35,000 per ICF/MR program  		recipient in 1986 (Lakin, 1987).</p>

</tr></table><p><b><i>Special Education and Vocational Education</i></b></p>
<p>Federal expenditures under the Education for all Handicapped Children  		Act P.L. 94-142 for State grants have now reached over $1 billion. According to  		the Department of Education, State grants represent approximately 8 to 9  		percent of the per pupil costs of educating a handicapped child (Department of  		Education, 1987). The remaining costs are borne by State and local  		government.</p>
<p>The purpose of Special Education grants is to help States and schools to  		provide instruction and services tailored to the special needs of handicapped  		children.</p>
<p>Vocational Education, another source of Federal funds, provides  		vocational services for persons with developmental disabilities through school  		programs. Such programs frequently combine classroom instruction with on-site  		work experience. An estimated $25 million was spent in FY 1986 for vocational  		education services for people with developmental disabilities.</p>
<p><b><i>Vocational Rehabilitation</i></b></p>
<p>Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) is a federally funded, State operated  		program which assists persons with disabilities in entering or returning to  		employment. Under the Basic State Grant program, funds are provided to States  		on a formula basis for a variety of vocational rehabilitation services  		including counseling, training and job placement. Because people with  		developmental disabilities are often in need of sheltered or supported  		employment, in the past, many have been denied VR services. This has changed  		somewhat as a result of Federal funding for the development of supported  		employment.</p>
<p>The 1986 allocation for Vocational Rehabilitation services was $1.14  		billion; the funding rate is 80 percent Federal, 20 percent State. In FY 1984,  		an estimated $125 million in Rehabilitation funds were expended to provide  		services to mentally retarded VR clients. Nearly 26,000 persons with mental  		retardation were rehabilitated, representing about 12 percent of the total VR  		caseload (Braddock, 1987a).</p>
<p><b><i>Other Service Programs</i></b></p>
<p>A variety of other Federal programs also are used to fund services in  		the community. For example, the <i>Social Services Block Grant</i> is a funding  		source for residential and MR/DD adult day programs in some States. Braddock et  		al. (1987) estimate Title XX expenditures for day programs at $101.8 million in  		1986.</p>
<p>The <i>Job Training Partnership Act</i> (JTPA), administered by the  		Department of Labor, provides training and employment services to several  		special needs groups. However, its impact on the disabled population has been  		limited. Persons with all forms of disability completing the program in FY 1986  		represented less than 10 percent of the total. Most developmentally disabled  		people would not be considered as JTPA candidates since eligibility is based on  		the capacity to earn hourly wages of at least $4.94, while the average starting  		hourly wage for MR/DD persons was $3.96 in 1985 (Kiernan, McGaughey, &amp;  		Schalock, 1986). Total funding for JTPA in FY 1986 was nearly $1.8 billion; an  		estimated $23 million was spent for training and employment services for about  		5,200 developmentally disabled people.</p>
<p>The primary Federally funded <i>housing programs</i> serving people with  		disabilities are Section 202, Section 106, and Section 8 programs. Section 202  		provides direct Federal loans, for a maximum of 40 years, to assist private,  		non-profit corporations and consumer cooperatives in the development of new or  		substantially rehabilitated housing for elderly or handicapped individuals. By  		law, at least 10 percent of all Section 202 units must be reserved for use by  		handicapped people. Most proposals involving persons with developmental  		disabilities are for group homes (Larsen, 1987). The Section 106 program  		provides "seed money" to assist in Section 202 project planning. Section 8  		assists persons with low income in obtaining housing through the use of rent  		subsidies. In March 1987, there were 390 Section 202 projects targeted to  		developmentally disabled people. These projects contained 5,204 units serving  		approximately 10,000 clients. Another 345 projects with 3,820 units were under  		development (Department of Housing and Urban Development, 1987). Some community  		services are financed by the <i>Developmental Disabilities Act</i>, primarily  		through the Basic State Grant program. States may use up to 65 percent of their  		allotment for special projects and services; however, funds are intended for  		project initiation and demonstration and are therefore not a source of  		long-term program support. The 1987 reauthorization of the Developmental  		Disabilities Act increased funding levels significantly to $62 million for  		Basic State Grants.</p>
<p><i>Health and Medical Care</i> funding is provided by Medicaid, Medicare  		and programs administered by the Public Health Service. Most people who receive  		SSI are eligible for Medicaid services as outlined under the State Medicaid  		plan. Individuals not receiving SSI benefits may also qualify for Medicaid as  		"medically needy" if their medical expenses exceed their ability to pay. Most  		mentally retarded children in foster care placement are also covered by  		Medicaid. An estimated 660,000 developmentally disabled people are enrolled in  		the Medicaid program and comprise about 27 percent of the Medicaid disabled  		population. No definitive information is available about the level of Medicaid  		expenditures for acute care or other Medicaid services for this population  		beyond those provided under the ICF/MR program and the Home and Community-Based  		Waiver program. However, Burwell, in a study of Medicaid utilization among  		ICF/MR residents in three States, found these residents to be relatively low  		users of other Medicaid services. The exception was younger residents under 6  		years who were relatively higher users of acute care (Burwell, 1987).</p>
<p>Developmentally disabled individuals who are SSDI beneficiaries are  		eligible for Medicare after a 24 month waiting period. Medicare has co-payment  		and deductible provisions; it does not require a means test as does Medicaid.  		However, Medicare benefits do not include long-term care.</p>
<p>Services for Children with Special Needs, funded under the Maternal and  		Child Health Block Grant, is another source of public monies. Braddock  		estimates that nearly $9.5 million was expended for services to developmentally  		disabled people in 1985 (Braddock, Hemp and Fujiura, 1986).</p>
<h3>FEDERAL INCOME MAINTENANCE</h3>
<p>Federal income maintenance programs are a significant source of cash  		benefits for people with disabilities living in the community.</p>
<p><b><i>The SSI Program</i></b></p>
<p>Title XVI of the Social Security Act, the Supplemental Security Income  		(SSI) program, authorizes a cash benefit for eligible disabled persons based on  		financial need. The program is centrally administered by the Social Security  		Administration, which supervises Disability Determination Units at the State  		level. These units determine eligibility based on disability for both the SSI  		and SSDI programs. To be eligible for SSI benefits, individuals must meet the  		following conditions:</p>
<ul><li>have little or no income or resources;</li>
<li>be medically disabled as determined by the disability determination  		  services (or by an appeals process entity such as administrative law judge) an  		  the initial application, or during a continuing disability review; and</li>
<li>initially not be working or working but earning less than the  		  substantial gainful activity (SGA) level, currently $300 per month. Children  		  below working age are considered eligible if their disability is of comparable  		  severity to one that would preclude SGA in an adult.</li>
</ul><p>Eligibility based on disability is defined in medical listings specific  		to the individual's primary diagnosis. For example, the medical listing for  		persons with mental retardation or autism requires that deficits in measured  		intelligence and/or functioning levels must be evident and have been initially  		exhibited prior to age 22.</p>
<p><b>The SSI program is presently the most important source of Federal  		assistance for people with mental retardation and related disabilities living  		in the community</b>. Several aspects of financing and participation are  		important to note.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Federal SSI payments to persons with mental retardation were  			 estimated to be over $2.0 billion in 1986 (Braddock, 1987).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average payment to all disabled individuals was $250 per month,  			 <i>not including optional State supplements</i>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recipients who earn income above a certain level lose $1 of their  			 SSI benefit for every $2 earned; however, a number of exclusions are applied in  			 determining earned income, and disability eligibility is maintained while the  			 SSI recipient works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Federal Benefit Rate (FBR) for SSI recipients living in the  			 household of another and receiving support is reduced by one-third. This  			 primarily applies to developmentally disabled adults who live with their  			 parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons institutionalized in Medicaid-certified facilities lose all  			 SSI benefits except for a personal needs allowance of approximately  			 $25.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All but two States elect to supplement SSI benefits for at least  			 some beneficiaries; the monthly supplement ranges from $3.40 (Oregon) to  			 $538.00 (Alaska), and does not necessarily cover all SSI  			 beneficiaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the Social Security Administration there were about  			 747,200 persons with a primary diagnosis of mental retardation or congenital  			 anomalies receiving SSI benefits in 1986. This represents approximately 27  			 percent of the SSI/disabled rolls.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><b><i>The SSDI Program</i></b></p>
<p>Title II of the Social Security Act establishes an entitlement program  		for disabled workers and their dependents funded from the Disability Insurance  		Trust Fund, created by employer and employee contributions. Most  		developmentally disabled people who receive SSDI do so under the Adult Disabled  		Child benefit (ADC) which authorizes payments to surviving disabled children  		age IS or older of retired, deceased or disabled workers eligible for Social  		Security benefits. The average monthly benefit check for SSDI/ADC recipients is  		less than $150 a month. The Social Security Administration estimates that  		522,300 people with mental retardation or congenital anomalies received  		SSDI/ADC benefits in 1986.</p>
<p>An SSDI provision with potential effect on people with severe  		disabilities is the requirement that workers in non-profit organizations be  		covered. This means that people with severe or profound retardation working in  		sheltered workshops and earning as little as $400 per quarter could qualify for  		disability insurance and be entitled to cash benefits, Medicare coverage and  		retirement income. The average monthly benefit, based on prior earnings, for  		disabled workers under SSDI was $466 per month in 1986.</p>
<p><b><i>Food Stamps</i></b></p>
<p>Since residents of small community living facilities became eligible for  		food stamp benefits in 1976, Federal expenditures for food stamps for people  		with developmental disabilities have risen to an estimated $200 million in FY  		1986 (Braddock, 1987).</p>
<p>No estimates are available of numbers served; however, the average  		monthly food stamp benefit is about $45 per month per person.</p>
<h3>FEDERAL LEADERSHIP</h3>
<p>Federal leadership is evident in the promotion of quality in the ICF/MR  		program. Federal ICF/MR standards have been instrumental in upgrading the level  		of care in large public institutions. The recent "look behind" surveys  		successfully identified problem MR/DD providers, both public and private and  		required correction of identified deficiencies. Regardless of their concerns  		about possible loss of FFP, States have generally applauded Federal leadership  		in carrying out these reviews (Jaskulski and Weader, 1987). The revised  		Conditions of Participation for the ICF/MR program, provide further evidence of  		the Federal Government's commitment to improve the quality of residential  		care.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest manifestation of Federal leadership in this field  		is the <i>Developmental Disabilities Act</i>. Its significance is only  		marginally related to the amount of Federal dollars administered by its  		programs. The Developmental Disabilities Act goals -- independence,  		productivity and integration into the community -- establish the context for  		assessing Federal MR/DD policy and for formulating new directions.</p>
<h2><a name="finding" id="finding">V. WORKING GROUP FINDINGS</a></h2>
<p>The previous chapters have described the size and characteristics of the  		Population with developmental disabilities; the organization of the service  		delivery system; and the Federal role in financing MR/DD services and support.  		In this chapter the conclusions of thick Working Group are presented. They are  		as follows:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b> The principal Federal financing program for the MR/DD  			 population, the ICY/MR program, has not kept pace with changes in the field of  			 developmental disabilities over the past twenty years.</b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>While the ICF/MR program represents the largest Federal  				  investment in services specifically for people with mental retardation and  				  other developmental disabilities, almost 90 percent of its resources are  				  allocated to services in large institutional settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This institutional care emphasis occurs despite the substantial  				  body of research showing that significant advances in adaptive behavior and  				  independent living skills of developmentally disabled people are strongly  				  associated with:</p>
<ul><li>small family-like settings;</li>
<li>community-based learning experiences that provide challenges  					 and promote independence; and</li>
<li>opportunities to interact with peers who are not  					 disabled.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Research also shows that even severely disabled people can work  				  productively and that people with substantial medical care needs can benefit  				  from habilitation and community integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most significantly, through litigation, advocacy and the!  				  promotion of new legislation, parents, disabled people themselves and  				  professionals have demonstrated their commitment to achieving family and  				  community living for the great majority of the MR/DD population.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><b>The most important Federal supports for the noninstitutionalized  			 MR/DD population are the SBI and BSDI programs, neither of which is intended to  			 pay for the full range of needed services.</b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>SSI and SSDI are designed to provide basic subsistence,  				  principally room and board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average SSI benefit and SSDI benefits for this population  				  are $250 and $150 per month respectively. it is estimated that the average  				  monthly cost for a young adult who needs habilitation and vocational services  				  as well as a supervised residence is close to $1,900, based on 1982 cost  				  estimates adjusted for inflation (Ashbaugh and Allard, 1984).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearly all States supplement SSI benefits; however, the average  				  State supplement is only $51 per month. in some States, few SSI beneficiaries  				  with developmental disabilities are eligible for the State supplement.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><b>The lack of substantial Federal participation in the financing of  			 community services is widely perceived as a barrier to independence,  			 productivity and community integration for developmentally disabled  			 individuals. It may also load, down the road, to a  			 reinstitutionalization movement.</b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>People with developmental disabilities who are placed out of  				  their homes in an ICF/MR are assured services. In essence, they have an  				  entitlement to care as long as they remain in a certified facility and meet  				  ICF/MR eligibility criteria. Given the lack of community alternatives, it is  				  not surprising that on average, an ICF/MR resident in a large public  				  institution has spent 13 years in such a facility (Sigford et al.,  				  1982).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who live in a non-ICF/MR community residence or with  				  their family have no such protection. They can either get some services, end up  				  on waiting lists or do without altogether, depending on the service  				  availability in their area and the commitment of their States to pay. Even  				  people with the most severe impairments have no guaranteed access to services  				  after they exit programs provided through the public school systems. A recent  				  study of waiting lists includes reports of tens of thousands of persons with  				  mental retardation waiting for community services across the various States  				  (Association for Retarded Citizens/US, 1987).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without a greater public commitment to community services, many  				  of these young adults could end up losing most of the gains made through  				  special education and, in the process, begin a new trend toward increased  				  institutionalization.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><b>Many features of the principal Federal funding source for KR/DD  			 services -- the Medicaid program -- make it unattractive as the vehicle for  			 Federal policy reform.</b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>A basic issue in current financing policy is the large  				  concentration of resources (ICFs/MR) devoted to the support of a relatively few  				  people, primarily those in large public institutions. However, as this report  				  tries to make clear, there is a much larger number of developmentally disabled  				  people living in the community who could benefit from community services.  				  Because of the open-ended nature of the Medicaid program, creating a community  				  service benefit similar to the ICF/MR benefit would be prohibitively expensive.  				  HCFA has estimated that. such an expansion could cost at least $700 million in  				  additional Federal Medicaid costs in its first year. Other estimates are that  				  expansion could add as much as $2.5 billion to Federal Medicaid costs (Burwell,  				  1987).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A second issue is Medicaid's welfare orientation. Medicaid was  				  originally intended to provide Federal and State assistance to poor people. As  				  a result, several sub-groups of the MR/DD population are generally excluded  				  from receiving benefits. These groups include children who remain at home with  				  parents whose income is above Medicaid eligibility levels and young adults  				  making the transition from school to adult life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A third issue is the health insurance orientation of Medicaid  				  which imposes regulatory and administrative limitations on the nature of the  				  services which can be covered. Most services needed by persons with  				  developmental disabilities are not (and should not be) medical or even health  				  related.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reliance on Medicaid to pay for MR/DD services also creates  				  widespread potential for administrative inefficiencies at the State level.  				  State mental retardation agencies and State Medicaid agencies must coordinate  				  eligibility, service coverage, provider licensing, payment system, and quality  				  assurance policies to ensure Federal Financial Participation (FFP). Since State  				  Medicaid Agencies and State Mental Retardation Agencies frequently operate  				  under vastly different policy agendas, successful coordination is not always  				  achieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the open-ended financing of the Medicaid program  				  distorts policy decisions at the State level. States often emphasize maximizing  				  FFP under Medicaid instead of developing a high quality MR/DD service system at  				  a reasonable price.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><b>Two central features of the Medicaid program, which are widely,  			 viewed as strengths, make it difficult to create a new MR/DD program outside of  			 Medicaid.</b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Advocacy groups and States believe that keeping MR/DD services  				  within Medicaid will protect the entitlement aspects of the ICF/MR program and  				  shield it from budget cuts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most interest groups strongly support the heavy involvement of  				  the Federal Government in quality control that has been achieved in the  				  Medicaid program and do not want to see this role diminished.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><p>The Working Group recommends that these considerations be kept in mind  		in reviewing the policy options described in the final section of this  		report.</p>
<h2><a name="policy" id="policy">VI. POLICY ALTERNATIVES</a></h2>
<p>This chapter outlines a range of policy alternatives for reforming MR/DD  		financing. The first two options were developed by an HHS Working Group. One  		would result in a comprehensive restructuring of Federal financing of services  		to persons with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities. The  		other Working Group option would make incremental changes to Medicaid. It  		should be noted that neither option developed by HHS staff has been endorsed by  		the Department nor by OMB. Two congressional initiatives are also presented.  		Each would expand Medicaid funding and eligibility to this population.</p>
<h3>COMPREHENSIVE REFORM OF FEDERAL FINANCING FOR MR/DD  		SERVICES</h3>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>The Working Group's first alternative would establish an entirely new  		Federal program for financing services to persons with mental retardation and  		other developmental disabilities. It would consolidate existing Medicaid  		funding for non-acute care services into a new program to be administered  		outside of Medicaid. The program would be budget neutral; aggregate Federal  		spending under the new program would equal actuarial projections of Medicaid  		spending for MR/DD services under current law, and would be capped. States  		would be allowed wide flexibility in the use of Federal funds for financing  		MR/DD services, but they could not exceed annual spending caps established for  		each State. The new program would retain an entitlement component by requiring  		States to provide a core set of supportive services to persons with severe  		developmental deficits. Persons with less severe disabilities would be eligible  		for, but not entitled to, Federally-financed services at the option of  		States.</p>
<p><b>How This Option Differs from Current Policy and Other  		Options Under Consideration</b></p>
<p>The comprehensive reform option is the most extreme departure from  		current policy in that it would move approximately $4.2 billion in Federal  		spending for MR/DD services under Medicaid (in FY 1990) into a new program. It  		would create a new financing mechanism specifically targeted to the service  		needs of persons with developmental disabilities. The proposal would also  		eliminate the current ICF/MR program, establish a cap on aggregate Federal  		spending, and gradually lead to a more even distribution of Federal resources  		for MR/DD services across the 50 States.</p>
<p><b>Administration, Eligibility, Services and Quality  		Assurance</b></p>
<p>A single Federal agency would implement and administer the new program.  		This agency would be responsible for State allocation formulae, payments to  		States, eligibility and service coverage requirements, and the development and  		enforcement of quality assurance standards. At the State level, a lead agency  		would be responsible for administering Federal funds. In all likelihood this  		would be the State Mental Retardation/Developmental Disabilities Services  		agency.</p>
<p>States would be required to enroll a mandatory population defined on the  		basis of functional level. The mandatory population would consist of persons  		with severe developmental deficits (more specifically defined in the full  		proposal). Persons who met these functional criteria would be entitled to a  		core set of services and protections regardless of income status, although cost  		sharing of parents and recipients would be required. States could also extend  		eligibility to persons with less severe disabilities at their option, but these  		persons would not be legally entitled to services under Federal law.</p>
<p>The core set of services and protections include case management,  		residential services, respite care and vocational/developmental services.  		Again, States could provide a broader package of services at their own option.  		The mandatory and optional eligibility and service coverage components of the  		program reflect the structure of the current Medicaid program. Access to acute  		care and other medical services would be available through Medicaid, Medicare,  		private health insurance, or other coverage mechanisms without change to  		existing laws.</p>
<p>Quality assurance standards would be client-based rather than facility  		or provider-based, with an emphasis on individualized assessment, treatment,  		and outcomes. All contracted providers, with the exception of client family  		members, would be required to be licensed by the State. States would have the  		option of contracting with independent accreditation and quality assurance  		agencies which met Federal standards.</p>
<p><b>Financing</b></p>
<p>Under the new MR/DD Services Program, States could claim Federal  		Financial Participation (FFP) for eligible expenditures up to a pre-determined  		ceiling, established in advance by the Department for each fiscal year.  		Federal/State matching rates would stay the same as those used in the Medicaid  		program.</p>
<p>The aggregate Federal ceiling for the first year of implementation would  		equal projected Federal expenditures for that year, based on the Medicaid  		Forecasting System, for ICF/MR, Medicaid waiver, and other non-acute care  		services for the MR/DD population. The ceiling would be adjusted downward to  		offset projected increases in Federal SSI benefits resulting from the  		elimination of the ICF/MR program.</p>
<p>After the first year of implementation, each State's ceiling would be  		indexed for State population growth and price increases, using the Average Wage  		Index for Social Security-Covered Employment. An additional adjustment would be  		made for States which currently spend less than the national mean (per capita)  		for MR/DD services. This adjustment is intended to gradually lead to the more  		equitable distribution of Federal resources for MR/DD services across  		States.</p>
<p>Elimination of the ICF/MR program will have a budgetary impact on the  		SSI program since under the new program current ICF/MR recipients will be  		entitled to receive full SSI benefits instead of a reduced personal needs  		allowance. The aggregate ceiling on FFP would be reduced by an amount equal to  		the aggregate increase in Federal SSI payments.</p>
<p><b>Advantages and Advantages of This Option</b></p>
<p>This option is intended to achieve the kinds of programmatic reforms  		that growing numbers of people in the field believe are needed in Federal MR/DD  		policy within a budget neutral framework. At the same time, States are  		guaranteed the same increases in Federal spending that are projected under  		current Medicaid law.</p>
<p>Incentives for families to place children in out-of-home residential  		settings would be eliminated; services would be available regardless of where a  		person chose to live. Services would be tailored to individual needs. Resources  		would be targeted to the most severely disabled and vulnerable population.</p>
<p>Increases in aggregate Federal spending would become more predictable in  		a fixed-budget program, and inequities in the allocation of Federal resources  		across States would be reduced.</p>
<p>Replacing Medicaid with a fixed-budget program as the primary funding  		source for MR/DD services is viewed by some as the major disadvantage of this  		proposal. Despite its eligibility and service coverage restrictions, and its  		inefficiencies, the open-ended financing aspect of Medicaid and its protection  		from Gramm-Rudman sequestrations remains attractive, particularly to State  		program administrators. The new program may also be criticized for not  		mandating expansions in community-based and family support services. The  		proposal rather assumes that the fiscal incentives built into the program will  		lead to expansions in community-based and family-support financing and delivery  		systems.</p>
<h3>SELECTED CHANGES TO MEDICAID</h3>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>The second option of the Working Group is to modify existing Medicaid  		program provisions, particularly the ICF/MR program, which limit opportunities  		for financing services in integrated, community-based settings. The intent of  		these proposals is to make the program more responsive to individual needs. Any  		or all changes could be implemented.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Limit ICF/MR Eligibility</p>
<p>This reform proposes four strategies to limit ICF/MR services to  			 clients actually in need of active treatment:</p>
<ul><li>require State screening of prospective ICF/MR residents, using  				HCFA regulations (to be developed) based on degree of disability, functional  				status, and least restrictive alternatives</li>
<li>require States to conduct ongoing reviews utilizing these  				criteria</li>
<li>restrict new admissions to large ICFs/MR</li>
<li>restrict ICF/MR admissions of children to small facilities.</li>
</ul><p>The purpose of this reform is to clarify that the ICF/MR program is  			 designed to serve only those developmentally disabled individuals who require  			 active treatment in an intensive care setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reform Reimbursement for Medicaid Services</p>
<p>This proposal would address inappropriate cost shifting to Federal  			 financing, promote cost-effective care in community settings and reduce  			 inequities among the States. Research is essential to develop reimbursement  			 reforms in the ICF/MR and other Medicaid long-term care programs, in particular  			 to gain understanding of the cost discrepancies between the States. This  			 research should include:</p>
<ul><li>a comprehensive study of the cost of providing ICF/MR services in  				the States to provide a data base for precise and defensible payment reforms;  				and</li>
<li>experimentation with prospective client-centered payment systems  				to reduce incentives for the use of high-cost options.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Improve Quality Assurance</p>
<p>Problems can occur because of the apparent conflict of interest when  			 States survey and certify their own public facilities. Three options to address  			 the conflict of interest issues are proposed:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Deemed status - States would give facilities the option to  				  choose an approved private accrediting body to conduct certification surveys;  				  the accreditation decision would thus be binding. Public facilities that chose  				  not to use deemed status would be certified by HCFA rather than the State. This  				  would require legislative change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federal survey and Certification of public facilities the  				  Federal Government would be responsible, as the Institute of Medicine has  				  recommended, for all Federally-financed long-term care facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased Federal reviews - this option would retain the current  				  quality assurance system but increase Federal "look behind"  				  activities.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The first of these three options, deemed status, is recommended with  			 HCFA certifying and possibly also surveying public facilities which do not use  			 the deemed status option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure Parental Responsibility</p>
<p>Parents of children with developmental disabilities frequently do  			 not contribute to the cost of publicly supported care, especially for  			 Medicaid-funded services in an ICF/MR. A change in the Medicaid statute to  			 require financially able parents to contribute to the cost of care for their  			 minor children in an ICF/MR would reduce the incentive to institutionalize  			 children, promote parental involvement, and provide additional funds for other  			 Medicaid services. Federal cost sharing should also be considered for HCB  			 waiver services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow ICF/MR Residents to Retain Earnings</p>
<p>Supported employment and other advances in the MR/DD field have  			 demonstrated that many ICF/MR residents have significant earnings potential.  			 Under current regulations, however, only a small amount -- usually $25.00 per  			 month -- may be retained by the resident for personal use, with the rest  			 applied to the cost of care. This potential disincentive to gainful employment  			 activity should be reduced by:</p>
<ul><li>permitting residents to retain earnings but requiring them to  				contribute toward their room and board at rates comparable to those in the  				community; and</li>
<li>allowing employed residents to continue their eligibility for  				ICF/MR services, at least until such time as their earnings reach a level  				sufficiently adequate to support appropriate living arrangements outside an  				ICF/MR.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><p><b>How This Option Differs from Current Policy and Other  		Options Under Consideration</b></p>
<p>The proposals discussed in this option are designed to modify elements  		of existing policy and represent an incremental approach to policy reform.  		Unlike the comprehensive reform proposal, they would maintain Medicaid as the  		primary funding source for MR/DD services. These incremental changes are far  		less sweeping than either the Working Group's reform proposal or the  		Congressional initiatives.</p>
<p><b>Advantages and Disadvantages of This Option</b></p>
<p>The changes proposed in this option would address some of the more  		troublesome features of-the current Medicaid ICF/MR program. These reforms  		could stimulate growth in small community-based ICFs/MR and help insure those  		individuals who are served are clearly in need of active treatment in an  		intensive service setting. Implementation of these changes could be viewed as  		an interim measure and would not necessarily inhibit the development of other  		proposals.</p>
<p>Since significant momentum has been building for reform of Federal  		financing of services to MR/DD people, these incremental changes are not likely  		to be favorably received, especially if it appears the Congress might enact  		major reform legislation.</p>
<h3>CONGRESSIONAL INITIATIVES</h3>
<p>Legislation was introduced during the 100th Congress which would have  		expanded Medicaid funding for home and community services to persons with  		mental retardation and other developmental disabilities. Two of the bills are  		discussed briefly here. Although neither piece of legislation was enacted, they  		will probably be reintroduced early in the next Congress.</p>
<p><b><i>Medicaid Home and Community Quality Services Act of 1987  		(Chafee/Florio)</i></b></p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>This bill was introduced by Senator Chafee; a House version of the bill  		was sponsored by Representative Florio. It would mandate that States provide an  		array of community and family support services to persons with developmental  		disabilities who are eligible for Medicaid. Persons with developmental  		disabilities are defined as those whose disability occurred prior to age 22.  		The age of onset limitation would gradually increase over time, to age 50, so  		that most persons whose disabilities were not developmental in nature would  		also eventually be entitled to these services. States also have the option to  		cover a broader array of supportive services, if they choose. Financial  		criteria for Medicaid eligibility would be liberalized for this population,  		also at State option. Funding for expanded community-based services for persons  		with developmental disabilities under Medicaid would be partially offset by a  		freeze on Federal matching funds for services provided in facilities with more  		than 15 beds. It is anticipated that this provision would provide a significant  		fiscal incentive for States to continue initiatives to deinstitutionalize  		clients from large State institutions to smaller, more integrated, residential  		settings.</p>
<p><b><i>Medicaid Quality Services to the Mentally Retarded Amendments of  		1988 (Waxman)</i></b></p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>This legislation, introduced by Representative Waxman, would allow  		States to provide community habilitation services to MR/DD persons as an option  		under the State Medicaid plan. It would also extend eligibility for community  		habilitation services to anyone who would be eligible for Medicaid if admitted  		to an institution (essentially waiving deeming of parental income for children  		under 18). It would reclassify ICFs/MR as "habilitative" facilities and  		establish detailed quality assurance standards for them. The legislation would  		essentially extend statutory authority to quality assurance-standards which are  		now in effect in regulatory form. Further, it would require States to ensure  		appropriate placement in habilitation facilities by conducting pre-admission  		screening and annual client reviews. The proposed legislation also includes  		detailed employee protection arrangements for employees affected by reduction  		plans for large facilities.</p>
<p><b>Now Those Initiatives Differ from Current Policy and  		Other Options</b></p>
<p>These initiatives differ from current policy in that they would  		considerably expand the availability of Federal Financial Participation for  		community-based services under Medicaid. They both also expand the population  		eligible for Medicaid-financed services at the option of States. These  		Congressional initiatives also differ from each other. The Chafee bill  		<i>requires</i> States provide community services while the Waxman bill only  		gives States the <i>option</i> of providing these services on a statewide  		basis. Another difference is their approach to Medicaid financing of large  		facilities. The Chafee bill would freeze Medicaid spending for large facilities  		at current levels while the Waxman bill prohibits payment limits for either  		community or institutional care.</p>
<p>The two bills also differ with respect to eligibility. The Waxman bill  		limits eligibility to persons whose disability initially occurred prior to age  		22, and specifically excludes persons with a primary diagnosis of mental  		illness from eligibility for community habilitation services. The Chafee bill  		extends eligibility to all persons with disabilities with an age of onset prior  		to 22, and eventually increases the age of onset limitation to age 50. Overall,  		the Chafee bill is more proscriptive in mandating Medicaid changes for persons  		with developmental disabilities, while the Waxman bill allows financing and  		system changes to occur at the option of individual States.</p>
<p>Both Congressional initiatives retain Medicaid as the primary Federal  		funding source for MR/DD services while the HHS comprehensive reform proposal  		would remove funding of MR/DD services from Medicaid. The Working Group  		comprehensive reform proposal also establishes individual State funding  		ceilings and mandates a core set of services to the most severely impaired  		population.</p>
<p><b>Advantages and Disadvantages of the Congressional  		Initiatives</b></p>
<p>Both initiatives would expand access to home and community services for  		persons with developmental disabilities. The Chafee Bill gained a great deal of  		Congressional support with 47 co-sponsors in the Senate and 198 for its  		companion bill in the House.</p>
<p>The Chafee bill is most strongly supported by those who favor continued  		reduction in the use of large institutions as residential care settings. The  		Waxman bill is more neutral with regard to the preferred size of residential  		care facilities and provides increased protections for employees of large  		institutions. At the same time, the Waxman bill mandates increased Federal  		involvement in monitoring and enforcing quality assurance standards in  		Medicaid-certified facilities which serve persons with developmental  		disabilities.</p>
<p>Estimates of the cost of these legislative initiatives vary. The  		Congressional Budget office estimates only incremental costs for the Waxman  		Bill ($31 million in the second year of implementation). According to CBO, the  		Chafee bill would result in additional Medicaid costs of $30 million in the  		first year of implementation, but lead to net Federal savings of $765 million  		over the subsequent four years of implementation due to the freeze on spending  		for large-scale facilities. Initial analyses conducted by HCFA, however,  		estimate the Chafee bill would result in additional Federal Medicaid costs of  		$700 million in the first year of implementation with new Federal Costs Of $1.3  		billion by the third year. Cost estimates of these two legislative proposals  		depend largely on assumptions about the degree to which States would move to  		expand the availability of Medicaid-financed community-based services for  		persons with developmental disabilities upon enactment of the legislation. It  		has been estimated by David Braddock, in his study of public MR/DD  		expenditures, that States now spend more than $2 billion dollars annually on  		community programs for persons with developmental disabilities. It seems  		reasonable to expect that a good proportion of these State expenditures would  		be shifted to Medicaid under either Congressional proposal.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>All of these proposals all have a common goal: to expand access to home  		and community-based services for persons with mental retardation and other  		developmental disabilities. They represent, however, different approaches to  		policy reform. The Department's Working Group developed a major proposal to  		comprehensively reform the way in which the Federal government finances  		services for persons with developmental disabilities, and a second proposal  		which identifies selected changes to the Medicaid program. Both Congressional  		initiatives would significantly expand the availability of Federally-financed  		home and community-based services for the developmentally disabled, and promote  		other reforms in the service delivery system.</p>
<p>The policy debate will continue in the 101st Congress, in the new  		Administration, and among all persons concerned with Federal policy regarding  		persons with developmental disabilities. It is the purpose of this report to  		help inform these discussions.</p>

Experimental group received community based residential and  			 vocational services from an existing human services agency. Control group  			 continued to receive residential and habilitation services in the state  			 institution. Pre-test/post-test measures were gathered on three instruments,  			 two adaptive behavior scales (Becoming Independent and Street  			 Survival Skills Questionnaire) and an intelligence test (Stanford  			 Binet).

No significant differences were found in the assessed I.Q. of experimental or  			 control group members either at pre-test or post-test. Subsequent analyses  			 showed that the differences between groups in adaptive behavior gains could not  			 be accounted for by differences between the groups at either pre-test or  			 post-test in a range of variables including I.Q., age, sex, or years  			 institutionalized prior to the study.</font></td>

Fewer of the children whose parents supported  			 home care returned to institutions after the program (4% to 37.5%). The  			 training program made home adjustment easier for parents who supported home  			 care. Those who preferred long-term institutionalization also noted the  			 progress wrought by the training program, but also admitted experiencing a  			 relief from the burden of child care. Slight gains were seen in the areas on  			 the ABS through training. Slight improvements in maladaptive behavior were seen  			 after deinstitutionalization. Reinstitutionalized children exhibited lower  			 skill levels than children who receive home care; they also showed a decline in  			 skill levels (language development and self care) upon returning to the  			 institution. Gains in toileting, dining, and social skills are negligible. Both  			 groups of children showed an increase in maladaptive behavior; the increase was  			 not statistically greater for either group.</font></td>

The Adaptive Functioning Index (AFI)  			 was used to collect adaptive behavior data in the domains of Personal Routines,  			 Community Awareness, and Social Maturity. A modified version of the ABS was  			 also used. Other information regarding age, sex, IQ, length and number of times  			 institutionalized, characteristics of residences, staff attitudes, physical  			 disabilities of residents, etc. was collected. Four regression analyses, one  			 for each of the individual domains of the AFI and for the total score were  			 done.</font></td>
</tr><tr><td scope="row"><font>Summary of Findings:</font></td>
<td><font>Clients residing in urban  			 facilities with access to effective transportation systems had better skills;  			 indicating that the nature of the community is an important factor. Individual  			 characteristics of each resident such as inappropriate aggression, etc. were  			 found to influence behavior and adaptation. The appropriateness of  			 staff-resident interactions was a strong contributory factor to social  			 maturity, and successful functioning in the community. Those placed in smaller  			 communities tended to demonstrate slightly more social maturity on the AFI than  			 residents placed in large communities. While community awareness was more a  			 function of intellectual capacity than Personal Routines, the contribution of  			 environmental normalization variables to the latter was higher. Other  			 individual factors such as age, behavioral problems, and the extent to which  			 residents were satisfied with their current residence were significantly  			 related to various aspects of adaptive functioning.</font></td>

</tr><tr><td scope="row"><font>Summary of Findings:</font></td>
<td><font>Despite the large decline  			 in institutionalizations and growth in community-based alternatives, most  			 SMR/PMR individuals continue to live in large state institutions. Community  			 residences, as a majority, tended to have a medical orientation, large size,  			 and lack of privacy. Those SMR/PMR persons who were returned to institutions  			 did so because of behavior problems. Those clients in the community generally  			 tended to have a higher average of self-help, communication, and social skills  			 and fewer medical and behavioral problems. The returnees to state institutions  			 did not differ with regard to SMR/PMR categories, only with regard to age.  			 Twice as many males returned than females. The majority of returnees had been  			 placed in nursing homes which had little or no experience with residents who  			 were mentally retarded. Two most frequently cited reasons for returning to the  			 institution were inflicting physical harm on others and destroying objects.  			 Indicates that community success for persons with severe and  			 profound retarded is largely affected by the appropriateness of the placement  			 and that nursing home placement is a significant predictor of  			 reinstitutionalization.</font></td>

Significant correlations  			 were found between all of the independent variables (age, IQ, initial adaptive  			 behavior domain scores and PASS-3 factor scores) in one set and 3 measures of  			 improvement in adaptive behavior in the other set. One the Personal  			 Self-Sufficiency factor, age level of retardation, and the initial score in  			 this domain were highly related to average annual gain on this domain.  			 Residents with higher IQs shoed more positive change than residents with lower  			 IQs regardless of age. Age was not related to positive change in Domain 2:  			 Community Self-Sufficiency was independent of IQ. Age, IQ, and initial score,  			 however, were all significantly related to improvement on Personal-Social  			 Responsibility; with older, less retarded residents and those with lower  			 initial scores demonstrating most improvement.</font></td>
