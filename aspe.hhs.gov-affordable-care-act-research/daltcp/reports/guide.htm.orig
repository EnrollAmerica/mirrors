<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The "activities of daily living" or ADLs are the basic tasks of everyday  		life, such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting and transferring (i.e.,  		getting in and out of a bed or chair). Although persons of all ages may have  		problems performing the ADLs, disability prevalence rates are much higher for  		the elderly than for the nonelderly. Within the elderly population, disability  		rates rise steeply with advancing age and are especially high for persons aged  		85 and over.</p>
<p>To the casual observer, estimates of the size of the elderly population  		with activity of daily living disabilities differ substantially across national  		surveys. There are a number of reasons for this variation, but differences in  		which ADL items are being measured and in what constitutes a disability account  		for much of the variation. Other likely explanations are differences in sample  		design, sample size, survey methodology and age structure of the population at  		the time the surveys were conducted.</p>
<p>When an effort is made to standardize ADL items for comparison,  		estimates for the community-based population vary by no more than 3.1  		percentage points and for the institutionalized population, with the exception  		of toileting, by no more than 3.2 percentage points. As small as these  		differences are in absolute terms, they can be large in percent differences  		across surveys. For example, the National Medical Expenditure Survey estimates  		that there are 60 percent more elderly with ADL problems than does the  		Supplement on Aging.</p>
<p>The main conclusion is that ADL estimates will differ for good reasons  		and that there is no one "right" estimate. Researchers and policy analysts  		alike need to be aware that ADL disability rates are simply much "softer"  		measures than, say, mortality rates. From wording decisions made by persons who  		design the survey questionnaire, to the analysts who choose a particular ADL  		question or set of questions to analyze and report, to the programmers who must  		actually handle multiple question recodes and deal with missing and  		inconsistent data, each step will influence the final results. Thus, even an  		extremely large sample could not provide a definitive estimate.</p>
<p>What should policymakers and others make of these differences across  		surveys? Cost estimates for home care programs or insurance benefits based on  		one set of ADL prevalences will be substantially different from cost estimates  		based on a different set of ADL prevalences. This inconsistency will clearly be  		unsettling to those who must pay the bills. From a research perspective,  		however, the estimates are remarkably alike. If the policy interest was on the  		nondisabled, nobody would give the inconsistency of the estimates a second  		thought. The fact is that, even among the elderly, ADL limitations are  		relatively rare and some variation in the estimates is inevitable.</p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The "activities of daily living" or ADLs are.the basic tasks of everyday  		life, such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, and transferring (i.e.,  		getting in and out of a bed or chair). When people are unable to perform these  		activities, they need help in order to cope, either from other human beings or  		mechanical devices or both. Problems performing the activities of daily living  		cut across diagnoses, but are especially prevalent among persons with  		arthritis, osteoporosis and stroke. Although persons of all ages may have  		problems performing the ADLs, prevalence rates are much higher for the elderly  		than for the nonelderly.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> Within the elderly population, disability  		rates rise steeply with advancing age and are especially high for persons aged  		85 and over.</p>
<p>Measurement of the activities of daily living is critical because the  		have been found to be significant predictors of admission to a nursing  		home,<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> use of home  		care,<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup> use of hospital  		services,<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> living  		arrangements,<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup> overall  		Medicare expenditures,<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup>  		insurance coverage,<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup> and  		mortality.<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup> For research  		on the elderly, the ability to perform the ADLs has become a standard variable  		to include in analyses, like age, sex, marital status and income.</p>
<p>Estimates of the number and characteristics of people with problems  		performing ADLs are also important because of the increasing number of private  		long-term care insurance policies and proposed public long-term care insurance  		programs that rely on ADL dependency measures to determine whether an  		individual qualifies for benefits. For example, private insurance policies sold  		by John Hancock, Aetna, Travelers, Metropolitan Life and CNA rely on ADL  		measures as triggers for benefits.<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup> All of the developed public insurance plans,  		including those proposed by Senators Mitchell and Kennedy and by  		Representatives Waxman, Stark and Pepper, do the same. Obviously, the amount of  		long-term care benefits paid out by such private and public plans will largely  		depend on the number of persons who meet the various ADL eligibility  		criteria.</p>
<p>Since 1982, a number of national surveys have been conducted which  		measure the ability of the elderly to perform the activities of daily living. A  		legitimate question is whether these diverse surveys produce consistent  		estimates. A cursory glance at some recent studies suggest that this is not the  		case. For example, one analysis using the 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey  		reported that there were 3.0 million elderly with impairments in one or more  		ADLs; while another study using the 1984 Supplement on Aging found 6.0 million  		impaired elderly; and, yet another study using the 1984 Survey of Income and  		Program Participation identified only 1.5 million elderly with "personal care  		needs," a concept roughly comparable to requiring help with the ADLs.<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup> The very wide differences in  		the cost estimates for Rep. Claude Pepper's long-term home care bill, H.R.  		3436, between the U.S. Congressional Budget Office and the U.S. Department of  		Health and Human Services served to focus attention on the consistency of the  		estimates.</p>
<p>In May 1988, the Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics decided  		to systematically examine the surveys measuring ADLs and to try to discover the  		reasons for the varying estimates. A Committee on Definitions of Functional  		Limitations, including government and nongovernment experts familiar with the  		different surveys, was formed to study the issue. This paper is the report of  		that Committee. The report focuses on the activities of daily living and does  		not address potential differences across surveys in the estimated number of  		persons with problems performing the "instrumental activities of daily living"  		or the number of cognitively impaired elderly. The goal of this paper is to  		provide a guide to policymakers and researchers on the national surveys that  		measure ADLs and on the issues that must be addressed in using data from these  		surveys.</p>
<p>The remainder of this report has four sections. The <a href="#sectionI">first section</a> defines the activities of daily living in  		greater detail and reviews the history of the concept. The <a href="#sectionII">next section</a> provides an overview of eleven recent  		national surveys that measure activities of daily living. The  		<a href="#sectionIII">third section</a> discusses some potential sources of  		differences among surveys. The <a href="#sectionIV">final section</a> presents  		the conclusions of the analysis.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionI" id="sectionI">I. ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING: DEFINITION AND  		HISTORY</a></h2>
<p>General measures of health status such as diagnoses or medical  		conditions are limited indicators of the independence and functional  		capabilities of an individual. For example, diagnoses have been found to be a  		poor predictor of use of long-term care services.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup> Therefore, disability researchers have  		devoted considerable attention to developing measures that tap practical  		dimensions of everyday life as a way of measuring a person's physical  		functioning. The activities of daily living are increasingly being used as the  		way to measure disability.</p>
<p>The term "activities of daily living" refers to a set of common,  		everyday tasks, performance of which is required for personal self-care and  		independent living. The most often used measure of functional ability is the  		Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup> In this scale, the set of tasks assessed are  		bathing, dressing, transferring, using the toilet, continence and eating.</p>
<p>Over the years, a number of other measures of physical dysfunction have  		been introduced which cover tasks similar to the Katz ADL Scale. Most of these  		other measures of activities of daily living include some measure of mobility,  		such as walking, getting around inside, and getting around outside. One newer  		measure, the Barthel scale, also subdivides the eating activity into two  		different tasks and transferring into four different activities. Another  		measure is the PULSES scale which focuses less on the specific task and more on  		the physical characteristics that make task completion difficult, thereby  		indicating which areas of the body require rehabilitation. Appropriately, the  		PULSES acronym refers to Physical condition, Upper limbs (self-care), Lower  		limbs (ambulation), Sensory abilities, Excretory, mental and emotional  		Status.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Measures of the ability to perform the ADLs have become routine in  		surveys of the elderly, partly displacing the National Health Interview Survey  		disability classification of being "unable to perform your major (or usual)  		activity."<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup> ADLs are  		more specific and concrete than an inability to perform a "major activity,"  		thus minimizing situational or contextual differences among survey respondents.  		For example, the physical requirements of the major or usual activity of a  		construction worker are very different than those of an accountant. Moreover,  		because ADLs have been defined as having at least five or more elements, they  		can provide more highly differentiated levels of disability. In addition, ADLs  		can be used to provide general information on the basic service needs of the  		disabled. A person unable to feed himself needs help eating; it is not clear  		what, if any, services a person needs who is "unable to perform his major  		activity." Finally, as mentioned earlier, ADL status is a good predictor of a  		wide range of health-related behavior.</p>
<p>As useful as they are, ADLs do not measure the full range of activities  		necessary for independent living in the community. To partly fill this gap in  		disability classification, the "instrumental activities of daily living" or  		IADLs were developed.<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup>  		The IADLs capture a range of activities that are more complex than those needed  		for personal self-care, including handling personal finances, meal preparation,  		shopping, travelling, doing housework, using the telephone, and taking  		medications.<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup> Recent  		research suggests that there is a hierarchical relationship between some IADL  		items and ADL items, with IADL disabilities representing less severe  		dysfunctional.<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Because they seek to measure certain activities which are not  		universally performed by all individuals, IADLs have certain limitations.  		First, IADLs are difficult to use in institutional settings, where many  		activities, such as meal preparation and housework, are routinely performed by  		others. Second, some IADLs tend to emphasize tasks traditionally done by one  		sex or another. For example, an elderly male's inability to cook may reflect  		the fact that his wife always performs that task for him. Thus, his inability  		to prepare meals is not related to any physical or mental disability.</p>
<p>Another domain, related to ADLs and IADLs, is cognitive ability. Persons  		with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias are prime examples of  		individuals with cognitive impairment. Measures of cognitive impairment are  		much less well developed than are ADL measures. One cognitive assessment scale  		that has been included in a number of national surveys is the Short Portable  		Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). The SPMSQ assesses mental functioning  		based on a ten-item test of orientation, recent memory, long-term memory, and  		capacity for serial calculation.<sup><font><a href="#note18">18</a></font></sup> Some example questions are: "What is the  		date today?", "When were you born?", and "Who is the President of the United  		States?".</p>
<p>Cognitive impairment and ADL status are correlated but are separate  		dimensions of functioning.<sup><font><a href="#note19">19</a></font></sup> Not all persons with substantial cognitive  		impairment have ADL dysfunctions. One recent study found nearly 40 percent of  		the elderly with moderate to severe cognitive impairment, as measured by the  		SPMSQ, received no active human assistance with any of five ADLs.<sup><font><a href="#note20">20</a></font></sup> As a result, studies estimating  		the extent of need for long-term care services that rely solely on ADL measures  		will miss a substantial proportion of the target population.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionII" id="sectionII">II. NATIONAL DATA BASES MEASURING ADLS</a></h2>
<p>In recent years, a number of national surveys, designed for a variety of  		purposes, have collected information on the ADL status of the elderly.  		<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> lists eleven of these surveys, the population  		each seeks to describe, the sample design, how disability was defined and which  		ADLs were asked about. Appendix I describes the eleven surveys in considerable  		detail.</p>
<h3>A. 1982 National Long-Term Care Survey</h3>
<p>The 1982 National Long-Term Care Survey (1982 NLTCS) is a  		nationally-representative survey of noninstitutionalized Medicare beneficiaries  		aged 65 and over with functional limitations. The survey was designed to  		provide data on the number and type of physical limitations affecting the  		elderly, the kind, amount and costs of services they receive, and their ability  		to pay for that care. The sample frame was 36,000 Medicare enrollees screened  		by phone or in-person for an ADL or health-related IADL problem that had or  		would endure for three months or longer. The screen netted a final sample of  		6,393 disabled elderly who received detailed personal interviews. Elderly  		residing in hospitals, nursing homes or other institutions were excluded. This  		survey was sponsored by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Planning and  		Evaluation/U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Health Care  		Financing Administration.</p>
<h3>B. 1982 New Beneficiary Survey</h3>
<p>The 1982 New Beneficiary Survey (NBS) is a nationally representative  		household survey of <b>new</b> Social Security beneficiaries. The survey  		provides detailed information on new Social Security participants to address  		program operation research needs. Personal interviews were conducted with  		18,599 persons who had begun receiving benefits between mid-1980 and mid-1981  		as retired workers, disabled workers aged 18 and older, or auxiliary benefits  		for wives and aged widows, and workers aged 65 and older who lost benefits  		because of the earnings test. Responses were later linked to Social Security  		administrative data on benefits and earnings, and to data from the Medicare  		Automated Data Retrieval System. The survey was sponsored by the Social  		Security Administration.</p>
<h3>C. 1982-84 NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study</h3>
<p>The 1982-84 NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study (NHEFS) is a  		longitudinal study of those persons aged 25-74 at baseline who participated in  		the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (NHANES I) which was  		conducted between 1971-75. The Followup was designed to investigate the  		relationship between risk factors measured at baseline and subsequent morbidity  		and mortality. Approximately 5,700 NHANES I participants were aged 55 and older  		at baseline; 5,500 of whom were successfully traced. Of these, 3,500 were alive  		at followup and had reached the aged of 65 years. An extensive battery of  		questions were designed to characterize general functional ability. In  		addition, particular functional limitations can be related to reported  		symptoms, diagnosed conditions and hospital utilization. Two additional waves  		of followup have been conducted--one in 1986 and the second in 1987. This  		survey was sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics and other  		agencies of the Public Health Service.</p>
<h3>D. 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey</h3>
<p>The 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey (1984 NLTCS) is primarily a  		followup survey of the sample of 36,000 elderly Medicare beneficiaries  		initially screened for the 1982 NLTCS. In addition, approximately 5,000 persons  		who turned aged 65 after 1982 were added to the 1984 sample screened for  		impairments, and those reporting a disability were then given a detailed  		interview. This provided a representative cross-section of the population aged  		65 and older with functional limitations for 1984. The 1984 NLTCS provides data  		on elderly with a chronic impairment in 1982, elderly in institutions in 1982  		and elderly screened in 1982 but not reporting a chronic limitation. The 1984  		NLTCS contained an institutional and decedent component as well. This survey  		was sponsored by the Health Care Financing Administration and the National  		Center for Health Services Research.</p>
<h3>E. 1984 National Health Interview Survey, Supplement on  		Aging</h3>
<p>The 1984 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), Supplement on Aging  		(SOA) is an in-person, household survey of 16,148 persons aged 55 and older.  		Designed to provide national estimates on middle-aged and older  		noninsitutionalized persons, the SOA collected information on various  		health-related topics such as family structure, disability and health service  		use. About 11,500 interviews were obtained for persons aged 65 and over. This  		survey was sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>
<h3>F. 1984-86 Longitudinal Study of Aging</h3>
<p>The 1984-1986 Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA) is a prospective survey  		of 5,151 persons aged 70 and older who were initially interviewed in the 1984  		SOA. The LSOA was designed to measure change in functional status, living  		arrangements, and health service use. Data were collected primarily by  		telephone and mail-outs. This survey was sponsored by the National Center for  		Health Statistics and the National Institute on Aging.</p>
<h3>G. 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation</h3>
<p>The 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is designed  		to collect data on changes in income and participation in federal programs such  		as Social Security, Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid. SIPP is a  		longitudinal survey of about 26,000 housing units representing the  		noninstitutional population. Each household in the initial sample was  		interviewed at four-month intervals over a period of two and one-half years  		beginning in October 1983. The third wave supplement to the 1984 panel of SIPP  		contained a set of questions on disability status. Approximately 20,900  		households were interviewed and about 5,900 respondents were aged 65 and older.  		This survey was sponsored by the Bureau of the Census.</p>
<h3>H. 1985 National Nursing Home Survey</h3>
<p>The 1985 National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS) provides information on  		current residents and discharges from nursing homes. The Current Resident  		Component is a nationally-representative sample of nursing home residents  		collected from 1,079 nursing and related care homes. Through interviews with  		nursing staff, information was collected on a sample of residents on the  		nursing home's roster the night before the survey. There are 4,650 elderly in  		this sample. The Discharges Component of NNHS contains a sample of 5,329  		elderly nursing home discharges over a 12-month period. This survey was  		sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>
<h3>I. 1986 National Mortality Followback Survey</h3>
<p>The 1986 National Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS) provides  		nationally-representative estimates of all decedents in 1986 aged 25 and older.  		Data was collected by mail-out, telephone and personal interviews with  		next-of-kin for 18,500 persons who died in that year; 10,154 decedents were  		aged 65 and older. The National Mortality Followback Survey was designed to  		provide data on socioeconomic differentials in mortality, the association  		between risk factors and mortality, care in the last year of life and the  		reliability of certain death certificate data. This survey was sponsored by the  		National Center for Health Statistics.</p>
<h3>J. 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey</h3>
<p>The 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) provides  		nationally-representative data on health services use and expenditures among  		both noninstitutionalized and institutionalized individuals. The NMES Household  		Component consists of a longitudinal sample of 14,000 households. About 5,750  		sample members were aged 65 and older. Data were collected at four points in  		time in 1987 using an in-person interview with each household member or, when  		unavailable, a proxy. The NMES Institutional Component is a longitudinal survey  		of 2,800 current residents and 2,800 new admissions from 815 nursing homes and  		personal care facilities. About 2,550 current residents were aged 65 and over.  		Data were collected over one year by personal interviews with nursing staff for  		the Baseline Questionnaire and from a primary informal caregiver for the  		Personal History Questionnaire. This survey was sponsored by the National  		Center for Health Services Research.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionIII" id="sectionIII">III. COMPARING ESTIMATES FROM DIFFERENT  		SURVEYS</a></h2>
<p>Public policymakers and insurance actuaries typically want to know the  		answer to what seem to be simple questions: How many persons aged 65 and older  		have ADL problems? How many have ADL problems by each type of activity? How  		many elderly have more than a threshold number of ADL problems? Unfortunately,  		researchers designing and analyzing surveys quickly find that answering those  		questions are complicated tasks requiring decisions for which there is not an  		obvious choice.<sup><font><a href="#note21">21</a></font></sup>  		Differences in lists of ADLs, what constitutes an ADL problem or limitation,  		and varying technical survey techniques accounts for many, but not all, of the  		differences in ADL estimates across surveys.</p>
<h3>A. Which ADLs Are Included?</h3>
<p>Not all surveys or analysts use the same list of ADLs. Most surveys  		include eating, toileting, transferring, dressing, and bathing. However,  		because of considerations of time and respondent burden, sometimes not all of  		these are asked about or may not be asked about separately. For example, the  		1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation asks one combined question  		about "dressing, eating and personal hygiene." Other surveys and analysts may  		or may not include as ADLs such additional activities as walking, getting  		around inside, getting around outside and controlling bowels or urine.</p>
<p>Which and how many activities are included can make a big difference in  		the number of people counted as having disabilities, especially if the analyst  		is "counting" the number of ADL problems. Obviously, the more ADLs that are  		included, the larger will be the number of people with ADL disabilities. For  		example, one study using the 1984 Supplement on Aging found that there were 3.7  		million elderly with limitations in one of the five ADLs but 6.0 million  		elderly with limitations in one of seven ADLs.<sup><font><a href="#note22">22</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Recently, a number of legislative proposals have surfaced that focus on  		five ADLs--eating, toileting, transferring, dressing, and bathing.<sup><font><a href="#note23">23</a></font></sup> These are the ADL items which  		have been proposed for use in determining eligibility for benefits in several  		proposed public insurance programs. Private insurance plans are more varied in  		which ADLs they use to determine eligibility for benefits.<sup><font><a href="#note24">24</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>B. How Are ADLs Measured?</h3>
<p>Although there is some consensus across surveys as to which activities  		of daily living should be included, there is a great deal of variation in the  		way surveys ask about ADL functioning. The surveys differ in measuring what  		type of assistance was received, the degree of difficulty in performing each  		ADL, and the duration of the disability. Differences in question wording can  		also produce subtle variation. Even within a single survey, the inclusion of  		multiple questions for a given ADL item can produce different estimates  		depending on which questions are chosen to measure a limitation. Some of the  		important variations in the type of information collected on ADL items by each  		survey are summarized on <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>.</p>
<p>A critical definitional issue concerns whether to count as disabled only  		persons "receiving active human assistance" or whether to include persons who  		rely on "special equipment or mechanical aids" and persons requiring only  		"supervision or stand-by assistance." Mechanical assistance can include such  		devices as grab bars on special beds to facilitate transferring. Arguably, some  		people would need human assistance if the special equipment were not available.  		Stand-by assistance is often needed by persons with cognitive impairment whose  		motor abilities may actually be quite good, but who are not always sure what  		they are supposed to do.</p>
<p>Whether or not to limit ADL dependencies to persons receiving active  		human assistance can have a major impact on the estimates. One study using the  		1982 National Long-Term Care Survey found that if only people receiving active  		human assistance were classified as having a disability, there were 1.0 million  		people with problems performing two of five ADLs; when a more inclusive  		definition was used, 1.7 million people were identified with two of five  		ADLs.<sup><font><a href="#note25">25</a></font></sup> Another study  		using the 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey found that among the 1.7 million  		elderly with a bathing limitation who were not using mechanical help, 60  		percent had active human help, 27 percent required only stand-by help, another  		11 percent reportedly did not bathe, and 3 percent reported an unmet need for  		bathing help.<sup><font><a href="#note26">26</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Some surveys, such as the 1984 Supplement on Aging and the 1986  		Longitudinal Study of Aging, asked each respondent to classify his or her ADL  		limitation by the level of difficulty in performing them--some, a lot, unable.  		For example, among the estimated 2.0 million persons aged 70 and older who  		reported a bathing difficulty in the 1984 Longitudinal Study of Aging, 40  		percent had "some" difficulty, 22 percent had at least "a lot" of difficulty,  		and 38 percent were "unable" to bathe.<sup><font><a href="#note27">27</a></font></sup> Other surveys do not ask for such  		gradations. Where level of difficulty measures exist on the survey, the analyst  		has the option of only considering the respondent to be disabled if she has "a  		lot" of difficulty or is "unable" to perform the activity.</p>
<p>A third definitional issue relates to the duration of the disability.  		When screening persons for inclusion in the detailed surveys, the 1982 and 1984  		National Long-Term Care Surveys asked whether respondents had at least one ADL  		or health-related IADL problem "which had lasted, or was expected to last, 90  		days or longer." In contrast, most other surveys asked about disability on the  		day of the survey. Thus, compared to the 1982 and 1984 National Long-Term Care  		Survey, other surveys may include more short-term disability. A recent study  		using the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey, for example, found the  		number of elderly with a bathing limitation that had lasted over 90 days was  		10.4 percent lower than the same estimate for the day of the survey.<sup><font><a href="#note28">28</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Differences in each survey's wording of ADL questions may also introduce  		subtle variation in survey response. To illustrate, compare the wording of the  		initial question on bathing limitations from three of the surveys:</p>
<p>The 1987 NMES:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Because of a mental or physical health problem, do you (or anyone in  		  the family) have any difficulty bathing or showering without  		  help?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1984 NLTCS:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Since last (insert day one week ago), did any person help (sample  		  person) bathe, or was (sample person) unable to bathe at all?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1984 SOA:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Because of a health or physical problem, do you have any difficulty  		  bathing or showering?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the three, note that only the National Long-Term Care Survey omits  		"showering" from the question and gives the respondent a one week reference  		period. Another difference is the mention of a "physical health problem" in the  		Supplement on Aging and the National Medical Expenditure Survey questions which  		is not found in the National Long-Term Care Survey. Moreover, only National  		Medical Expenditure Survey mentions "mental health" as a potential source for a  		bathing problem. Finally, both National Medical Expenditure Survey and the  		National Long-Term Care Survey start off the bathing questions by asking about  		"help". The Supplement on Aging asks about bathing "help" in a completely  		separate question. To the extent that questions vary, so will the  		responses.</p>
<p>Differences in how questions are asked and who is counted as being  		disabled are often the result of answering different rtsearch questions. For  		example, an epidemiologist studying the relationship between a disease and its  		symptoms may be most interested in whether there is any physical problem and  		the exact nature of that dysfunction (e.g., does the bathing problem reflect  		difficulty controlling the faucet or does it reflect getting in and out of the  		tub?) The epidemiologist may be less interested in knowing whether a person  		receives human assistance in performing their ADLs. In contrast, an actuary  		estimating the potential demand for a new home care insurance benefit is  		probably less interested in the underlying biological problems than in whether  		the person could, for example, bathe independently with grab bars or whether he  		or she needs human help.</p>
<p>Some surveys ask about different aspects of the same ADL problem. The  		detailed 1982 and 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey interviews asked about  		eight or nine separate questions about each activity. For example, some of the  		eight separate, consecutively asked questions designed to get at different  		aspects of eating limitations were: "Did you use special utensils or special  		dishes to help you eat?"; "Did someone usually stand by just in case you needed  		help?"; "Did someone feed you?"; and, "Did someone help you cut your meat or  		butter your bread?" The additional detail afforded by asking about specific  		aspects of a person's eating limitation may generate divergent estimates simply  		because the analyst chooses to analyze one rather than another question from  		the same survey.</p>
<p>Further complicating matters, the National Long-Term Care Surveys had a  		section referred to as the "control card" in 1982 and the "flap" in 1984, which  		required the interviewer to recap whether the respondent had reported a  		particular ADL limitation. Some analysts choose to report estimates based on  		this constructed measure rather than on the detailed questions.<sup><font><a href="#note29">29</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>C. What Effect Do Year of Survey, Sample Frame, and  		Survey Techniques Have on ADL Estimates?</h3>
<p>Differences in ADL estimates may also derive from a combination of  		technical factors, although the effect of these factors is not clear in terms  		of direction and magnitude. These differences include the year the survey was  		conducted, sample frame, use of proxy respondents, and survey instrument  		design.</p>
<p>One clear difference among surveys is in the year the interviews were  		conducted. Given the strong association between age and ADL status, a change in  		the age composition of the elderly population could result in different  		prevalence estimates.<sup><font><a href="#note30">30</a></font></sup>  		For example, between 1982 and 1987, the number of elderly aged 65-74 increased  		only 9.1 percent, while the number aged 75-84 increased 13.7 percent and the  		number aged 85 and older grew by 17.3 percent.<sup><font><a href="#note31">31</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Another possible explanation for varying estimates involves differences  		in sampling frame. To estimate elderly ADL status in the community, the 1982  		and 1984 National Long-Term Care Surveys sampled individuals, not households,  		and only Medicare-enrolled individuals--a very close approximation but still an  		incomplete set of all U.S. elderly. Estimates from the 1984 Supplement on  		Aging, the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation and the 1987  		National Medical Expenditure Survey were based on a subsampling of all  		household members aged 65 and over from a representative sample of all U.S.  		households. Similarly, for the institutionalized population, the 1985 National  		Nursing Home Survey used a sampling frame of 20,479 nursing and related care  		facilities contained in the National Master Facility Inventory.<sup><font><a href="#note32">32</a></font></sup> On the other hand, the 1987  		National Medical Expenditure Survey used a much larger sampling frame called  		the Inventory of Long-Term Care Places which contained 38,930 facilities and  		included board and care facilities that are excluded from the National Master  		Facility Inventory.</p>
<p>Still another source of variation among surveys was the way in which  		data were collected. The 1982 National Long-Term Care Survey relied primarily  		on face-to-face interviews with disabled beneficiaries, except in 24 percent of  		the cases where the interview was conducted with a proxy respondent. A proxy  		was used when a sample person was absent, physically or mentally unable to  		participate, did not speak English, or had speech or hearing  		problems.<sup><font><a href="#note33">33</a></font></sup> The 1984  		Supplement on Aging also obtained face-to-face information from elderly sample  		persons, with close to 30 percent of disabled respondent data coming from  		proxies.<sup><font><a href="#note34">34</a></font></sup> In many  		cases, the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation and the 1987  		National Medical Expenditure Survey interviewed only one person in each  		household who was asked about all other household members. Proxy respondents  		may answer questions differently than the sample person would if asked  		in-person. Even more fundamentally, none of the surveys actually asked  		respondents to perform the indicated ADLs. Preliminary research being conducted  		at the National Institute on Aging and the National Center for Health  		Statistics suggest that there may be discrepancies between survey responses and  		actual physical capabilities.<sup><font><a href="#note35">35</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Yet another potential explanation of divergence in ADL estimates is that  		similar ADL information may be collected at more than one time in the same  		survey. For example, the 1982 National Long-Term Care Survey screened about  		36,000 elderly Medicare beneficiaries to develop the sample used to collect  		detailed information from 6,393 disabled elderly. When interviewers came to  		conduct the detailed survey, nearly 9 percent reported that they were no longer  		disabled.<sup><font><a href="#note36">36</a></font></sup> This  		two-step process resulted in two separate sets of ADL prevalence estimates from  		the 1982 National Long-Term Care Survey--one from the screen interview, and one  		from the detailed survey.<sup><font><a href="#note37">37</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>D. What Happens to the Estimates When Standardized for  		List of ADLS and Definition of Having a Problem?</h3>
<p>Given the apparent variability of estimates based upon differences in  		lists of ADLs and in definitions, the only meaningful way to compare ADL  		estimates across surveys is to control for these differences. The Committee on  		Definitions of Functional Limitations collected a closely-specified set of ADL  		data on the elderly population from each survey. Weighted and unweighted data  		were developed for all persons aged 65 and older, with separate estimates for  		persons receiving help with bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting, and  		eating, along with an overall estimate of the elderly receiving help at least  		one of these activities. The data were not, however, age-adjusted.</p>
<p>Comparable estimates of the prevalence of functional limitations for the  		elderly were assembled for eight of the eleven national surveys identified as  		collecting information on ADLs.<sup><font><a href="#note38">38</a></font></sup> Estimates for the five comparable surveys  		covering the noninsitutionalized elderly are shown in <a href="#table1">Table  		1</a>.</p>
<p>Standardizing reduces but does not eliminate the differences across  		surveys. The estimates show that the proportion of all elderly in the community  		receiving help with at least one ADL limitation ranges from a low of 5.0  		percent in the 1984 Supplement on Aging to 8.1 percent in the 1987 National  		Medical Expenditure Survey Household Survey--a difference of about 750,000 to  		850,000 elderly depending on the year of the survey. For each ADL item asked,  		the 1984 Supplement on Aging consistently produced the lowest estimate of  		elderly functional limitations. No one survey was consistently high over the  		range of ADLs. Taken together, the five surveys suggest that between 4.6 and  		6.9 percent of the noninstitutionalized persons aged 65 and older require  		personal help bathing, between 2.9 and 4.4 percent need similar help dressing,  		between 2.6 and 4.2 percent need help transferring, between 2.4 to 3.4 percent  		need help with toileting, and between 0.7 to 2.5 percent need help eating.</p>
<p><a href="#table2">Table 2</a> adds the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup  		Study to the list and focuses the comparison on the noninstitutionalized  		elderly aged 65-74. The pattern of results is very similar to <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. The main difference is that the percentage point  		spread between the highest and lowest estimates for each ADL narrows,  		reflecting the overall lower prevalence rate for this age group. In addition,  		the 1984 Supplement on Aging no longer consistently produces the lowest  		estimates.</p>
<p>Two of the eleven surveys can be used to compare functional limitations  		among the institutionalized elderly population. <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>  		presents these estimates for the resident population. The National Nursing Home  		Survey and the National Medical Expenditure Survey Institutional Component  		surveys found just over 91 percent of the institutionalized elderly received  		help with at least one of the five ADLS and both found just over 90 percent of  		residents received help with bathing. Estimates for dressing, transferring and  		eating were slightly higher for the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey  		than for the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey. The largest difference between  		the two surveys of the institutionalized elderly was for toileting which ranged  		from 51 percent in the National Nursing Home Survey to 67 percent in the  		National Medical Expenditure Survey. However, since only about 5 percent of the  		elderly are institutionalized on a given day, the absolute difference of this  		discrepancy is only about 200,000 elderly.</p>
<p>Because the estimates obtained from each of these surveys are based on a  		sample, the data for any survey will differ somewhat from what would be  		obtained if a complete census were taken. Variations which could occur by  		chance because only a sample of the population is surveyed are measured by the  		relative standard error of the estimate. Sample size and the number of  		observations of a particular trait greatly affect the size of the standard  		error. When sample size is increased, the standard error declines. As shown on  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, there is great variability across surveys in the  		number of actual observations for each ADL. At the extreme, for eating  		disabilities, the range in the actual number of cases varies from 650 for the  		1984 National Long-Term Care Survey to 76 for the Supplement on Aging.</p>
<p>If the confidence interval of the ADL limitations resulted in  		overlapping estimates between these surveys, then chance variation could  		account for the observed differences. To illustrate the potential range in  		estimates, we calculated confidence intervals for the number of elderly  		receiving help with one or more ADLs and for those receiving help eating, which  		is the least frequent ADL problem. <a href="#table4">Table 4</a> presents the  		68 percent, 95 percent, and 99 percent confidence ranges for the 1984  		Supplement on Aging, the 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey and the 1987  		National Medical Expenditure Survey. For example, the 1984 Supplement on Aging  		estimate of 183,000 persons aged 65 and older requiring help to eat has a  		relative standard error of 13 percent.<sup><font><a href="#note39">39</a></font></sup> The 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey  		estimate of 618,000 elderly having a comparable eating limitation has a  		relative standard error of 4 percent.<sup><font><a href="#note40">40</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Calculating these confidence intervals also reduces but does not  		eliminate differences across surveys. The estimates for eating disabilities  		between the 1984 Supplement on Aging and the 1984 National Long-Term Care  		Survey are still 314,000 apart even at the upper and lower ranges of the 99  		percent confidence interval. Sampling variability among estimates of elderly  		receiving help with one or more ADLs shows substantial overlap between the 1984  		National Long-Term Care Survey and the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey  		beginning at the 95 percent confidence interval. However, like estimates for  		eating limitations, the 1984 Supplement on Aging estimate is still over 500,000  		lower than either of the other two surveys even at the high and low end of the  		99 percent confidence interval.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionIV" id="sectionIV">IV. CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p>To the casual observer, estimates of the prevalence of activity of daily  		living disabilities for the elderly population differ substantially across  		national surveys. Sources of the variation in national survey-based estimates  		of the elderly with ADL problems includes potential differences in:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Which ADLs are included (especially when counting the number of  			 ADLs).</p>
</li>
<li>How ADLs are classified by:
<ul><li>level of difficulty;</li>
<li>type of assistance;</li>
<li> duration of problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Exact wording of questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Age composition of the elderly population in the survey  			 year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sample frame used to select respondents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Methods used to collect data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That similar ADL information may be contained in more than one place  			 in the same survey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That multiple questions are often asked on each ADL item in a single  			 survey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chance sampling variability.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>When an effort is made to standardize ADL items for comparison,  		estimates for the community-based population vary by no more than 3.1  		percentage points for the noninstitutionalized population; and for the  		institutionalized population, with the exception of toileting, by no more than  		3.2 percentage points. As small as these differences are in absolute terms,  		they can be large in percent differences across surveys. For example, the  		National Medical Expenditure Survey estimates that there are 60 percent more  		elderly receiving help with ADL problems than does the Supplement on Aging.</p>
<p>Our main conclusion is that there is no one "right" estimate of ADL  		prevalences. Researchers and policy analysts alike need to be aware that ADL  		disability rates are simply much "softer" measures than, say, mortality rates.  		From wording decisions made by persons who design the survey questionnaire, to  		the analysts who choose a particular ADL question or set of questions to  		analyze and report, to the programmers who must actually handle multiple  		question recodes and deal with missing or inconsistent data, each step will  		affect the results. Given a lack of consensus on exactly how to measure ADLs,  		even an extremely large sample could not provide a definitive estimate.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these differences, the estimates are remarkably alike.  		This is especially true if we focus on the percentage of persons without an ADL  		limitation. At one extreme, the Supplement on Aging estimates that 95 elderly  		out of 100 do not receive help with any of five ADLs. At the other extreme, the  		National Medical Expenditure Survey puts the number of comparably nondisabled  		elderly at 92 persons out of a 100. If the policy interest was on the  		nondisabled, no one would give these differences in estimates a second thought.  		Indeed, most observers would be commenting on the consistency of the estimates  		across surveys. The fact is that, even among the elderly, ADL limitations are  		relatively rare and some variation in the estimates is inevitable.</p>
<p>Moreover, it should be remembered that conducting survey research is  		different than running a public or private program that pays for long-term care  		services. Actual participation rates for benefits which use ADL status as an  		eligibility trigger may be quite different than what is estimated by a survey.  		Even aside from the technical design and analysis issues, the incentives for  		the respondent are very different when applying for Medicare or insurance  		benefits than they are when answering a research survey. Policy analysts and  		actuaries will need to make their cost estimates consistent with how tightly  		the program will be administered, how they believe the elderly will respond to  		the availability of financing, and how important it is that costs not be under-  		or overestimated.</p>
<p>In sum, much of the variation in ADL estimates across national surveys  		can be explained by legitimate differences in survey and analytic  		methodologies. Once this is done, estimates for the noninstitutionalized and  		institutionalized elderly population are consistent within a few percentage  		points. However, since there is no one "right" methodology, estimates can  		legitimately vary a great deal in percentage terms, especially for relatively  		rare ADL problems such as eating. Thus, in choosing which survey to examine and  		which survey items to use, policy analysts and researchers will need to think  		carefully about what questions they are trying to answer. In addition, to avoid  		confusion, in reporting their results, they need to specify in greater detail  		than they might otherwise how they defined ADL disabilities and which data  		elements they used.</p>

For example, to assist  			 with this report, both the Center for Demographic Studies at Duke University  			 and the National Center for Health Services Research furnished the Committee  			 with estimates obtained from the 1982 and 1984 National Long-Term Care Surveys  			 on the number of elderly receiving help with bathing, dressing, transferring,  			 toileting, eating, and with any one of these activities. Even though the two  			 sets of results were close, no pair matched exactly. The average difference for  			 a given ADL was about 55,000 elderly (range 1,000 - 103,000), but neither  			 source was consistently high or low. The reasons for the different estimates  			 involve dissimilar handling of missing data, minor differences in programming  			 the questionnaire skip patterns, and varying definitions of "receives help  			 with" based upon whether the helper provide "active" or "stand-by" assistance.
