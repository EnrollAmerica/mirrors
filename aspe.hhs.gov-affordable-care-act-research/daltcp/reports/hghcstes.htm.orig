<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This paper summarizes the findings and policy implications from four  		research reports about the health care experiences of severely disabled and  		high cost children, especially their participation in Medicaid. This research  		was sponsored by ASPE, and relied heavily on Medicaid administrative data from  		the Health Care Financing Administration's Tape-to-Tape data base. The four  		reports included: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><b><i>Variations in the Medicaid Safety Net for Children and Youth  			 with High Medical Costs: A Comparison of Four States</i></b>. This report  			 analyzed the Medicaid experience of children and young adults with total  			 Medicaid claims of $25,000 or more in California (1986), Georgia (1984),  			 Michigan (1985) and Tennessee (1986). [Available at <a href="4stvares.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/4stvares.htm</a>]</p>
<p>Key study questions were: Through what eligibility pathways do  			 high-cost children and youth become enrolled in the Medicaid program? What  			 health care utilization patterns account for their high Medicaid expenditures?  			 How do the program characteristics of State Medicaid program affect the size  			 and characteristics of high-cost children and youth on Medicaid? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>SSI-Related Disabled Children and Medicaid</i></b>. This  			 report analyzed the 1984 Medicaid experience of all children passing the SSI  			 disability test in California, Georgia and Michigan. [Available at  			 <a href="4stvares.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/ssireles.htm</a>]</p>
<p>Key study questions were: What are the Medicaid enrollment,  			 utilization and expenditure patterns of SSI-related disabled children? What  			 proportion of overall child Medicaid enrollment and expenditures do SSI-related  			 disabled children represent? How do SSI-related disabled children fit into the  			 overall disabled Medicaid population and expenditures? What are the disabling  			 conditions of SSI disabled children? What differences are seen among  			 SSI-related children by institutional status? What impact might the Supreme  			 Court's <b><i>Zebley</i></b> decision have on Medicaid patterns for disabled  			 children? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i><b>Longitudinal Analysis of High Cost Medicaid Children in  			 California</b></i>. This report analyzed the Medicaid experience from 1980  			 through 1986 of children in California who had Medicaid claims in 1983 of  			 $25,000 or more. [Available at <a href="cahcmces.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/cahcmces.htm</a>]</p>
<p>Key study questions were: What proportion of high cost children are  			 new to the Medicaid program when they experience a period of high  			 medical expenditures? To what extent do high cost children remain enrolled in  			 Medicaid after their period of high expenditures? Have these children had high  			 costs on Medicaid in the past? Do they have persistently high costs in the  			 future? Are there variations in the longitudinal experience of high cost  			 Medicaid children by age, institutional status, or eligibility group? What are  			 the characteristics of high cost children who use Medicaid as a permanent  			 safety net? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>Who is Paying the Big. Bills? Very High Cost Pediatric  			 Hospitalizations in California, 1987</i></b>. This report analyzed all-payor  			 data for high cost pediatric hospitalizations (<u>&gt;</u>$25,000) for all  			 children in California in 1987, using the California All-Payor Hospital  			 Discharge data set. [Available at <a href="bigblles.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/bigblles.htm</a>]</p>
<p>Key study questions were: Who is paying for the hospital care for  			 high cost child cases? How many high cost children are uninsured? What are the  			 differences in the characteristics of very high cost cases among those who are  			 privately insured, publicly insured and those without insurance? What are the  			 differences in age, diagnosis, type of discharge, and length of stay? </p>
</li>
</ul><p>In the following pages, we answer three questions from these reports:  		What did we learn? What are the policy implications? Is additional research  		needed? Rather than present each study separately, we have integrated the  		findings into major program areas. </p>
<h2>OVERVIEW OF MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY FOR DISABLED AND HIGH COST  		CHILDREN</h2>
<p>Before we present the study results, it seems appropriate to provide a  		brief review of the Medicaid program as it relates to severely disabled and  		high cost children. Medicaid is the primary public medical assistance program  		for low-income severely disabled children. However, Medicaid eligibility is so  		complicated that it is difficult to evaluate the extent to which Medicaid can  		be used to provide coverage to disabled and high cost children. There are  		numerous pathways to eligibility, and these pathways vary from State to State  		due to the many options available. Generally, qualifying for Medicaid can be  		considered to involve two steps--categorical eligibility and financial  		eligibility. </p>
<p><b>Categorical Eligibility</b>. First, a child has to fit into one of  		the so-called categorical groups which a State covers for Medicaid: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Most children on Medicaid qualify through the <i>Aid to Families  			 with Dependent Children (AFDC)</i> program. AFDC is our main welfare program  			 for families in need. To qualify for AFDC, a key requirement is that a child  			 must live in a family in which only one parent is present, although the program  			 has recently expanded to include two-parent families with one unemployed  			 parent. All States have to cover children receiving AFDC cash assistance under  			 Medicaid. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another pathway to Medicaid eligibility is through the  			 <i>Supplemental Security Income (SSI)</i> program, a Federally administered  			 cash assistance program for the disabled (and aged). To receive SSI benefits, a  			 child has to pass a disability test. The SSI definition of disability is the  			 inability to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically  			 determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in  			 death or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not  			 less than 12 months. This definition focuses on whether an adult is capable of  			 work. For children, the SSI program is supposed to determine whether a child  			 suffers from a condition of comparable severity. However, the Supreme Court  			 ruled this year that SSA had been using a harsher disability test for children  			 than had been intended by Congress. As a result, the SSI disability test for  			 children is to be revised to include an individualized assessment for children  			 (when necessary) with an age-appropriate functional standard. Nevertheless,  			 many severely disabled children will not be able to pass the SSI disability  			 test since their disabilities are acute, and they may eventually achieve  			 recovery. Although States do not have to automatically extend Medicaid to SSI  			 children, all but two (Connecticut and Missouri) do. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Ribicoff coverage</i> is the final categorical group under which  			 severely disabled children may qualify for Medicaid assistance only, if they  			 are unable to qualify under the AFDC or SSI-related groups. The Ribicoff child  			 group is named after the Connecticut Senator who sponsored the initial  			 legislation for expanding Medicaid to all poor children, regardless of their  			 family structure or eligibility for AFDC or SSI categorical coverage. With  			 Ribicoff coverage, there are no categorical rules per se for children. Unlike  			 AFDC, Ribicoff coverage includes children who live in two-parent families. Also  			 important, there are no disability tests for children to qualify under the  			 Ribicoff group. Instead, the Medicaid eligibility for Ribicoff children is  			 strictly based on their financial situation. </p>
<p>Until recently, any Ribicoff coverage was optional to States;  			 however, Federal legislation now requires all States to implement Ribicoff  			 coverage for all children born on or after October 1, 1983. As a result, by the  			 year 2002, Ribicoff coverage will be complete nationwide for all children  			 through age 18. However, in 1989, only 30 States at their option had elected to  			 extend Ribicoff coverage for children through age 18. Thus, in the remaining  			 States, children born before October 1, 1983 will not qualify for Medicaid  			 unless they can meet the AFDC or SSI categorical requirements. </p>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Financial Eligibility</b>. Second, a child (or the child's family)  		has to pass a financial test. The financial test varies among the categorical  		groups and among States. For children on AFDC and SSI, financial eligibility  		for Medicaid is determined by the criteria used by States to determine  		eligibility for cash assistance. Generally, the financial thresholds for the  		AFDC program are quite low. In 1989, the median State used an AFDC level of  		$360 for a family of three, which was about 46% of the Federal poverty level.  		SSI financial thresholds are higher. In 1989, the median State SSI threshold  		for a disabled person living independently was $368 a month, 68% of the Federal  		poverty level. </p>
<p>States also have the option to adopt medically needy  		programs. A medically needy program allows a State to set higher income (and  		asset) criteria for Medicaid (only) eligibility than are used for AFDC cash  		assistance. Children in any of the categorical groups can qualify through the  		medically needy provisions. A medically needy program also requires that  		applicants be allowed to "spend-down" to Medicaid eligibility, even if their  		income exceeds the medically needy income level. The income spend-down process  		allows applicants to deduct incurred medical expenses from income in  		determining financial eligibility. Severely disabled children in States without  		medically needy programs are subject to the so-called Medicaid  		notch, whereby an additional $1 of income can mean the complete  		loss of Medicaid coverage. The spend-down provisions of a medically needy  		program mitigate this notch problem and allow children from families of any  		income level to qualify for Medicaid, assuming their medical bills are large  		enough. It is important to note that the spend-down liability only has to be  		incurred, not paid, by a spend-down applicant. This is different from the way  		Income spend-down works for Medicaid recipients in nursing homes, who always  		have to pay their spend-down obligation each month. </p>
<p>The median State medically needy level in 1989 was $382 for a one person  		family, about 70% of the Federal poverty level. In 1989, 36 States had  		medically needy programs. </p>
<p>Different financial eligibility levels are used for children born on or  		after October 1, 1983 who qualify for Medicaid under the Ribicoff coverage  		group. OBRA 1989 required States to provide Medicaid coverage to all children  		up to age 6 in families with income up to 133% of the Federal poverty level.  		OBRA 1990 requires States to cover all children born on or after October 1,  		1983 with family income below 100% of the Federal poverty level. State  		medically needy financial levels are used for Ribicoff children born before  		October 1, 1983. </p>
<p>Thus, as shown in <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>, different financial  		levels are used to determine Medicaid eligibility for children, dependent on  		the categorical group under which they are qualifying. For Ribicoff children,  		age also makes a difference. <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> does not represent  		any one State, but instead depicts in a general fashion w ere median State  		financial eligibility levels for children were in 1989. </p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure1" id="figure1"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68286/hghcstesf1.gif" /></a></div>
<p>It should be noted that Medicaid eligibility for children who are  		institutionalized works very differently than with children who are living at  		home with their families. Generally, the income and assets of family members  		with whom children are living are considered to be available to them for  		support and thus are counted in determining financial eligibility for Medicaid.  		However, children who have been institutionalized for more than one month are  		not "deemed' to have family income or assets available to them; only income or  		assets which the child may have individually are considered to be available.  		This approach greatly expands financial eligibility for institutionalized  		children, and has been criticized for providing an incentive to  		institutionalize children instead of caring for them at home. Although some  		program options and waivers are available to State Medicaid programs to waive  		the deeming of family income and assets for children who could be cared for  		appropriately and cost-effectively at home, not all States participate in these  		options. </p>
<h2>STUDY RESULTS</h2>
<p>Study analyses focused on two groups of severely disabled children  		served under Medicaid--children with high Medicaid costs (<u>&gt;</u> $25,000  		annually) and children passing the SSI disability test (called SSI-related  		children). Little national level data are available on either group, except the  		number of disabled children qualifying for cash assistance benefits under the  		SSI program. In December 1989, 296,293 children under age 22 were enrolled in  		the SSI program. SSI child enrollment has been fairly stable since 1980. </p>
<p>High cost Medicaid children were about 0.2% of total Medicaid recipients  		among the study States, while SSI-related disabled children were 1%-3%. There  		was some overlap between the two groups. About half of the high cost children  		in each State passed the SSI disability test. However, the vast majority of  		SSI-related children were not high cost, i.e. they did not have annual Medicaid  		expenditures of $25,000 a year or more. <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a> below  		shows the general relationship between high cost Medicaid children and  		SSI-related Medicaid children. </p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure2" id="figure2"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68286/hghcstesf2.gif" /></a></div>
<h2>HIGH COST MEDICAID CHILDREN (&gt; $25,000/Year)</h2>
<p>Although high cost children were only about 0.2% of total Medicaid  		recipients among the study States in 1986, they represented 4-8% of total  		Medicaid expenditures, as shown in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. They  		accounted for a greater proportion of expenditures in California and Michigan,  		compared to Georgia and Tennessee. Lower expenditures in Georgia and Tennessee  		were due to more restrictive service coverage and reimbursement policies  		employed in these States. </p>
<p>High cost children tended to fall into two major groups: 1) infants and  		very young children (under age 4) with high Medicaid costs related to extended  		hospital stays, and 2) teenagers and young adults with mental disabilities who  		were institutionalized. </p>
<p>In 3 of the 4 study States, 70% or more of high cost children were  		institutionalized. Most of these institutionalized children were adolescents  		and young adults. Most were institutionalized during the entire study year.  		About 60% were male. The proportion receiving ICF/MR care ranged from 50% to  		97% among the study States. Most were receiving SSI cash assistance to cover  		their personal needs. </p>

</tr></table><p>The longitudinal analysis in California showed that high cost  		institutionalized children were likely to main institutionalized and remain  		high cost, as shown in <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>. In 1986, about 90% of  		the 1983 cohort were still enrolled in Medicaid, and 67% still had Medicaid  		expenditures of $25,000 or more per year. The 7 year cumulative Medicaid cost  		(1980 through 1986) for institutionalized children who were in the high cost  		group in 1983 in California averaged $328,819 per child. </p>
<p>High cost children who were not institutionalized had a very different  		profile. From one-third to two-thirds were under age 4. A very high proportion  		were infants, suggesting that these children incurred high Medicaid costs as a  		result of complications of delivery and birth, such as low birth- weight. </p>
<p>Optional eligibility groups were critical to Medicaid coverage for many  		of the high cost children not in long-term care settings. The combination of  		full Ribicoff coverage (i.e. coverage of all low-income children up to age 21,  		regardless of family structure) and medically needy coverage accounted for 42%  		of noninstitutionalized high cost children in California, 35% in Michigan, and  		26% in Tennessee. Georgia did not have Ribicoff or medically needy coverage  		during the study year. </p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure3" id="figure3"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68286/hghcstesf3.gif" /></a></div>
<p>Although many of the noninstitutionalized high cost children qualified  		for Medicaid through the medically needy and Ribicoff groups, few of the  		children were reported to have private insurance or spend-down liabilities.  		This result suggests that Medicaid coverage is not reaching many high cost  		children in middle class families. Instead, most of the coverage is going to  		children in families with income below the poverty level. </p>
<p>The longitudinal analysis in California showed that about one-third of  		the noninstitutionalized high cost children in 1983 were new entrants to  		Medicaid, a higher than expected rate with normal caseload turnover and growth.  		<a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a> shows that only about half of these children  		were still enrolled in Medicaid by 1986, and about 10% were deceased. Most  		noninstitutionalized high cost children in 1983 were not persistently high  		cost. Only 9% continued to have Medicaid expenditures of $10,000 or more  		annually by 1986. </p>
<p>These results suggest that the California Medicaid program was providing  		transitory coverage for many noninstitutionalized high cost children. Of  		interest, infants were the least likely age group to remain enrolled on  		Medicaid, and the least likely to remain high cost. The most frequent diagnoses  		for high cost infants involved conditions originating in the perinatal period  		(such as low birth weight) and congenital anomalies. It appears that these  		problems were not permanently and totally disabling, since few of these infants  		became SSI recipients. Of the high cost infants in 1983, only 3% remained high  		cost to Medicaid (<u>&gt;</u> $10,000 annually) three years later in 1986,  		compared to an overall average of 9% among high cost children. </p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure4" id="figure4"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68286/hghcstesf4.gif" /></a></div>
<h2>SSI-RELATED DISABLED CHILDREN</h2>
<p>In 1984, SSI-related disabled children were 1%-3% of overall Medicaid  		recipients and 3%-5% of overall Medicaid expenditures among the study States,  		as shown in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>. At least 97% of SSI-related disabled  		children in each State received cash assistance, so that few children passing  		the SSI disability test qualified through the medically needy provisions. The  		average age for SSI- related disabled children was about 14 years, and there  		were slightly more males than females. Four disease categories accounted for  		the vast majority of SSI children--mental retardation, disease of the nervous  		system and sense organs (including infantile cerebral palsy, multiple  		sclerosis, epilepsy and muscular dystrophy, hearing loss and blindness), mental  		disorders, and congenital anomalies. </p>

</tr></table><p>Three subgroups of SSI-related disabled children with consistently  		different Medicaid enrollment and utilization patterns were identified among  		the study States: </p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Noninstitutionalized SSI Cash Assistance Children</b>. The vast  			 majority of SSI-related disabled children on Medicaid were in this group (88%  			 to 95%). They lived at home in the community and received SSI cash assistance  			 benefits. The annual Medicaid expenditure per child in 1984 ranged from $1,490  			 to $2,434, compare to an average expenditure per AFDC child of $358 to $439.  			 However, the median expenditure per SSI-related disabled child was only $239 to  			 $411 among the study States. A minority of these children in each State had  			 exceptionally high expenditures, thus substantially increasing the overall  			 average per child. About half the Medicaid expenditures for this group went to  			 inpatient hospital care for the 11 % to 20% of children who were hospitalized  			 during the year. Noninstitutionalized children receiving SSI accounted for  			 28%-39% of expenditures for SSI-related disabled children in California and  			 Michigan. Since Georgia had little optional coverage, this group accounted for  			 58% of Medicaid expenditures for SSI-related disabled children in that State.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Institutionalized Children</b>. About 5%-10% of SSI-related  			 disabled children in each State were institutionalized, mainly in ICFs/MR and  			 SNFs. The average number of institutional care days per child exceeded 300 for  			 the year. About 17% also used inpatient hospital care during the year. The  			 annual Medicaid expenditure per institutionalized child ranged from $26,792 to  			 $31,638. As a result, most of these children were in the high cost group  			 described earlier of children with annual Medicaid expenditures of $25,000 or  			 more. Most received an SSI cash benefit each month of $25 to cover their  			 personal needs. Institutionalized children accounted for 42% of Medicaid  			 expenditures for SSI-related disabled children in Georgia, 58% in California,  			 and 71% in Michigan. Institutionalized children accounted for a greater  			 proportion of overall expenditures in Michigan because the State had a much  			 lower average expenditure per noninstitutionalized child relative to the other  			 study States. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Noninstitutionalized No Cash Children</b>. This subgroup  			 accounted for only 1%-2% of SSI-related disabled children among the study  			 States, and &lt;1%-3% of expenditures. They showed very different Medicaid  			 utilization patterns. Their hospital user rate was relatively high (17%-26%),  			 and they averaged many more days per hospital user than SSI cash children  			 (noninstitutionalized). They were only enrolled for 6-7 months of the study  			 year, compared to 10+ months for the other groups. The average Medicaid  			 expenditure for the year ranged from $3,700 to $12,821 per child, but a small  			 group of children had exceptionally high expenditures which greatly inflated  			 the averages. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>A major finding is that very few SSI-related disabled children living at  		home qualified for Medicaid through the medically needy provisions. In  		California, the most generous State with regard to its medically needy income  		threshold, only 2% of SSI-related disabled children were living at home and not  		receiving SSI cash assistance. Because Medicaid deems family income to be  		available to children living in the community, many families with disabled  		children have income considerably in excess of State SSI levels. Only when  		there is a major health crisis, such as a hospitalization, will they seek  		assistance from Medicaid. Several study results pointed to this pattern.  		SSI-related disabled children living at home and not receiving SSI had  		considerably higher Medicaid expenditures per enrollee when compared to the SSI  		cash group. They had shorter lengths of enrollment during the year. Their  		inpatient hospital user rates were considerably higher, and they averaged more  		hospital days per user. </p>
<p>A recent ruling by the Supreme Court (<i><b>Sullivan v. Zebley</b></i>,  		February 20, 1990) is expected to significantly increase the numbers of  		SSI-related disabled children on Medicaid. The court has ordered the Social  		Security Administration (SSA) to implement new standards for child disability  		determinations. The new standards will Include individualized functional  		assessments (when necessary) for children which will focus on the impact of a  		child's handicap on his/her normal daily activities. Previously, the disability  		assessment was limited to whether a child suffered from a condition included in  		(or equal to) a listing of medical impairments promulgated by SSA. </p>
<p>The number of new SSI awards to children has been steady at about 50,000  		annually for the last few years. However, another 50,000 children are denied  		coverage each year, most often because of their failure to pass the disability  		test. Some experts have estimated that about one-third of these denials (or  		17,000 children annually) may quality under the new procedures. Assuming most  		of the children who will qualify under the new procedures will have Medicaid  		expenditures similar to those of noninstitutionalized SSI cash assistance  		children, study results indicated that this level of expanded coverage would  		result in Medicaid increases of $10-$42 million a year nationally. </p>
<h2>PRIVATE INSURANCE COVERAGE OF HIGH COST CHILDREN</h2>
<p>Using an all-payor hospital data base, all children who had a hospital  		stay that cost more than $25,000 in 1987 in California were studied. Although  		these cases comprised only 2% of California's 1.06 million discharges for  		children, they comprised 35% of the $3.8 billion in total hospital charges for  		children in 1987. About half of the high cost children were covered by private  		insurance or HMOs, with another 30% covered by Medicaid. About 14% were covered  		by other government programs, such as CHSCN, CHAMPUS, Workers' Compensation,  		Medicare and various other Federal, State and local funding sources. A final 9%  		were reported to have no insurance. </p>
<p>These California data suggested government financing of a much greater  		proportion of high cost care for children than was expected. Altogether about  		44% of the financing (30% Medicaid plus 14% other public programs) was  		attributable to public payors. However, since these data were limited to  		California, this pattern may not be representative of all States. National  		survey data for 1987 indicate that about two-thirds (69%) of persons under 25  		had private insurance. It is not clear if the large role of public payors  		(especially non-Medicaid programs) in high cost care is unique to California,  		or if it is a broader phenomenon not previously identified due to lack of  		comparable data in other States. </p>
<p>Also of interest, the California data showed the rate of uninsurance was  		greatest among older adolescents and young adults, with about 30% of those 18  		to 24 years of age reporting a lack of insurance. This pattern is roughly  		consistent with national data indicating that lack of insurance is greatest  		among those 18 to 24 years of age and that public insurance coverage (i.e.,  		Medicaid, CHAMPUS, etc.) declines with the age of the child. Part of the  		problem is that Medicaid's coverage for children only extends through age 20.  		Young adults (i.e. those age 21-25) who meet Medicaid's financial requirements  		can only qualify for Medicaid if they have dependent children or if they pass  		the SSI-related disability test. A young adult, single or married, without  		children, has no avenue to qualifying for Medicaid if he or she has a  		short-term disabling condition, even if a very expensive hospitalization is  		involved. </p>
<p>The high cost uninsured were often hospitalized due to injuries or  		poisoning, suggesting that access for acute traumatic cases is relatively good  		among the uninsured. However, few hospitalized psychiatric patients were  		uninsured, suggesting that access to mental health services is more directly  		affected by insurance availability. </p>
<p>Another finding of importance is that as hospital stays become more  		expensive, the share of patients without private insurance declines. This may  		indicate that those without insurance have reduced access to care for serious  		illnesses, that hospitals are more aggressive in identifying payors for  		expensive cases, or that those without insurance seek less care. </p>
<p>If Medicaid were functioning as a good catastrophic program, we would  		expect the share of bills paid by Medicaid to rise as costs increased. This  		opposite pattern confirms the earlier conclusion that Medicaid is not reaching  		many high cost children in families with income just over the poverty level,  		even in California. </p>
<h2>POLICY IMPLICATIONS</h2>
<p>Generally, study results showed that although Medicaid has the potential  		to provide broad coverage for low-income families with disabled children, it  		provided only a very limited safety net in many States, with most coverage  		directed to severely disabled children in families poor enough to qualify for  		AFDC or SSI cash assistance. Even in a State like California with a relatively  		broad Medicaid program which extended coverage to many non-cash high cost and  		disabled children, it appears that Medicaid does not serve as a catastrophic  		insurance program for noninstitutionalized children of working class families  		with incomes just over the poverty level. Detailed below are some major policy  		implications for the Medicaid program and its coverage of severely disabled  		children. In some instances, the research showed that States are not exercising  		certain options under Medicaid which would improve their coverage of disabled  		and high cost children. In other instances, there are problems of program  		design which need to be addressed at the Federal level. </p>
<h3>1. Ribicoff Coverage Is Critical to the Medicaid Safety  		Net for High Cost Children</h3>
<p>Study results showed that the adoption of Ribicoff coverage (in  		conjunction with medically needy coverage) had a major effect on broadening the  		Medicaid safety net for severely disabled children, particularly  		noninstitutionalized children with extended hospital stays. During the study  		period, children unable to pass the SSI disability test in Georgia could only  		qualify for Medicaid if they were in single parent families. In 1983, 16% of  		high cost children in California and about 27% of the high cost children in  		Michigan and Tennessee qualified through the Ribicoff coverage provisions (in  		combination with medically needy coverage). The absence of Ribicoff coverage in  		Georgia in 1984 severely limited access to Medicaid coverage for high cost  		children in families that were not eligible for AFDC or SSI benefits. </p>
<p>The numerous expansions to Medicaid eligibility during the last few  		years to extend coverage to all infants and young children living in poverty  		make mandatory some of the Ribicoff children covered optionally by California,  		Michigan and Tennessee in 1986. OBRA 1989 required States to provide Medicaid  		coverage to all children up to age 6 in families with incomes up to 133% of the  		Federal poverty level. This coverage will be extremely important since study  		data showed a large proportion of infants and young children with high hospital  		costs. OBRA 1990 requires States to begin phasing in the coverage of all  		children born after September 30, 1983 whose family incomes are below 1 00% of  		the Federal poverty level. In effect, this will mean that eventually all States  		will have Ribicoff coverage for all children through age 18. Further, the  		income threshold will be the poverty level, not the medically needy level,  		which is usually well below the poverty level. </p>
<p>However, States are still not required to provide Ribicoff coverage for  		children born before October 1983. Thus, severely disabled children born before  		October 1983 will not qualify for Medicaid coverage in some States if they live  		in two-parent families and they cannot pass the SSI disability test. Full  		Ribicoff coverage is necessary to open up Medicaid to high cost children in  		two-parent families who are unable to pass the SSI disability test. </p>
<p>In 1989, 20 States did not offer Ribicoff coverage to children through  		age 17. In these States, Medicaid's coverage of severely disabled children will  		continue to be seriously restricted, even with the changes in OBRA 1990. The  		group of severely disabled children adversely affected in these States are  		those born before October 1983 who cannot pass the SSI disability test and who  		live in two-parent poor families. It is important to realize that no matter how  		poor the families of these children are, or how high their medical expenses  		are, their disabled children will not be able to qualify for Medicaid unless  		the State has opted to provide full Ribicoff coverage. </p>
<h3>2. Some Provision for Buying-In to Medicaid Coverage Is  		Needed in All States to Replace the Medically Needy Program</h3>
<p>Currently, the medically needy program through its spend-down provisions  		provides access to Medicaid for children at all Income levels, assuming they  		fit into one of the categorical groups and their medical expenses are high  		enough. However, there are several problems with the medically needy program.  		To start with, not all States provide medically needy coverage. In 1989, some  		15 States did not have a medically needy program. In these States, no access to  		Medicaid (except through institutionalization) is available to otherwise  		eligible children born before October 1983 whose families have incomes which  		exceed AFDC or SSI levels. Even with the new eligibility groups Congress has  		implemented for younger children using income thresholds related to the poverty  		level, there continues to be a Medicaid notch problem. An  		additional $1 in family income over the poverty-related threshold can render a  		child completely ineligible for Medicaid in States without medically needy  		programs. </p>
<p>A second problem which exists in States <i>with</i> medically needy  		coverage is that the medically needy program is not used by very many children.  		Study results showed that only 2% of SSI- related children among the study  		States lived at home and qualified for Medicaid under the medically needy  		program. Participation was also low for high cost children, especially in the  		spend-down component of the medically needy program. Although many high cost  		children use the medically needy provisions to qualify for Medicaid, few  		children qualify by spending-down. For example, study data showed that in 1986,  		only 22% of California's noninstitutionalized high cost children who qualified  		through the medically needy provisions had a spend-down liability. Generally,  		for medically needy children to qualify for Medicaid without a spend-down,  		their family incomes must be just above AFDC or SSI levels but below medically  		needy levels--a fairly narrow income band. Children with family income above  		the medically needy level have to incur a spend-down liability to qualify for  		Medicaid. </p>
<p>Why do so few SSI-related children and families with high cost children  		use the spend-down provisions? Part of the problem may be that spend-down  		policy imposes a 100% marginal tax rate for income above the medically needy  		level. That means every dollar of income above the medically needy level has to  		be offset by incurred medical expenses. An example may help illustrate this  		problem. In 1986, the AFDC level in California for a four-person AFDC family  		was $734 monthly, compared to the medically needy level of $984. In 1986, the  		poverty level for a family of 4 was $933 monthly, close to California's  		medically needy level. Thus, a four-person family whose income was above the  		AFDC level but below the medically needy level (and poverty level) could have  		their high cost child qualify for Medicaid as medically needy without a  		spend-down. However, a four-person family with income above $984 a month would  		have to incur a spend-down liability in order for their children to become  		Medicaid eligible. If the family's income was $1,500 a month (or $18,000  		annually), the monthly spend-down liability would be $516 ($1,500 - $984 =  		$516). A family with $18,000 in income would not be considered to be living on  		the edge of poverty. On the other hand, It is easy to imagine that such a  		family might not have private health coverage or only fairly limited coverage.  		</p>
<p>Although $516 is not a lot of money relative to the medical expenses for  		a high cost child, it would represent almost one-third of the family's monthly  		income. Most would agree that this is an excessive proportion of income to  		require for access to medical benefits. Further, this approach provides no  		incentive to earn additional Income. Every additional dollar of income which  		the family earned would have to be devoted to the spend-down liability. </p>
<p>Yet another problem caused by current spend-down policy involves the  		OBRA 1989 coverage of children through age 5 and the 1990 OBRA legislation  		extending coverage to all children born after September 30, 1983. Recall that  		OBRA 1989 mandated that all States provide Medicaid to children through age 5  		whose family Income was less than 133% of poverty. A family with income just  		under 133% of poverty would not have to spend-down at all to obtain Medicaid  		coverage, providing their child was under age 6. However, if their income was  		140% of poverty, they would have to spend-down to the medically needy level,  		not the 133% of poverty level. The OBRA 1989 legislation made no provision for  		spending-down to the 133% of poverty level. Neither did the OBRA 1990  		legislation mention any spend-down to the 100% of poverty level. </p>
<p>The median State medically needy level in 1989 was only at 70% of the  		poverty level. As a result, in most States the disparity between the 133% of  		poverty level threshold for children up to age 5, the 100% of poverty level  		threshold for children born after September 30,1983 and the medically needy  		level is considerable. </p>
<p>Even though technically, the spend-down only has to be incurred and not  		paid, many families may not understand this distinction. In fact, many  		policymakers are surprised to learn that income spend-downs only have to be  		incurred. According to the Medicaid statute in Section 1903(f)(2) of the Social  		Security Act, medically needy applicants are supposed to be able to disregard  		from their income any medical expenses which they have incurred; applicants may  		disregard such expenses even ff they have not actually paid the bills, as long  		as the bills are their responsibility. There are good reasons for allowing  		applicants to incur spend-down costs instead of requiring that the spend-down  		be paid. Immediate payment of a large spend-down liability would not be  		possible in many circumstances. Continuing with the example above, many  		families would find it difficult to pay the $516 right away in  		order to spend-down into Medicaid. Thus, requiring only incurred costs enables  		applicants to collect bills, establish eligibility for Medicaid, and pay off  		the incurred spend-down liabilities eventually as best they can. On the other  		hand, if applicants are not aware that they only have to incur spend-down  		liabilities, or providers are not willing to let applicants incur costs, it  		makes little difference that the Medicaid statute does not require that the  		spend-down liability be paid. </p>
<p>We believe the spend-down provision of the medically needy program has  		major design flaws. The 100% marginal tax rate for some categorical groups  		means there is no incentive to earn additional Income. There is also a new  		Medicaid notch problem introduced by having some younger groups of children  		whose eligibility is tied to the poverty standard. Since there is no spend-down  		to the poverty standard, families whose income exceed the poverty threshold  		have to spend-down to the medically needy level to attain Medicaid eligibility  		for their children. Finally, although the spend-down liability only has to be  		incurred, not paid, this policy may not be uniformly understood or implemented.  		All these design problems can only be resolved by changes in Federal Medicaid  		policy. </p>
<p>The most frequently proposed solution to the spend-down problem is to  		replace the spend-down component of medically needy programs with an  		income-related Medicaid buy-in premium. The amount of the buy-in might range  		from 2% to 10% of family income. Consideration should be given to structuring  		the buy-in in such a way that there would be some incentive for additional  		income, perhaps similar to the sliding scale fees used for other social service  		programs. Using a buy-in premium paid directly to State Medicaid programs would  		eliminate many of the administrative problems associated with spend-down.  		Applicants and providers would find the buy-in concept much easier to  		understand than spend-down, since a buy-in would be similar to an insurance  		premium. Applicants would no longer have to track their medical expenses and  		report them to local Medicaid offices in order to successfully spend-down.  		Finally, applicants would no longer be dependent on the willingness of  		providers to extend credit before they could spend- down to achieve Medicaid  		eligibility. </p>
<p>Work is also needed on where the income threshold for Medicaid buy-in is  		set. The current system involves numerous income thresholds to Medicaid  		eligibility for children. These thresholds do not fit together logically. The  		differing thresholds cause substantial equity issues, as well as adverse  		incentives for families to increase their earned income. We ought to be able to  		do better in terms of structuring access to Medicaid for low-income children,  		especially when the children are severely disabled. Since many of the recent  		Congressional changes to Medicaid eligibility have involved using the poverty  		level as the income eligibility standard, it may be more consistent to tie  		State buy-in thresholds to this level as well. Currently, these changes in  		Medicaid program design can only be made at the Federal level. One option might  		be to implement these design changes only for children. </p>
<h3>3. Controlling the Medicaid Costs of Institutionalized  		Children Must Continue To Be a High Priority</h3>
<p>Study results emphasized the persistent high costs to Medicaid  		associated with institutionalized children. Policyrnakers might want to  		consider ways to encourage States to use the available options to provide  		community-based care for disabled children who would otherwise be  		institutionalized. Currently, 36 States are using home and community-based  		waivers to provide disabled children specialized services in a home or  		community setting. Seventeen States are using the TEFRA option to waive  		parental deeming of income to their children and provide them cost-effective  		home care. </p>
<p>Consideration could be given to further steps for encouraging States to  		use these options, or to develop additional incentives for States to discourage  		institutionalization. Institutionalized disabled children are one of the most  		expensive Medicaid groups. They are not likely to become ineligible for  		Medicaid coverage. Many are likely to remain institutionalized indefinitely.  		Medicaid will be covering all of their institutional care costs (which average  		over $30,000 annually) for as long as they live. </p>
<p>The good news with regard to institutionalized disabled children is that  		this population is not growing. This is true in spite of the fact that Medicaid  		eligibility policy provides incentives for institutionalization in many States.  		States have been successful in stabilizing or, in some instances, even lowering  		the number of children in ICFs/MR, for example. Thus, this is not a group of  		children for whom Medicaid expenditures are likely to expand. </p>
<h3>4. Severely Disabled Children Who Qualify for Medicaid  		Coverage as a Result of the Supreme Courts Zebley Ruling May Not Be As  		Expensive to Medicaid as Expected</h3>
<p>Study data showed that the vast majority of SSI-related disabled  		children were not high cost to Medicaid. Indeed, the median annual Medicaid  		expenditure in California and Georgia for SSI children living at home was about  		$550 (adjusted to 1989 dollars using the medical care price index). A minority  		of SSI-related children with extended hospital stays and institutionalized SSI  		children accounted for the vast majority of Medicaid Expenditures for  		SSI-related disabled children. Study data provide some parameters for  		estimating the costs of Medicaid expansions for disabled children under the  		Zebley decision. It seems likely that most children requiring institutional  		care are already covered under Medicaid. Thus, analysts should use the median  		and average costs for SSI children living at home for lower and upper bound  		estimates of Medicaid expansions to disabled children. This may result in lower  		costs than were previously predicted for adding new groups of disabled  		children. </p>
<h2>RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS</h2>
<p>Subsequent to the time period analyzed in these studies, the Federal  		government has imposed increased mandates on States to broaden Medicaid  		coverage for poor infants and children born after September 30, 1983. In  		addition, several States have elected to expand their coverage of children. For  		example, since the studies, Georgia has adopted a medically needy program and  		extended coverage to all Ribicoff children under age 19. Thus, it would be  		interesting to re- examine high-cost children in the four study States with  		more recent data to assess the degree to which these mandated and voluntary  		eligibility changes may have broadened access to Medicaid program coverage,  		particularly in States with more restrictive Medicaid programs in the past.  		</p>
<p>Also, the spread of AIDS to children and the increased number of drug  		exposed infants and children may have changed the profile of severely disabled  		children significantly since the study time period. An update of the high cost  		profile would show if the proportion of younger children in the high cost group  		has become even greater and whether the long-term patterns of high cost infants  		and younger children have changed, given these more recent developments. There  		is growing concern that drug exposed infants in particular may require  		prolonged medical and social assistance. </p>
<p>It would also be helpful to investigate whether the longitudinal  		patterns of high cost children seen in California apply to other State Medicaid  		programs as well. We know that California's Medicaid program in 1983 offered  		more comprehensive benefits and used less restrictive eligibility criteria than  		other States. We believe that these program differences had an impact on the  		dynamics of Medicaid coverage for high cost children, but we do not have enough  		information on the longitudinal experience of high cost children in other  		States to say this with certainty. </p>
<p>The surprising extent to which non-Medicaid government programs were  		financing the hospital expenses of all high cost children in California should  		be explored further. It would be interesting to undertake similar analyses with  		other State all-payor data bases, such as those in New Jersey or Florida. </p>
<p>Finally, one major policy issue which we were not able to address was  		the degree to which families are incurring out-of-pocket costs for health care  		for disabled children. A lot of anecdotal data have been cited which suggest  		these costs are substantial, but better research is needed. A special survey  		approach is probably necessary since childhood disability is a relatively rare  		event affecting only a small percentage of children in the United States. </p>
