<h2><a name="chapI" id="chapI">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p> Caring for the elderly in a community setting has become an extremely  		complex task. The needs of the elderly population are varied, and the service  		providers attempting to meet these needs represent a diverse group of agencies,  		organizations, and institutions. Providers may be public, non-profit, or  		proprietary. They may receive reimbursement for services from a variety of  		social service, aging, or health funding streams. These include Area Agencies  		on Aging, Base Service Units of Mental Health Agencies, agencies funded by  		Title XX of the Social Security Act, and home care agencies reimbursed through  		Titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act.</p>
<p> Case management or coordinating agencies have been established in many  		locales, partly in response to the complexity of the service system which  		provides community care to the elderly. These agencies have the Herculean task  		of creating order and organization in this system. The Memorandum of  		Understanding is a tool which can be quite effective in achieving this end.</p>
<p> Through the use of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), agreements  		between coordinating or case management agencies and the agencies providing  		direct service can be formalized. The MOU can be tailored to the specific needs  		of each agency, whether the agency provides case management services, direct  		services, or some combination of both.</p>
<p> The MOU is an important device in organizing community care systems for  		the elderly since it can be used to stipulate client flow and other issues  		related to efficient service delivery in advance of operation. This paper  		discusses the process an agency should follow to develop interagency MOU's and  		presents examples of MOU's which can be used as models.</p>
<h2><a name="chapII" id="chapII">II. MOU'S: PURPOSES AND TYPES</a></h2>
<p> Case management agencies must develop working relationships with a  		variety of other agencies in their communities and states. These relationships  		will vary depending on the needs of the case management agency and the  		willingness and capability of community agencies to become involved in the case  		management effort. Many interagency relationships can be based simply on the  		informal understandings of executives or workers in each of the agencies. Other  		relationships, however, are important or complicated enough to require  		formalization through the development of MOU's, or as they are sometimes  		referred to, Memoranda of Agreement or MOA's. An MOU is a formalized statement  		of the mutual expectations of two agencies. Although not a legally binding  		document, an MOU represents a signed commitment on the part of two or more  		parties to conduct interagency business in a specified manner.</p>
<p> An MOU can be a useful tool for case management agencies which have as  		their major function, coordination of services for clients from a number of  		community providers. Procedurally, this task could be a nightmare for case  		managers unless specific elements, especially client flow, are clearly  		described in advance of operation. The MOU serves as the vehicle for  		establishing the requirements of the agreement. In this respect it can be  		used:</p>
<ul><li>To delineate client flow;</li>
<li>To specify services to be provided by a provider agency to  		  clients;</li>
<li>To specify the type of clients appropriate for the case management  		  agency and how referrals should be made;</li>
<li>To facilitate communication by defining a process for regular  		  meetings, phone contact or data exchange;</li>
<li>To protect both parties against differing interpretations of  		  expectations by either party, by spelling out details of the relationship;</li>
<li>To cut through red tape by defining new or altered procedures for  		  clients;</li>
<li>To enhance the status of the case management agency in the community  		  through formalized relationships with established or influential agencies;</li>
<li>To reduce friction over turf issues by specifying  		  responsibilities;</li>
<li>To transfer authority to perform a mandated function from one agency  		  to another or from one level of government to another.</li>
</ul><p> Negotiating an MOU can take a considerable amount of staff time,  		energy, and resources. Therefore, a case management agency should only pursue  		MOD's with those agencies which are considered essential to its operation or to  		the building of its credibility in the community. The types of agencies with  		which case management agencies will develop MOD's will vary but the MOU's  		negotiated will fall into one of three categories. These are described  		below.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Client Services</b>. Agencies, organizations, or individuals  			 which will provide services for case management clients should sign MOU's with  			 the case management agency. Whether such services are donated, for example, by  			 a church or community group or paid for through traditional funding streams, an  			 MOU should be developed specifying how the services will be ordered, what  			 methods of communication will be used, what types of personnel will be  			 involved, what measures will assure confidentiality of client data, and any  			 other terms or conditions necessary to assure a good working  			 relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Referrals</b>. Agencies or organizations which will refer clients  			 to the case management agency should sign an MOU agreeing to the types of  			 appropriate clients to refer, the process for contacting the case management  			 agency, the process for ongoing communications between agencies, the measures  			 employed to assure confidentiality and any other necessary terms or  			 conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Non-Client Related Issues</b>. In some instances the case  			 management agency may wish to formalize a relationship with an agency which  			 does not provide client services or referrals. This may be an MOU with a  			 non-provider agency, such as a planning agency or philanthropic organization,  			 which simply details common interest, mutual support, agreement to exchange  			 data, or willingness to serve on committees and governing bodies. Another  			 important type of MOU which does not involve direct service or referral is one  			 which transfers authority from one entity to another. For example, a state  			 nursing home prescreening program may transfer the authority to prescreen  			 clients to the case management agency. An MOU between the program and the case  			 management agency may be developed specifying the terms of this  			 arrangement.</p>
</li>
</ul><p> An important point to be made is that MOU's are not contracts. A  		contract is a private law between two parties which can be upheld in court. An  		MOU can be a powerful tool since it requires two parties to come to mutual  		agreement. However, an MOU is not legally binding. A case management agency  		must ascertain when agreements need to be further solidified through the use of  		a contract rather than an MOU. Whenever exchange of money is taking place, a  		contract is a necessary document. In addition, whenever service delivery,  		transfer of authority, or any other condition needs to be binding, a contract  		may be a necessary document.</p>
<p> The process of negotiating contracts and the ultimate content of  		contracts are very similar to that of MOU negotiation and content. Contracting  		simply requires further attention to legal detail. The following material will  		be useful to agencies interested in contracting since it represents a building  		block for understanding contract negotiation and development.</p>
<p> Finally, it should be recognized that a good understanding of the MOU  		development process can be acquired only through actual practice. Common sense,  		logic, and the materials which follow, combined with a bit of political savvy  		about the local community, should help an agency director to begin developing  		agreements with providers.</p>
<h2><a name="chapIII" id="chapIII">III. THE PROCESS OF NEGOTIATING MOU'S</a></h2>
<h3>A. General Guidelines</h3>
<p> The following is a list of general guidelines to keep in mind during  		the process of MOU negotiation and development. </p>
<ol><li>Identify the key people.</li>
<li>Keep the goals and objectives broad. </li>
<li>Keep the language broad and simple.</li>
<li>Define your role as a case management agency. </li>
<li>Define what the provider can offer. </li>
<li>Set realistic expectations.</li>
<li>Be specific regarding the understandings and functions. </li>
<li>Set review dates.</li>
<li>Do not make the MOU more complicated than necessary.</li>
<li>Do not use the MOU as a power play.</li>
<li>Define the terms, units of service, service definitions.</li>
<li>Use a marketing approach. Make the provider feel good about entering  		  into the relationship.</li>
<li>Encourage participation of provider agencies on your Advisory  		  Council.</li>
<li>Clearly specify procedures for amending the MOU.</li>
<li>Check the need to include state, federal, and local legal  		  requirements such as the Civil Rights clause which must be included in federal  		  contracts.</li>
<li>Handle the arrangements and establish the relationship correctly the  		  first time, so that the need to renegotiate is minimized.</li>
<li>Be aware and beware of underlying agency antagonisms or feuds which  		  may impact on the implementation of the MOU. If possible, help to resolve these  		  problems.</li>
</ol><h3>B. Stages in the Process</h3>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Stage One. Planning Stage.</b> The planning stage is essential as  			 a basis for subsequent MOU activity and will, if carefully executed, provide a  			 set of decisions and determinations which will facilitate smooth negotiation  			 and implementation of the relationship with the provider. It is also essential  			 as the basis for developing a contract. </p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><b>Step One. Begin with internal brainstorming.</b>  				  Administrators, case managers, or others involved in your agency's efforts  				  should identify:</p>
<ol><li>What you want or need another party to provide;</li>
<li>What you are willing to negotiate;</li>
<li>What you are willing to give up;</li>
<li>What you have to offer;</li>
<li>The rationale for entering the MOU process.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p><b>Step Two. Identify the potential providers in the  				  community.</b> In this process, identify provider needs and explore ways in  				  which you can, to some extent, address their needs. Be realistic about what you  				  can expect providers to deliver and what you can deliver. Explore ways to  				  establish appropriate relationships in order to maximize the probability of  				  achieving what you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Step Three. Define your agency's program objectives for a  				  particular MOU and evaluate whether you can accomplish the objectives without  				  the MOU.</b> The definition of program objectives is a crucial process in the  				  development of an MOU.</p>
<p> Clearly defined program objectives can be translated into the  				  terms and conditions of the MOU. In developing the objectives you should:</p>
<ol><li>Define the client population to be served;</li>
<li>Define the service to be provided, or the understanding you  					 desire;</li>
<li>Assess any costs, both direct and indirect, to your agency  					 and the agency with which you are negotiating an MOU;</li>
<li>Define the minimally acceptable standards of performance.  					 </li>
</ol><p> Program objectives stated in terms of measurable outcomes will  				  facilitate monitoring, evaluation, and MOU renogotiation later on after the MOU  				  has been implemented.</p>
<p> Program objectives can be used as a point of reference against  				  which to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of developing an MOU. Their  				  consideration will assist you in determining whether the creation of an MOU  				  will unnecessarily formalize a relationship, create unnecessary bureaucracy or  				  be counterproductive. An MOU should not be attempted if it will disrupt a good  				  relationship. </p>
<p> Finally, reference to program objectives will help you set up  				  the criteria for agencies and individuals with which to negotiate an  				  MOU.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Step Four. Identify the level of staff to be involved in the  				  negotiation process.</b> Involve those persons in the process as early as  				  possible. Their value in negotiation will be enhanced if they are thoroughly  				  familiar with what you want accomplished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Step Five. Identify agencies which have money for  				  services.</b> Consider some of the ways you can tap into their money and  				  services. For example, you could act as a referral source to the agency or  				  perform preauthorizations for service for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Step Six. Identify agencies which authorize or pay for  				  services.</b> Consider ways to negotiate some transfer of authority to the case  				  management agency. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <b>Step Seven. Identify individuals who are influential among  				  service providers and enlist their support and assistance.</b></p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p><b>Stage Two. Negotiation Stage.</b> The negotiation stage begins  			 through contact with the agency, preferably in-person. It is a good idea to  			 include the staff member who will be responsible for implementing the MOU in  			 the initial visit. Have a clear agenda for the meeting. Describe your agency,  			 what you hope to demonstrate through case management, why the participation of  			 the provider agency is Important, and how clients will be better served by the  			 joint effort. </p>
<p> Sell the concept of case management as one that eliminates  			 duplication and enhances delivery of services to clients and their families.  			 After the sales pitch, service providers will probably be able to anticipate  			 what you want from them. </p>
<p> You have spent time during the planning stage identifying what you  			 want and what you are prepared to negotiate and now is the time to lay out your  			 expectations. Be realistic about what you expect and be prepared for  			 trade-offs. Develop a timetable with the provider, setting clear deadlines. It  			 is helpful if each party knows what time constraints and limitations exist in  			 the process.</p>
<p> Important points to consider are listed below.</p>
<ul><li> Identify the internal review process for both your agency and  				the provider. If the approval of an Advisory Board or Board of Directors is  				required, learn when these groups meet and plan with that date in mind. Check  				on whether you or the provider require a legal review and build that into the  				timeline.</li>
<li> Identify any insurance needs, relevant personnel policies, and  				requirements for physical examinations, T.B. or other tests. Decide who will  				pay if any tests are required.</li>
<li> Identify strategies for enhancing the professional status of  				both the provider and the case management agency in the community. One strategy  				is to jointly serve on each other's Boards.</li>
<li> Identify whether staff in-service training is required in order  				to implement the MOU. Agree on how, when, and who will provide that  				training.</li>
<li> If the reaction is negative, you might try a little community  				pressure. Find an influential friend in another agency, or locate a helpful  				Board member or use your state agency contacts. A little persuasion or  				arm-twisting is all part of a tough negotiation process.</li>
<li> Any research components in your program should be discussed in  				the process of negotiating MOU's with provider agencies.</li>
<li> Confidentiality assurance should be discussed with the provider  				during the negotiation stage. It should be understood that only authorized  				persons may have access to client information and records, that the records  				must be adequately secured at all times, that release of information is  				allowable only with the client's permission. These are good practice procedures  				which protect the rights of clients.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><b>Stage Three. Completing the MOU.</b> This final step begins with  			 the preparation of a draft of the MOU instrument which is based on your meeting  			 and negotiations with the provider agency. Generally, since you are initiating  			 the process, you will assume responsibility for preparing the draft. Send the  			 draft to the other party, along with a cover letter in which you identify  			 controversial areas. Try to negotiate those points where there is some  			 flexibility and identify the immutable points. This phase of the negotiation  			 could be handled by phone or in person, however personal contact may carry more  			 impact in terms of developing the relationship. Involving the persons with the  			 authority to negotiate for the agency at this draft stage can minimize the time  			 to complete the MOU.</p>
<p> If programmatic objectives have been specified in the planning  			 process, developing a system for monitoring and/or evaluation can be fairly  			 easy. You could identify data needs and develop the appropriate forms and  			 filing and tracking systems to be used jointly by your agency and the agency  			 with which you are developing the MOU.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Special Concerns.</b> </p>
<ol type="a"><li>
<p><b>Timing.</b> The finalization process can take as little as a  				  few days, or as long as a few months. Factors which tend to increase the amount  				  of time to finalize the MOU are:</p>
<ol><li>the people involved, the individual personalities and the  					 number of individuals can impact on the length of time needed to finalize the  					 MOU;</li>
<li>the number of drafts prepared and reviewed; </li>
<li>legal review;</li>
<li>board review; </li>
<li>staff review; </li>
<li>revisions;</li>
<li>negotiations; </li>
<li>holidays;</li>
<li>anything subject to action by a third party;</li>
<li>involvement by more than two agencies; </li>
<li>turf issues and interagency feuds.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p><b>Language.</b> Most problems can be eliminated with clear and  				  simple language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <b>Relationships.</b> You are negotiating a relationship. Since  				  relationships are dynamic, their nature can change over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> <b>Negative Publicity.</b> Negative publicity can come from  				  word-of-mouth or the press. Be aware of all publicity the joint effort  				  receives, both negative and positive. Address the negative publicity quickly,  				  thoroughly, and honestly.</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><h2><a name="chapIV" id="chapIV">IV. THE INSTRUMENT</a></h2>
<h3>A. General Comments</h3>
<p> The MOU is not a legally binding document. Rather, it is the written  		reflection of an understanding between two parties. The MOU is developed  		through a process of negotiation and mutual assent, finalized through  		acceptance of the MOU instrument, and approved by the appropriate agency  		representatives who signify such approval by signing the MOU.</p>
<p> The MOU instrument should be written so that it is clearly understood,  		is specific about the understandings negotiated and defines objectives.  		Language should be simple and straightforward. There Is no need for jargon,  		convoluted wording or intricate legal terms. A good marketing approach is to  		use language which makes both parties feel important and vital to the  		relationship. Follow the guidelines presented earlier in drafting the  		instrument. Keep in mind that the instrument is the written document which  		reflects what has been negotiated and agreed upon. Begin the MOU with a  		definition of what you want, and whose interests are being served or  		protected.</p>
<p> There is no standard MOU format. However, your agency's philosophy of  		relations with providers will be reflected in the format. Common sense should  		guide both the development of the instrument and the decisions regarding  		inclusions and exclusions. Community care demonstration projects have employed  		different terms and conditions, and these differences are addressed in the  		following section. There is, however, general agreement among demonstration  		projects about the approach and inclusions. Some of the terms and conditions  		below are essential requirements of an MOU, while others should be included  		only when appropriate. A good rule to follow is to include that which appears  		reasonable.</p>
<h3>B. Terms and Conditions of the MOU</h3>

</li>
<li>
<p><b>Describe the Expertise of Each Party.</b> This description will  			 establish the mutual respect for entering the agreement. This can be done with  			 a bit of flare to make the other party feel good. Make the other party feel  			 that his/her agency has something you need or want, and make sure he/she knows  			 you have something to offer. You might include the scope of responsibility  			 and/or program operational goals of each party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Describe the Clients Appropriate for your Service.</b> This  			 inclusion is applicable only for MOU's involving services to or referral of  			 clients. It can be written in general terms at the beginning of the MOU or can  			 be outlined in greater specificity in a separate section.

</ol></div>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b>SAMPLE 2 </b>Clients appropriate  				  for services furnished by the parties to this memorandum are the frail elderly  				  65 and over.</font></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Describe the Understanding Between the Parties Including the  			 Service to be Provided.</b> This is the major portion of the MOU and its  			 contents will depend on what has been negotiated. As mentioned earlier, it  			 could specify a service, the number of service slots to be reserved, a referral  			 process, a communication item. State the nature, scope, amount, and duration of  			 service where appropriate.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b>SAMPLE 1</b> </font><font>The case management agency agrees to provide case management services  				  to any client referred to (<b>provider</b>) for service during the duration of  				  time the client is eligible.</font></div>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b>SAMPLE 2</b>The case management  				  agency will determine eligibility for its case management services through a  				  screening process at intake and a comprehensive needs assessment.

<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b>SAMPLE 3</b> The (<b>provider</b>)  				  agrees to designate 15 slots per month for home delivered meals to case  				  management clients.</font></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Describe Who Will Pay For Service and How Payments Will Be  			 Made.</b> An explanation of the fee payment arrangements may be necessary in  			 some instances. For example, if agency A transfers authority to you to  			 authorize services for which Agency A will pay, and you are developing an MOU  			 with Provider Agency B, you will want to specify the arrangement for payment of  			 the services to Agency B by Agency A.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b>SAMPLE 1</b>Where (Agency B)  				  furnishes services (of xyz dimension, i.e., describing what A will pay for) and  				  for which charges are made, (Agency B) will bill (Agency A) directly. (Agency  				  A)'s agreement to cover such charges is attached herewith as Appendix A and is  				  a part of this Memorandum of Understanding.</font></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Describe the Referral Process.</b> This description is an  			 appropriate inclusion when client services will be provided by either party. A  			 clearly delineated referral process can save case managers time and will  			 formalize the practice.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b>SAMPLE 1</b>The case management  				  agency will make a telephone call to initiate the referral process. Such  				  telephone contact will be followed by a written service order.</font></div>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b>SAMPLE 2</b>Hospital social workers  				  from Hospital X will refer appropriate clients to the case management agency.  				  Following intake by the case management agency, the hospital social worker will  				  be notified in writing regarding the client's eligibility for case management  				  services. Intake will occur within _____ days of the referral, and notice to  				  the hospital regarding eligibility will occur within _____ days of the  				  assessment.</font></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Describe the Communication Process.</b> As noted in the  			 preceeding paragraph, referral processes can be handled separately in the MOU,  			 particularly if that is the major understanding being negotiated. However, many  			 other forms of communication processes might be the subject of the relationship  			 between the parties. Some examples are regular or timely meetings between  			 agency directors or parties, case conferences between workers, paper flow,  			 correspondence, reports, service orders, and/or the naming of persons involved  			 in the communication process.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b>SAMPLE 1</b>Timely meetings shall  				  be held to review implementation of this agreement, to establish policy  				  directives, and to hold case conferences as appropriate.</font></div>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b>SAMPLE 2</b>Case manager(s) and  				  provider agency workers shall meet biweekly to review special problem cases,  				  coordinate schedules, evaluate closed cases, and assess caseloads. Precise  				  times shall be set by the parties to their mutual convience.</font></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Describe Reporting/Recordkeeping Requirements.</b> These  			 requirements can be handled in general terms in the instrument, but the  			 provider should be fully aware of any reporting or recordkeeping needs for or  			 about case management agency clients. Other reporting might relate to your  			 management needs.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b>SAMPLE 1 </b>_____ and _____ will  				  maintain documentation of service orders and service provision, and other  				  statistical and financial information as needed for accountability and research  				  purposes.</font></div>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b>SAMPLE 2 </b>The parties to this  				  memorandum agree to develop common reporting instruments wherever possible. In  				  any event, they intend to confer on the development of forms or other elements  				  of their respective systems.</font></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Provide for Confidentiality Assurance.</b> Confidentiality  			 assurance can be viewed as an essential practice for the protection of clients'  			 rights when any information is gathered and shared between agencies, and  			 therefore should be included in the MOU instrument.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b>SAMPLE 1</b>(<b>Provider</b>) shall  				  safeguard the use of and access to information regarding individuals or  				  families to which the case management agency is providing or arranging for  				  services. (<b>Provider</b>) shall not use or release any reports, data, or  				  other information except with the approval of such applicant or person served  				  and in accordance with the rules and regulations of _____ and _____, and where  				  applicable, state and federal laws and regulations. Such information shall be  				  used only to assure proper administration, planning, coordination and  				  monitoring of performance under this Agreement, and permit the transfer of  				  client records to another agency for the purpose of continuing services, with  				  appropriate release from the client or the client's guardian, and for research  				  purposes.</font></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>State Whether There Will be an Exchange of Representation on  			 Advisory Boards.</b> Providing opportunities for the other party In the MOU to  			 serve on your Advisory Board or working sub-committees may serve as an  			 incentive for developing closer relationships. Exchange can also be initiated  			 through a joint audit process.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b>SAMPLE 1</b>Whenever possible,  				  there will be representatives of both agencies on Advisory  				  Councils.</font></div>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b>SAMPLE 2</b>Service Audit and  				  Program Review functions will be performed jointly when  				  appropriate.</font></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Describe Publicity Procedures or Requirements.</b> It is  			 advisable to assure that publicity involving both parties be coordinated or  			 cleared. One way to do this is to limit the use of agency names by the  			 respective parties.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b>SAMPLE 1</b>We mutually agree not  				  to use the name of the other in any public information without  				  permission.</font></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Dealing with Problems.</b> Few MOU's are negotiated with the  			 anticipation of problems, however, relationships sometimes change and disputes  			 may arise. It is important to anticipate problems and attempt to structure the  			 MOU negotiation to minimize conflicts. While procedures for resolution need not  			 be specified in the MOU, it is advisable to have strategies in mind which might  			 be employed if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Liability.</b> The MOU is not a legal document. The case  			 management agency assumes liability for its actions and those actions of its  			 employees or representatives. The provider or other party is liable for its  			 actions and the actions of its employees or representatives. No statement  			 regarding liability is necessary in an MOU. However it is advisable to consult  			 an attorney if there are questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Closing.</b> The closing statement finalizes the agreement.  			 Appropriate signatures and dates must be included. Each party retains a signed  			 original.</p>

</ol><h2><a name="chapV" id="chapV">V. MODEL MOU'S</a></h2>
<p> The following MOU's have been developed as models of the three basic  		types of agreements you will most likely need to negotiate. The first is a  		model of an MOU with a provider of services to case management agency clients.  		The second is an MOU with a referring hospital. The third is an MOU specifying  		transfer of nursing home prescreening authority.</p>
<p> These are not necessarily complete MOU's which should be carried to  		provider agencies in your community for negotiation. Completeness will be  		dictated by the issues of concern between your agency and each agency with  		which you negotiate an agreement.</p>
<p> These model MOD's should be helpful to you in devising appropriate  		wording and in selecting areas of probable concern.</p>
