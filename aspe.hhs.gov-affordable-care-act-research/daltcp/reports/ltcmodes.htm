<hr /><h2>AGING IN PLACE: A LONGITUDINAL EXAMPLE </h2>
<p>"Aging in place" is a relatively new phrase that is useful in describing  		the changes in functional status and residential circumstances of cohorts of  		older people over time, and the extent to which various types of residential  		environments permit elders to grow old in familiar surroundings. To date,  		however, even simple descriptive data of this sort for cohorts of older people  		are scarce. The absence of such data may be an underlying factor in the  		presumed failure of a number of community intervention programs designed to  		keep frail elders from moving to nursing homes. </p>
<p>For a number of years, the long-term care policy concerns of federal  		officials have centered around the design of programs to keep frail elders from  		entering nursing homes. The motivation was to slow the growth of the Medicaid  		program, about 40 percent of which is used to pay for nursing home care of the  		elderly.<sup><font><a href="ltcmodes.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup> The most  		ambitious of these experimental efforts was the National Long-Term Care  		Channeling Demonstration<sup><font><a href="ltcmodes.htm#note2">2</a></font></sup> in which access to community-based services  		was facilitated for elders who were impaired in activities of daily living  		(ADL). Financial and regulatory barriers were removed, a self-selected client  		population was served, and services were delivered through a case-management  		control system. The results were disappointing. Similar findings from earlier  		demonstrations<sup><font><a href="ltcmodes.htm#note3">3</a></font></sup>  		underline the need to increase our knowledge of the changes over time in the  		functional capabilities of cohorts of elders residing in the community. </p>
<p>High-risk<sup><font><a href="ltcmodes.htm#note4">4</a></font></sup> elders  		have proved to be difficult to identify. Although many elders have functional  		and health deficiencies, in the study discussed below, we found few who had  		serious unmet needs, and fewer still who entered nursing homes. The majority of  		elders who actively sought care in the community were successful in their  		quest. When institutional placements occurred, they often were transitory.  		Large numbers of impaired elders continued to live in the community for long  		periods of time<sup><font><a href="ltcmodes.htm#note5">5</a></font></sup>. </p>
<p>This chapter discusses a study that suggests a way to develop important  		information about key aspects of the experiences of a cohort of elders as it  		ages in the community. The study examined a sample of elderly people living in  		the community in the state of Massachusetts.<sup><font><a href="ltcmodes.htm#note6">6</a></font></sup> They all were aging in place in a variety of  		residential settings and they drew upon whatever supportive services were  		available to them. The aging in place perspective was not restricted by public  		policy concerns with cost reductions, or by a need to justify the role of the  		public sector in caring for elders in the community, or by a need to study only  		a limited subset of highly-impaired elders<sup><font><a href="ltcmodes.htm#note7">7</a></font></sup>. </p>
<p>The data show that placements in a nursing home are rare and that  		informal care is available to most elders living in the community. We looked at  		the extent to which informal and formal care systems respond to the needs of  		the elderly and measured the consistency in service levels over a four year  		period for a representative cohort of elders. </p>
<p>In the study we relied on descriptive information for a representative  		sample of 2898 elders living in communities in the state of Massachusetts. The  		members of the cohort were 62 years of age and older when first interviewed in  		1982, and were 66 years of age or older at the end of the four year followup  		period in 1986. Baseline characteristics and service use estimates regarding  		the first of the four followup years apply to all elders in the cohort; year  		two and subsequent estimates are limited to cohort members who were alive  		during or at the designated followup period. Our analyses thus center on the  		experience of a cohort of elders, tracking the cohort at distinct points in  		time, with period-specific estimates derived for all cohort members who were  		alive in those periods. </p>
<p>Although the findings are limited to elders from one state, they may be  		indicative of what is occurring in some other industrial states, particularly  		those that have programs that foster in-home care for frail elders. </p>
<p>Findings are disaggregated by type of residential setting: private  		homes, apartments in facilities for the elderly, and private apartments.  		Private homes are defined to include free-standing homes, condominiums, or  		mobile homes, irrespective of the elder's ownership of the dwelling or whether  		the elder is considered the head of the household; private apartments are  		defined to include privately owned two-unit to multi-unit dwellings (as well as  		residential hotels) where the elder, or someone on behalf of the elder, pays  		rent as a condition of residency. </p>
<p>The issues discussed in this chapter include: the distribution of types  		of. elders in the different residential settings; entry into a nursing home;  		return to the community following entry into a nursing home; change in  		community residence; support services received; unmet need status; and  		functional status. The presentation is primarily descriptive, although  		explanatory hypotheses are suggested. </p>
<p>We believe that findings of this type can be useful in laying a  		foundation<sup><font><a href="ltcmodes.htm#note8">8</a></font></sup> upon which  		new long-term care service paradigms can be based. </p>
<h2>LIVING ENVIRONMENTS </h2>
<p>Over three-quarters (78%) of the representative sample of Massachusetts  		elders residing in the community lived in private homes at the time of the  		initial (baseline) survey. The next most prevalent housing setting was private  		apartments (16.2%), followed by residency in housing for the elderly (5.8%).  		</p>
<p>Socio-demographic descriptors of the sample are reported in  		<a href="ltcmodes.htm#table3-1">Table 3-1</a>. The oldest cohort is found in housing for  		the elderly, a quarter of whom are over 80 years old. The age profiles for the  		two remaining housing groups are fairly comparable. Slightly less than half  		were 62-69 years of age, and 20% or less were age 80 or above. Over 70% of  		elders in elderly housing and private apartment settings were female, but only  		55.3% of those living in private homes were female. Eighty five percent of the  		residents in elderly housing were not married at baseline, but only 63.4%  		living in private apartments and 42.2% of those living in private homes were  		unmarried. Similarly, two-thirds of those living in elderly housing reported  		that they lived alone. Following the marital status pattern, the distributions  		of those living alone in the private apartment and private home settings were  		43.8% and 23.2%, respectively. </p>

</tr></table><p>In addition to being older, more predominately female, less likely to be  		currently married, and less likely to live with someone, residents of elderly  		housing were poorer than their counterparts in the other two housing settings.  		Almost a quarter (23.8%) reported an annual household Income below $5,000, and  		only 11.4% reported an income level above $10,000. Elders living in private  		apartments ranked second lowest in income. While 25.5% of this group also  		reported an annual household income below $5,000, 18.7% reported income in  		excess of $10,000. </p>
<p>Those residing in private homes were the most affluent -- only 1 in 10  		reported income below $5,000, while 36.3% reported income above $10,000. </p>
<h2>PLACEMENT OVER TIME </h2>
<p>Two important findings emerge from the data presented in  		<a href="ltcmodes.htm#table3-2">Table 3-2</a> which reports the residential status of the  		sample of elders 24 and 48 months after they were initially interviewed. First,  		the vast majority of elders were still alive and living in the community --  		92.9% at the two year followup, and 83.2% at the four-year followup. If we look  		only at those who were alive at these periods, 98.6% were in the community at  		the end of 24 months, and 97.5% at the end of 48 months. </p>
<p>The second major finding relates to admissions to nursing homes. Only  		3.4% of the original cohort were in a nursing home during the initial 24 month  		period; 8% during the 48 month period. Of those alive at the end of each of  		these periods, only 1.4% were in a nursing home at the end of 24 months, and  		2.5% at the and of 48 months. Thus, for many elders, nursing home placements  		are either transitory or occur at the end of one's life. </p>

</tr></table><p>Among institutionalized elders who were alive at the end of 24 and 48  		months, the number who returned to the community was similar to the number who  		remained in nursing homes: at 24 months, 1.3% of the original cohort were in a  		nursing home and 0.9% had been in a nursing home home at some point during the  		24-month period but had returned to the community by the end of the period. Two  		years later, at 48 months, the pattern is even stronger: 2.1% were in a nursing  		home at the end of month 48, while 2.5% had returned from a nursing home to the  		community. </p>
<p>Of those who died, the risk of institutional placement was considerably  		higher than the overall averages might suggest -- 1 in 5 over the initial two  		year period, and 1 in 4 over the four year period. By the end of month 24, of  		those who had entered a nursing home, 35% had died, 38% were still in a nursing  		home, and 27% had resumed community residency. In 48 months, 43% of those who  		had entered a nursing home had died, 26% were still in a nursing home, and 31%  		had returned to the community. </p>
<p>The use of nursing homes differs only slightly among residents living in  		different settings. At the end of month 24, while one percent of elders from  		private homes were in nursing homes, two percent of elders from the two  		apartment settings were in nursing homes. By the end of month 48, residents of  		both private homes and housing for the elderly shared a lower likelihood of  		nursing home placement (2.1% - 2.5%) than residents in private apartments  		(4.8%). </p>
<p>The likelihood of ever having resided in a nursing home during the four  		year period is highest for elders in the two apartment settings (about 11%) and  		lowest for those in private housing (7.3%). </p>
<p>Of the elders who entered a nursing home during the 48 months, and who  		were alive at the end of that period, those in private homes and housing for  		the elderly (at baseline) had a 57% chance of returning to the community. For  		the elders who had moved to a nursing home from a private apartment, the rate  		of discharge from a nursing home back to the community was somewhat lower --  		44% by the end of month 48. </p>
<p>Of those who died during this period, institutional placement rates were  		lowest for residents in the private home subgroup (22%), compared to those in  		private apartments (25%), and those in housing for the elderly (31%). </p>
<p>Cohort death rated were 5.8% in the initial 24-month period, and 9.3% in  		the second 24-month period for those alive in month 25. This increase is  		attributable both to an aging cohort and the fact that in the second period  		(between 24 and 48 months) a substantial number of the original sample of  		elders had been institutionalized. When identified (at baseline) in 1982, all  		sample members lived in the community. At the beginning of the second two year  		period, 1.4% of elders resided in nursing homes. Over four years, we can see  		the importance of this change in the makeup of the cohort: 42.5% of those who  		were ever in a nursing home had died, while only 12.2% of those who had never  		been in a nursing home had died. </p>
<p>Through 24 months, the death rate was highest for those living in  		elderly housing -- 11.1%. This was almost double the rate for elders in the  		other two settings. By the fourth followup year, the cumulative death rate was  		still highest for those who had resided in elderly housing at baseline (19.0%).  		This difference, however, was due entirely to the differential death rate in  		the initial 24-month period. During the period from month 25 through month 48,  		the elderly housing subgroup who were alive at month 25 had an 8.9% death rate,  		a rate identical to that of elders in private housing (8.9%) and less than that  		of elders in private apartments (12.0%). </p>
<p>Shifts in residential setting since baseline are summarized in  		<a href="ltcmodes.htm#table3-3">Table 3-3</a>, representing the baseline and followup sites  		of residence. Of those living in private homes at baseline, 91.5% were still  		living in private homes at 24 months, and 89.5% at the the 48 month followup.  		Only 1.2% were in a nursing home at 24 months and 2.1% at 48 months. About 6%  		of this cohort were in private apartments at each of the followup intervals and  		1% and 2%, respectively, were in elderly housing. </p>

Among those  		living in private apartments, movement was largely into private homes -- 10%  		through month 24 and 18.3% through month 48. Movement to a private home was  		most often accompanied by residency with others -- at month 48, 53% lived with  		a spouse, 21% lived with a child, 9% lived with some other relative, and only  		17% lived alone. A much lower rate of movement to private homes is noted for  		those in elderly housing at baseline -- 1.4% through month 24, and 3.1% through  		month 48. If a tenant in elderly housing moved, the community alternative was  		almost always a private apartment, and the majority lived alone following the  		move -- at month 48, of those who entered a private apartment, 56% lived alone,  		16% resided with a spouse, and 28% resided with a child. </p>
<p>Of those in elderly housing and private apartments, 2.2% were in nursing  		homes at the end of month 24. By the end of month 48, 2.5% of elderly housing  		tenants and 4.8% of those in private apartments were in nursing homes. </p>
<h2>CHANGES IN FUNCTIONAL STATUS </h2>
<p>The functional status estimates presented in this chapter are based on  		an expanded version of the HRCA Vulnerability Index<sup><font><a href="ltcmodes.htm#note9">9</a></font></sup>. The HRCA Index differentiates  		elders into two groups: the functionally independent and the functionally  		impaired. Impairment is defined as requiring support in at least two areas --  		e.g., meal preparation, housework, taking out the rubbish, dressing, and  		climbing stairs. As used in this chapter, those who are impaired are further  		disaggregated into those with activity of daily living (ADL) and instrumental  		activity of daily living (IADL) dependencies. ADL-dependent elders are those  		who require support with personal care activities, particularly dressing, and  		with medication management. IADL dependent elders do not have ADL deficiencies,  		but do have problems in independently preparing meals, removing rubbish, or  		completing light housework activities. Based on this expanded version of the  		HRCA Vulnerability Index, at baseline 77.8% of elders were functionally  		independent, 17.2% had IADL deficits, and 5% had ADL deficits (<a href="ltcmodes.htm#table3-4">Table 3-4</a>). Those living in private homes were most likely  		to be functionally independent, while those living in housing for the elderly  		were most likely to have IADL and ADL deficits. </p>

At each of the three data collection points, 78% of the cohort members  		were found to be functionally independent. </p>
<p>At baseline, elders in private homes were most independent, while those  		in elderly housing were the most dependent.

<p>Aging in place over the four year period was not accompanied by a rapid  		loss of functional independence for surviving sample members. At the same time,  		concentrating only on the estimate for those with the most severe functional  		problems, there is a tendency in all housing settings for the proportion with  		ADL deficits to increase over time. </p>

In the first two age  		groups (under 75 and 75-79), a higher proportion of those living in elderly  		housing had one or more deficits than those living in private homes (37.1% vs  		13.9%). The same pattern holds true for those age 75-79. For both of those age  		categories, those living in private apartments occupy a midpoint position -- a  		greater proportion have IADL/ADL deficits than their counterparts living in  		private homes, but their rate is less than that of those living in elderly  		housing. However, at the 80 and above age level, the percent with IADL/ADL  		deficits is fairly comparable in all three housing settings. </p>
<p>Fourteen percent of those who were married, and 30.5% of those not  		married, had one or more functional deficits. Sixteen percent of males and  		26.3% of females had such deficits.

A large proportion of the survivors, close to half in  		five of the six cells in the table, display an improvement in functional status  		over the followup periods, while 5.5% or fewer became less functionally  		independent over time. </p>

<h2>ACCESS TO SUPPORT RESOURCES </h2>
<p>Data on the annual amounts of supportive services received by the sample  		of elders was estimated for homemaking, chores, meals, personal care,  		medication management, shopping, and transportation. <a href="ltcmodes.htm#table3-7">Table  		3-7</a> shows home-based care is a pervasive feature in the lives of elders as  		they age in the community. Between 72% and 79% of elders in the three  		residential settings received informal care, levels that are considerably  		higher than the 22% of elders shown to have IADL and/or ADL deficits in  		<a href="ltcmodes.htm#table3-4">Table 3-4</a>. Informal supports are almost always present  		if elders have reduced functional capacities -- 91.2% and 95.8%, respectively,  		of those with IADL and ADL deficits. Even for those without functional  		deficits, however, informal care is the norm -- with almost three-quarters of  		these elders receiving some type of assistance by family and/or friends.

In the 12-month  		period following assessment of those elders who received informal care, the  		majority were assisted with shopping (ranging from 73% for the independent to  		93% for the ADL impaired) and transportation (ranging from 55% to 76%). Among  		these recipients of informal care, assistance with meals and housework was  		received by one-quarter of functionally independent elders, a little less than  		half of IADL impaired elders, and about three quarters of ADL impaired elders.  		Informal assistance with personal care was generally limited to those who  		exhibited ADL impairments and was received by 4% of independent elders  		receiving informal care, 11% of the IADL impaired, and 64% of the ADL impaired.  		</p>
<p>Significantly fewer elders made use of formal support services in the  		community -- about 40% overall, ranging from 35% of those who are functionally  		independent to 54% of those with IADL and/or ADL deficits. To some extent, the  		use of formal services by those who were functionally independent represents a  		private market or life style choice by elders and their families. At the same  		time, it also reflects the fact that some of those who were independent at  		baseline experience transitory or permanent changes in need status during the  		intervening time period (see <a href="ltcmodes.htm#table3-6">Table 3-6</a>). For example,  		of those who were independent at both baseline and at the two year followup,  		about 33% made use of formal services; of those who became IADL dependent,  		about 44% used formal services; and of those who moved from independent to ADL  		dependent, about 53% used formal services. </p>
<p>On average, recipients of formal care in the community were assisted  		with 1.8 activities -- ranging from 1.6 activities for those who were  		functionally independent to 2.3 and 2.9 respectively for those with IADL and  		ADL impairments. In the 12-month period following assessment, there was no  		service area in which a majority of elders receiving help obtained that help  		from a formal source. The two most prevalent areas of support were meals and  		transportation in which 38% and 33% respectively of the recipients of formal  		care were assisted. Little difference in receipt patterns across the functional  		subgroups was noted. In addition to these two services, 17% of functionally  		independent recipients of formal care received help with housework and personal  		care, while less than 10% received help with shopping and medication  		management. For IADL and ADL impaired recipients of formal care, approximately  		40% received formal help with housework and transportation, while 25% of the  		IADL impaired and 47% of the ADL impaired received help with personal care.  		Finally, formal assistance with medication management was largely localized to  		those who were ADL impaired: it averaged 3% of the independent, 12% of the  		IADL-impaired, and 35% of the ADL-impaired. </p>
<p>Differences exist in the usage estimates in the three housing settings.  		While 74% of independent elders in private homes and private apartments  		received informal care, only 61% of independent elders in housing for the  		elderly received such care. Elderly housing tenants who are functionally  		independent appear to be less likely to be able to rely on friends and  		relatives for support in the every day activities of life. This  		housing-associated difference in access to informal care was not observed for  		elders with ADL impairments; for those elders, the difference was not in the  		receipt of care, but rather in a reduction in the number of areas in which  		informal care was provided. </p>
<p>Inter-residential patterns of access to formal community services are  		more complex. Tenants residing in housing for the elderly were most likely to  		access formal support systems. For those who were functionally independent, 59%  		received formal care, while for those who were functionally impaired, slightly  		over 75% received formal care. </p>
<p>For elders in private homes and apartments, use of formal care was less  		than that observed in elderly housing except for those in private apartments  		who had ADL deficits. In the latter case, the rates were about the same. In  		addition, for ADL dependent elders in both apartment settings (elderly and  		private), although not displayed in <a href="ltcmodes.htm#table3-7">Table 3-7</a>, the  		percent using home-based formal care decreased over time going from 87.4% to  		66.4% over the four-year interval for tenants in elderly housing, and from  		74.8% to 63.0% for tenants in private apartments. Although we have not explored  		the reasons for these shifts, we note that this decreasing utilization pattern  		begins to bring these elders into closer proximity with the considerably lower  		usage experience of ADL-dependent elders residing in private homes. In  		addition, as indicated in <a href="ltcmodes.htm#table3-2">Table 3-2</a>, a higher  		proportion of tenants in the two apartment subgroups spent time in a nursing  		home (thereby reducing their need for home-based formal care). </p>
<p>Of those living in private homes, formal usage levels mirror the values  		for the total sample. In contrast to those in apartments, ADL-dependent elders  		living in private homes were considerably less likely to make use of formal  		support services in the home. Elders in private homes were shown to be much  		more likely to reside with a spouse (see <a href="ltcmodes.htm#table3-1">Table 3-1</a>),  		and this undoubtedly played a large part in this unique helping pattern. Such  		people may simply be less likely to require supports beyond those provided by  		family. When elderly individuals in private homes have a need for ADL support,  		there appears to be a greater likelihood that it can be provided informally. In  		addition, for the subgroups of elders in private homes who were functionally  		independent or had IADL deficits, the percent using home-based formal care  		increased over time -- rising from 19.1% in the first year to 32.4% in the  		fourth year for those who were functionally independent; and from 46.2% to  		62.1% for those who had IADL deficits. </p>
<p>In assessing the use of formal services in Massachusetts it is important  		to consider the extent to which the State's widespread case-managed home care  		system is involved in the care provision process. Under the Massachusetts  		program, state funds are used to provide homemaking, chore, transportation, and  		other home based services to approximately 4% of elders in the state. This  		pattern represents a relatively unique commitment by a state to the provision  		of community-based long-term care services. Our data suggest that significant  		numbers of impaired elders, particularly those in apartment settings (both in  		private apartments and in elderly housing), are reached by this program.  		Approximately 70% of ADL-dependent elders and 50% of IADL-dependent elders who  		received formal services were Home Care Corporation clients. For  		functionally-impaired elders residing in private homes, approximately 44% of  		ADL-dependent and 23% of IADL-dependent formal service users were Home Care  		clients. At the other extreme, for functionally independent (some of whom will  		have deteriorated over time) users of formal services, home care participation  		was at a much lower level -- 5% for those in private homes, 7% for those in  		private apartments, and 14% for those in elderly housing. </p>
<h2>SERVICES USED </h2>
<p><a href="ltcmodes.htm#table3-8">Table 3-8</a> contains estimates of the annual hours  		of informal and formal care, based on average utilization values, provided to  		sample residents during four one-year periods. Systematic trends representing  		either increasing or decreasing levels of care are noted in the table. The  		initial, and in many ways most important finding, was the absence of  		significant shifts over this four-year period in informal and formal  		utilization levels for the total group of elders in the cohort. On average,  		community elders who were alive in any study year received 101 hours of  		informal care and 26 hours of formal care representing four hours of informal  		care for every hour of formal care. These findings suggest a system in  		equilibrium. They are consistent with our earlier finding of longitudinal  		stability in the estimated proportion of functionally independent elders (see  		<a href="ltcmodes.htm#table3-4">Table 3-4</a>), and fit within a model of oscillating  		capabilities -- some elders die and some deteriorate, but others improve, and  		the net effect of these changes for a given cohort is longitudinal stability in  		estimated risk levels and utilization profiles. </p>

</tr></table><p>At the same time, there were inter-residential differences in informal  		utilization levels. Informal care was least intensive for tenants in housing  		for the elderly -- averaging 55 hours per year or about one-half the average  		for elders in private homes and private apartments. These inter-residential  		differences were consistent over time, and there was no indication that  		informal support levels were changing for the cohort as a whole, nor that  		elders in one setting were more or less likely to experience shifts in the  		intensity of informal care available to them. As would be expected, informal  		supports increased with disability status, with tenants in elderly housing  		receiving the lowest level of care at each level of disability. Highest  		informal care levels were found for elders with ADL deficits who lived in  		private apartments and private homes: they averaged 280 hours of care per-year,  		or a little more than three-quarters of an hour per day. In addition, for  		elders who were independent at baseline, we observed an increase in informal  		support levels over time. This occurred because of these people became slightly  		more functionally dependent -- increasing from an average of 73.8 hours of care  		in the first year to 85.6 hours in the fourth year. </p>
<p>For functionally independent tenants in housing for the elderly, the  		annual averages rose from 34.8 hours in the first year to 47.6 hours in the  		fourth year, while for functionally independent elders in private apartment,  		there was no systematic pattern of increasing informal hours of care over time.  		</p>
<p>Finally, for elders who were functionally (ADL) impaired at baseline, a  		different pattern of longitudinal shifts in average cohort utilization values  		occurred. For the high-level users who resided in private homes and private  		apartments, utilization went down over time from 345.5 hours to 252.3 hours in  		the four-year period for those in private homes; and from 313.8 hours to 223.5  		hours for those in private apartments. To some extent these changes reflect the  		death or institutional placement of the most disabled of these cases. In  		addition, some experienced improvement, that is, they became more functionally  		independent. For ADL dependent elders in housing for the elderly at baseline,  		the pattern over time is much different. The average hours of care in the first  		followup year for this cohort was only about 40% of the level observed for ADL  		dependent elders in the other two settings. More importantly, their average  		hours of care increased over time -- rising from 134.7 hours (on average) in  		year one to 151.8 hours in year four. By year 4, their average hours of  		informal care had increased to about 63% of the level observed for ADL  		dependent elders in the other two settings. It appears that informal supporters  		are less responsive if the elder resides in an elderly housing site, although  		there is some indication (at least for those who are functionally independent  		or have ADL deficits, although not for those with IADL deficits) that the level  		of these supports can increase over time. </p>
<p>Formal care levels were also found to differ by residential setting.  		Unlike the preceding findings, formal care is most intensive for tenants in  		housing for the elderly -- averaging 53 hours per year, or about equal to the  		level of informal care received by these tenants. This level of care is twice  		that received by elders in private homes and one and one-half times the level  		received by elders in a private apartment. As would be expected, formal support  		levels increase with disability status -- averaging 19 hours per year for those  		who are functionally independent, 49 hours for those with IADL deficits, and 67  		hours for those with ADL deficits. </p>
<p>Three remaining findings are worthy of special note. First, universally  		lower levels of formal care were observed for elders in private homes who do  		not have ADL deficiencies. Second, the average level of formal care for  		ADL-dependent adults who continue to live decreased over time (dropping from an  		average of 77.2 hours in the first year to 56.4 hours in the fourth year).  		Third, ADL-dependent elders in housing for the elderly have average utilization  		levels that far exceed those of ADL dependent elders in other residential  		settings. </p>
<h2>UNMET NEEDS </h2>
<p>The unmet need estimates summarize subjective judgments of whether  		additional supports required with homemaking, chores, meals, personal care,  		medication management, shopping, and transportation. To be scored as having an  		unmet need, a respondent must report the need for additional support in a  		service area in which he/she had some level of functional restriction (no  		matter how minor). As indicated in <a href="ltcmodes.htm#table3-9">Table 3-9</a>, unmet  		needs for elders in Massachusetts were not a pervasive factor in the lives of  		most elders -- only 5% of elders reported that they had unmet needs. Although  		not shown in the table, the needs reported are seldom viewed by the respondents  		to be of major significance. In addition, very few elders required additional  		support in more than two areas, and most who require such supports had a need  		in only one area. </p>

</tr></table><p>Unmet need levels were higher for elders with IADL and ADL deficits --  		13.7% and 17.1% respectively. But even here, approximately five out of every  		six impaired elders believed that they were receiving sufficient support  		services. Finally, while there is some fluctuation across residential settings,  		the basic shape of the distributions and relative levels of unmet need were not  		dramatically different. </p>
<h2>DISCUSSION </h2>
<p>There is very little published information on the types of changes to be  		expected as elders age in the community. This study provides data that suggest  		the importance of conducting this kind of research throughout the country. The  		population of elders in the community is diverse, and it is diversity that must  		be studied. Elders age in different types of residential settings, and although  		the importance of adequate housing for maintaining elders in the community has  		been pointed out by some researchers<sup><font><a href="ltcmodes.htm#note10">10</a></font></sup>, it has not received as much attention as,  		for example, have the large number of community-based case-management programs  		evaluated under Federal sponsorship. For long-term care professionals, housing  		has been of secondary interest, often characterized as simply the opposite of  		institutional residency without further differentiation. By focusing on the  		concept of aging in place we can begin to remedy this oversite. We therefore  		examined longitudinal data for subgroup cohorts of elders in three distinct  		types of housing, and provided descriptive information on residential mobility,  		death, functional status, institutional placement, and service utilization.  		</p>
<p>The data have made it possible to highlight a series of key factors that  		must be recognized in planning long-term care services for the frail elderly in  		this country. We have found that residential mobility patterns differ for  		elders who live in the three types of settings studied. Institutional  		placements were shown to be relatively rare, and many who entered a nursing  		home subsequently returned to the community. Informal support was found to be  		available to most elders. Helping patterns begin prior to functional decline,  		escalate with increasing disability, and achieve different levels of intensity  		in the three types of housing studied. Formal care also was found to be a  		factor in the lives of large numbers of elders living in the community.  		Moreover, the use of some formal care does not require that the elder first  		become impaired. Its spread for those in apartments was shown to be related to  		the presence of a statewide program of case-managed home care services. </p>
<p>In presenting these data, we hope to highlight the need for new service  		paradigms. There is much to be gained by finding out what is happening in the  		community and providing descriptive information that can be used for more  		effective organization of services. We recognize that, despite the fact that  		the data cover four years, the lessons to be learned are limited to information  		from a single time period (1982 to 1986) and from a single state  		(Massachusetts). We believe it would be useful to both states and the federal  		government to replicate this type of study in many other places in the country.  		A single national survey will not provide the information needed for realistic  		planning on the local or statewide level. Local issues of particular importance  		relate to factors such as residential density, the distribution of minority and  		disadvantaged populations, the rate of in- and out-migration, the extent of  		state or local support for community-based service systems, and local  		variations in the access or use of third party insurance. Because long-term  		care is so related to systems of informal care as well as to local variations  		in community and institutional service availability, we recommend that  		replications be completed for populations in different states with the overall  		effort coordinated at the national level. </p>
