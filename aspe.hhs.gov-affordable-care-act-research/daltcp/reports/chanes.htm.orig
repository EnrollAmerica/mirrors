<hr /><p>In September 1980 the National Long Term Care Demonstration--known as  		channeling--was initiated by three units of the United States Department of  		Health and Human Services--the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning  		and Evaluation (ASPE), the Administration on Aging (AOA), and the Health Care  		Financing Administration (HCFA). It was to be a rigorous test of comprehensive  		case management of community care as a way to contain the rapidly increasing  		costs of long term care for the impaired elderly while providing adequate care  		to those in need.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>A. THE INTERVENTION</h2>
<p>Channeling was designed to use comprehensive case management to allocate  		community services appropriately to the frail elderly in need of long term  		care. The specific goal was to enable elderly persons, whenever appropriate, to  		stay in their own homes rather than entering nursing homes. Channeling financed  		direct community services, to a lesser or greater degree according to the  		channeling model, but always as part of a comprehensive plan for care in the  		community. It had no direct control over medical or nursing home  		expenditures.</p>
<p>Channeling was implemented to work through local channeling projects.  		The core of the intervention--i.e., case management--consisted of seven  		features:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Outreach</b> to identify and attract potential clients who were  			 at high risk of entering a long term care institution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Standardized eligibility screening</b> to determine whether an  			 applicant met the following preestablished criteria: (a) <i>Age</i>--had to be  			 65 years or older. (b) <i>Functional Disability</i>--had to have two moderate  			 disabilities in performing activities of daily living (ADL), or three severe  			 impairments in ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living  			 (IADL), or two severe IADL impairments and one severe ADL disability. Cognitive  			 or behavioral difficulties affecting ability to perform ADL could count as one  			 of the severe IADL impairments. (c) <i>Unmet Needs</i>: had to have an unmet  			 need (expected to last for at least six months) for two or more services or an  			 informal support system in danger of collapse. (d) <i>Residence</i>: had to be  			 living in the community or (if institutionalized) certified as likely to be  			 discharged within three months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Comprehensive inperson assessment</b> to identify individual  			 client problems, resources, and service needs in preparation for developing a  			 care plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Initial care planning</b> to specify the types and amounts of  			 care required to meet the identified needs of clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Service arrangement</b> to implement the care plan through  			 provision of both formal and informal in-home and community services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Ongoing monitoring</b> to assure that services were appropriately  			 delivered and continued to meet client needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Periodic reassessment</b> to adjust care plans to changing client  			 needs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Two models of channeling were tested. The <i>basic case management  		model</i> relied primarily on the core features. The channeling project assumed  		responsibility for helping clients gain access to needed services and for  		coordinating the services of multiple providers. This model provided a small  		amount of additional funding to purchase direct services to fill in gaps in  		existing programs. But it relied primarily on what was already available in  		each community, thus testing the premise that the major difficulties in the  		current system were problems of information and coordination which could be  		largely solved by client-centered case management.</p>
<p>The <i>financial control model</i> differed from the basic model in  		several ways:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>It expanded service coverage to include a broad range of community  			 services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It established a funds pool to ensure that services could be  			 allocated on the basis of need and appropriateness rather than on the  			 eligibility requirements of specific categorical programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It empowered case managers to authorize the amount, duration, and  			 scope of services paid out of the funds pool, making them accountable for the  			 full package of community services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It imposed two limits on expenditures from the funds pool. First,  			 for the entire caseload <i>average</i> estimated expenditures under care plans  			 could not exceed 60 percent of the average nursing home rate in the area.  			 Second, for an <i>individual</i> client estimated care plan expenditures could  			 not exceed 85 percent of that rate without special approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It required clients to share in the cost of services if their income  			 exceeded 200 percent of the state's Supplemental Security Income (SSI)  			 eligibility level plus the food stamp bonus amount.</p>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h2>B. THE DEMONSTRATION AND EVALUATION</h2>
<p>In September of 1980, the participating states, a technical assistance  		contractor, and a national evaluation contractor were awarded contracts and  		began planning channeling. Among the criteria used for selection among states  		that competed to be part of channeling were demonstrated interest and  		commitment at the state level; capacity to perform the basic case management  		functions; whether channeling would represent a change from the existing  		system; and general quality of the proposal. A local project in each state was  		then selected. The host agencies of these projects were well established as  		departments within existing human service organizations (typically area  		agencies on aging or private nonprofit service providers).</p>
<p>Initial plans had called for four different models of channeling to be  		tested in 23 sites, selected through two procurements. Federal cutbacks reduced  		the models to two and the number of sites to 10 making it necessary to select  		from among 10 already chosen 5 that would implement the financial control  		model. Selection of financial control sites was based on perceived capacity of  		the projects to implement the more complex financial model, combined with  		judgments about the existence in the remaining sites of real differences  		between the basic model and the existing service system. Both considerations  		led to assigning the financial control model to the richer service  		environments.</p>
<p>The 10 sites participating in the demonstration and their model  		designations were:</p>
<table border="BORDER"><tr align="CENTER" valign="TOP" bgcolor="#004080"><td><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Basic Case Management</b></font></td>
<td><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Financial Control Model</b></font></td>
</tr><tr><td>Baltimore, Maryland</td>
<td>Cleveland, Ohio</td>

<td>Greater Lynn, Massachusetts</td>
</tr><tr><td>Houston, Texas</td>
<td>Miami, Florida</td>
</tr><tr><td>Middlesex County, New Jersey</td>
<td>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</td>
</tr><tr><td>Southern Maine</td>
<td>Rensselaer County, New York</td>
</tr></table><p>The 10 local projects opened their doors to clients between February and  		June of 1982, and were fully operational through June of 1984. The projects  		were phased out of the federal program in March of 1985, although most  		continued to operated under state or other agencies.</p>
<p>The goal of the evaluation, in addition to documenting the  		implementation of channeling, was to identify its effect on:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Use of formal health and long term care services, particularly  			 hospital, nursing home, and community services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public and private expenditures for health services and long term  			 care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual outcomes including mortality, physical functioning, unmet  			 service need, and social/psychological well-being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caregiving by family and friends, including the amount of care  			 provided, the amount of financial support provided, and caregiver stress,  			 satisfaction, and well-being.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To compare channeling's outcomes with what would have happened in the  		absence of channeling, the evaluation relied on an experimental design. Elderly  		persons referred to each channeling project were interviewed (most by  		telephone) to determine their eligibility for channeling. If found eligible,  		they were randomly assigned either to a treatment group whose members had the  		opportunity to participate in channeling or to a control group whose members  		did not receive demonstration services but continued to rely on whatever  		services were otherwise available in their community. Over the life of the  		demonstration (which included the period after the end of randomization for the  		research) 11,769 applicants were screened, 9,890 of whom were determined  		eligible. In all 6,341 persons were randomly assigned. Given the substantial  		death rate among this population as well as interview noncompletion, this  		yielded research samples of 3,372 to 6,326 elderly persons, depending on the  		analysis.</p>
<p>Several data sources were used. In addition to the telephone screening  		interviews, an extensive in-person survey was administered to the elderly  		members of the research sample (both treatment and control groups) at baseline  		and 6, 12, and (for half the sample) 18 months thereafter. Another survey was  		administered (usually by telephone) to the primary informal caregivers of a  		subset of the sample members at baseline, and 6 and 12 months thereafter.  		Service use and cost data were collected from Medicare, Medicaid, and  		channeling records, and from providers directly; participant tracking data and  		project cost records were collected from the channeling projects; official  		death records were obtained from state agencies. Finally, federal, state,  		local, and project staff were interviewed about the implementation and  		operation of the demonstration.</p>
<p>The basic methodology was to measure differences between treatment and  		control groups in the average levels of the variables for which effects were  		expected. Multiple regression was used to estimate the averages because it  		controls for different distributions of treatment and control groups across  		sites and to some extent for different patterns of attrition. It also takes  		account of variation due to factors other than channeling, thus yielding more  		precise estimates. In addition to analyzing the effects by model, we examine  		effects disaggregated by site and by subgroups of the sample. There were few  		instances of significant differences in effects across models, sites, or  		subgroups.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>C. FINDINGS ON IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
<p><b>Channeling's selection criteria did identify an extremely frail  		group</b>. Consistent with the eligibility criteria, clients reported major  		limitations in functioning--with over 22 percent unable to perform any of five  		common activities of daily living (ADL) (eating, transfer, toileting, dressing,  		bathing), 53 percent incontinent, and 81 percent restricted in their mobility.  		There was also overwhelming dependence in instrumental activities of daily  		living (IADL), for example, meal preparation (88 percent), shopping (96  		percent), housekeeping (97 percent), and a high number of unmet needs  		(averaging almost 4 out of 8 possible needs). Mental functioning was also  		limited; channeling sample members missed on average 3 to 4 items of a 10-item  		mental status questionnaire. Fifty-two percent reported incomes below $500 per  		month (which includes spouse income where applicable). Over one-third of the  		sample lived alone, although more than 90 percent reported receiving some  		informal care. Most (87 percent) had experienced a major stressful life event  		during the previous year. The average age of the channeling sample at baseline  		was 80 years. Nearly half reported a hospital admission in the 2-month period  		prior to channeling, and about three-fifths were already receiving in-home  		care.</p>
<p><b>The program elements were implemented largely as designed</b>. Case  		managers successfully coordinated delivery of a broad range of services to  		those in the community. An in-person structured assessment, taking 75 minutes  		to complete, served the important clinical function of providing the basis for  		care planning as well as the research function of providing baseline data for  		the evaluation. Assessments were completed on all clients. Then a formalized  		care plan, which included both informal and formal services, was completed for  		each client and reviewed by a supervisor.</p>
<p>Case managers under the financial model reported being able to purchase  		services under the funds pool in all the specified service categories generally  		without constraint, although supply shortages limited the ordering of some  		services (e.g., homemaker services) in some sites. Case managers under the  		basic model, consistent with design, relied primarily on a brokering approach  		to arrange services. They reported having great freedom to use the gap filling  		funds as needed. These funds were (as intended) a small fraction of the funds  		available to case managers under the financial model.</p>
<p>The cost controls of the financial control model were also implemented  		according to plan. They did not prove to be as binding a constraint as had been  		expected. Estimated care plan costs in the five projects ranged from 30 to 47  		percent of the cost of a nursing home in the site--well below the average  		expenditure cap of 60 percent. However, case managers did report that the  		requirement of calculating costs and comparing them to the limit, and the  		ability to trade off expenditures among clients did increase their  		cost-consciousness.</p>
<p>Because the incomes of the vast majority of clients fell below the  		cost-sharing level and because key services were exempt from cost-sharing, only  		about 5 percent of clients shared in the costs of their care. Even so, case  		managers under both models felt that cost-sharing contributions increased both  		client and family interest in the care and their willingness to notify the case  		managers in instances of inadequate care.</p>
<p>Ongoing case management, including regular monitoring and formalized  		reassessment and care plan adjustment, was implemented successfully. Telephone  		contacts to monitor changes in clients' situations occurred in a majority of  		cases very frequently, in-person visits less frequently. Reassessments and care  		plan revisions occurred at 6-month intervals for the majority of clients. The  		initial requirement that the first reassessment occur at 3 months was relaxed,  		partly because of high work loads but partly because case managers were in  		frequent contact with clients during that period in any case.</p>
<p>Although implementation across sites was remarkably uniform,  		implementation differed across models in ways which, though the differences  		were not large, could potentially influence the effects of the case management  		component. Total staff resources were approximately the same for the two  		models, but case managers under the basic model were able to spend a greater  		proportion of their time on direct client functions. This was probably due to  		the extra responsibilities under the financial model of ordering direct  		services and associated paperwork. Taken together the differences suggest that  		the basic model case managers may have provided more reassurance and personal  		support for clients and their informal caregivers than their counterparts under  		the financial model.</p>
<p><b>The technical evaluation design was implemented successfully</b>. The  		large sample sizes made it unlikely that important channeling effects either  		went undetected or were seriously overestimated. The data collected on sample  		members provided measures of all the central outcomes of interest. In any  		evaluation, and particularly in one of channeling's scale and complexity,  		qualifications and uncertainties inevitably surround some of the results.  		Extensive methodological research, however, substantially reduces the risk that  		the basic conclusions of the channeling evaluation are subject to uncertainty  		due to sample attrition, estimation methodology, data noncomparability, or  		other technical matters.</p>
<p><b>The demonstration did not evaluate the effects of community care per  		se</b>. <b>Rather, it evaluated the effects of adding comprehensive case  		management and expanded community services to a system that already provided a  		substantial amount of community care</b>. Not only was service-based case  		management already available in the channeling sites; a limited amount of case  		management like channeling's in its comprehensiveness was also available. Ten  		to twenty percent of the control group received such comprehensive case  		management, more in financial than in basic sites. Receipt of direct community  		services was substantial also; 60-69 percent of controls received in-home care  		visits in the week six months after randomization, with the proportion  		receiving and the number of visits received being substantially greater in  		financial sites.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>D. CHANNELING'S EFFECTS ON SERVICE USE AND COST</h2>
<p>Service use and cost results are summarized in <a href="#TABLE1">Table  		1</a>.</p>
<p><b>Channeling increased formal community service use</b>. Community  		service use increased, not because of the substitution of community for nursing  		home care, but because of increased use among those in the community. The bulk  		of these services was in-home care from visiting service providers. Personal  		care and homemaker services--reported by practitioners to be the most difficult  		types of services to obtain in sufficient quantity under the existing  		system--increased the most. Community service increases were modest under the  		basic case management model (about half a visit a week over a control group  		average of 2.2 visits). They were substantial under the financial control model  		(more than 2 visits a week over a control group average of 2.8 visits). This  		difference is consistent with the models' different capacities to pay for  		community services.</p>
<p><b>Neither model had a major effect on informal caregiving, although the  		financial control model led to small reductions in some areas</b>. Most of the  		informal care received was from caregivers who lived with the sample member.  		The proportion of those caregivers giving care was not affected by either  		channeling model. The basic case management model did not affect the amount of  		care given by visiting family and friends either. Both treatment and control  		group members were receiving about three visits a week from visiting caregivers  		at the end of the first year. Under the financial control model treatment group  		members were receiving about two and a half visits a week at the end of the  		first year, compared to about three for control group members. Although this  		difference in visits was not statistically significant, the reduction in the  		proportion receiving such visits was significant under the financial control  		model. In particular, the proportion receiving help from friends and neighbors  		was significantly reduced under the financial model. The areas where small  		reductions were observed were the proportions receiving help with  		housework/laundry/ shopping, help with meal preparation, delivery of prepared  		meals, and transportation.</p>
<p><b>Despite success in targeting an extremely frail population,  		channeling did not identify a population at high risk of nursing home  		placement, and did not substantially reduce nursing home use</b>. At 12 months,  		13 percent of control group members in the basic sites and 14 percent in the  		financial sites were in a nursing home. This was much lower than expected,  		given the channeling eligibility criteria. Even by 18 months (not shown) only  		19 percent of surviving control group members were in a nursing home. Nursing  		home use was lower among the treatment than the control group under both models  		at 12 months but the differences were small and not significant.</p>
<p><b>The channeling population was frequently hospitalized and made heavy  		use of physicians and other medical services</b>. Channeling did not affect  		these types of service use. Use of hospitals was considerable--45 to 46 percent  		of the control group had a hospital admission during the first six months after  		enrollment. During the first year of channeling the control group in the basic  		sites spent 19.8 days in the hospital and 26.8 days in the financial sites.  		Hospital use by the treatment group was virtually the same--19.2 days and 25.6  		days, respectively--and the differences were not significant. Other medical  		service use (not shown) was also high. In the basic sites, 71 percent of  		members of the control group visited a physician during months 7-12 and in the  		financial sites 81 percent did so. Use of outpatient, x-ray, and laboratory  		services among control group members was also high--60-65 percent per 6-month  		period in the basic sites, 73-77 percent per 6-month period in the financial  		sites. There was no evidence that channeling had an effect on physician or  		other medical service use.</p>
<p><b>The costs of expanding case management and community services were  		not offset by reductions in nursing home or other costs</b>. Channeling  		increased the costs of case management and direct service use by design. Since  		it had little effect on nursing home use and none on hospital, physician, or  		other medical service use, the cost increases were not offset by cost decreases  		in other areas. In the basic sites, control group costs (including all service  		and room and board costs) averaged about $1,330 per month alive. Channeling  		resulted in a net increase in these costs of $83 (6 percent). In the financial  		sites, control group costs averaged about $1,592 per month alive. Channeling  		resulted in a net increase in these costs of $287 (18 percent). The cost burden  		was redistributed by channeling. Government costs increased by about 14 percent  		under the basic model, 28 percent under the financial model. Costs to clients  		and their families were reduced by about 7 percent under both models.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>E. CHANNELING'S EFFECTS ON WELL-BEING, FUNCTIONING, AND MORTALITY</h2>
<p>Channeling effects on well-being, functioning, and mortality are  		summarized in <a href="#TABLE2">Table 2</a>.</p>
<p><b>Channeling reduced unmet needs, increased clients' confidence in  		receipt of care, and increased their satisfaction with life</b>. At the end of  		the first year the control group averaged one unmet need (out of a maximum of  		four). Both models of channeling reduced the number of unmet needs by 0.2  		(equivalent to removing an unmet need for one out of five sample members). Both  		models of channeling increased the percentage expressing confidence that they  		would get needed care (increases of 8-9 percentage points over a control group  		average of just over 70 percent) and reported satisfaction with service  		arrangements. Both models also increased satisfaction with life generally, with  		the financial control model having the stronger effect (5.5 percentage points  		over a control group average of 56.3 percent). Channeling did not affect a  		number of other measures of quality of life for clients (including morale,  		social interactions, self-perceived health, and contentment).</p>
<p><b>Channeling increased informal caregivers' satisfaction with service  		arrangements and satisfaction with life</b>. The majority of primary caregivers  		of the channeling client population expressed positive feelings about care  		arrangements and about their own life satisfaction. In the basic sites, for  		example, 76.8 percent of primary caregivers of control group members said they  		were confident about care arrangements; in the financial sites 71.8 percent  		said they were. Channeling increased these high percentages to 83.2 and 91.1  		percent, respectively, with the financial control difference being  		statistically significant. With respect to primary caregivers' satisfaction  		with life, in the basic sites 75.3 percent of primary caregivers of control  		group members expressed satisfaction, in the financial sites 59.0 percent. Here  		again channeling increased these percentages (to 79.2 and 67.8 percent,  		respectively) with the financial control difference being statistically  		significant. Channeling did not affect perceived emotional, physical, and  		financial strain due to caregiving, employment, or limitations on employment or  		personal activities.</p>
<p><b>Channeling did not affect measures of client functioning, with the  		possible exception of physical functioning under the financial model</b>. The  		basic model did not affect ADL or any other measure of functioning. The  		financial model did not affect the number of days restricted to bed or the  		ability to perform IADL. However, the treatment group reported performing fewer  		personal care (ADL) tasks than the control group (2.3 tasks out of 5 versus  		2.5)--a small, but statistically significant difference. Significantly lower  		levels of functioning were also reported on some individual ADL items. This  		could reflect a real change in functioning. But it could also be an artifact of  		measurement; perhaps treatment group members reported doing less simply because  		of the high level of assistance provided. These possibilities cannot be  		disentangled with the available data.</p>
<p><b>The channeling population was at high risk of dying</b>.  		<b>Channeling did not affect mortality</b>. At the end of the first year, 29.7  		percent of the control group members in the basic sites had died, 27.4 percent  		in the financial sites. By the end of the demonstration these rates had risen  		to 39 percent and 33 percent, respectively (not shown). Channeling did not  		significantly affect mortality.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>F. CONFIDENCE IN THE RESULTS OF CHANNELING AS FIELDED</h2>
<p>Inevitable uncertainty surrounds some results in any evaluation of this  		kind. However, there is, in our judgment, little doubt about the basic  		conclusions concerning the channeling demonstration as fielded. Three pieces of  		evidence increase our confidence in the results.</p>
<p>First, the results were generally consistent across the sites in which  		each model was tested, making it unlikely that effects in one or two sites  		dominated the results, or that there were significant offsetting results in  		different sites.</p>
<p>Second, changes of any plausible magnitude in the channeling results  		would not alter the basic conclusions about costs. A rough comparison or the  		costs of community and institutional care illustrates the point. Because the  		channeling population's risk of institutionalization was so low, the trade-off  		between cost in a nursing home and cost in the community <i>plus</i> channeling  		services indicates that the basic model would have had to reduce average  		nursing home use to less than half actual control group use just to break even.  		The financial control model, given its larger increases in community care,  		could not have broken even at all, because the required reduction in nursing  		home use would have exceeded total control group use.</p>
<p>Third, the channeling results are consistent with those of other  		community care demonstrations, which generally found (with one important  		exception discussed below) relatively low risk of nursing home use among the  		populations served, and insufficient nursing home cost savings to offset the  		increased costs of expanded case management and community services.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>G. GENERALIZABILITY</h2>
<p>The findings and conclusions reported here are, of course, for  		channeling as fielded in the ten demonstration sites in 1982-1984. Determining  		whether the results are generalizable to other interventions, populations, or  		environments is difficult for any demonstration, and channeling is no  		exception. Assessment of these issues to the extent possible will, however,  		assist users of the research in making judgments about its applicability to  		their particular situation.</p>
<p><b>The intervention</b>. Success of the demonstration makes it clear  		that the channeling intervention itself could be successfully replicated in  		other settings as a permanent program. Indeed, the demonstration's documented  		experience in case management, provider relations, and cost controls is a  		useful guide for practice in replication of channeling or in other case  		management programs.</p>
<p>The demonstration tested two models of a particular approach to long  		term care--comprehensive case management combined (in the financial control  		model) with expanded community services and cost controls. Thus, the  		demonstration cannot speak to the effectiveness of case management within other  		approaches (such as a social/health maintenance organization, mandatory  		preadmission screening, or vouchers).</p>
<p><b>The population served</b>. Channeling was tested with the particular  		population who applied to channeling. Because of the voluntary nature of  		application, the population may have been a selected subset of the eligible  		population who had more needs related to an acute care episode and were more  		likely to be connected with the existing community care system. The channeling  		population turned out to have relatively low risk of institutionalization  		despite state of the art screening criteria and assessment techniques. Since  		channeling was designed there has been no new research suggesting alternative  		screening instruments for community care populations that appear substantially  		better able to separate those who will go into nursing homes from those who  		will stay in the community.</p>
<p>The one evaluation that used a randomized design and came to a different  		conclusion about the substitution of community for institutional care is of  		special interest in this regard. The South Carolina Long Term Care Project  		served a slightly more disabled population with high nursing home use among the  		control group (48 percent of the controls were institutionalized after 12  		months). The reduction in nursing home use was substantial (40 days during the  		first year after enrollment--a 31 percent reduction). The South Carolina  		project differed from channeling and most of the other community care  		demonstrations in that it was integrated with the state's nursing home  		preadmission screen from which it received all its clients. Whether because of  		this or some other reason, it was able to reduce nursing home use and break  		even on (but not reduce) costs.</p>
<p><b>Environment</b>. Whether the demonstration sites were similar to the  		nation with respect to the difficulty of admission to a nursing home and the  		availability of community services is particularly important to interpreting  		the results. If nursing home beds were in shorter supply and community services  		more available in the demonstration sites than in the nation, channeling would  		have been less able to affect institutionalization rates than if it had been  		fielded elsewhere. Available evidence suggests that nursing home beds may have  		been somewhat less available than in the nation as a whole, but that severe  		shortages were probably not a major factor affecting channeling's outcomes for  		a majority of clients.</p>
<p>Data on the availability of community care are even more limited.  		Channeling sites were similar to the nation with respect to the proportion of  		states covering optional services under Medicaid and to home health  		expenditures under Medicare and Medicaid. No data on community care under other  		programs such as state home care programs are available. Given that the  		demonstration projects applied to participate in the demonstration through a  		competitive process, however, the case management and community care systems in  		the selected sites may have been more developed than in sites that did not  		apply or were not selected.</p>
<p><b>Conclusions</b>. It is clear that channeling tested the effect of  		adding comprehensive case management and expanded community care to service  		systems that already provided such services to some of the frail elderly. It  		was not an evaluation of community care compared to its total absence. Its  		population, which voluntarily applied to the demonstration, was extremely frail  		and had unmet service needs but turned out to be not at high risk of nursing  		home placement. Substantial reductions in nursing home use were not possible  		given that only a relatively small portion of the population would have used  		nursing homes even without channeling.</p>
<p>The channeling evidence indicates that expansion of case management and  		community services beyond what already exists does not lead to overall cost  		savings. But it does yield benefits in the form of increased in-home care,  		reduced unmet need, and improved satisfaction with life for clients and the  		informal caregivers who bear most of the care burden. Whether these benefits  		are commensurate with its costs is a decision for society to make.</p>
