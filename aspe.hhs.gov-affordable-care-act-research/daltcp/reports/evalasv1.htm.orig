<p> MAXIMUS wishes to acknowledge the assistance and support of Mr. William  		Prosser and Ms. Sharon McGroder of the Office of Social Services Policy, Office  		of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, in the development and  		implementation of this project. Mr. Prosser and Ms. McGroder were instrumental  		in providing direction and guidance in this project's information gathering and  		synthesis tasks. In addition, we thank the members of the Interagency Work  		Group for their assistance during the project.</p>
<p> We could not have completed this evaluability assessment without the  		cooperation of the staff in the selected states and the Head Start grantees,  		who provided descriptions of current and planned activities in the areas of  		work-welfare programs, child care approaches, and Head Start linkages to child  		care and work-welfare.</p>
<p> We also wish to acknowledge the assistance of other federal staff,  		Congressional staff, and advocates from leading child care organizations who  		shared their time and expertise in our identification of states and grantees,  		and definition of the issues to be addressed. These individuals contributed to  		this effort with their knowledge of welfare reform and child care legislative  		proposals, work-welfare activities in the various states, and innovative Head  		Start approaches.</p>
<h2><a name="execsum" id="execsum">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p> This report presents the results of an evaluability assessment of child  		care options for work-welfare programs. The project examined current  		work-welfare programs in selected states across the country and explored the  		evaluative issues regarding the role of child care in these programs.</p>
<p> This exploratory study was funded by the Office of Social Services  		Policy, Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) under a task  		order contract to:</p>
<ul><li>identify the relationship of child care practices, issues, and  		  barriers to welfare reform and work-welfare programs in selected states;  		  and</li>
<li>explore the linkages between Head Start programs and child care to  		  supplement services to low income and AFDC families.</li>
</ul><p> A review of current legislative proposals, discussions with federal and  		Congressional staff knowledgeable about work-welfare programs and welfare  		reform activities across the country, advocates for improved child care  		services, and examinations of child care support in several states, helped us  		identify the best practices, issues, and barriers in the states regarding the  		role of child care in work-welfare programs. Additionally, we talked with a  		number of Head Start grantees to determine the extent that Head Start could  		supplement child care services for work-welfare participants. Finally, we  		attempted to identify issues and directions for further study. The resulting  		topics may provide additional insight into the policy responses that may be  		required at state and federal levels regarding child care and welfare  		reform.</p>
<p> The study was grounded in the growing concern of federal and state  		staff, and advocates that the provision of adequate child care has become a  		critical factor in the states' and local jurisdictions' abilities to implement  		education, training, and employment programs for parents of low income families  		receiving public assistance. While, in general, mothers receiving AFDC have  		been exempt from participating in work-welfare programs if they have children  		under the age of six, these exemptions may not continue.</p>
<p> The federal government and many of the states have begun to take a look  		at lowering the minimum age for mandatory participation in work-welfare  		programs. This short-term evaluation attempted to obtain descriptive  		information on approaches employed by a select number of states to provide  		child care services for work-welfare participants, as well as looking briefly  		at the operations and funding configurations of innovative Head Start programs  		as one option to supplement child care services for low income parents.</p>
<h3>A. Examination of Selected States with Work-Welfare  		Programs</h3>
<p> To address the first objective of this study, current child care  		practices of selected states with work-welfare programs were examined. We  		looked specifically at the requirements of the programs in terms of  		participation and exemptions, support services available, and funding and other  		regulations associated with child care within the work-welfare environment. We  		also looked at states' perceptions concerning the potential impact of the  		federal legislative proposals on their current practices and resources needed  		to meet any new requirements.</p>
<p> In the first part of the information gathering tasks discussions were  		held with staff from nineteen states having some level of work-welfare  		activity, whether state supported work programs WIN Demonstrations, or other  		federally supported work programs. The following states were included.</p>
<ul><li>Arizona</li>
<li>Arkansas</li>
<li>California</li>
<li>Colorado</li>
<li>Florida</li>
<li>Georgia</li>
<li>Illinois</li>
<li>Iowa</li>
<li>Maryland</li>
<li>Massachusetts</li>
<li>Michigan</li>
<li>Minnesota</li>
<li>Nebraska</li>
<li>New Jersey</li>
<li>New York</li>
<li>Oklahoma</li>
<li>Oregon</li>
<li>Texas</li>
<li>Washington</li>
</ul><p>Eight state among these nineteen states have federal waivers to mandate  		participation of mothers with children under the age of six.</p>
<p> The nineteen states in this study provided a broad range of  		work-welfare programs, including comprehensive state programs, WIN  		Demonstrations, and basic WIN, CWEP and JTPA work programs. Within this broad  		work-welfare environment, the states also presented a wide variety of examples  		of child care approaches and options to support participants.</p>
<p> Half of the states have initiated special child care programs for  		work-welfare participants that are operated and funded separately from the  		general child care programs. Characteristic of these programs was the  		flexibility of participants to chose from a wide range of child care  		approaches: licensed/regulated or non-regulated care, center-based, family day  		care homes, or in-home care. Child care by relatives was a frequent arrangement  		note.</p>
<p> The remaining states provided child care for work-welfare participants  		through the general child care program primarily funded through a combination  		of state, SSBG, and other federal funding sources. In many states, child care  		is restricted to licensed/regulated facilities and child care by relatives is  		non-reimbursable. However, several of these states either had exemptions to  		licensed care or utilized funds not restricted to licensed care as a way of  		providing more flexible child care arrangements to work-welfare  		participants.</p>
<p> Transition assistance was considered by most states as a service  		critical to successfully moving welfare recipients into unsubsidized  		employment. All but one state currently provides transition assistance; however  		the benefits and periods of assistance vary greatly.</p>
<p> In examining the states' perceptions of the potential impact of the  		child care requirements contained in the federal legislative proposals under  		consideration, we were not surprised by the responses, particularly in the  		areas of mandated participation of mothers with children three and under, and  		regulated care. All agreed that any federally mandated changes would require  		significant fiscal and programmatic modifications to current child care  		components. These modifications translated into the need for additional funding  		and staff resources to develop new child care providers and to monitor for  		compliance.</p>
<h3>B. Head Start as a Supplement to Child Care</h3>
<p> The second part of the information gathering activity focused on  		discussions with 21 Head Start grantees operating full-day programs, which  		supplement the child care services required by low-income working parents  		participating in the program. These grantees offered a wide range of methods to  		meet the child care needs of low income families, including:</p>
<ul><li>providing full-day services to children and their families through  		  center-based care, family day care homes, or a combination of center-based and  		  family day care homes, and</li>
<li>brokering or coordinating full-day services for clients within the  		  community.</li>
</ul><p>The grantees also employed a number of funding approaches to support the  		full-day services:</p>
<ul><li>funding wholly by Head Start,</li>
<li>Title XX or State only funding, and</li>
<li>a combination of Head Start and Title XX/State funds.</li>
</ul><p> Three of the grantees have participated in the planning of work-welfare  		programs in their counties. Their experience offers insight into issues  		concerning the provision of child care services to participants.</p>
<h3>C. Directions for Further Investigation</h3>
<p> The results of this evaluability assessment suggest that several areas  		require further investigation. The short-term nature of this study did not  		allow for extensive exploration of all the issues, nor have states had  		sufficient experience with certain services or approaches to provide definitive  		results. Examples of possible topics for further research include the  		following.</p>
<ul><li>Investigation of the involvement of the child care community in  		  planning for work-welfare implementation and the effect on resource  		  availability and development.</li>
<li>Exploration of the impact of transition assistance on participants'  		  abilities to successfully move into unsubsidized employment and off public  		  assistance.</li>
<li>Investigation of the maximum rates for various types of care  		  allowable by states compared with the rate ceilings established in the federal  		  legislative proposals.</li>
<li>Investigation of an expanded sample of Head Start programs to  		  determine the effort required to extend programs to serve work-welfare  		  participants.</li>
</ul><p> <a href="evalasv2.htm">Volume II</a> of this report provides summaries  		of the discussions with the states and grantees participating in the study.</p>
<h2><a name="chapI" id="chapI">I. INTRODUCTION AND STUDY APPROACH</a></h2>
<p> This report presents the results of <strong>An Evaluability Assessment  		of Child Care Options for Work-Welfare Programs</strong>. The project examined  		current work-welfare programs in selected states across the country and  		explored the evaluative issues regarding the role of child care in these  		programs.</p>
<p> The purpose of the study, which was performed under a task order  		contract to MAXIMUS from the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation,  		Department of Health and Human Services, was two-fold:</p>
<ul><li>to identify the relationship of child care practices, issues, and  		  barriers to welfare reform and work-welfare programs in selected states;  		  and</li>
<li>to explore the linkages between Head Start programs and child care to  		  supplement services to low income and AFDC families.</li>
</ul><p> In the following sections of this chapter we provide background  		information and a discussion of the approach used to access information related  		to both study objectives.</p>
<h3>A. Background to the Study</h3>
<p> While the ongoing policy debates about welfare reform and recent  		legislative and advocacy activity regarding child care contributed to the  		framework for this study, the project focused very specifically on child care  		as a support service to work-welfare programs. We did not, in the course of  		this project, address the broader issues of welfare reform. These have been the  		topic of numerous research and demonstration studies and reports; however, a  		review of much of that material was necessary to place the evaluability  		assessment in the proper context.</p>
<p> The provision of adequate child care is becoming a prominent national  		issue. With more than 65 percent of the workforce in this country composed of  		working mothers, the availability of adequate and affordable child care is of  		concern to parents, employers, advocates, and federal, state and local  		governments. This is particularly true for working mothers with children under  		the age of six.</p>
<p> As more parents in low income families receive public assistance are  		required to participate in education, training, or employment programs, the  		availability of child care becomes more critical. In the past, mothers  		receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), have been exempt from  		participating in work-welfare programs if they have children under the age of  		six; however, these exemptions may not continue.</p>
<p> During the past five to six years, the states and the federal  		government have begun to take a new look at linking welfare to work, paying  		particular attention to the participation of mothers with young children.  		Several states have inaugurated work-welfare programs that encourage voluntary  		participation of mothers with young children. other states, through federal  		waivers to the AFDC regulations, have actually lowered the age for exemption.  		Eight states have received federal waivers to require mothers with children  		under the age of six to register with WIN, thus making them mandatory work  		program participants. These states are:</p>
<ul><li>Arizona,</li>
<li>Arkansas,</li>
<li>Colorado,</li>
<li>Florida,</li>
<li>Michigan,</li>
<li>Nebraska,</li>
<li>Oklahoma, and</li>
<li>Oregon.</li>
</ul><p> Three of these states lowered the age for exemption to three years;  		another state reduced the age to two years. Three other states lowered the age  		for exemption to six months. One state requires participation of mothers  		beginning at birth of a child. While these states lowered the age of exemption,  		insufficient funds and supply of child care proved to be a barrier to the  		participation of some clients to whom these waivers were targeted.</p>
<h4>1. Federal Legislative Proposals</h4>
<p> With the introduction of recent federal welfare reform legislation, it  		is expected that more states may decide to require AFDC mothers of young  		children to participate in education, training, or employment programs. In this  		past year, three legislative proposals were sponsored in Congress, each of  		which lowered the age of exemption to three years or below.</p>
<ul><li>The Family Welfare Reform Act (H.R. 1720),</li>
<li>H.R. 3200, and</li>
<li>The Family Security Act (S. 1511).</li>
</ul><p> These proposals also included requirements for the provision of child  		care with specific references to standards for child care, funding options, and  		transition services. <a href="#exhibitI.1">Exhibit I-1</a> provides a  		comparison of the key child care features of these three proposals and the age  		of child for mandatory participation by parents in work-welfare programs.</p>
<p> The two major House and Senate welfare reform proposals, the Family  		Welfare Reform Act (H.R. 1720) passed by the House in December 1987 and the  		Family Security Act (S. 1511) currently under consideration by the Senate,  		target parents with children age three for mandatory participation. H.R. 3200,  		the House Republicans' proposal, reduced the age minimum to six months. Given  		the proposed reduced minimum age requirements, the availability of child care  		becomes a critical factor for parents who must participate in work-welfare  		programs.</p>
<p> In terms of paying for child care, S. 1511 and H.R. 3200 proposed no  		changes from the current policy of a maximum of $160 per child per month. The  		Family Welfare Reform Act (H.R. 1720) includes not only an increase in the  		maximum monthly rate of $175 per child (over age two), but also a special  		maximum rate of $200 per month for children under the age of two.</p>
<p> Transitional child care services are key features in each of the  		proposals, although the transition period varies. H.R. 1720 requires states to  		provide at least 12 months of child care assistance to parents obtaining  		unsubsidized employment, provided the family income is below 150% of the  		federal poverty level. H.R. 3200 included transitional services for families  		with incomes less than 150% of the federal poverty level and, S. 1511 provides  		for nine months of transitional service. All three proposals included family  		co-payment through the establishment of sliding fee scales.</p>

</ul></td>
</tr></table><p> At issue in all three proposals is setting standards for care. Under  		current policy, parents are given a wide range of child care options from which  		to choose. All three of the above proposals are more restrictive in that some  		level of regulated care is required for reimbursement. H.R. 3200 requires that  		states take steps to insure that child care services meet acceptable standards  		of health and safety. S. 1511 is more specific in that it restricts  		reimbursement for child care on y if the care meets applicable standards of  		state and local law. H.R. 1720, while requiring compliance with applicable  		state and local standards, also requires child care for more than two children  		to meet standards set by the state that ensure basic health and safety  		protection. This bill also prohibits states from reducing the current level of  		child care standards.</p>
<h4>2. Child Care Legislative Proposals</h4>
<p> At the same time that standards for subsidized care in work-welfare are  		being considered, broader issues of "quality care", licensed care, and  		federally subsidized child care exist. Child care is a major initiative in  		Congress. Four child care bills were introduced in 1987:</p>
<ul><li>H.R. 3660, The Act for better Child Care Services of 1987 (ABC  		  Bill),</li>
<li>S. 1885 (companion bill of H.R. 2660)</li>
<li>H.R. 1572, The Child Care Act of 1987, and</li>
<li>S. 1678, The Child Care Services Improvement Act of 1987.</li>
</ul><p> All of these bills require more stringent state and/or federal  		licensing standards, and provide for major federal appropriations to implement  		the various features of the bills. Noting the existence of this broader child  		care initiative is important in this discussion to acknowledge potential  		conflict between the current proposals for work-welfare programs and the  		proposed child care reforms. The child care proposals are far more costly to  		implement in comparison to the resources set aside for child care in the  		welfare reform proposals. However, this is a separate issue from this  		evaluability assessment, a topic perhaps for future study.</p>
<p> It is generally recognized that there will be changes in the current  		work-welfare proposals. If either is to be passed by Congress, it is also  		understood that any changes in current policy regarding the participation in  		work-welfare programs of mothers with children under the age of six can be  		expected to have major impact on the child care community. The impact of the  		policy changes will be readily seen in the availability of adequate and  		affordable care. More low income mothers will need care for their young  		children now. Given the proposed legislation, the need will be for more  		full-time and part-time care in regulated situations, rather than a few hours  		which may have been provided by informal arrangements.</p>
<p> To address the objectives of this study, current practices of selected  		states with work-welfare programs were examined. We looked specifically at the  		requirements of the programs in terms of participation and exemptions, the  		support services available, and the funding and regulations associated with  		these services. We also looked at perceptions of the states regarding the  		potential impact of the proposed legislation on their current practices in  		meeting the new requirements.</p>
<p> To supplement this information, the study also looked at a select  		number of Head Start programs to explore full-day care offered by Head Start  		grantees, which may supplement local child care offerings for low income  		families.</p>
<p> In the following the section, we provide a brief description of the  		approach used to address these objectives.</p>
<h3>B. Approach</h3>
<p> The exploration of the issues associated with the objectives of this  		project was undertaken in two phases. First, the project staff focused on  		identification of data sources and discussions with knowledgeable individuals  		at the national level about the design of current child care projects for  		low-income families, including Head Start programs, and the issues relating to  		child care and work-welfare. The second phase focused on information gathering  		from selected states and programs, including telephone discussions with key  		staff from the states, and a review of pertinent documents supplied by the  		states.</p>
<h4>1. Phase I: Key Informant Discussions</h4>
<p> In the first phase, project staff held discussions with individuals in  		the Washington area who are knowledgeable about welfare reform including  		demonstration and/or innovative programs, proposed legislation, and general  		concerns and issues. The informants included staff of advocacy and public  		interest organizations, federal agencies, and staff of Congressional  		subcommittees representing such agencies and organizations as:</p>
<ul><li>Administration for Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) - with  		  information on Head Start and child care;</li>
<li>Family Support Administration (FSA)- with information on AFDC, WIN,  		  waiver projects, and work-welfare;</li>
<li>ASPE staff - information on policy and proposed legislative issues  		  regarding welfare reform and child care;</li>
<li>advocate and public interest groups, including
<ul><li>Children's Defense Fund,</li>
<li>Child Welfare League of America,</li>
<li>National Association of Counties, and </li>
<li>American Public Welfare Association.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families - information on  		  proposed legislation and testimony on welfare reform and child care.</li>
</ul><p> These discussions resulted in a list of specific states and local  		jurisdictions with work-welfare programs or demonstration projects and Head  		Start grantees with innovative programs. In addition, project staff gained a  		much clearer perspective of the historical development of the welfare reform  		movement; the legislative proposals on welfare reform; and the issues, concerns  		and perceptions of advocate and public interest groups, as well as the federal  		agencies, regarding the role of child care in welfare reform.</p>
<p> Given the current pressures on the child care community to meet the  		growing demand for support to working parents, most informants expressed  		concerns about the adequacy and availability of child care for AFDC parents  		entering work-welfare programs. A particular issue concerning adequacy was the  		question of "quality" child care, and whether or not adequate resources  		(specifically funding) would be available to ensure that participants with  		young children would have access to appropriate types of care. While this  		project did not attempt to address the definition or the issue of "quality"  		child care, it does mention the level of licensing requirements and child care  		standards included in the states' work-welfare child care components.</p>
<h4>2. Phase II: Agency-Specific Information  		Gathering</h4>
<p> The second phase of the project's information gathering task took the  		form of indepth, unstructured telephone discussions with work-welfare and child  		care staff in selected states and local jurisdictions and Head Start programs  		to gather agency-specific information on current practices and issues.</p>
<p> Discussion guides, developed to assist project staff in formulating  		questions, were used to obtain specific information. A copy of the discussion  		guides are included in the appendix of this report.</p>
<p> Questions about work-related child care issues focused on the  		following.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Background and Experience with Work-Welfare  			 Programs</strong>. Descriptions of current or planned work-welfare programs and  			 the dimensions of these programs were sought. This included  			 experimental/demonstration status of programs, related policy and legislation,  			 and participation requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Child Care Components</strong>. The types of care, adequacy  			 of current resources, flexibility of care available, and applicable standards  			 or requirements were addressed. Mechanisms for funding, payments, and arranging  			 for child care were also discussed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>General Child Care Program</strong>. A discussion of the  			 general child care program was included to determine the relationship between  			 that program and the work-welfare child care needs. This discussion addressed  			 such questions as priorities/requirements for care, services available and  			 types of children served, funding, licensing requirements, and other  			 descriptive information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact of Proposed Legislation</strong>. The perceptions of  			 the impact of proposed federal legislation were sought regarding the states'  			 reaction to mandated participation of mothers with children under six years of  			 age, the impact of "regulated" child care in terms of the availability and  			 affordability for program participants, and funding alternatives.</p>
</li>
</ul><p> The framework for discussion about full day-care offered by Head Start  		programs for low income and AFDC families included the following.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Description of Program</strong>. General descriptions of the  			 Head Start programs were requested to help identify ways in which the programs  			 serve working mothers. Included in this discussion was information on the  			 number of families served, selection criteria for children served, ages of  			 children served, and siblings in the family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Funding Sources</strong>. Head Start staff were asked to  			 identify funding sources for the program, some history regarding joint funding  			 and the co-mingling of funds. We were particularly interested in problems  			 experienced by grantees related to eligibility, families served, audit, and  			 costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Issues with Program Operation</strong>. Project staff probed  			 to gain a perspective of the concerns of Head Start programs regarding full-day  			 operations, criteria used to select families, funding alternatives, and issues  			 related to serving working parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coordination with AFDC</strong>. Of particular relevance to  			 this project is the identification of Head Start's coordination/cooperation  			 with AFDC programs related to supplementing child care needs of working parents  			 and work-welfare participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expansion</strong>. Program expansion plans were sought to  			 determine program innovations, and programs receptivity and interest in serving  			 the working parents.</p>
</li>
</ul><p> In the following two chapters, we present case studies of the states  		and Head Start programs in this study. We include a synthesis of the findings  		and issues that resulted from this evaluability assessment.</p>
<h2><a name="chapII" id="chapII">II. SYNTHESIS OF CHILD CARE OPTIONS FOR WORK-WELFARE  		PROGRAMS</a></h2>
<p> In this chapter, we present a synthesis of the information obtained  		from discussions with public agency work-welfare and child care staff in  		selected states. From those discussions we gathered information concerning:</p>
<ul><li>the work-welfare programs in the states;</li>
<li>the child care options supporting those programs;</li>
<li>the general child care programs operating if different from options  		  supporting the programs; and</li>
<li>implications of the federal legislative proposals on the states.</li>
</ul><p> We attempted to identify the special work-welfare/child care  		initiatives, current practices, issues and barriers. Concurrently, we were  		interested in concerns or ideas that would initiate further study.</p>
<h3>A. Selected States</h3>
<p> Discussions were held with representatives from nineteen states having  		some level of work-welfare activity. These states were selected from a list  		generated from the earlier discussions with key informants and federal staff.  		In an attempt to obtain a representative sample, we selected a range of states  		from different geographic areas of the country, with fairly equal mix of  		rural-urban populations, and having established or comprehensive work-welfare  		programs or some combination of work programs.</p>
<p>	<a href="#exhibitII.1">Exhibit II-1</a> graphically illustrates the  		geographic distribution of the nineteen states listed below which were selected  		for this study.</p>
<ul><li>Arizona</li>
<li>Arkansas</li>
<li>California</li>
<li>Colorado</li>
<li>Florida</li>
<li>Georgia</li>
<li>Illinois</li>
<li>Iowa</li>
<li>Maryland</li>
<li>Massachusetts</li>
<li>Michigan</li>
<li>Minnesota</li>
<li>Nebraska</li>
<li>New Jersey</li>
<li>New York</li>
<li>Oklahoma</li>
<li>Oregon</li>
<li>Texas</li>
<li>Washington</li>
</ul><p> Also included in this selection are the eight states with federal  		waivers to operate a WIN demonstration or work-welfare program with mandated  		participation of AFDC recipients with children less than six years of age. Five  		of the eight states mandated participation of mothers with children three years  		and older - Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Nebraska, and Oregon. Two states,  		Colorado (Weld County) and Michigan, reduced the mandatory participation age to  		six months. The other state, Oklahoma requires work-welfare participation as  		soon as the child is born.</p>

<h3>B. Summary of Key Features</h3>
<p> As noted in <a href="#chapI">Chapter I</a>, an informal discussion  		guide was used to frame the questions to the state contacts. Questions were  		categorized under program features or components which we believed were  		important for this evaluability assessment and would provide a broad  		understanding of the work-welfare practices, supporting services, and issues in  		the selected states.</p>
<p> Detailed information was provided on current/planned work-welfare  		programs, participation, child care services (including special components and  		provision under general child care programs), funding, impact of proposed  		federal legislation, and coordination activities with Head Start. This last  		area was added to the framework to ascertain if there were existing  		relationships between Head Start and state/local work-welfare programs.</p>

</tr></table><p> The states in this study provided a broad range of work-welfare  		programs, including comprehensive state programs; WIN Demonstrations; and basic  		WIN, CWEP, and JTPA work programs. Within this broad work-welfare environment,  		the states also presented a wide variety of examples of child care approaches  		and options to support participants in work-welfare programs.  		<a href="#exhibitII.2">Exhibit II-2</a> presents an overview and a quick look  		at participation requirements and child care support in each state.</p>
<p> Within the different work-welfare environments, states vary in minimum  		age limits of children for mandated participation and support for child care  		services. Half of the states included in this project have initiated special  		child care programs, accompanied by substantial commitments of funds. It is in  		these states where support for welfare reform is most evident through state  		legislation and special initiatives of the Governor and agency heads.</p>
<p> Equally interesting are the states that rely on the resources of the  		general child care program to support work-welfare participants. Many of these  		states have been creative in the use of exemptions and funding sources to  		provide flexibility in child care resources to meet the needs of the  		participants.</p>
<p> In the following sections we present highlights of the findings and  		general perceptions from our discussions with state staff.</p>
<h4>1. Work-Welfare Program Participation</h4>
<p> Mandated participation of parents with children under the age of six is  		one of the key current issues in welfare reform. For this reason we included  		the eight states with federal waivers to operate programs mandating  		participation of parents with children younger than six years. Of the eight  		states, five lowered the mandatory participation to parents with children three  		years and older, two states reduced the age to six months, and one state,  		Oklahoma, to birth.</p>
<p> In the other states, we noticed voluntary lowering of the age minimum  		for participation of parents with younger children. New Jersey's REACH program  		requires that parents with the youngest child two years or over must  		participate in education, job training, or employment programs. Washington  		State's new FIP program, while voluntary for the first two years of operation,  		will implement mandatory participation for parents with children age three and  		over, as well as single parents with children six months and older who have  		been on public assistance for at least two years.</p>
<p> Of the remaining states which follow the six year old limit, there is a  		heavy emphasis on encouraging parents with younger children to participate  		voluntarily. Massachusetts has experienced a significant increase in the number  		of mothers with young children voluntarily participating.</p>
<p> Minnesota, Illinois, and New Jersey specifically target young parents  		(under the age of 21) through special projects. One of the priority groups for  		Minnesota's PATHS is the caretaker (parents) under the age of 21. In addition,  		Minnesota recently revised its statute regarding provision of social services  		to minor parents and their infants. This law specifies that a report be sent to  		the county social services agency by the hospital where a birth has occurred to  		a teenage parents. Social Services agencies are required to respond to the "72  		Hour Report of a Birth to a Minor" by contacting that minor mother, determining  		whether the minor mother has a plan for herself and her infant covering  		specified areas in the legislation, developing a plan if there is not one, or  		taking appropriate steps if the minor mother refuses to plan or does not follow  		through on an agreed upon plan.</p>
<p> Illinois and New Jersey have demonstration projects which target  		education, training, employment, and support services to pregnant teens and  		teenage parents who are AFDC recipients. Florida is seeking an additional  		waiver that would require a teenaged mother to remain in school in order to  		continue receiving an AFDC check. Other states acknowledged the establishment  		of informal priorities on young parents because of the degree of success  		associated with that group.</p>
<h4>2. Care Available</h4>
<p><a href="#exhibitII.3"> Exhibit II-3</a> shows the types of child care  		available to work-welfare participants and the use of regulated and  		non-regulated care. In all of the states, participants are offered center-based  		and family day care. In several, in-home and relative care is allowed,  		particularly in those states which do not require regulated care.</p>
<p> Only about half of the states actually require licensed/regulated care  		for reimbursement. It is interesting to note that about 75 percent of the  		states with special components or funding for child care (noted in  		<a href="#exhibitII.2">Exhibit II-2</a>) allow the use of unregulated care.</p>
<p> In states that rely upon the general child care program, the issue of  		licensed/regulated care was much more pronounced. All but one of these states  		reported that reimbursement for child care was restricted to licensed/regulated  		providers only. However, at least two of these states use Title IV-A to pay for  		child care for work-welfare participants and as a way of by-passing the  		licensing restrictions.</p>
<p> Of the states with special child care components, two require  		licensed/regulated care for reimbursement. However, each of these has some  		exemption which allows the use of unregulated care, whether it is relative or  		family day care. Minnesota's licensing laws exempt family day care homes with  		children in care from only one additional family. Massachusetts Voucher Program  		includes Independent Family Day Care homes which are not part of larger Family  		Day Care Systems managed by Vendor Management Agencies. These providers, which  		are usually relatives or friends, are developed in response to a special need  		or lack of care, particularly in rural areas. They must only register with the  		Vendor Management Agencies to receive payment. New Jersey will pay 50 percent  		of the approved rate for unregulated relative care.</p>
<p> Some difficulty is anticipated for participants using relative care who  		move into unsubsidized employment and into general child care programs. There  		are at least four states in our study that will not allow the use of relatives  		for reimbursed care.</p>
<p> Lack of available and accessible licensed/regulated care is the major  		reason most states agree to exemption for lack of child care. Nine states make  		provisions for this exemption, many states frequently use it. Only California  		and Colorado (Weld County) reported that no exemptions had been requested  		because of lack of child care. Nebraska and Oregon specifically exclude lack of  		child care as an exemption, although they allow other WIN exemptions.</p>

<p> The true success of the work-welfare programs can only be measured by  		the number of participants who are able to move into unsubsidized employment  		and off public assistance. Many of the programs included in this discussion are  		too new to determine any level of success at this time, and the role of child  		care in this success. To assist participants in moving into unsubsidized  		employment, fourteen states reported active transition assistance programs,  		although the variation in time periods and approaches is great. One state,  		Iowa, currently without transition assistance, has legislation pending to  		provide this service.</p>
<p> Four states, Georgia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Washington, have  		transition provisions of 12 months, and a fifth, Iowa, moving to 12 months. A  		few states will continue services indefinitely if a slot in the general child  		care program is unavailable. Arkansas, Minnesota, and Oklahoma will provide  		services indefinitely, depending on a family's income and a sliding fee  		formula. <a href="#exhibitII.4">Exhibit II-4</a> summarizes the characteristics  		of child care transition services available to participants.</p>

</tr></table><p> Most of the states with transition provisions make use of a sliding fee  		scale to determine co-payment levels for the transition period before  		participants move into the general child care programs. A major concern noted  		by many of the states is the lack of available resources in the general  		programs. States are working now to ensure that these participants are placed  		high on the priority list for child care in the general programs.</p>
<h4>4. Funding Sources and Payment  		Mechanisms</h4>
<p> States use a variety of federal, state, and local funding sources to  		pay for child care for work-welfare participants. These sources, which are  		depicted in <a href="#exhibitII.5">Exhibit II-5</a>, include:</p>
<ul><li>State funds,</li>
<li>local or county funds,</li>
<li>SSBG (Social Security Block Grant - Title XX),</li>
<li>AFDC (IV-A),</li>
<li>WIN, and</li>
<li>JTPA.</li>
</ul><p> Combinations of state, AFDC, and WIN funds appear to be the most common  		approach to funding work-welfare related child care services. Two states,  		Massachusetts and New Jersey, reported exclusive use of state funds for their  		child care programs. However, New Jersey expects to expand the funding base  		beyond state funds after the first year of the program.</p>
<p> Seven states reported the use of SSBG funds for child care, but  		Oklahoma limits these funds to transition child care. Only Texas relies on SSBG  		funds as the single source of child care funding.</p>
<p> Of those states which require licensed/regulated facilities, and depend  		on the general child care program to support the work-welfare program, a few  		indicated that AFDC funds are used at times to "get around" the licensing  		requirement and to pay for unregulated care (particularly relative care).</p>

</tr></table><p> Payment mechanisms vary as widely as funding sources. The most  		prominent method of reimbursement, as shown in <a href="#exhibitII.6">Exhibit  		II-6</a>, is through contract provider payments or provider direct payments.  		All but four states use this method exclusively or in combination with other  		payment mechanisms.</p>
<p> Only five states, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Washington,  		allow for reimbursement directly to the recipient. Illinois and Minnesota limit  		this method because of the difficulty in monitoring follow-up payment to the  		provider. As a way of ensuring provider payment through the recipient, three of  		the states, Illinois, California, and Oregon employ dual party payment, with  		the recipient and provider names on the reimbursement check. Oregon is  		currently piloting a version of this method, know as Vendor Payments.</p>
<p> Four states are either using vouchers or piloting vouchers as a  		mechanism for payment. In most voucher programs, clients are given a form that  		establishes their eligibility for subsidized child care and the maximum  		reimbursement for care. Clients are also provided a list of approved providers  		from which they can select the child care arrangement most appropriate for  		their situation. The voucher serves as a contract document between the client,  		the provider, and the funding agency.</p>

</tr></table><p> The Massachusetts Voucher Day Care Program which uses vouchers  		exclusively as the payment mechanisms for work-welfare participants child care  		needs. New Jersey has proposed vouchers as the single payment mechanism as  		well. New York is currently piloting vouchers in two counties, and California  		provides counties with the option of using vouchers.</p>
<p> Nine states reported the use of family copayment to supplement child  		care reimbursement, particularly in the transition assistance programs. This  		copayment is based on a sliding fee scale.</p>
<h3>C. Potential Impact of Proposed Federal Legislation</h3>
<p> A logical follow up to the discussions with the states on current  		work-welfare practices is an examination of their perceptions of the potential  		impact on their state of the federal legislative proposals under consideration,  		specifically the mandatory participation and child care components of these  		proposals. In general, the responses were very similar and quite expected.</p>
<p> Without knowing the final form that welfare reform might eventually  		take, states were not able to identify specific consequences for their systems.  		However, all agreed that any federally mandated changes would require  		significant fiscal and programmatic modifications to the current child care  		components.</p>
<p> Our discussions with state staff focused primarily on the issues of  		lowering mandated participation to mothers with children three years and older  		and those with children six months and older, as well as the requirement for  		some level of regulated care. To the issue of lowering the mandated age  		minimum, most of the waiver states did not anticipate any major problems,  		particularly with a minimum age of three. Difficulty would come with a minimum  		age of six months because of existing shortages in infant and toddler care and  		lack of resources to meet special needs such as part-time, after hours, and  		week-end care.</p>
<p> As expected, states with voluntary participation of mothers with  		children under the age of six voiced major concerns about resource  		availability. Each state expects the need for additional federal funding for  		resource development to support implementation of a lower mandated age minimum  		to rise.</p>
<p> The strongest concerns came in response to proposed requirements for  		licensed/regulated care, regardless of the level or stringency of the  		requirements. Even in the few states that already require licensed care for  		reimbursement of child care for work-welfare participants, there are concerns  		that available resources will not be sufficient to meet the demands,  		particularly if the age minimum is lowered. For those states which allow the  		use of unregulated and/or relative care, the impact will be the greatest. All  		states reported that the anticipated increase in workload would require  		additional resource development and licensing/monitoring staff to meet the  		demand for licensed/regulated care. This could not happen without expanded  		additional federal support to cover increased staffing levels.</p>
<p> While states generally were in agreement about the potential impact of  		any proposed legislative mandates, a number have begun to take steps in  		anticipation of federal welfare reform. A few states are currently conducting  		surveys and studies to determine potential impact or have analyzed their  		situation based on the proposed requirements. California's Budget Act mandates  		a joint study by June 1988 conducted by the Departments of Education and social  		services on the potential impacts of lowering age limits. In Weld County,  		Colorado, a survey is being conducted to assess the impact of lowering the age  		limit to six months.</p>
<p> Other states are considering the establishment of priority groups, both  		formal and informal, as a way of targeting resources. For example, Minnesota  		has established three priority groups to be served by PATHS, with the first  		being the caretaker under the age of 21. Other states are informally targeting  		young parents because they believe that the greatest success in  		self-sufficiency and in cost-savings will be realized through this group.</p>
<h3>D. Coordination with Head Start</h3>
<p> In considering child care resources for work-welfare parents, the  		relationship of current work-welfare programs to Head start was briefly  		examined. What became evident in our discussions with state work-welfare staff  		is that there really is little, if any, coordination with Head Start at the  		state level. There are few exceptions to this, and these are relatively recent  		attempts. New York, for example, has for the past four or five years placed  		particular emphasis on state level coordination between these programs.  		Initiatives which use combinations of Head Start and state funding to support  		alternatives to routine Head Start and day care operations have been  		implemented. These include a part-day Head Start program with state monies  		funding the balance of the day for child care services, a cluster of family day  		care providers administered by a Head Start Program, and a county-wide  		demonstration of Head Start and day care using the same staff.</p>
<p> What little relationship or coordination that does exist is primarily  		at the local level, with arrangements being made mostly by individual  		participants. Some of the barriers at the local level appear to be a lack of  		available Head Start slots, and reimbursement rates for child care for  		work-welfare participants are insufficient to meet Head Start costs.</p>
<p> The potential for addressing some of the resource needs of work-welfare  		participants through Head Start are discussed in detail in the  		<a href="#chapIII">Chapter III</a>.</p>
<h3>E. State Highlights</h3>
<p> In the last section of this chapter, we highlight information on the  		employment-training programs, the level of participation and exemptions, child  		care services available, and selected issues for each state. This information  		is summarized from more detailed state writeups included in  		<a href="evalasv2.htm">Volume II</a> of this report.</p>
<p> With the focus of this study on child care options for work-welfare, we  		have chosen to organize the state highlights under two broad categories:</p>
<ul><li>states with special child care components and/or funding, and</li>
<li>states which provide child care for work-welfare participants through  		  the general state child care program.</li>
</ul><p> While most states clearly fell into one category, one or two states may  		have crossed both categories. In these cases, we have noted the reason for  		forcefitting the state into one category.</p>
<h4>1. Special Child Care Components and/or  		Funding</h4>
<p> More than half of the states contacted have implemented special child  		care components to support participants in work-welfare activities, or they  		offer child care services separate from the general child care programs. These  		components range from specially designed statewide programs to county options  		for service delivery. For each of the states we provide an overview of the  		work-welfare program and details about the child care program component as a  		support service for participants. Oklahoma is included in this category because  		the state child care program is exclusively to support the employment and  		training program.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 Minnesota</strong></p>
<p> PATHS, Priority Access to Human Services, is Minnesota's strategy to  		help three specified groups of AFDC recipients achieve self-sufficiency:</p>
<ul><li>caretakers under the age of 21,</li>
<li>caretakers without a high school diploma or GED, and</li>
<li>caretakers who have been on assistance for 24 out of the last 35  		  months.</li>
</ul><p> The first two groups were chosen as priorities based on characteristics  		that often determine long-term AFDC dependency, namely young parents and  		parents lacking a high school education. The third group has already begun a  		period of long-term dependency.</p>
<p> PATHS builds on the Minnesota 1985 Jobs Act which reorganized the  		state's employment and training delivery system and mandated coordination of  		the employment, training, and income maintenance resources for the purpose of  		putting unemployed Minnesotans to work. The 1987 Welfare Reform Law established  		PATHS and committed more than $50 million in state funds for the program.</p>
<p> The responsibility for PATHS, a multi-agency, multi-disciplinary  		self-sufficiency program, is shared by a number of state agencies and Local  		Service Units--LSUs (counties). The Department of Jobs and Training coordinates  		the development and delivery of employment and training programs. The  		Department of Human Services, as the state IV-A agency, has ultimate authority  		over all AFDC activities, and the operation of the special child care  		component. The Office of Jobs Policy, created by Executive Order in 1987,  		coordinates policy development and planning for jobs, public assistance, and  		education issues that cross state agency lines.</p>
<p> PATHS is to be implemented on a county-by-county basis according to  		approved Local Service Plans. The LSUs have primary responsibility for  		developing and operating "job systems" which best suit the needs of the local  		communities. Currently nine, counties have implemented a local PATHS  		program.</p>
<p> PATHS, as it is currently designed, is a comprehensive program  		including case management services, employment and training, child care, health  		care, and AFDC self-employment activities. The case management component  		consists primarily of vocational counseling and assistance in accessing  		vocational, social and support services. Although employment and training  		programs may vary widely among the counties, each county must include a job  		search program that is mandatory for one parent in AFDC-U families, an initial  		orientation for all recipients to inform them of employment, training,  		education, and support services. All other components of PATHS are  		voluntary.</p>
<p> The PATHS program was designed with child care as a major component  		because the state believed that child care is the most significant barrier to  		self-sufficiency for AFDC recipients. The Child Care Sliding Fee Program  		provides state subsidized child care to AFDC recipients and other low-income  		families, based on a sliding fee schedule. Care is available to priority group  		participants from licensed day care centers and family day care homes. However,  		there is one exception to the family day care home licensing regulations that  		provides flexibility to recipients in areas where licensed resources may be  		scarce. Family day care homes serving only one other family are exempt from  		licensure. The responsibility for child care arrangements rests with the  		client.</p>
<p> Funding for the Child Care Sliding Fee Program is almost $26 million  		for the 1987-1989 biennium. Some $5.7 million is designated specifically for  		PATHS participants in employment and training services. With the sliding fee  		scale, child care services are available indefinitely to participants in  		transition to unsubsidized employment as long as they meet the income  		guidelines of the fee scale. For a family of two, the cut-off is 74 percent of  		the state median income, or more than $15,700 annual gross income. For a family  		of three the cut-off is $19,395.</p>
<p> Another $5.2 million is reserved for AFDC recipients in post-secondary  		education. Minnesota places emphasis on post-secondary institutions as central  		agents in providing recipients with the tools to become self-sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Massachusetts</strong></p>
<p> The Employment and Training Choices Supported Work Program (ET  		CHOICES), initiated in 1983, offers AFDC recipients opportunities for  		employment, skills training, and education through a variety of state and local  		options. Operated by the Massachusetts Department of Welfare, ET CHOICES is  		mandatory for AFDC recipients with children over the age of six. Mothers with  		children under six are encouraged to volunteer for the program.</p>
<p> The ET CHOICES philosophy focuses on participants' freedom to choose a  		component of the program that is right for them. These components include  		direct job placement assistance, education, skills training, or support work  		experience. With four years of experience, the ET CHOICES program has been  		institutionalized statewide.</p>
<p> Perhaps the most widely publicized component of ET CHOICES is its child  		care program. Massachusetts made a substantial commitment to the ET program in  		its funding of the Voucher Day Care Program. The Voucher Program is operated by  		the Department of Social Services (DSS) under a contract from the Department of  		Welfare. DSS administers the Voucher Program through ten contracted Vendor  		Management Agencies across the state. These agencies provide information and  		referral to participants on available licensed day care center or family day  		care home services. The agencies are also responsible for assessing parent fees  		and providing follow-up case management services. Resource development,  		recruitment, training and technical assistance, and provider reimbursement are  		administrative tasks contracted for through the Vendor Management Agencies.</p>
<p> Through the Voucher Program, participants are free to choose the type  		of child care which best suits their needs. Although licensed care is required,  		participants may also choose an independent family day care home which is  		exempt from licensing. This is usually a relative's home which is registered by  		the Vendor Management Agency as an approved day care provider to address a lack  		of appropriate care, or inaccessibility to licensed care.</p>
<p> The Voucher Program served 9332 children through 1645 voucher day care  		providers in 1987. Fifty percent of the children were preschool to first  		graders. As a special component of ET, the Voucher Program budget for FY 1988  		is $30 million, or almost half of the total ET budget.</p>
<p> ET participants receive a voucher subsidy for the entire period they  		participate in an ET component activity. In addition, they may continue to  		receive voucher assistance for a period of 12 months after employment to assist  		in transition. At the end of the transition period, participants are  		transferred to the State's "Contracted Day Care Program." Basically, this  		program is a Title XX funded program serving clients in employment and training  		programs, and clients in protective services.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 California</strong></p>
<p> National attention has been focused recently on the California  		statewide welfare reform program known as GAIN (Greater Avenues for  		Independence). GAIN is a comprehensive program that offers job search,  		education, training, and supportive services to enable welfare recipients to  		become self-sufficient. Established in September 1985 by state legislation,  		GAIN is being implemented on a county-by-county basis. The program is currently  		operating in 22 of the State's 58 counties. Only two of the larger counties  		have a GAIN program in operation--Santa Clara for more than one year and San  		Diego for six months.</p>
<p> All able-bodied applicants and recipients of AFDC whose youngest child  		is six years old or above must register for GAIN. Others may volunteer. All  		registrants go through an appraisal process by the county welfare department to  		determine if remedial education is required and to review any employment  		history. At the end of this process, the participant enters into a contract  		with the county, agreeing to participation requirements and supportive services  		to be provided.</p>
<p> GAIN involves comprehensive services leading to employment, such as job  		club, supervised job search or assessment, remedial education, development of  		employment plans, work experience, and other on-the-job training and support  		services.</p>
<p> GAIN is supported by a major comprehensive dedicated child care  		program, separate from the state's general child care program. The key  		provision of the GAIN legislation designates approximately one-third of the  		GAIN budget for child care services for GAIN participants. An accompanying  		"latchkey" bill added additional funding for expansion of after-school child  		care and for capital outlays for construction and expansion of child care  		facilities.</p>
<p> The types of care available vary by county. Each county must conduct a  		survey of recipient preferences as part of the county-level planning process.  		GAIN allows exemptions to mandated participants for lack of child care, but  		experience in the counties operating one or more years indicates that no such  		exemptions have been requested.</p>
<p> GAIN is funded approximately 70 to 75 percent by state monies. The  		total annual GAIN program costs are expected to be close to $356 million for  		194,000 participants. Some federal funds (at 90/10 match) are available to the  		program, plus federal administrative matching funds at 50/50.</p>
<p> Child care funds are allocated/claimed in the following ways:</p>
<ul><li>if associated with education - state monies, or</li>
<li>if associated with job search-state/federal sharing of costs.</li>
</ul><p> GAIN offers counties flexibility in designing their child care  		services. Although it is expected that most of the child care will be provided  		through purchase of service arrangements, counties are permitted to use  		vouchers and license-exempt providers (relatives).</p>
<p> Upon entering GAIN, participants are referred to the State general  		child care program administered by the State Department of Education.  		Participants are placed on a waiting list for the general child care program in  		anticipation of the time when he/she can move into employment. GAIN provides  		three months of fully paid child care as transition assistance for the  		participants. At the end of this period, the participant moves into the state  		subsidized child care program if there is a vacant slot in a licensed provider  		agency, and begins co-payment for child care based on a sliding fee scale.</p>
<p><strong>1.4 New Jersey</strong></p>
<p> New Jersey's Welfare Reform program, REACH (Realizing Economic  		Achievement), was initiated in October 1987 as the result of a federal waiver.  		REACH is a comprehensive program with the ultimate goal to include every AFDC  		family in the state. Seen as a "mutual obligation" program, with both the state  		and the recipient having responsibilities, REACH is designed to remove barriers  		to employment and provide support programs and services to "able-bodied"  		recipients with children age two and over. These services include:</p>
<ul><li>extension of Medicaid coverage for up to one year after  		  employment;</li>
<li>providing child care allowances;</li>
<li>providing transportation allowances; and</li>
<li>providing educational programs, counseling, vocational assessment,  		  job training, and placement services.</li>
</ul><p> The program is currently operating in three counties, with two more  		scheduled to begin early in 1988. By the end of the year, the goal is to have  		REACH operating in 13 counties representing 93 percent of the welfare  		caseload.</p>
<p> REACH is the Governor's initiative to change the state's welfare  		program from payments to an emphasis on employment and training. Through  		legislative appropriation, the budget for this first year of operation is $12.5  		million. It is expected that when fully implemented, the annual costs will be  		$60 million.</p>
<p> As one of the major support services for REACH, a special child care  		component is part of the REACH funding. Half of the REACH budget is allocated  		to support services, including child care. REACH child care services include  		licensed centers and registered family day care homes, as well as regulated or  		unregulated relative care. However, unregulated relative care is reimbursed at  		only one-half the rate paid to registered providers. The child care component  		is separate from the general state child care program which is funded through  		Title XX.</p>
<p> Currently, child care resources in New Jersey are limited, so that the  		demand for subsidized child care far exceeds the supply. However, the  		commitment of the Governor, the Legislature, and the Department of Human  		Services is to remove barriers to employment and provide support programs and  		services. With this commitment in mind, the county planning process is designed  		to assess the need for local support services and to help increase the network  		of family child care homes. It is assumed that the Department of Human Services  		will develop, or find, the necessary resources to meet the needs of REACH  		participants.</p>
<p> REACH will use the voucher system for child care. Counties have the  		option of supplementing the state rates to providers. REACH will continue  		Medicaid and child care for up to one year after employment to assist  		participants in transitioning to unsubsidized employment.</p>
<p><strong>1.5 Washington</strong></p>
<p> Although Washington State is currently operating a WIN/Employment and  		Training Program, a new comprehensive welfare reform program known as the  		Family Independence Program (FIP) is being implemented. FIP is proposed as a  		five year program within the general framework of Title IV-A, and alternative  		to the AFDC program. FIP requires federal legislation for implementation, since  		the provisions include a cash-out of Food Stamps, with impact on AFDC,  		Medicaid, and WIN.</p>
<p> With a goal of moving more heads of households into employment (whether  		on or off welfare), the idea of FIP is to be "budget neutral" (no additional  		state funding above current levels) accomplished through:</p>
<ul><li>placing enrollees in employment at an earlier point than is currently  		  now done in AFDC and freeing funds for child care, medical care, social  		  services, and incentive payments; and</li>
<li>improving child support collections.</li>
</ul><p> FIP will be totally voluntary for the first two years of operation,  		with AFDC recipients required only to register and to go through an assessment.  		After the two year period, participation in education, training, and work  		programs will be mandatory in regions where over 50 percent of the job-ready  		enrollees were placed within three months. Participation will also be mandatory  		for parents with children age three and older and for single parents with  		children between the ages of 6 months and three years if the family has been  		receiving public assistance for more than three years.</p>
<p> The major components of FIP are:</p>
<ul><li>a thorough assessment of the applicants' skills and potential;  		  and</li>
<li>coordination between the State Department of Employment Security  		  Development and the Department of Social and Health Services to assist the  		  applicant in:
<ul><li>completing high school or a GED program,</li>
<li>attending a community college or four year institution,</li>
<li>participating in training to prepare for jobs likely to be  				available, and/or</li>
<li>obtaining employment in an available job on a full-time or  				part-time basis.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p> Child care is a major support service of FIP. Currently a child care  		initiative is under way to mobilize resources for child care in every sector of  		the state economy, and to create partnerships among state and local  		governments, education, business, the media, and community agencies. When FIP  		is implemented, child care will be available from licensed day care centers and  		family day care homes. In addition, FIP will pay for unregulated care provided  		by relatives or other in-home caregivers.</p>
<p> The funding for child care supporting the current WIN/Employment and  		Training program is a combination o f Title XX, WIN, and AFDC income disregard.  		Since FIP is being organized as a "budget neutral" program, the proposal calls  		for federal sharing of child care expenditures associated with education,  		training, and work activities, as well as transitional child care, at the AFDC  		matching rate. Transitional child care for 12 months following employment (with  		a sliding fee scale) is seen as a key to the success of FIP.</p>
<p><strong>1.6 Illinois</strong></p>
<p> Illinois' approach to welfare reform is a comprehensive program called  		Project Chance. The focus of Project Chance has been to redefine welfare as a  		temporary support system, rather than a permanent form of dependency. Project  		Chance is open to any person receiving benefits from the Department of Public  		Aid, including AFDC and General Assistance (GA), and some Food Stamp  		recipients. Enrollment is mandatory for all new GA clients and AFDC mothers  		with children age six and over. Mothers with children under the age of six are  		encouraged to participate on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p> Project Chance, which is operated through the local county offices,  		provides an intensive eight-week Job Search session followed by a period in  		which the participants are encouraged to try to find a job. If unsuccessful,  		participants are moved into one or a combination of different programs,  		including:</p>
<ul><li>job training through JTPA,</li>
<li>literacy training through the Illinois Literacy Council,</li>
<li>adult basic education and GED programs through the State Board of  		  Education and community college system,</li>
<li>vocational training,</li>
<li>work experience program, and</li>
<li>support services including child care and transportation.</li>
</ul><p> The goal of Project Chance is to move 100,000 welfare recipients into  		jobs by July 1988, using a budget of almost $63 million dollars. In Fiscal Year  		1987, it was estimated that close to 75,000 recipients had moved into jobs.</p>
<p> Like the other states, Illinois views child care as a major support  		service for participants entering the jobplace. Child care is 29.6 percent of  		the support services costs for the program. A combination of State, WIN, and  		IV-A funds are use to support the child care needs.</p>
<p> Clients are responsible for making their own child care arrangements  		through a variety of regulated and unregulated resources, including licensed  		centers and family day care homes, in-home and relative care.</p>
<p> Illinois recently passed new legislation designed to enable the  		Department of Public Aid to significantly expand Project Chance. A key feature  		of the legislation was a six-month extension of medical assistance and child  		care benefits to assist participants in the transition from welfare dependence  		to self-sufficiency. Clients entering job placements can continue to receive  		child care services through Project Chance for six months. At the end of the  		period, they are referred to the Title XX Child Care Program which is  		administered by the Department of Children and Family Services.</p>
<p> Illinois places a special emphasis on assisting teenage parents in an  		effort to reduce dependency on welfare. The state administers three programs  		designed specifically for this purpose: Parents Too Soon, Young Parents  		Program, and Project Advance. The first two programs are state supported;  		Project Advance is one of two national demonstration projects funded by the  		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation and the Family Support  		Administration. In this project, pregnant teens and teenage mothers on AFDC  		participate in a comprehensive program designed to help them complete their  		education, enter job training programs, and move into employment. Like Project  		Chance, child care and transportation are two integral support services, with  		special funding to ensure available resources.</p>
<p><strong>1.7 Florida</strong></p>
<p> Florida operates a modified WIN Demonstration, Project Independence. As  		a waiver state, Florida has chosen to require mandatory participation of  		mothers with children age three and over. Mothers with children younger than  		three are encouraged to volunteer for the program. Florida is also seeking an  		additional waiver to require teenage mothers to remain in school in order to  		continue receiving AFDC assistance.</p>
<p> Implemented under the Florida Economic Opportunity Act of 1987, Project  		Independence places a heavy emphasis on assessment of job readiness. Clients  		with less than a 10th grade education, or without 13 months of total work  		experience, are channelled into education and training programs prior to job  		search activities.</p>
<p> Project Independence includes a special child care component, as part  		of the Support services budget. Funds for child care come from WIN and AFDC  		monies. Participants are provided with assistance from Project Independence  		workers in planning for and locating appropriate child care. Participants may  		choose from a variety of provider types, including center-based care, family  		day care, and relative care (which is unregulated).</p>
<p> Project Independence will continue child care for 90 days after  		employment for mothers in transition. At the end of the 90 day period,  		participants are referred to the general day care program. Unfortunately, there  		is a waiting list of more than 27,000 children for child care through the  		state's program. This does not include the additional Project Independence  		children whose parents are in need of child care to remain in their employment  		situations.</p>
<p> Like the general child care program, the Project Independence child  		care component is limited by scarce resources in terms of center-based care.  		Rural areas are particularly faced with inadequate supplies of all types of  		care. Because of this situation, Florida exempts mothers from participation who  		are unable to find appropriate child care arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>1.8 Georgia</strong></p>
<p> With the approval of the Georgia State Legislature, the Department of  		Human Resources initiated a comprehensive work-welfare program called PEACH  		(Positive Employment and Community Help) in 1986. PEACH is a county  		administered program, currently operating in 20 counties.</p>
<p> Registration in PEACH is mandatory for AFDC recipients with children  		age six and older, and voluntary registration for mothers with children under  		the age of 6. Exemption from registration is permitted for recipients who are  		ill or who must care for disabled relatives.</p>
<p> The PEACH model stresses local option designs which meet the unique  		needs of the individual county populations. Local PEACH projects are encouraged  		to select activities that meet client population characteristics and community  		resources. Through PEACH, registered recipients can participate in assessment,  		orientation, job search, work experience, job placement, adult basic education,  		and vocational skills training.</p>
<p> PEACH includes a child care component separately funded from the  		state's general child care program. With local option, counties are responsible  		for developing appropriate child care and other resources to meet identified  		local needs. Child care is reimbursable from a wide variety of providers,  		including licensed centers and registered family day care homes, or unregulated  		care which may be provided by relatives or friends in or out of the child's own  		home, as well as family day care homes with fewer than three children.</p>
<p> The PEACH child care component is supported through a pool of WIN,  		Title IV-A, and state funds. Transitional care is provided by approximately  		three-fourths of the counties currently operating PEACH programs. This  		assistance is available for up to a 12 month period. The remaining counties  		with PEACH operations limit transition services to three months. However, these  		counties are expected to increase the transitional period during this year.</p>
<p> Like many of the other states, Georgia's child care resources are  		limited for infants and toddlers. This has been seen as a factor in the limited  		volunteer participation of mothers with children under the age of three.</p>
<p><strong>1.9 Iowa</strong></p>
<p> Iowa currently operates three work-welfare programs through the  		Employment and Training Program of the Iowa Department of Human Services. These  		include:</p>
<ul><li>classroom training,</li>
<li>WIN Demonstration, and</li>
<li>JTPA with special funds.</li>
</ul><p> Participation in these programs is based on federal WIN exemptions. The  		WIN Demonstration, operated in 49 of the 99 counties in Iowa, provides 3  		activities for work-welfare participants. The job club and work experience  		components are mandatory for AFDC recipients with children over the age of six.  		Classroom training is a voluntary program for all interested recipients. The  		Classroom Training Program provides tuition support to voluntary  		participants.</p>
<p> Child care is provided as a specially funded component of the Iowa  		Employment and Training Program, funded primarily through a combination of  		state and federal monies. A new program recently implemented provides child  		care to JTPA participants who may not qualify under the Classroom Training or  		WIN Demonstration programs for child care. In these cases the participant  		receives child care assistance under a category of AFDC special needs.</p>
<p> Participants in Iowa's Employment and Training Program are responsible  		for making their own arrangements for child care. They are not restricted to  		licensed/regulated care, as Iowa will pay for unregulated relative and in-home  		care. only current or ex-spouses are restricted from providing paid care for  		participants.</p>
<p> At the writing of this report, Iowa does not offer transition  		assistance for participants who become employed. A new proposal is pending  		before the state legislature to extend child care benefits to Iowa Employment  		and Training participants up to 12 months after employment. The current  		practice is to use the AFDC income disregard up to $175 per month at the point  		of employments. In rare cases, this may be supplemented by SSBG funds; however,  		these resources are not usually available.</p>
<p><strong>1.10 Oklahoma</strong></p>
<p> The work-welfare program in Oklahoma is a diversified, comprehensive  		employment and training program which includes the following components:</p>
<ul><li>WIN Demonstration,</li>
<li>CWEP,</li>
<li>direct job search,</li>
<li>structured job search,</li>
<li>classroom training,</li>
<li>basic adult training and GED, and</li>
<li>work supplementation (grant diversion).</li>
</ul><p> Beginning in 1981 as a WIN Demonstration, the current program  		represents a continuous building process of new features added annually.</p>
<p> Oklahoma, as one of the eight waiver states, has completely removed the  		minimum age requirement as a factor in determining an AFDC recipient's  		participation in work-welfare. As such, all AFDC recipients with children from  		birth and up are required to register for the work-welfare program.</p>
<p> Program statistics show that Oklahoma has had better success in placing  		mothers with children under six into employment situations than mothers with  		older children. This has resulted in an informal priority on young mothers with  		young children.</p>
<p> Following registration, a plan is developed for each applicant which  		takes into consideration the adequacy of child care, transportation and the  		physical/mental condition of the applicant and family members. If this  		assessment indicates the applicant is not "job ready," the applicant's name  		goes into an "exempt pool" until the department's work-welfare staff can  		determine that needed support services are available and/or the applicant is  		ready to enter the program.</p>
<p>Of the ten states included in this discussion, Oklahoma is the only  		state that does not have a designated work-welfare child care program which is  		separate from the general child care program. However, because Oklahoma's  		single program for child care is almost exclusively restricted to support the  		employment and training program, the state description was included with others  		that do have special child care components.</p>
<p> Adequate child care is viewed by Oklahoma as essential to a successful  		employment and training program. Therefore, child care in the state is targeted  		toward the Employment and Training Program participants, and receives  		legislative and budgetary support.</p>
<p> Child care reimbursed by the program is available only through licensed  		day care centers and family day care homes. Currently, there are no apparent  		resource problems in the metropolitan areas, even for flexible care such as  		nighttime and week-end. The rural areas experience much more of a resource  		problem, primarily due to lack of transportation.</p>
<p> Child care is funded through a combination of Title IV-A and Title XX  		funds which are utilized according to the following conditions:</p>
<ul><li>child care for AFDC recipients participating in CWEP is covered by  		  Title IV-A; and</li>
<li>child care for participants moving into employment and off the  		  welfare rolls is covered by Title XX in combination with a co-payment from the  		  participant based on a sliding fee schedule.</li>
</ul><p>Through this second payment mechanism, participants transitioning to  		unsubsidized employment are assured of continued assistance.</p>
<h4>2. Work-Welfare Child Care Support Through  		General Child Care Program</h4>
<p> The remaining states in the study elected to provide child care support  		to work-welfare participants through the state general child care program. As  		in the previous section, an overview of each state's work-welfare program is  		provided, as well as the child care services available.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Michigan</strong></p>
<p> The Michigan Opportunities Skills Program (MOST) was established by the  		State Legislature in December 1983 to target services to the hard-to-place,  		long-term AFDC recipient on the rolls for two or more years. Described as an  		umbrella program, MOST incorporates four programs into its service delivery  		system:</p>
<ul><li>WIN Demonstration,</li>
<li>Title IV-A work program,</li>
<li>Food Stamp employment and training program, and</li>
<li>General Assistance work program.</li>
</ul><p> As of September 30, 1987, there were more than 91,000 participants of  		which 60,000 were AFDC recipients.</p>
<p> As a waiver state, Michigan mandates participation of AFDC recipients  		with children age six months and older. However, MOST also incorporates the  		standard WIN exemptions, including lack of child care, so that many of  		recipients mandated to participate actually end up as exempt.</p>
<p> Child care is provided to MOST participants through the Michigan Child  		Care Program. Of the 15,000 children in the program, two-thirds are covered  		under Title IV-A funding, with the remaining paid for by Title XX.</p>
<p> By Michigan statute, all nonrelated child care providers must be  		licensed or registered. However, the Department does pay for relative care,  		which is unregulated, out of Title IV-A funds. Participants are reimbursed  		directly for child care expenses as the Department does not use vouchers or  		contract providers for MOST participants.</p>
<p> Transition assistance is available for the month the participant is  		first employed until the first paycheck is received. Beginning with the second  		month of employment, child care is calculated as an employment expense, and  		supplemented by a co-payment based on a sliding fee scale.</p>
<p> Like many states, Michigan is experiencing an inadequate supply of  		infant and toddler child care resources, as well as flexible hours of care. In  		many cases, due to this lack of appropriate child care resources, the  		participant is exempt from the program.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Nebraska</strong></p>
<p> Work programs in Nebraska are included in the WIN Demonstration,  		including IV-A job search and CWEP. As one of the original waiver states in  		1985, Nebraska initially mandated participation of mothers with children age  		three and older. In June 1987, Nebraska received a waiver to reduce the minimum  		age requirement to children six months and older.</p>
<p> The work-welfare program in Nebraska is grounded in state policies, not  		in legislation. Funding decisions are made through the normal process. More and  		more attention is being given to the programs by the Governor and the  		legislature.</p>
<p>The child care needs of participants are met through the state's general  		child care program. Of the 3600 children in care in FY 1987, 2200 were AFDC  		children and another 250 children had parents in special job support  		programs.</p>
<p> Nebraska sees the strength of its work-welfare program and the child  		care program in its flexibility to overcome whatever barriers may arise that  		prevent recipients from participating in work-welfare. Funds are available for  		use on a case-by-case basis to pay for gasoline, bus vouchers, vehicle licenses  		or repairs, transportation services, and to assist clients to seek and accept a  		job. Although Nebraska requires that child care be in licensed centers and  		registered group or family day care homes, staff have the discretion to pay for  		child care provided by relatives, if the relative is the only source of care  		available.</p>
<p> The child care program is funded through a combination of state and  		federal dollars, including IV-A, WIN, and Title XX. The Title XX funds are used  		primarily for the non-AFDC/work-welfare related children (meaning children in  		protective services), non-AFDC low income children, and children supplemented  		through co-payments.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Arkansas</strong></p>
<p> Arkansas' new work-welfare program is a IV-A work search program.  		Previously, the state had a WIN Demonstration program known as Project Success.  		The new program is a departmental initiative, driven by federal financial  		participation available (based on the federal OBRA legislation). There is no  		state legislation for the program.</p>
<p> As a waiver state, Arkansas mandates participation of mothers with  		children over the age of three, but allows the lack of child care as an  		exemption from participation.</p>
<p>Participants in the IV-A work search program are provided child care  		through the general child care program. Child care licensing regulations  		currently exempt centers from the licensing/registration requirement if they  		operate less than five hours per day or ten hours per week. Day care homes  		which care for children of fewer than four families or a total of fewer than 6  		children are not currently required to register. This significantly reduces the  		pool of available licensed resources from which participants can select. It is  		anticipated that a voluntary registration program will be instituted within the  		next three years which will increase the available resources for clients.</p>
<p> While the general child care program is funded through a combination of  		state and federal funds, child care to support work-welfare participants is  		paid primarily from Title IV-A funds. Transitional child care is available to  		participants moving into employment, with no time limit, based on a sliding fee  		scale. However, Arkansas staff cite affordability as a continuing problem for  		these participants once care is no longer subsidized.</p>
<p> Child care in Arkansas has high visibility at the level of the Governor  		and the legislature. The Governor's Task Force on Child Care has been  		instrumental in expanding child care through new state appropriations.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 Arizona</strong></p>
<p> Arizona implemented a statewide expansion of its WIN Demonstration that  		had previously operated in the two most populous counties of the state,  		Maricopa and Pima Counties. As a waiver state, Arizona makes WIN participation  		mandatory for AFDC recipients with children age three and over; however, the  		waiver applies only to the two counties.</p>
<p> The statewide program, referred to as Arizona Works, is administered by  		the Department of Economic Services. Since this agency includes Employment  		Services, JTPA, Vocational Rehabilitation, AFDC, and Food Stamps, there is  		strong coordination of funding and services. Arizona Works includes a  		placement/orientation component, plus an intensive services component. This  		last component focuses on serving AFDC clients who are long-term dependent,  		with few job skills and children over 16; and on teenage parents.</p>
<p> Child care for work-welfare participants is provided through the  		general child care program. Care is authorized only in licensed day care  		centers and certified family day care homes. Statistics show that most clients  		use child care centers. However, since Arizona requires a co-payment based on a  		sliding fee scale, some clients move to less expensive family day care when the  		co-payment requirement poses a problem. Certification limits the maximum number  		of children in family day care homes to four which has resulted in few  		available slots at lower rates.</p>
<p> Funding for the child care program is a combination of state (80%) and  		Title XX (20%) dollars for a total of $18 million. Additional monies from WIN,  		AFDC, JTPA, and the Governor's Discretionary Fund are used-for the intensive  		services component of the work-welfare program.</p>
<p> Transitional child care assistance is available for work-welfare  		participants for up to four months through the co-payment sliding fee scale.  		New regulations which will increase the period to nine months are expected.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 Colorado</strong></p>
<p> Colorado does not have a statewide work-welfare program. For most of  		the state, the WIN program and CWEP provide the work experience for AFDC  		recipients. Colorado does have a waiver for the work-welfare program in Weld  		County which is the focus of this discussion.</p>
<p> The Weld County work-welfare program is a grant diversion program with  		mandatory participation of parents with children age six months and older. This  		provision was added to the waiver in its third year renewal, and currently is  		under federal review. Previously, participation in the Weld County program  		followed the WIN guidelines, with voluntary participation of mothers with  		children under six.</p>
<p> The Weld County work-welfare program provides up to six months of  		full-time work experience in a minimum wage position in a public or non-profit  		agency. This work experience is reimbursed under the waiver funds supplemented  		by JTPA.</p>
<p> Participants in the Weld County program are provided child care  		services through the state child care program whose priorities focus totally on  		enabling parents to seek and obtain employment and training. Reimbursement for  		child care is restricted only to licensed day care centers and family day care  		homes.</p>
<p>Lack of child care is an allowable exemption from work-welfare  		participation; however, to date, no such request for exemption has been made in  		the Weld County program.</p>
<p><strong>2.6 Oregon</strong></p>
<p>Oregon's New Jobs Program is a pilot program operated in seven sites  		representing 25 percent of the state's population. The foundation for the New  		Jobs Program was Oregon's WIN Demonstration which started in 1982. New Jobs is  		scheduled for statewide implementation in early 1988, with all counties phasing  		in by April 1988.</p>
<p>The New Jobs Program places major emphasis on long-term  		self-sufficiency. It components include the basic activities of other  		comprehensive work-welfare programs, including:</p>
<ul><li>work search,</li>
<li>vocational education,</li>
<li>work site training,</li>
<li>supported work,</li>
<li>business development,</li>
<li>assessment, and</li>
<li>basic skills.</li>
</ul><p> Oregon is a waiver state, mandating participation of clients with  		children age three and older. Clients with younger children are encouraged to  		participate on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p> The general child care program in Oregon is employment related and  		therefore targets the New Jobs participants for services. Child care available  		to work-welfare participants is largely unregulated care. Payment is made for  		child care services regardless of certification, since the payment is usually  		made directly to the client.</p>
<p> Funding of child care for work-welfare participants is primarily from  		WIN and IV-A/disregard. There is a special child care program for clients  		moving into employment and leaving the AFDC program. This is the Employment  		Related Day Care Program which is funded with state monies.</p>
<p> Transition assistance is available through the Employment Related Day  		Care Program and WIN funds. The WIN funds can be used for one-time charges such  		as a registration fee or advance payment to a new provider.</p>
<p><strong>2.7 New York</strong></p>
<p> In addition to a WIN Demonstration, New York operates a voluntary  		work-welfare program known as Comprehensive Employment Opportunities Support  		Centers (CEOSC). This discussion focuses on this special program.</p>
<p> As part of New York State's welfare employment initiative, caretaker  		parents of children under age six who are receiving AFDC are encouraged to  		volunteer for participation in CEOSC. The CEOSCs, which are currently active in  		eight sites across the state, are operated by public or voluntary agencies.  		Eight additional centers are scheduled for implementation early 1988. Two of  		the current CEOSCs are in New York City.</p>
<p> The key concepts of CEOSCs are case management and "one stop shopping"  		for employment and training services. The goal of case management in the CEOSCs  		is to coordinate the comprehensive array of services, support, and assistance  		necessary to the recipient's successful achievement of self-sufficiency. The  		case management concept requires that one staff member work with a client  		throughout the involvement with CEOSC.</p>
<p> The "one stop shopping" concept has shaped the CEOSC into a  		full-service program, providing all necessary services or serving as a broker  		to secure needed services.</p>
<p> To date, sponsors of the CEOSC have been local Boards of Cooperative  		Education, private colleges, private organizations, county Department of Social  		Services. county Departments of Labor, and JTPA.</p>
<p> CEOSC is supported by ten on-site licensed day care centers at the  		training sites. These centers are part of the State's general child care  		program. In addition, care is also provided through unregulated caregivers,  		including friends and relatives.</p>
<p>While funding for the general child care program is primarily through  		Title XX, child care for CEOSC participants is principally covered by Title  		IV-A funds, supplemented as necessary by Title XX or state funds. Reimbursement  		is made through local county Departments of Social Services. Transitional  		assistance is supplemented by local departments as well.</p>
<p><strong>2.8 Other States</strong></p>
<p> Two other states were included in the study, Texas and Maryland.  		Information available on components of work programs in these locations was  		limited, due to problems in making appropriate contacts or little experience  		with work programs. However, brief summaries of available information are  		provided, with relevant study points noted.</p>
<p><b>Maryland</b> operates four work-welfare programs, including a WIN  		Demonstration, a grant diversion project in Baltimore City and seven counties,  		a state funded jobs program known as Investment in Job Opportunities (IJO), and  		Project Independence. Project Independence involves a consolidated application  		for Food Stamps, AFDC, and Medicaid; a case manager for intensive services to  		link the hard-to-place client with JTPA; and assignment to a transitional  		caseload if working but still eligible for public assistance. Participants in  		job training and employment programs are provided with child care services  		through the general child care program. Child care funds are also available  		from JTPA and the IJO.</p>
<p> Although <b>Texas</b> does not have an established work-welfare program  		in place, discussions were held with staff to determine what impacts have been  		noted on services and recipients due to the recent downturn of the state's  		economy. Texas operates a WIN Program on contract with the Texas Employment  		Commission, and a Food Stamp Employment and Training Program. Resources, such  		as JTPA and vocational training, are used to supplement these programs.</p>
<p> Participants in work programs with young children are provided child  		care through the state's general child care program. Although the first  		priority for child care through this program is children in need of Protective  		Services, the program does place a heavy emphasis on serving public assistance  		recipients who are in training or employment situations and in need of care for  		their children. Three of the four priorities for care require employment or  		training leading to employment as criteria for receiving child care  		services.</p>
<p>As a result of the downturn of the state's economy, some changes are  		being made in the child care program which focus on assisting parents in  		obtaining self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Effective March 1, 1988, child care will be extended from one year to  		two years for a parent who is in training leading to employment. In addition,  		transition child care will be extended from four weeks to eight weeks for  		participants leaving public assistance to move into unsubsidized  		employment.</p>
<p>Of interest in Texas is the availability of licensed and registered  		facilities. While licensed/registered care is required for reimbursement, there  		does not appear to be a shortage of approved facilities. Funding for child care  		is through Title XX.</p>
<h2><a name="chapIII" id="chapIII">III. HEAD START GRANTEES WHICH OFFER FULL-DAY CHILD  		CARE</a></h2>
<p> In the previous chapter we discussed the child care components in state  		work-welfare programs. The discussions about the programs were held with state  		staff, who provided their perspective on the child care provisions. In this  		chapter we examine a very different perspective, that of local child care  		providers who may be able to participate in work-welfare through supplying  		clients with the needed child care.</p>
<p> In fact, we chose to talk with a specific subset of providers -- those  		who offer Head Start services. This group is potentially important to  		work-welfare planners because:</p>
<ul><li>Head Start serves the low income population from which work-welfare  		  clients will be taken;</li>
<li>research on Head Start has shown that the program has a positive  		  influence on the children and families who are enrolled; and</li>
<li>it may be possible to coordinate Head Start and work-welfare at a  		  national or state level to help ensure that quality child care is available for  		  work-welfare clients.</li>
</ul><h3>A. Description of Head Start</h3>
<p> The Head Start program currently provides a comprehensive child  		development program for about 460,000 low income children. Grantees offer  		children an educational experience in a classroom or in the child's own home,  		extensive health screening, needed medical and dental care, and nutritionally  		well balanced meals and snacks. Head Start staff provide referrals for families  		in need of social services; they work hard to educate parents on child  		development and to involve them in the development of their own children.</p>
<p> In states that lower the age of exemption for work-welfare, we  		anticipate that many mothers of Head Start children will be asked to  		participate in the work-welfare program. It would seem that the education  		component of Head Start, where grantees provide classroom services to children,  		could supply the child care needed by mothers entering work-welfare. However,  		most Head Start programs offer part-day services for children. They are not  		designed as custodial child care programs. On the contrary, Head Start has  		separated itself from "day care" (in the sense of custodial care) in philosophy  		as well as practice. Therefore, in order for this successful child development  		program to mesh its services with work-welfare, certain changes in purpose and  		practice would need to occur.</p>
<p> A number of Head Start grantees have felt prepared and qualified to try  		to meet the full-day child care needs of families in their communities. Many  		have applied for Title XX (Social Service Block Grant funds allocated for child  		care), State Preschool or other local funds, and currently offer full-day child  		care. Some grantees even offer long hours of care paid for by Head Start (for  		example, grantees serving migrant families).</p>
<p> The purpose of this part of the project is to report discussions with  		grantees operating some full-day service about:</p>
<ul><li>schedules of operation of programs for children;</li>
<li>funding sources for each option and their expenditures;</li>
<li>the advantages and disadvantages of their options including any  		  barriers to offering full-day services and any "best practices" they have  		  identified;</li>
<li>coordination of Head Start services with those of other agencies and  		  funding sources; and</li>
<li>possibilities of expanding services for the low income  		  population.</li>
</ul><h3>B. The Sample</h3>
<p> Locating grantees that offer full-day services was accomplished by  		searching through the computerized Head Start Cost Management System and  		talking with staff in Head Start's Regional Offices. The Cost System now holds  		records of the program schedules and budgets of 1240 Head Start grantees (about  		95% of all grantees). Only 41 offered schedules where children attend class  		more than nine hours a day. of these, 11 grantees served migrant families.  		Full-day care is a relatively small part of Head Start's offerings, occurring  		in 3 to 3.5 percent of grantees.</p>
<p> Because the Cost System only reports schedules paid for by Head Start,  		it was important to find out from Regional Office staff about grantees that  		also offered full-day programs paid for by other sources. Regional staff were  		asked to list known grantees that offered full-day child care paid for by Head  		Start, Title XX, or a State Preschool fund. Grantees could operate programs  		either in centers, family day care homes, or both. The sample of grantees to be  		contacted was there chosen to include grantees from each of the Regions that  		offered different kinds of services paid for by different funding streams.</p>
<p> A total of 21 grantees were included in the final sample. The Director  		of each agency was interviewed over the telephone to supply information about  		the agency's child care programs. Summaries of all interviews are included as  		an appendix to this report. <a href="#exhibitIII.1">Exhibit III-1</a> shows the  		locations of the grantees, dividing the group according to the sources of  		funding for full-day options (Head Start only, Title XX/State Preschool only,  		or both) and the kinds of services offered (center-based, family day care home,  		or both).</p>
<p> Three caveats should be noted. First, the sample was intended to  		include a minimum of two grantees from each Head Start Region. However, because  		Region 10 staff knew of only one grantee with full-day services, this Region is  		represented only once. Second, it might appear that grantees in the middle  		column (labeled "Title XX or State Only") do not offer Head Start; this is not  		the case. All grantees in the sample offer Head Start services, but those in  		the center column offer only part-day Head Start. Third, the fact that two  		cells on the table are empty does not mean that such programs are  		nonexistent.</p>

</tr></table><p> Head Start has generally funded family day care homes as demonstration  		programs for a specific time period (e.g. two years) or has allowed grantees to  		add services for children in existing Title XX homes. It has not yet declared  		this child care model an official Head Start option. The absence of grantees  		operating family day care homes under the aegis of Head Start may reflect the  		infrequency of this model. However, the fact that none of the grantees in the  		sample offered part-day Head Start and sponsored a network of family day care  		homes funded by another source may not be due to the infrequency of this second  		model. Rather, it is likely that a number of Head Start grantees (not included  		in the sample) do offer these services. They may simply not be as obvious to  		Regional office staff. Or, the question which elicited nominations of grantees  		for the sample may not have seemed to Regional Office staff to include this  		model.</p>
<p> The reason for dividing grantees into the nine groups on the table is  		that these groups tend to differ from each other in the age range of children  		served, the kinds of services that are provided and the way they deal with  		funding. <a href="#exhibitIII.2">Exhibit III-2</a> summarizes these  		differences. If Head Start is the only funding source, the age range of  		children in part-day and full-day care is 3- to 5-year olds; all families are  		offered the comprehensive array of Head Start services, and Head Start alone  		pays for the services. If Title XX or a State Preschool program pays for the  		child care, then there is generally a wide age range, possibly as extensive as  		infants to children aged 14. The only service offered Title XX/State Preschool  		children is day care. This may mean that there is a carefully planned  		educational program for children, but usually children in these programs do not  		receive the health, social, and parent involvement services that are offered to  		the part-day Head Start children sponsored by the same grantee.</p>
<p> Generally, the part-day Head Start program and the full-day Title  		XX/State Preschool program are operated as separate entities with different  		staff and separate funding streams. Some administrative staff or support staff  		may be shared; teachers and aides in both programs may have the same position  		descriptions and the same pay scales, but the fiscal operations are separate.  		Any division of staff costs across programs (e.g., of administrative staff or  		cooks) is done according to a simple cost principle, usually that salaries  		should be divided according to the percentage of children funded by each  		source.</p>

</tr></table><p> Grantees in the final column on the exhibit represent multiple  		variations in programming and financial management; they seem to be meeting  		different needs in different communities. Some agencies are offering extended  		day care for Head Start children (e.g., Wanaque, NJ) and thus care for only 3-  		to 5-year-olds. Others (e.g., White Plains, NY; Visalia, CA) are the major  		child care providers in the county and offer care for all ages of preschool  		children and some school aged children.</p>
<p> Where "Head Start" and "Title XX" children are mixed in the same  		classrooms, grantees are required by Head Start to provide comprehensive  		services to all of the children. When the children are in separate facilities,  		grantees may try to provide comprehensive services to all, but the focus of  		their health, social, and parent services remains on the Head Start  		families.</p>
<p> The cost principles used to separate Head Start, Title XX and other  		costs include division by number of children in each funding stream, services  		required for each group, number of hours of service offered each, and some  		historical rationales unique to particular grantees. These are discussed in  		detail in a later section of the report.</p>
<p> The important points about these grantees with multiple funding sources  		for their full-day programs are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>each is different from the other;</li>
<li>each is responsive to its own community's needs; and</li>
<li>each has a somewhat different history of development of services and,  		  consequently, a different mix of services.</li>
</ul><p>Together they provide particularly interesting case studies of  		possibilities for using multiple sources of funding to provide the best quality  		of care and an appropriate blend of kinds of care.</p>
<p> In the sections that follow we discuss key features of the different  		grantees, emphasizing the importance of the match between a community and its  		child care offerings and understanding the history of the development of the  		services of each particular grantee. The discussion divides the grantees into  		three groups:</p>
<ul><li>those that concentrate on the <b>provision</b> of full-day services  		  to children;</li>
<li>those that provide some full-day services, but seem to center efforts  		  more on <b>brokering</b> or coordinating full-day services for families in the  		  community; and</li>
<li>those that are in <b>work-welfare</b> states and have developed  		  service provision and brokering within a coordinated county effort.</li>
</ul><p>Grantees solely funded by Head Start for full-day services and those  		solely funded by Title XX or State Preschool funds tend to fall in the first  		group. Grantees that receive funding from multiple sources sometimes provide  		services, sometimes broker services, and are at times already involved in  		work-welfare programs, providing and/or brokering services for children.</p>
<h3>C. Descriptions of Grantee's Services</h3>
<p> In the following sections we describe the services and operation of the  		grantees which provide full-day care. We begin with grantees that supply a good  		deal of full-day service and the full comprehensive array of health, social  		services, and parent involvement activities to all families. We comment  		initially on grantees that are financed fully by Head Start, and later on those  		jointly financed by Head Start and another source. Next we discuss grantees who  		feel they cannot supply the full-day care that is needed or the comprehensive  		services which would benefit all families, singling out the barriers they  		experience. Third, we continue with descriptions of those grantees whose major  		contribution to full-day care is in brokering or coordinating such services in  		the community. Finally, we conclude with discussions of the grantees now  		involved in work-welfare.</p>
<h4>1. Grantees Providing Full-Day Care and  		Comprehensive Services to All Families</h4>
<p> Several of the grantees in the sample offer multiple schedules of  		operation for children. They provide substantial assistance to working and  		non-working parents in search of appropriate child care. Three agencies that  		belong in this category are funded wholly by Head Start.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 Gulf Coast Community Services Association</strong></p>
<p> The first example is the Houston, Texas grantee, Gulf Coast community  		Services Association, which offers the following schedules of operation.</p>
<ul><li>For infants and toddlers, a Parent and Child Center (PCC) full-day  		  program (up to 9 hours a day, 5 days a week) for 40 children.</li>
<li>For infants and toddlers, a second PCC home-based program for 60  		  children.</li>
<li>A home-based Head Start program for 277 3- to 5-year-old children.  		  Most of these children live in the more rural parts of the county where it is  		  difficult to establish centers; many of the children are 3-years-old and the  		  grantee Director feels that a year in the home-based option strengthens the  		  family and prepares the child for a second year in a center-based program.</li>
<li>A part-day Head Start option (5 1/2 hours a day, 4 days a week) for  		  582 3- to 5-year-old children. These Head Start children come to center-based  		  programs in different parts of the county for part of the day and then return  		  home to at least one non-working parent.</li>
<li>A second part-day Head Start option (4 hours a day, 5 days a week)  		  for 16 3- to 5-year-old children. This classroom was established because a  		  number of the handicapped children served by the grantee could not manage the 5  		  1/2 hours a day in the variation in center attendance option. The part-day  		  classroom has about 60 percent handicapped children, mainstreamed with  		  non-handicapped children. At least one parent of each child is at home during  		  the day, so children will return home to a supervised environment.</li>
<li>A full-day Head Start option (up to 11 1/2 hours a day, 5 days a  		  week) for 1,486 3- to 5-year-old children whose parents are employed, in school  		  or in training. This option operates 12 months a year for children who need a  		  full year of care.</li>
</ul><p>The Head Start program operates 12 months a year, but only about half of  		the classes continue during the summer months. Several years ago all children  		attended this grantee for a full day. However, as Head Start has cut back on  		full-day programs and asked for a justification for each child enrolled in the  		option, the Houston grantee has created its home-based and part-day  		schedules.</p>
<p> The child care services of the Houston grantee, thus, provide for the  		needs of many families. If a parent is at home, the program provides a  		comprehensive child development program for child and family. If parents work,  		the grantee offers full-day care for infants, toddlers and older preschoolers.  		Children in need of full-year care have that opportunity. It would appear that  		grantee staff have evaluated the needs of Houston low income families and  		adapted their program to suit the varying requirements. Their vision or purpose  		is not simply to provide Head Start, but also to look at the wider needs of  		families making a transition to economic self-sufficiency.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Albina Ministerial Alliance</strong></p>
<p> A second example of a Head Start grantee assisting working parents is  		provided by the Portland, Oregon grantee, Albina Ministerial Alliance. This is  		the only grantee in the sample who offers a single schedule for all children.  		That is, all 200 3- and 4-year-old children served by this grantee follow a  		full-day schedule where the centers are open from 7:00 am to 5:30 pm, 5 days a  		week, 9 months a year. All parents of these children are working, in training,  		or enrolled in an educational program.</p>
<p> The reason this grantee can offer only this full-day schedule is that  		there is another, much larger Head Start grantee in Portland, the Portland  		Public Schools. All of the schedules of this grantee are part-day. In effect,  		then, the varying child care needs of families in the city of Portland are  		being met through multiple schedules of operation. It just happens that in this  		instance, as opposed to the Houston example, the different schedules are  		operated by different grantees. When staff at Albina Ministerial Alliance  		envisioned their Head Start offerings, they examined the offerings of the  		community, isolated the particularly strong needs of low income working  		families, and designed a Head Start model to meet those needs.</p>
<p> One difficulty that the Albina Ministerial Alliance has in trying to  		meet family needs is that they cannot operate 12 months a year. They began  		their operation of Head Start with a 12-month schedule, but recent budget  		constraints have meant that the program had to choose between reducing the  		number of children it served or its length of service. The Director says that  		parents find a friend or relative to care for their children during the summer  		months.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Human Development Corporation of Metropolitan St. Louis  		</strong></p>
<p> A third example of a Head Start program with a strong commitment to  		meeting the needs of working parents is the St. Louis grantee, Human  		Development Corporation of Metropolitan St. Louis. It offers multiple schedules  		of operation, including both care in centers and in family day care homes. In  		particular, it offers three Head Start options for 3- to 5-year-olds:</p>
<ul><li>a part-day option (3 1/2 hours a day, 4 days a week, 9 months a year)  		  for 1,911 children who have at least one parent at home during the day;</li>
<li>a full-day center-based option (10 hours a day, 5 days a week, 10  		  months a year) for 180 children whose parents are employed or in training.  		  There is one such classroom in each of 9 different centers, spread around the  		  city; and</li>
<li>a full-day schedule (10 hours a day, 5 days a week, 12 months a year)  		  in 15 family day care homes, for 134 children of working parents.</li>
</ul><p>Once a family is accepted for full-day services, the parent can decide  		whether the child enters center or home care. Some parents feel that their  		child will receive more attention in a home or they like the atmosphere of a  		home better. The grantee's Director feels that a parent knows his/her child  		best and should be able to choose the more appropriate kind of care. One factor  		in a parent's choice may be that the centers close for two months in the summer  		while the day care homes remain open.</p>
<p> Thus far, the examples have included grantees whose full-day program is  		paid for by Head Start. The next two examples discuss grantees that operate  		full-day child care paid for completely by other sources.</p>
<p><strong>1.4 Upper Arkansas Area Council of Governments</strong></p>
<p> The first of the grantees in this category is the Cannon City, Colorado  		grantee, Upper Arkansas Area Council of Governments. It operates one schedule  		for Head Start children and another for Title XX children, and the two  		operations complement each other successfully in being able to provide families  		with important services:</p>
<ul><li>a part-day Head Start option (4 hours a day, 4 days a week, 8 months  		  a year) for 60 4-year-old children; and</li>
<li>a full-day Title XX program (12 hours a day, 5 days a week, 12 months  		  a year) for another 60 children ranging in age from 2 1/2 to 13 years (a  		  retarded child).</li>
</ul><p>This grantee is located in a rural area where the bus travels about 175  		miles a day to transport the Head Start children. Before they initiated their  		Title XX program (in 1979), they had some problems with children whose parents  		did not come to meet the bus. The driver had to transport the children back to  		the center and a teacher had to wait with the children until a parent came to  		pick them up. Now, with Title XX, a Head Start child who is not met at the bus  		will return to the Title XX classroom where there are other children,  		activities and appropriate supervision.</p>
<p> Also, grantee staff try to extend comprehensive services to all of the  		families, whether children are in day care or Head Start. The Social  		Services/Parent Involvement Coordinator does family needs assessment of day  		care families and provides referrals; screenings and immunization sessions  		include all children. Two day care parents serve on the Policy Council; Head  		Start parents help fund the day care effort with fund raisers. Although Head  		Start and Title XX may be operated as separate fiscal entities with separate  		program schedules, they may also help each other provide important  		services.</p>
<p><strong>1.5 Androscoggin County Head Start</strong></p>
<p> A second example of a successful meshing of part-day Head Start and  		full-day services paid out of other sources is provided by the Lewiston, Maine  		grantee, Androscoggin County Head Start, Inc. It offers the following  		schedules:</p>
<ul><li>a part-day Head Start program (4 hours a day, 5 days a week, 8 1/2  		  months a year) for 117 4-year-olds;</li>
<li>a home-based Head Start program for 50 4-year-olds;</li>
<li>a part-day "Head Start-like" program (4 hours a day, 5 days a week, 8  		  1/2 months a year) for an additional 47 4-year-olds funded by the state of  		  Maine. These children are commingled with the children funded by Head  		  Start;</li>
<li>a full-day program in about 12 family day care homes for 40 children  		  6 weeks old to 3 1/2 years old paid for by Title XX and parents on a sliding  		  fee scale. The agency trains providers, monitors the homes on an "irregular"  		  basis, and acts as the sponsor for USDA funds;</li>
<li>a full-day center-based program (12 months a year) for 100 3 1/2 to  		  5-year-old children, funded by the cities of Lewiston and Auburn for their  		  children; and</li>
<li>a before- and after-kindergarten program for 30 children  		  (kindergarten is only 2 hours long), jointly funded by United Way and parent  		  fees.</li>
</ul><p> Both working and non-working mothers are served by this grantee. A  		working mother may enter her child in the infant program at 6 weeks, see the  		child graduate to a center-based program at 3 1/2 years, and then to the  		before- and after-kindergarten program in that first year of schooling.</p>
<p> The agency tries to provide comprehensive services to all of its  		families. The day care children are required to have a physical exam before  		entering the program and their families are encouraged to come to clinics  		(offered by the grantee) where a full gamut of screenings are given. There are  		some other monies in the community for health services, if children require  		follow-up treatment. The agency's social services staff help day care parents  		by providing referrals and encouraging parent involvement. For example, the  		agency hires a Social Worker for 16 hours a week. She conducts the STEP program  		for parents in Head Start or day care.</p>
<p> There are some differences in services to day care and Head Start  		children. Follow-up medical treatment for Head Start children is paid for by  		the grantee; day care families must seek payment from another agency and it nay  		not be forthcoming. Head Start parents are offered "therapies" that are not  		available to the day care families. Yet, this grantee has managed to put  		together a package of services for all families that is more comprehensive than  		what is officially authorized under Title XX.</p>
<p><strong>1.6 Schuylkill County Child Development, Inc.</strong></p>
<p> When other funding sources are combined with Head Start to support  		full-day schedules, grantees may offer services to families in a number of  		creative ways. For example, in Schuylkill Haven, Pennsylvania, Schuylkill  		County Child Development, Inc. receives child care funding from Head Start,  		Title XX, the county and from fee-paying parents. Their program has the  		following options.</p>
<ul><li>A part-day Head Start program (4 1/2 hours a day, 5 days a week, 9  		  months a year) is offered for 287 3- to 5-year-old children.</li>
<li>A full-day Title XX program (up to 12 hours a day, 5 days a week) is  		  offered for 350 children, infants through school age, who are placed in about  		  15 family day care homes and 10 centers. A staff member from the grantee  		  monitors all placements and provides technical assistance to providers.</li>
<li>A newly funded Head Start program for 68 of the Title XX children is  		  available. All of these 3- to 5-year-old children are Head Start-eligible, but  		  in need of full-day care. At a cost of about $300 per child, the grantee  		  supplies all of the needed services to bring their day care program up to the  		  standards of Head Start.</li>
<li>A private tuition program has been initiated for families desiring  		  Head Start services, but whose income is above the poverty guidelines for Head  		  Start and Title XX. These parents are given the option of paying tuition so  		  that their children can join the grantee's program and receive the full gamut  		  of Head Start services.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the grantee receives funding from the county under a mental  		health grant to mainstream "at risk" children, such as those with emotional  		problems or those in families with risk of child abuse.</p>
<p> This grantee has, thus, managed to combine its funding sources to  		ensure that families in need -- whatever their income level and subsidy -- can  		receive the comprehensive services they require. The Director feels that Title  		XX is satisfied because children are receiving the day care they are supposed  		to receive. Head Start Regional staff are pleased that the grantee has been  		able to increase its enrollment at such a modest cost for the 68 Title XX  		children whose services are enhanced.</p>
<p><strong>1.7 Westchester Community Opportunity Program</strong></p>
<p> Another grantee with a creative combination of offerings is Westchester  		Community Opportunity Program, White Plains, New York. This grantee serves  		1,400 children ranging from infants through age 11. The options for  		preschoolers are as follows.</p>
<ul><li>A full-day Title XX program (10 hours a day, 5 days a week, 12 months  		  a year) is available for 60 infants and toddlers.</li>
<li>A part-day Head Start program (3 1/4 hours a day, 5 days a week, 10  		  months a year, double sessions) is offered for about 680 3- and  		  4-year-olds.</li>
<li>A full-day Head Start program (10 hours a day, 5 days a week, 12  		  months a year) is offered for about 267 3- and 4-year-olds who are commingled  		  with Title XX children.</li>
<li>A full-day Title XX program (10 hours a day, 5 days a week, 12 months  		  a year) is available for about 300 3- and 4-year-olds commingled in classrooms  		  with the Head Start full-day children.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the grantee is the fiscal operator of the Title XX program  		for family day care reimbursement. Though grantee staff do not monitor the  		operation of the family day care homes, they work closely with the local child  		care council (next door) to ensure that this form of full-day care is working  		smoothly for low income families.</p>
<p> Two other practices of the Westchester grantee are particularly  		noteworthy. First, classrooms at some of the centers accept fee-paying  		children. The agency uses the Title XX scale for setting parent fees, so that  		fees increase as family income increases. Second, the grantee provides  		comprehensive services to all income-eligible children. That is, all of the  		"Title XX" children whose families are eligible for Head Start are also counted  		as "Head Start" children and receive the full range of Head Start services.  		Since all 3- and 4-year-olds, regardless of the source of payment for their  		care, are in the same classrooms, this means that programming for all children  		can follow the Head Start plan. As was true in Schuylkill Haven, the cost of  		"Head Start" for the "Title XX" children is very low; it is the additional cost  		of comprehensive services, above and beyond the cost of child care reimbursed  		by Title XX.</p>
<p><strong>1.8 Summary</strong></p>
<p> Each of these seven grantees is first and foremost a Head Start  		grantee. Each has assessed the needs of its community and developed a program  		to meet those needs. One of the differences between these grantees and other  		Head Start grantees is in the with priority they have given to the child care  		needs of families working parents.</p>
<p> Whether the need has been met by funding from Head Start or through  		other sources, the grantees have put together a package of offerings that  		provide longer hours of care for children who need them. In addition, these  		grantees have been able to provide a broad package of comprehensive services to  		all families. Their vision of their role would seem to be to serve low income  		families at the highest level of quality possible.</p>
<h4>2. Grantees Experiencing Barriers to  		Providing Needed Full-Day Care and Comprehensive Services</h4>
<p> Many of the grantees that provide some full-day child care services  		share the vision of those discussed above and would like to provide all low  		income families with the services they need. However, they feel limited by a  		lack of funding, limitations set by Title XX with regard to the population to  		be served and by Head start with regard to full-day services, or by constraints  		imposed by other Title XX practices.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Lack of Funding for Full-Day Slots</strong></p>
<p> Lack of extensive funding of child care slots out of Social Service  		Block Grant (Title XX) funds seems a barrier in some states. For example, the  		Director of the Missoula, Montana Head Start grantee (Child Start, Inc.)  		reports that Montana uses Title XX for aging programs and for assistance to the  		developmentally disabled. In keeping with national policy, the Head Start  		Regional Office requires justification for each child served in a full-day  		program and more willingly funds part-day care. This grantee is able to offer  		only a small number of Head Start children full-day services, and does not  		begin to meet the need. Its schedules of operation are as follows.</p>
<ul><li>A full-day program is offered (10 hours a day, 4 days a week, 10  		  months a year) for 35 3- and 4-year-old children in families where both parents  		  are working or in training programs.</li>
<li>A part-day schedule (3 or 3 1/2 hours a day, 4 days a week, 7 months  		  a year) is offered for 119 4-year-old children, some of whom have working  		  parents.</li>
<li>A home-based option for an additional 78 4-year-old children is  		  available.</li>
</ul><p>Because of budget difficulties, the full-day option operates on a  		4-day-a-week, part year schedule, so parents must make alternative arrangements  		for child care on Mondays during the year and for the entire week during the  		summer months. Children in the part-day option in need of full-day care get  		transported by Head Start to other centers, family day care homes, or other  		approved homes. These children must then be in two different child care  		situations each day. The grantee Director would like to increase his full-day  		care, but is having difficulty finding sources interested in funding the extra  		hours of care.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Restrictions in Eligibility for Title XX Slots </strong></p>
<p> A second barrier to providing full-day services to all families in need  		is created by the different goals and objectives of Head Start and Title XX.  		Different families are eligible for the two programs and different services are  		authorized for the families. Head Start tries to serve the poorest of the poor;  		Title XX serves families with working parents. Head Start provides  		comprehensive services; Title XX provides day care. In the following four  		examples grantees have discovered that there may be gaps between these two  		sources that mean that some families in need cannot receive appropriate  		services.</p>
<p><strong><em>2.2.1 Harambee Child Development Council</em></strong></p>
<p> In the state of Georgia, for example, Title XX slots are reserved for  		families where the parent is actively looking for work. Each parent has 90 days  		to find a job. If the parent has not located employment in that time, the child  		is removed from Title XX care. If the parent does find employment, the child  		may stay in care for six months, after which the parent must make alternative  		care arrangements. This means that there is tremendous turn-over of children in  		Title XX centers. In addition, there are many low income working parents in  		need of subsidized care and who cannot find it.</p>
<p> In the Albany, Georgia Head Start grantee, Harambee Child Development  		Council, the Head Start program offers working parents a full-day option.  		Specifically, the grantee serves 425 3- to 5-year-old children, generally for 6  		hours a day, 5 days a week, 9 months a year. But 60 children of working parents  		stay in the classroom an extra two hours a day. The Director believes that  		full-day care would be useful for many more of the families where parents would  		like to enter education or training programs, but cannot find affordable child  		care. However, the Regional Office has suggested cutting full-day slots and the  		grantee Director says that she must argue annually to keep any of the children  		in full-day care. She would also like to return to a full year of service, as  		she is worried about the summer care arrangements of many of the children.</p>
<p><strong><em>2.2.2 Ninth District Opportunity, Inc.</em></strong></p>
<p> The Gainesville, Georgia grantee, Ninth District Opportunity, Inc., has  		responded differently to these state Title XX requirements. The grantee has  		historically operated part-day center-based and home-based Head Start programs  		in a 17 county area as well as a full-day Title XX program. As the Director has  		found other sponsors for Title XX, she has transferred centers to those  		sponsors. At the present time, then, staff manage three different schedules,  		the first two paid for by Head Start and the third one (in two counties only)  		by Title XX.</p>
<ul><li>A part-day Head Start option (5 1/2 hours a day, 5 days a week, 9  		  months a year) provides services for 1,045 3- to 5-year-old children, generally  		  housed in school buildings and operating on the sane schedule as the school  		  system.</li>
<li>A home-based Head Start option for 100 3- to 5-year-old children is  		  operated in rural areas where it has not been possible to establish  		  centers.</li>
<li>A full-day Title XX program (12 hours a day, 5 days a week, 12 months  		  a year) is offered for 186 children in two centers. The age range for these  		  children is 6 months to 5 years.</li>
</ul><p> There is little coordination between Title XX and Head Start. Title XX  		simply offers day care for a small group of children of parents actively  		looking for work or newly employed. Head Start offers comprehensive services to  		families with at least one non-working parent. A large number of low income  		families in need of child care are not served by either program.</p>
<p><strong><em>2.2.3 Community Progress Council</em></strong></p>
<p> Pennsylvania has still different rules for Title XX that, for some  		grantee Directors, seem to create gaps in providing appropriate services to  		families. The York, Pennsylvania grantee, Community Progress Council, used to  		operate some full-day Head Start and full-day Title XX child care, but has  		recently been required by the Regional Office to change all center-based Head  		Start to part-day. The Director has set up the following schedules to try to  		serve the families in the community:</p>
<ul><li>a part-day Head Start option (3 1/2 hours a day, 4 days a week,  		  double sessions, 9 months a year) for 180 4-year-old children;</li>
<li>a second part-day Head Start option (4 1/2 hours a day, 4 days a  		  week, 9 months a year) for 72 4-year-old children;</li>
<li>a home-based Head Start option for 65 4-year-old children;</li>
<li>a full-day Title XX program (11 hours a day, 5 days a week, 12 months  		  a year) for 60 3- tp 5-year-old children. This is supplemented by a before- and  		  after-school program for 30 6- to 7-year-olds; and</li>
<li>a full-day schedule (11 hours a day, 5 days a week, 12 months a year)  		  for 18 3- to 5-year-old children whose parents pay $35 a week for their  		  care.</li>
</ul><p> Even these variations do not supply adequate full-day service for the  		community. First, when Head Start converted to part-day, there was no increase  		in Title XX slots to accommodate the working parents in need of full-day care.  		Second, many parents in need of full-day care do not meet the Title XX  		requirements for eligibility. Specifically, Title XX requires that, if both  		parents are in the home, both must be working or in an approved training  		program (unless one parent is certified as disabled). If there is one parent in  		the home, that person must be working or in training. Families that are  		ineligible include, for example, the following.</p>
<ul><li>Those two-parent families where one parent is working and the other  		  is not an appropriate caregiver. The non-working parent may be an alcoholic, a  		  drug abuser, or in some way abusive to the child. Title XX in Pennsylvania does  		  not have a special category to allow these families to be served.</li>
<li>Those single-parent families where the parent is disabled. Title XX  		  says that, in this case, Children &amp; Youth Services should be responsible  		  for the child's care. But that agency only has money for temporary placements,  		  and these are generally not with Head Start, since its programs are only  		  part-day. Parents could benefit from Head Start for a full year if Head Start  		  were still full-day.</li>
<li>Those families where one parent is in a "non-approved" program. For  		  example, most 4-year-college and some 2-year-college programs are not approved.  		  Only programs that lead to specific credentials are permissible.</li>
</ul><p> The fee-paying class was designed to accommodate parents who were not  		eligible for Title XX, but needed full-day care. The class is fully enrolled,  		but the grantee is having some difficulty in collecting payment for their child  		care services. Thus, while for the grantee Director is trying to meet the  		community's needs child care, he is finding the situation very difficult. Head  		Start is not allowing full-day schedules in his Region; Title XX allows many  		families to "slip through the cracks"; fee-paying programs are of limited use  		when families can ill afford to pay for child care.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Title XX Lacks Comprehensive Services</strong></p>
<p> Even when grantees offer a significant number of full-day slots, they  		may not be able to offer comprehensive services to all families. They may have  		clear distinctions between Head Start and Title XX programs and provide the  		specific set of services required by each funding source for its children.  		Jewett City, Connecticut (Thames Valley Council for Community Action), for  		instance, has three Head Start options and two very different Title XX  		programs.</p>
<ul><li>A part-day Head Start option (3 hours a day, 4 days a week, 10 months  		  a year, double sessions) is available for 333 3- and 4-year-old children.</li>
<li>A home-based Head Start option for 45 infants and toddlers (often  		  with special needs) and 45 3- and 4-year-old children is offered which also  		  runs for 10 months.</li>
<li>A program for teen parents, is available, jointly funded by Head  		  Start and the New London school system, where Head Start inputs its standards  		  into the child care facility (for about 20 children) and works with parents on  		  parenting skills and the parents continue to attend high school.</li>
<li>A full-day Title XX program (10 hours a day, 5 days a week, 12 months  		  a year) is operated for 320 children in centers. Most of these children are 3  		  and 4 years of age.</li>
<li>The grantee sponsors a network of 120 family day care homes, some of  		  which enroll Title XX children. Preschoolers of all ages are included in these  		  homes.</li>
</ul><p>The schedules of operation are different for Head Start and Title XX. In  		addition, staffing and space are not shared. The Title XX centers are in  		different locations from the Head Start centers.</p>
<p> In this scenario less emphasis is placed on health, social services,  		and parent involvement activities for Title XX families. It is difficult to  		coordinate Head Start and Title XX services for individual children whose  		mothers are in transition to employment. For example, if a Head Start mother  		goes to work or enters an education/training program, her only option is to  		withdraw from Head Start. There is no transportation system that allows for the  		transfer of her child from a part-day Head Start classroom to a Title XX  		facility, and no provision is made for extended hours of care in Head Start.  		The schedule of Head Start classes and the program of parent involvement  		assumes that mothers are home during the day.</p>
<p> There is some interaction, however, among Head Start, Title XX center  		care, and the network of day care homes. During recruitment, families come to  		one place to find out about their options. A staff member is trained to listen  		to the family's needs and match the needs and types of child care. In addition,  		the agency operates the foster grandparent program and places grandparents in  		both day care and Head Start. While there is a separate Director for Head Start  		and day care, there is also one individual, jointly funded by the programs,  		whose responsibility is to facilitate exchanges between them.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 Problems in Title XX Recruitment and Payment Practices  		</strong></p>
<p> An additional barrier to increasing full-day services was cited by one  		grantee that has had tremendous difficulty with the recruiting and payment  		practices of their local Title XX program. The Title XX staff reserve the right  		to do all recruiting, so the grantee cannot speak with potential clients as  		they enter the program. The grantee usually has a number of empty slots. Since  		Title XX only pays for slots which are filled, the grantee suffers  		financially.</p>
<p> The Cedar Rapids, Iowa grantee, Hawkeye Area Community Action Program,  		offers the following schedules for 3- to 5-year-old children:</p>
<ul><li>a home-based Head Start option for 72 children lasting 9 months;</li>
<li>a part-day Head Start schedule (3 hours a day, 4 days a week, 9  		  months a year) for 95 children;</li>
<li>a second part-day Head Start schedule (3 hours a day, 4 days a week,  		  9 months a year, double sessions) for 128 children;</li>
<li>a full-day Head Start program (10 hours a day, 5 days a week, 12  		  months a year) for 36 children; and</li>
<li>a full-day Title XX schedule (10 hours a day, 5 days a week, 12  		  months a year) for 20 children, commingled with the full-day Head Start  		  children.</li>
</ul><p> The 56 full-day children were to be combined into 4 classes which would  		be jointly funded by Head Start and Title XX. However, only 12 Title XX slots  		are filled, meaning that only 3 classes can actually be operated. While the  		other slots can be filled with Head Start children (their families would like  		full-day services), the grantee will not receive additional money from Head  		Start for the additional children. And Title XX pays for children only when the  		slot is filled by a Title XX child. The problem with filling the Title XX slots  		appears to be threefold.</p>
<ul><li>There are many child care centers in Iowa City where Title XX slots  		  are available. The major users of Title XX are students at the University, but  		  the centers operated by Head Start are not near the University.</li>
<li>The Head Start centers only serve 3- to 5-year-old children; several  		  other centers accept younger siblings as well.</li>
<li>The Title XX office provides eligible parents with a list of all  		  available slots and lets the parent choose which location would be best.  		  Because of the distance to the Head Start centers and their restricted age  		  range for children, too few Title XX parents elect Head Start centers.</li>
</ul><p> The Title XX children who are enrolled in Head Start centers receive  		the full range of Head Start services, so there is an advantage for Title XX  		parents in choosing these centers.</p>
<p> The difficulties which the grantee's Director has experienced with  		full-day services have led her to the conclusion that her program may be better  		off <strong>brokering</strong> full-day services rather than  		<strong>providing</strong> them. Having insufficient Title XX children to fill  		classrooms has meant she has had to hire and then release staff, and is now  		having trouble finding qualified people. She feels that the grantee operates an  		excellent part-day Head Start program, and night extend full-day services  		better through brokering them. To this end, the agency has developed a new  		program to recruit and train family day care providers. They have about 175  		homes involved to date, of which about 25 involve Head Start parents. These  		homes can coordinate with part-day Head Start to assist families with working  		parents. And they provide work opportunities for other Head Start parents who  		are now paid to care for children.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 Belief That Head Start Should Not Be Full-Day</strong></p>
<p> The final barrier is of a different nature: some grantee Directors do  		not see resolving the child care issues of working parents as a part of their  		mandate. These grantees may provide a limited set of full-day services, but  		they are for a group of children in a specific set of circumstances (e.g.,  		those with teen parents still in school). And these services are ancillary to  		their main goal of providing Head Start to low income families.</p>
<p> One Chicago, Illinois grantee, the Ounce of Prevention Fund, is an  		example of a grantee which is not in the business of providing full-day care to  		children of working parents. They provide a part-day Head Start program (3  		hours a day, 4 days a week, 8 months a year, double sessions) for 700  		4-year-olds. And, they participate in the Parents Too Soon program, funded by  		the state of Illinois. The goals of the program are to ensure that teen mothers  		get good health care for themselves during their pregnancy and for their  		children during the first two years of the child's life, that the mothers stay  		in school or receive some job training and are trained in parenting skills, and  		that mothers have access to day care during school or training hours. The ounce  		provides some child care and training in parenting skills.</p>
<p> When asked about serving the working parents of Head Start children,  		the Director was clear that this was not her job. Her understanding is that  		national Head Start does not want its money spent on full-day services and also  		does not want its grantees to offer any "combination" programs where Head Start  		would pay for part of the day and Title XX or another source would pay for the  		remainder of the day. She believes that any expansion of services to help  		provide care needed by work-welfare recipients would be very difficult and  		costly; it is not in her plans.</p>
<h4>3. Grantees Brokering Full-day Services</h4>
<p> The process of brokering or coordinating full-day services for children  		is well represented by the three grantees whose only full-day services are  		provided in family day care homes. It may appear from their lack of full-day  		center care that they have a limited commitment to assisting working parents;  		however, this may not be the case, as will be described in this section.</p>
<p><strong>3.1 Broome County Child Development Council</strong></p>
<p> The Binghamton, New York grantee, Broome County Child Development  		Council, offers a Head Start program for 205 children with funds from national  		Head Start and the City of Binghamton:</p>
<ul><li>a part-day program (3 hours a day, 4 days a week, 10 months a year,  		  double sessions) for 153 4-year-olds, of whom 22 are funded by the city of  		  Binghamton;</li>
<li>a home-based program for 36 families with 3-year-olds; and</li>
<li>a locally designed option for 16 children who are usually recommended  		  by Child Protective Services (CPS). These children are placed in licensed  		  family day care homes; Head Start staff visit the homes regularly as they would  		  families in a home-based program, train the providers, and ensure that children  		  receive the gamut of required Head Start services.</li>
</ul><p>Thus, the only provision of full-day services is made to this special  		population of children recommended by CPS. It may appear that the grantee  		offers a very limited set of services for working parents. However, rather than  		provide more full-day care for children, this grantee has chosen to take a role  		in the community of brokering care. Its services in this category include the  		following:</p>
<ul><li>employer sponsored referral services where staff help employees of  		  specific businesses to locate appropriate child care, counsel parents, and  		  train providers;</li>
<li>operation of a child care resource and referral service in which  		  parents can call the grantee and receive a list of local centers and family day  		  care homes that meet their requirements for regular child care or respite  		  care;</li>
<li>a Day Care Development Program to increase the number of licensed  		  family day care providers in the area; the grantee recruits providers, supplies  		  training, sees new providers through the licensing process, monitors their  		  progress, and lists them in the CCR&amp;R service;</li>
<li>a peer support network for parents with particular problems, funded  		  by the Office of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities in which parents  		  are trained as peer counselors and matched with other parents sharing their  		  problems with a handicapped child or family in trouble;</li>
<li>coordination of school-aged child care, helping to establish new  		  programs, providing technical assistance to existing programs, and connect  		  families with appropriate care;</li>
<li>a teen parent program like Head Start's home-based option, with young  		  teens who are at risk to be early parents in a pregnancy prevention program in  		  an intermediate school, and helping older teens who are at risk gain employment  		  skills by placing them in a school age child care program where they are paid  		  and provided training in child development and parenting skills.</li>
</ul><p> This grantee has identified strong needs for quality child care in the  		area and has chosen to coordinate care for the county, help improve the quality  		of existing care, and provide support to families in need of care.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 South Plains Community Action Agency</strong></p>
<p> A second grantee which shares the goals of brokering (coordinating)  		care and improving its quality is in Levelland, Texas: South Plains Community  		Action Agency. It offers two traditional Head Start options and one locally  		designed one.</p>
<ul><li>Part-day programs (either 3 1/2 hours per day, double sessions, or 6  		  hours a day, 5 days a week, 10 months a year) are available for 200  		  4-year-olds.</li>
<li>A home-based option is offered to serve 80 4-year-olds.</li>
<li>A new option where 56 4-year-olds are placed in 16 licensed family  		  day care homes was recently started. Head Start staff work with the home  		  providers in the same way they would a family in the home-based program. Home  		  visits are conducted once a week with the provider and child, "center days" are  		  organized about once a month. Title XX pays for the day care hours; Head Start  		  pays for the home visitor and for health and social services for the child and  		  family.</li>
</ul><p>This expansion of Head Start into family day care homes is a part of a  		larger brokerage system managed by the grantee. They help find care in centers  		or in homes for CPS children, for preschoolers of working parents, and for  		children in need of after-school care. The system is paid for out of Title XX  		discretionary funds. If a Head Start child needs additional hours of care, he  		or she may be transported to a family day care home after part-day Head  		Start.</p>
<p> Grantee staff are also examining other options for providing full-day  		care or improving current services. They may work with military staff in the  		area or local corporations to set up new centers and train staff. They may  		allow and encourage teachers in the state of Texas' program for 4-year-olds to  		attend training sessions held at the grantee. Staff are actively involved in  		the day care community and examining ways to extend its services further.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 W.S.O.S. Community Action Commission, Inc.</strong></p>
<p> The specific goal of improving the quality of care in the community  		also guided the "brokering" arrangement set up by the Fremont, Ohio grantee,  		W.S.O.S. Community Action Commission, Inc. They have traditionally offered the  		following Head Start services:</p>
<ul><li>a part-day program (3.5 hours a day, 4 days a week, 8 months a year)  		  for 255 4-year-olds; and</li>
<li>a home-based program for 216 3- and 4-year-olds.</li>
</ul><p> Under an innovative grant funded for 1985-87, they added a full-day  		family day care home option for 12 4-year-old children. Grantee staff recruited  		existing licensed providers, some of whom had Head Start-eligible children,  		others of whom had slots in which Head Start children could be placed. The  		grant allowed for providers to be trained and supplied them with extra funding  		for supplying 4 hours a day of "Head Start programming" to children. In  		addition, Head Start grantee staff visited the home regularly with materials  		and provided assistance in developing lesson plans.</p>
<p> The impetus for designing this innovative program came from feelings on  		the part of the grantee's staff that many working parents in the community  		needed longer hours of care, that the grantee could not finance much of that  		care, and that family day care home providers now in the position to offer  		full-day care could benefit significantly from the kind of training that Head  		Start was able to provide. With the end of the innovative funding from Head  		Start, grantee staff are considering other options for improving child care for  		working parents. They are looking into ways in which their centers can offer  		more hours of care, the possibility of operating the network of homes that are  		providing slots for Title XX children, or the option of continuing to act as  		trainers for providers, able to reach all 60 day care homes in the community  		instead of only the 12 funded by Head Start. Such an operation might involve  		collecting parent fees, designing a resource and referral system, monitoring  		all homes and acting as credentialling agent for homes.</p>
<h4>4. Grantees in States With Work-Welfare  		Programs</h4>
<p> In the grantees discussed thus far the impetus for full-day care came  		largely from the community where working parents were in need of such services  		and from grantee staff who wanted to improve the quality of services offered.  		In this last group of four grantees an added incentive was provided by the  		coming of work-welfare legislation within the state. The first three of the  		grantees (Wanaque, New Jersey; Greeley, Colorado; Visalia, California)  		participated in the planning for work-welfare at the county level, and fit  		their models for provision of services into the larger plan conceived at the  		county level. They have very different programs, each responding to its own set  		of community needs. The fourth grantee (Sacramento, California) did not  		participate in county planning for child care and is not certain how it will  		eventually participate.</p>
<p><strong>4.1 Upper Passaic County Head Start</strong></p>
<p> The Wanaque, New Jersey program, Upper Passaic County Head Start, is a  		single purpose agency. It has traditionally offered three different part-day  		schedules for 3- and 4-year-olds (paid for by Head Start):</p>
<ul><li>for 34 children, classrooms operating 6 hours a day, 5 days a week  		  for 9 months a year;</li>
<li>for 34 children, split-session classes where one group of children  		  come to the center 5 hours a day, 3 days a week in the fall and another group  		  comes 5 hours a day, 2 days a week. In the spring the two groups change  		  schedules; and</li>
<li>for 68 children, double-session classes in which each child comes to  		  the center 3 hours a day, 5 days a week, 9 months a year.</li>
</ul><p>Under an innovative grant three years ago, Head Start allowed the  		grantee to extend the hours of service for one classroom (17 children). Head  		Start paid for 6 hours for children; the county paid for an additional 3 hours.  		The goal was to help parents become economically self-sufficient; in fact, 95  		percent of them entered training programs or employment.</p>
<p> When the Governor of New Jersey began the state's work-welfare program  		(REACH), he held hearings about potential problems and heard a great deal about  		child care issues. He created two kinds of child care dollars: some to support  		Head Start-like child care and some to go to private care providers (many of  		whom already had Title XX children enrolled). The grantee Director from Wanaque  		participated in the county planning process and has received a grant of "Head  		Start-like dollars" to extend the hours of the day for two of her  		classrooms.</p>
<p> Head Start will pay for 5 hours of programming each day, the county an  		additional 5. Head Start lasts nine months a year and the county will support  		the two extended day classrooms for the additional months. All children will  		continue to receive comprehensive Head Start services as they all will continue  		to be "Head Start" children, at least for part of the day and part of the year.  		In this first example, the Head Start Director developed a program to assist  		low income working parents by drawing on her current Head Start resource's and  		simply extending the hours of the day that two classrooms were open.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Weld County Commissioners</strong></p>
<p> In the second example, the Head Start Director worked just as closely  		with county officials to design an appropriate program, and came up with a very  		different concatenation of services. In Greeley, Colorado, the Weld County  		Commissioners are the Head Start grantee. The grantee has traditionally offered  		two Head Start options:</p>
<ul><li>a part-day program (3 1/2 hours a day, 4 days a week, September to  		  May, double sessions) for 300 4-year-olds; and</li>
<li>a full-day program (9 hours a day, 5 days a week, May to October) for  		  up to 250 Migrant children from infancy through age 5.</li>
</ul><p>Because they are asked to keep migrant children who are sick, grantee  		staff have acquired appropriate licensing to care for sick children. Because  		migrant children are placed with the grantee from infancy through age five, the  		grantee is licensed to deal with all of these ages. When the work-welfare  		planning process began, the grantee was, thus, in position to be able to help  		the community.</p>
<p> When the county began planning for the state's "Welfare Diversion  		Program", staff organized a Child Care Network, calling in all providers who  		were interested in caring for children of mothers in the program. The county  		staff said that they could not afford to pay the cost of private child care.  		Private providers said they could not afford to take welfare diversion children  		at the fixed rate offered. The Network discussed various line items of cost.  		Transportation was a major expense item for providers. Therefore, the county  		agreed to transport welfare diversion children. With this arrangement, many  		local providers agreed to open slots for welfare diversion children and the  		county found a sufficient number of existing slots for most of the children of  		program participants.</p>
<p> The role assumed by Head Start is one which complements child care  		services offered by other community agencies. First, some Head Start parents  		wanted their children to remain in the program. The grantee has some classrooms  		where children can remain for the full day. Second, the grantee offers infant  		care for 8 to 10 children of welfare diversion mothers in its licensed  		facility. Third, it offers care for sick children, whether they are a part of  		Head Start or a private day care class. Lastly, it will take children of  		mothers in transition into the welfare diversion program. A mother just  		entering the program may want her child placed in a particular center that is  		expecting an opening in a month; the Head Start grantee will take the child as  		a temporary placement until the permanent slot opens up.</p>
<p> Hence, it may not appear upon first glance that the Weld County grantee  		is participating extensively in the welfare diversion program. It only has a  		classroom of infants, care for sick children, care for a few children in  		transition to permanent slots, and extended days for some Head Start children.  		But, in fact, it is providing important services for the community which could  		not be obtained through other means.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Tulare County Department of Education</strong></p>
<p> The third work-welfare participant is heavily involved in providing  		child care for thousands of children of low income parents. In Visalia,  		California, the Tulare County Department of Education offers the following  		schedules:</p>
<ul><li>"part-day" Head Start (including either a home-based or center-based  		  option, this latter for 4 hours a day, 5 days a week, 9 months a year) for 283  		  children aged 3 to 5;</li>
<li>Head Start home preschool (4 hours a day, 5 days a week, 9 months a  		  year) for 6 3- to 5-year-olds in one day care home;</li>
<li>full-day Head Start (10 to 12 hours a day, 5 days a week, 12 months a  		  year) for 320 3- to 5-year-old children of working parents;</li>
<li>migrant Head Start (10 to 12 hours-a day, 5 days a week, 9 months a  		  year) for 154 infants to children about 5;</li>
<li>state-funded part-day center care (4 hours a day, 5 days a week, 9  		  months a year) for 240 children commingled with Head Start part-day  		  children;</li>
<li>state-funded general child care, extending the part-day hours of  		  children of working parents by funding an additional 6 hours a day;</li>
<li>twenty state-funded family day care homes for 129 children in which  		  the grantee helped these homes become licensed and insured, trained providers  		  and now monitors them; and</li>
<li>a "parent select" option in which JTPA and the state have contracted  		  with the grantee to find day care for their clients in licensed homes or  		  centers or in an approved relative's home. Care for about 190 children a year  		  is brokered through this option.</li>
</ul><p> The Tulare County Department of Education, thus, receives funding from  		several sources to provide or broker child care: Head Start's Region 9; Head  		Start's Migrant Program Division; the state of California; and JTPA. In the  		first seven schedules listed above, the grantee is providing care for children.  		In the final option, staff have become brokers for care. When a client comes to  		see a staff member to discuss care, the staff member can present a series of  		options: care in a center or licensed family day care home, or care by a  		relative. If the parent would like a relative to provide child care, a staff  		member from the grantee visits the proposed hone to see that it is appropriate.  		If it is, the staff member develops a contract with the relative which  		stipulates that he/she may be paid to care for the client's children, but she  		may not accept any other children (except her own). So, the grantee has some  		control over the quality of care, though the rules do permit children to be in  		unlicensed facilities.</p>
<p> In preparation for the beginning of California's work-welfare program  		(GAIN), grantee staff began working with a planning committee which had  		representatives from local colleges, training programs, programs for the  		developmentally disabled and child care agencies. The committee wrote the  		proposal for the county on how it would implement the GAIN program, and it now  		meets monthly to coordinate the operation of GAIN.</p>
<p> The decision on the provision of child care was that Tulare County's  		Department of Education would extend its parent select option and help match  		approximately 4,900 children with child care. The Director says that this  		matching process will require hiring 24 new staff members, most of whom will be  		intake workers who will talk with each client, visit potential child care  		sites, train providers and monitor homes.</p>
<p> In these first three examples of Head Start grantees participating in  		work-welfare programs, we have seen very diverse solutions to meeting increased  		needs for child care. In Wanaque, New Jersey Head Start extended its hours of  		care with the assistance of state dollars. In Greeley, Colorado Head Start  		staff agreed to provide care for children who could not be placed in existing  		private day care slots (infants, sick children, children in transition to  		permanent arrangements). In Visalia, California the grantee has extended its  		staff to include new intake workers to broker care for work-welfare clients.  		Each grantee was very involved in planning for work-welfare and remains  		involved in coordinating the implementation.</p>
<p><strong>4.4 Sacramento Employment and Training Agency</strong></p>
<p> In the final example, the Head Start grantee has not been involved in  		county planning for work-welfare and is not certain if or how it will  		participate. In Sacramento, California, the Sacramento Employment and Training  		Agency is the Head Start grantee. They offer the following services for  		children:</p>
<ul><li>a part-day Head Start program (3 1/2 to 4 hours a day, 4 or 5 days a  		  week, 10 months a year) for 1,133 children aged 3 to 5 years;</li>
<li>a full-day Head Start program (10 hours a day, 5 days a week, 10  		  months a year) for 20 3- to 5-year-olds. This option used to operate for 120  		  children, 12 months a year, but budget constraints have resulted in a reduction  		  of these services; and</li>
<li>a part-day state-funded program (3-1/2 to 4 hours a day, 4 or 5 days  		  a week, 10 months a year) for 359,children who are commingled with the Head  		  start children.</li>
</ul><p>The agency offers JTPA employment and training programs and JTPA staff  		coordinate child care for about 50 participants a year.</p>
<p> The GAIN program will begin in this county in September, 1988. The  		grantee has not been involved in the planning process; the county has not  		chosen to involve any members of the child care community. County planners will  		issue an RFP describing needs and expect any interested agency to respond. The  		Head Start Director believes that some of her school system delegates may apply  		for slots.</p>
<p> Interestingly enough, the grantee will participate in GAIN in that it  		will be responsible for the job training part of the program. But this county  		does not have the same sort of planning process and local involvement in  		coordinating child care that was true in the other counties in the sample, and  		it is not clear that this agency -- seemingly in an excellent position to  		coordinate training and child care -- will participate strongly in child care  		for the GAIN program.</p>
<h4>5. Summary of Child Care Services</h4>
<p> Perhaps the most striking feature of these examples is the diversity of  		methods in meeting local child care needs. Part-day Head Start meets a  		comprehensive set of needs for families where the mother is not working outside  		the home. The full-day services of these agencies fill another family need --  		for additional hours of child care. When Directors of agencies which have extra  		space and can locate additional funding have extended Head Start, they have  		created slots paid for by other sources. When Directors have perceived that the  		community offers ample private or Title XX child care, they have decided to  		concentrate their efforts on Head Start or on brokering services for children.  		When Directors believe that their communities lack adequate child care slots  		and funding, they often try to raise such funds any way they can.</p>
<p> Even those grantees that are trying to supply full-day care for working  		parents are meeting a number of barriers to providing full-day care. First is  		the question of agency mission or goals. Grantees finding ways to supply  		full-day care are generally those that accept as their mission ensuring that  		low income families with children in need of longer hours of care can find that  		care.</p>
<p> In at least one case (Chicago, Illinois) the grantee Director does not  		share this mission. The grantee offers limited full-day services and does not  		anticipate expanding them. (In a sampling of Head Start grantees that offer no  		full-day care, we might expect to find more Directors whose mission is to offer  		an excellent Head Start program -- not to meet the needs of working parents for  		additional hours of care.)</p>
<p> Head Start grantees which do not share the mission may be compared with  		many school systems across the country who also have rejected custodial child  		care as a service. Many elementary school Principals would probably argue that  		they are in the business of educating young children, not of providing child  		care while parents are working. So, they operate from 9 to 3, even though  		parents may be out of the home from 8 to 6. There is nothing disparaging  		intended by this comparison or this definition of mission. The problem is that  		parents are still in need of extended hours of care and one community facility  		that is potentially in a position to offer such care does not do so.</p>
<p> A substantial set of barriers discussed in the interviews concern Title  		XX regulations. The various problems perceived by grantees included the  		following.</p>
<ul><li>Title XX does not pay for a sufficient number of child care slots in  		  the state. Since Head Start is curtailing its funding of full-day services, it  		  seems virtually impossible to finance the needed hours of care for  		  children.</li>
<li>The limitations in eligibility for Title XX slots means that some  		  children or families cannot be served. Head Start and parent fees do not fill  		  the gap.</li>
<li>Title XX staff do the recruiting for existing slots and slots remain  		  empty for considerable periods of time. Grantees cannot maintain classrooms and  		  staffing unless all slots are filled.</li>
<li>Title XX does not require (or encourage) the provision of  		  comprehensive services to children and families. Grantees who would like to  		  provide such services have difficulty financing them.</li>
<li>Title XX payment is often slow and grantees have difficulty meeting  		  payroll and other regular expenses.</li>
</ul><p> When the sampled grantees were asked about expanding current services  		to help work-welfare participants, they mentioned another set of "practical"  		issues that impeded the provision of sufficient full-day care for the  		community.</p>
<ul><li>Grantees offering double sessions would have to reduce enrollment to  		  create full-day classes, as many agencies cannot find additional space at a  		  reasonable cost. No one wanted to reduce the number of funded slots.</li>
<li>Little appropriate space is available at a reasonable cost.</li>
<li>Many Head Start teachers and aides are working part-time by choice.  		  They would not view the increase to full-time positively.</li>
<li>The best solutions to child care issues are resolved through  		  coordination with Departments of Social Service. Staff in some of these  		  Departments argue that they have very heavy caseloads and no time for joint  		  meetings.</li>
<li>The community may need care for infants and school-aged children,  		  ages that are not a part of the traditional Head Start group. This would imply  		  new programming and new staffing.</li>
<li>The community may need care most during evening and weekend hours.  		  This, too, is not something Head Start is used to providing.</li>
</ul><p> Throughout the discussion, issues of funding arose. In the next section  		we present the various co-funding arrangements grantees have made and discuss  		the issues they raise for Head Start's further participation in work-welfare  		programs.</p>
<h3>D. Funding Mechanisms Used by Jointly Funded  		Programs</h3>
<p> In the previous sections of the report, we described the schedules of  		operation of the child care programs of the 21 grantees in the sample. In this  		section we turn to the mechanics of funding the various programs. In  		<a href="#exhibitIII.1">Exhibit III-1</a> and <a href="#exhibitIII.2">Exhibit  		III-2</a>, we divided grantees by the funding sources for their full-day  		programs. In <a href="#exhibitIII.2">Exhibit III-2</a> we stated that grantees  		which operate Head Start as a part-day program and Title XX or State Preschool  		as a full-day program generally separate the funding streams or use a  		straightforward formula to divide costs. Grantees which fund full-day  		operations from multiple sources, however, use a wide variety of cost  		principles to divide costs across funding sources.</p>
<p> A more detailed division of grantees by cost principles may now be  		made. Three groups seem to emerge. The first group includes those grantees that  		separate Head Start and other operations both programmatically and fiscally.  		Six grantees in this group -- those in the center column of  		<a href="#exhibitIII.2">Exhibit III-2</a> -- offer center-based programs for  		full-day care (and perhaps sponsor a network of family day care homes). The  		other three grantees which belong in the group are a particular set of grantees  		from the third column of <a href="#exhibitIII.2">Exhibit III-2</a>, those whose  		only full-day option is in family day care homes. Most of the line items in the  		budgets of these agencies are clearly defined as belonging to one funding  		source or another; some are divided across funding sources according to a  		clearly defined principle.</p>
<p> The second group generally includes grantees that began by operating  		only Head Start or only Title XX. Their addition of another program funded by a  		different source was treated fiscally as an add-on and has resulted in somewhat  		arbitrary separations of items paid for by each source. The cost principles  		used in this group vary, but are similar in that they do not separate costs  		according to the services required or offered by each funding source.</p>
<p> The third group is represented by grantees that frequently comingle  		children funded by different sources and offer comprehensive services to all of  		their clientele. They appear, however, to have divided costs among funding  		sources according to a logical principle. For example, if 60 percent of the  		children in a classroom are "Head Start" children, then the grantee has decided  		that 60 percent of the teacher's salary should be paid for by Head Start.</p>
<p> It may appear by these descriptions of the three groups that the first  		and third are using "appropriate" cost principles and the second is not.  		However, the division of grantees into these categories is not meant as a value  		judgement of their fiscal policies. All grantees have discussed their division  		of costs with Head Start Regional Office staff and with staff from their other  		funding sources. All principles for cost division have been approved. The  		questions which are raised by the use of this diversity of principles have more  		to do with future practices than with present strategies. If work-welfare  		dollars are made available to many agencies across the country, state  		work-welfare staff and federal Head Start staff need to decide if there are  		certain cost principles that will not be approved, others that will be used to  		guide staff in their negotiations with potential grantees.</p>
<p><a href="#exhibitIII.3"> Exhibit III-3</a> summarizes the cost  		principles used by all grantees receiving funding from multiple sources. it  		differentiates the split of costs for administrative staff, for teachers and  		aides, and for space since many grantees use different principles for these  		different line items. Each grantee appears once in each column. If a grantee  		uses the same principle to divide costs for staff and space, its name appears  		on the same line in each column.</p>

</tr></table><p> Of the six grantees which offer part-day Head Start and full-day  		services paid for by another source, three of the grantees (Jewett City,  		Connecticut; Gainesville, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois) consistently appear as  		using the first cost principle: no staff or space are shared between programs.  		The other three grantees (Lewiston, Maine, York, Pennsylvania and Cannon City,  		Colorado) do share some costs. In Lewiston, Maine and York, Pennsylvania, the  		administrative staff have joint responsibilities and are partially paid by Head  		Start and Title XX. To determine the split of their salaries, the grantee uses  		a principle that each funding source should pay according to the number of  		slots it funds. In Cannon City, Colorado administrative staff and space are  		shared and partially charged to Head Start and Title XX. The grantee did a time  		study of administrative staff and bills each funding source according to the  		percentage of hours administrative staff spend on their program. Similarly, the  		grantee studied the usage pattern of shared space (administrative and meeting  		rooms) and bills according to the findings of the study.</p>
<p> Therefore, it would appear that even the line items that are shared by  		programs funded through different mechanisms are clearly divided for billing in  		this group of grantees. one might ask about the failure of three of the  		grantees to declare that any administrative staff are shared. In Jewett City,  		the roles of Directors of the Head Start and Title XX programs are separated.  		However, there does exist one staff member (a child development specialist)  		whose job it is to coordinate program efforts where it seems possible. In  		Gainesville, Georgia the Head Start Director is in a supervisory role over the  		Title XX Director and does, therefore, become involved at times with Title XX.  		However, the Title XX Director assists with Head Start's home-based program and  		does not charge her time to Head Start. The grantee feels that the exchange of  		assistance, without joint billing, means that each funding source is  		appropriately charged.</p>
<p> Three of the other grantees that generally appear in the category  		"Staff/Space are not Shared" are the grantees whose only full-day program  		operates in family day care homes. In Binghamton, New York; Fremont, Ohio; and  		Levelland, Texas; Head Start adds dollars to existing Title XX homes. In  		Binghamton and Levelland, the programs operate like Head Start's home-based  		model where Head Start staff visit the homes and work with child and provider.  		The providers are not paid out of Head Start funds; the home visitors are. The  		administrators do not deal with Title XX funds; those are negotiated between  		the day care hone provider and the Department of Social Services. As is true in  		regular home-based programs, Head Start does not owe and does not pay for the  		space in which home visits occur; we can say that space is not truly shared  		across funding sources.</p>
<p> The program in Fremont, Ohio differs from the other two in that this  		grantee paid the family day care provider for the hours that were considered  		Head Start time. Each provider received her regular payment from Title XX and  		an additional dollar an hour for the four hours a day considered to be Head  		Start. Thus, Fremont appears on the chart as using a principle that "Head Start  		Pays for its Services Beyond Title XX" for teachers. However, since Head Start  		staff did not manage Title XX funds, the grantee's administrative staff are  		listed as not shared across funding sources. (One could argue that space was  		shared by Head Start and Title XX. If this argument is accepted, then Head  		Start is receiving space free and Title XX is paying for it. However, one could  		probably argue that Title XX is also receiving space free.)</p>
<p> This sort of arrangement where Head Start pays for services above and  		beyond the existing Title XX program is difficult to cost, whether one is  		dealing with an arrangement in family day care homes or centers.</p>
<p> In the second group of grantees where principles for dividing costs  		seen arbitrary, several grantees have developed an arrangement like Fremont's.  		For example, when two grantees (White Plains, New York and Schuylkill Haven,  		Pennsylvania) budgeted for their Head Start option which "upgrades" Title XX  		with additional services, they charged to Head Start only those costs above and  		beyond costs paid by the existing Title XX program. That is, they did not  		consider that Head Start should share the costs of teachers, support staff, or  		space with Title XX. These costs had traditionally been paid by Title XX and  		could continue to be paid by that source.</p>
<p> Similarly, when Wanaque, New Jersey decided to "upgrade" its Head Start  		program with additional hours of service paid for by new work-welfare dollars,  		it kept its Head Start costs constant and used the new money for additional  		costs. For example, administrative staff had been paid by Head Start for 7  		hours a day, 5 days a week. The new work-welfare dollars will pay these staff  		for an additional 1 hour each day. Head Start has traditionally paid for one  		teacher and one aide in each classroom, and will continue to do so even though  		these staff are now spending more of their hours with children. The  		work-welfare dollars will pay for a second aide, needed because of the longer  		hours for children each day. And, Head Start will continue to pay the amount it  		has paid for space; additional costs incurred because of longer hours for  		children will be picked up by work-welfare dollars.</p>
<p> White Plains, New York and Greeley, Colorado use this same kind of  		argument for their assignment of costs for administrative staff -- 100% to Head  		Start. They feel that single-purpose agencies offering Head Start programs with  		their large funded enrollments require an administrative staff of the size they  		now have. The fact that the administrators manage a Title XX program in  		addition to Head Start shows their dedication to serving the needs of working  		parents and to providing a quality child care program. It does not imply that  		administrative costs should be shared.</p>
<p> The cost principle used to divide the costs of teachers and space in  		White Plains, New York is a little different. Children from multiple funding  		sources are comingled in full-day classrooms, and the grantee first uses all  		Title XX money to pay for teachers, support staff (e.g., cooks, custodians) and  		space. When this money ends, Head Start money is used to ensure that the full  		complement of comprehensive services are provided for children and families. If  		any Head Start money is left over, it must be returned.</p>
<p> In these examples, the cost principles appear to have evolved as the  		programs evolved within the grantee. Some agencies began as Head Start grantees  		and expanded to operate Title XX. Others began with Title XX classrooms and  		added Head Start services. No federal or state staff member has required that  		the grantee's budgeting begin by looking at the current program and separating  		costs for each item. Rather, Head Start fiscal staff have accepted a variety of  		historical arguments, such as "Head Start has always paid 100% of the salary of  		the Director," or practical arguments such as "a single purpose Head Start  		agency would have our number of administrators paid for by Head Start," to  		justify the existing distribution of costs.</p>
<p> In the final group of grantees (Visalia, California; Schuylkill Haven,  		Pennsylvania; Cedar Rapids, Iowa), agreements on the division of costs have  		been reached on somewhat different grounds: the percentage of funding from each  		source; the percentage of slots funded by each; or the services required by  		each. In the state of California, officials from Head Start and the Department  		of Education have agreed that all grantees should split costs according to the  		percentage of funding from each source. If Head Start provides 40 percent of  		the funding, then each line item of the grantee's budget should be charged 40  		percent to Head Start, even if it covers costs that do not support the Head  		Start program. The idea is that other line items might be 100 percent Head  		Start costs, but they, too, will be shared. The costs should be approximately  		alike in the end and the role of fiscal staff will be greatly simplified.  		Visalia, California follows this principle.</p>
<p> Cedar Rapids, Iowa follows the other two well defined principles. In  		its division of costs of administrative staff and teachers, it uses the  		principle that costs should be billed according to the number of slots funded  		by each source. A Director works equally for all children. If 75 percent of the  		children in her care are "Head Start" children, then 75 percent of her salary  		should be paid for Head Start. Similarly, if 50 percent of the children in the  		class of a particular teacher are "Head Start" children, then half of her  		salary should come from Head Start. (Schuylkill Haven, Pennsylvania follows  		this principle, too, for its administrative staff and space.) On the other  		hand, Cedar Rapids uses another principle for its space cost, that a funding  		source should be billed according to the number of hours of service provided to  		its children within the space. If Head Start children are in the classroom  		fewer hours than Title XX children, then costs should be split accordingly.</p>
<p> Each grantee in the sample has arrived at a workable solution to the  		division of costs. Each solution has been agreed to by Head Start and the other  		funding sources. When these combination programs are a small percentage of Head  		Start programs, such flexibility in cost principles is probably justified. But  		in an environment of work-welfare programs beginning in each state, it may well  		be worth the effort of examining the effects on costs of each of these  		principles and deciding which are acceptable.</p>
<p> To examine the effects of the various cost principles, we selected an  		actual operating Head Start program, the Community Action Committee of Danbury,  		Connecticut to demonstrate how programs can be expanded to serve children and  		their families for longer hours. We applied different cost principles to  		determine the cost of full-day services for Head Start and the second funding  		source. Six different scenarios were constructed. A detailed discussion of  		these six scenarios is presented in <a href="evalasv2.htm">Volume II</a> of  		this report.</p>
<h3>E. Summary</h3>
<p> The 21 grantees in this sample have provided a broad spectrum of  		examples of the operation of full-day care programs by Head Start grantees. We  		have seen a number of grantees that provide extensive services to children and  		families in the community and others whose principal role is to broker child  		care services for families. Each has adapted to the needs of the community and  		has evolved a program that seems to work for that community.</p>
<p> Similarly, we have seen that the sample grantees make use of a diverse  		set of principles for dividing costs across child care programs. Some operate  		multiple programs by considering them fiscally separate entities. Some have  		begun by operating one program, and the addition of another shows in the budget  		as an extension of a primary program. Others have seemed to take a step back  		from their programs and try to separate shared costs using clear cost  		principles.</p>
<p> In <a href="evalasv2.htm">Volume II</a>, we follow the implications of  		these cost principles in a new example grantee. We see that the cost principle  		that a grantee elects can have a profound influence on the amount of money  		charged to each funding source. While there are advantages and disadvantages to  		each principle, it seems valuable to understand their effects on the division  		of costs. A new work-welfare program may wish to decide carefully on which  		mechanisms it will consider appropriate. And that decision may be that the cost  		principle will be decided on an individual basis, depending on the process of  		development and the description of the final program offered by each  		grantee.</p>
<h2><a name="chapIV" id="chapIV">IV. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p> In this chapter, we present a summary of the findings of the  		evaluability assessment of child care options for work welfare programs. This  		synopsis incorporates the information gained through the early discussions with  		federal and Congressional staff and advocates, and from our discussions with  		states and Head Start grantees. Based on these findings, we identify on-going  		issues related to child care and work-welfare programs. We also identify  		directions and areas for further study which may provide additional insight  		into the policy responses that may be required at the state and federal  		levels.</p>
<p> During the past few years, the provision of adequate child care has  		become a critical element in the states' abilities to implement education,  		training, and employment programs for parents of low income families receiving  		public assistance. Mothers receiving AFDC have been exempt from participating  		in work-welfare programs if they have children under the age of six; however,  		these exemptions may not continue.</p>
<p> The federal government and many of the states have begun to take a look  		at lowering the minimum age of children for mandatory participation by parents,  		requiring examination of resources that will be required to serve more  		participants with younger children in the programs. This short-term study  		attempted to obtain descriptive information on approaches employed by a select  		number of states to provide child care services for work-welfare participants.  		The study also examined innovative Head Start programs as one option to  		supplement child care services for low income working parents. In the following  		sections we summarize our key findings.</p>
<h3>A. State Child Care Approaches</h3>
<p> The nineteen states selected for this study presented a variety of  		approaches to providing child care to participants in a broad range of  		work-welfare programs, such as comprehensive state programs, WIN  		Demonstrations, and basic work programs. The approaches presented by the states  		fell into two major categories:</p>
<ul><li>child care provided through special child care components of the  		  work-welfare programs (separate from the general child care program), and</li>
<li>child care available through the states' general child care  		  programs.</li>
</ul><p> From the above categories, participants could choose from both  		center-based and family day care resources. The major difference was the degree  		of flexibility of participants to choose any type of child care, whether  		licensed/regulated or unregulated.</p>
<h4>1. Special Child Care Components</h4>
<p> The ten states with special components (Oklahoma is included as its  		general child care program is exclusively employment and training related),  		offer the most flexibility to participants. Six of these states (California,  		Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, New Jersey) will reimburse unregulated care.  		Participants can arrange for the traditional types of licensed/regulated care,  		or use relative, in-home, and other types of unregulated care. Of the remaining  		four which require licensed/regulated care (Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma,  		Washington), only Oklahoma is without exceptions. The other three have built in  		exceptions which permit special arrangements outside licensed care. The special  		components are funded usually through state funds, or a combination of state  		and federal funds, including IV-A, WIN, and JTPA.</p>
<h4>2. General State Child Care Programs</h4>
<p> Of the states which rely upon the general child care program, which is  		primarily funded under SSBG to serve the work-welfare participants (Arizona,  		Arkansas, Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, Oregon, and Texas), at least  		a few have exceptions. These exceptions are either for relative care in special  		cases, or the use of federal (Title IV-A) or state funds, which may not be  		restricted to regulated care, to support child care for work-welfare  		participants.</p>
<p> The use of exemptions for lack of adequate or accessible child care is  		used by many of the states. Whether or not this continues as an allowable  		exemption under federal legislation will impact significantly on those states  		which depend on the exemption as a way of dealing with resource shortages  		rather than to look for other resource development alternatives.</p>
<h4>3. Transition Assistance</h4>
<p> Transition child care services are now, or soon will be, provided by  		almost every state in the study. Transition assistance is viewed by the states  		as a critical factor in successfully moving welfare recipients into  		unsubsidized employment, although many of the programs in this study are too  		new to have significant numbers of participants moving off public assistance.  		Like the types of care available, transition assistance varies greatly, ranging  		from indefinite periods to as little as 30 days or one-time costs such as  		advance payments to new providers. Parent co-payment through sliding fees is  		considered by several states as an important way to help parents gradually  		assume full financial responsibility for child care.</p>
<p> One problem frequently experienced by many participants moving off  		transitional assistance is the lack of available slots in the general child  		care programs. These programs often have long waiting lists. The end result is  		that states are extending transitional care indefinitely until slots are  		available.</p>
<h4>4. Reimbursement Arrangements</h4>
<p> States are employing a variety of arrangements to reimburse for child  		care. While most continue to rely on contract or direct provider reimbursement,  		five states reimburse the participant directly for child care expenses with the  		expectation that the participant in turn pays the provider. Some states are  		turning to dual party checks to ensure provider payment.</p>
<p> Vouchers are being used by four states to provide participants with  		greater choice of care alternatives. Perhaps best known is the Massachusetts  		Voucher Day Care Program which uses vouchers exclusively in their ET Choices  		program. California, New Jersey and New York are piloting vouchers as a payment  		mechanism.</p>
<p> While few of the child care approaches presented by the states are  		particularly innovative, the states included in this study have demonstrated a  		variety of arrangements to ensure child care resources for work-welfare  		participants. The questions of adequacy of resources, licensed vs. unregulated  		care, flexibility of choice, and transition assistance remain issues to be  		grappled with by all states, whether participation is mandated for parents with  		children under or over six years of age.</p>
<h3>B. Head Start Options</h3>
<p> The second part of the project looked at Head Start as one option for  		offering child care services for work-welfare participants. Work-welfare  		planners are beginning to take an interest in Head Start as an additional  		resource for care of children of work-welfare participants. If mothers with  		children under the age of six are mandated to participate, or even if the  		numbers of voluntary participants increase, it is likely that a number of these  		participants will have children in Head Start programs. Why then could not Head  		Start supply the child care needed above and beyond the hours of classroom  		services already provided to these children?</p>
<p> Historically, Head Start has separated itself from custodial child care  		in philosophy as well as practice, even though more and more of the parents of  		Head Start children are entering the work force. A number of Head Start  		grantees have implemented programs to meet the full-day child care needs of  		families in their communities.</p>
<p> This study explored the potential for extending Head Start operations  		to meet the hours of care required for work-welfare participants. It focused  		primarily on a group of grantees which offer full-day services paid for through  		one or a combination of funding sources and that operate child card centers,  		family day care homes, or both.</p>
<p> As in the child care approaches employed by the states, the grantees in  		this study provided a diversity of methods of meeting local child care needs.  		The discussions with 21 grantees provided information on the blending of  		funding streams to provide care to children of low-income families, as well as  		the impetus for entering into more extensive child care arrangements.</p>
<h4>1. Head Start Options</h4>
<p> As a result of these discussions, the 21 grantees were grouped into  		three categories, including:</p>
<ul><li>grantees that provide full-day services to children and their  		  families;</li>
<li>grantees that provide some full-day services, but put more efforts  		  into brokering full-day services for clients within the community; and</li>
<li>grantees currently working with states that have work-welfare  		  programs and who have developed service provision and brokering within a,  		  coordinated local effort.</li>
</ul><p> The approaches presented by these grantees ranged from center care,  		family day care homes, or a combination of both, and included programs funded  		wholly by Head Start, by Title XX or State only, or by a combination of Head  		Start and Title XX/State funds.</p>
<p> Barriers identified to providing full-day care include:</p>
<ul><li>how the Head Start mission or goals might blend with the need of  		  working families for extended hours of care;</li>
<li>limitations imposed by Title XX in terms of funding ceilings and  		  eligibility;</li>
<li>practical issues of available space, need to serve age groups outside  		  the traditional Head Start age ranges; and Head Start teachers and aides may  		  not want to increase current part-time work levels.</li>
</ul><h4>2. Funding for Head Start</h4>
<p> The discussion with the 21 grantees provided information about the  		blending of funding streams to provide child care to low income families.  		Programs funded wholly by Head Start, Title XX or State only, or a combination  		of Head Start and Title XX/State funds include center care, family day care  		homes, or a combination of both. However, limitations are imposed by Title XX  		in terms of funding ceilings and eligibility.</p>
<p> Another area of exploration of these Head Start grantees focused on the  		principles used for dividing costs across child care programs. Some of the  		grantees operate multiple programs by considering them as fiscally separate  		entities. Others operate one system with an additional program simply shown as  		an extension of the primary program. Understanding the various cost principles  		is important if work-welfare programs and Head Start implement coordinated  		child care services.</p>
<h3>C. Issues Related to Work-Welfare and Child Care</h3>
<p> Throughout the discussions with leaders in the field of welfare reform,  		advocates, and key state staff, the overriding concerns and issues focused on  		three major areas:</p>
<ul><li>the impact on supply and demand for child care if age minimums are  		  lowered to under three years of age,</li>
<li>licensed/regulated care related to supply and demand and funding  		  resources, and</li>
<li>the impact of transitional child care services in participants'  		  success (or failure) in becoming self-sufficient.</li>
</ul><p> It is difficult to treat these issues separately because they are  		interrelated and impact each other significantly. However, each is important  		when considering the options states have when meeting the child care needs of  		work-welfare participants as described in an earlier section.</p>
<h4>1. Minimum Age Requirements and Child Care  		Supply and Demand</h4>
<p> Whether there is mandatory participation of mothers with children under  		the age of six or a heavy emphasis on voluntary participation, the demand for  		child care services will be felt most acutely by the child care community  		pertaining to resources for very young children. Lowering age minimums to  		toddlers or infants will result in pressures on a system already reportedly  		lacking in appropriate and available slots for children under age three,  		whether in center-based care, family day care homes, or in-home care.</p>
<p> States were clear that increasing the number of participants with very  		young children would require significant resources to develop additional slots  		to meet the rising demands for care, particularly for infant and toddler  		care.</p>
<h4>2. Licensed/Regulated Child Care</h4>
<p> The issue of required licensed/regulated child care cuts across a  		number of areas, such as supply, additional funds to develop new resources, and  		adequate staff to monitor for compliance. It is evident from the discussions  		with the states that, while licensed/regulated care is the desired condition  		for child care, there are vast differences in the states' abilities to actually  		provide adequate resources of licensed/regulated child care.</p>
<p> In the descriptions of the general child care programs, waiting lists  		are common for subsidized care, indicating insufficient supply of  		licensed/regulated, subsidized care for eligible parents. Parents eligible for  		subsidized care may choose alternatives to licensed/regulated care, such as  		relative, neighbor or older sibling care, to begin or continue training, job  		search, or employment. Many states, even those who have licensing/regulatory  		requirements for subsidized child care, use alternative funding sources which  		do not specify licensed/ regulated care as a condition for funding to expand  		the child care options available to public assistance recipients in  		work-welfare programs.</p>
<p> Two questions must be addressed when unregulated relative care is  		allowed.</p>
<ul><li>What will be the level of effort required to get the relative  		  licensed as a caregiver (if desired and allowed)?</li>
<li>Will sufficient resources be available to replace unregulated  		  relative care if relative care is not allowed or if relatives do not wish to  		  become licensed/regulated?</li>
</ul><h4>3. Transitional Services</h4>
<p> Transitional care is viewed by all the states as an important factor in  		work-welfare participants becoming self-sufficient. Of interest in the states  		included in this study is the range of time allowed for transition and the  		options available to participants at the end of the transition period.</p>
<p> No one state appeared to have the definitive answer to the most  		effective way to move participants into totally unsubsidized employment. The  		length of transition assistance seems most closely associated with available  		funding, rather than experience of clients successfully moving from subsidized  		care. Several questions remain unanswered.</p>
<ul><li>What is an appropriate period for transitional assistance?</li>
<li>If no child care slots are available in the general child care  		  program at the end of the transition period, should the transition period be  		  extended?</li>
<li>Should states be expected to set aside a certain number of general  		  child care slots to ensure that work-welfare participants transitioning to  		  unsubsidized employment can move successfully toward that goal? What will be  		  the impact of this on other priorities for care (CPS)?</li>
</ul><h3>D. Directions for Further Study</h3>
<p> The results of this evaluability assessment suggest that there are a  		number of areas open for further investigation before the federal government  		and the states can develop policy responses to address the child care needs  		associated with work-welfare participants. Topics which could be undertaken by  		ASPE and/or in cooperation with ACYF and FSA include:</p>
<ul><li>exploration of the relationship between the use of lack of child care  		  as an exemption and the number of participants with young children entering and  		  completing a work-welfare program;</li>
<li>comparison of the costs of developing and monitoring appropriate  		  child care resources with the cost of continuing families on public  		  assistance;</li>
<li>investigation of the involvement of the child care community in  		  planning for work-welfare implementation and the effect of this involvement (or  		  lack of involvement) on resource development, provider availability,  		  coordination with Head Start; is there a difference in this involvement between  		  state administered and locally administered work-welfare programs;</li>
<li>investigation of the impact of transition assistance on participants'  		  abilities to successfully move into unsubsidized employment or off public  		  assistance;</li>
<li>exploration of the maximum rates for various types of care allowable  		  by states compared with the rate ceilings established in the two federal  		  legislative proposals; these rates should be compared with the prevailing  		  community rates in the various states to determine participants' abilities to  		  assume the full cost of care;</li>
<li>exploration of the possibilities of preschool programs to expand to  		  meet the child care needs of work-welfare participants and the related  		  coordination issues;</li>
<li>investigation of an expanded sample of Head Start programs to  		  determine the effort required to extend programs to serve work-welfare  		  participants.</li>
<li>synthesis of programs employing vouchers to determine the types of  		  child care being chosen by parents in employment/training activities (relative,  		  family-based, center-based, other);</li>
<li>comparison of job placement success in states with special child care  		  components versus states using the general child care program;</li>
<li>identification and investigation of best practices in the area of  		  linkages or coordination between state child care agencies and schools or Head  		  Start to support work-welfare;</li>
<li>assessment of placement success of work-welfare programs targeted  		  toward long-term recipients versus mothers with young children or teenage  		  parents.</li>

<ol><li>In your opinion what would be the impact on your state (or local  		  agency) of the following? How would these impact supply of child care?<br /><ol type="a"><li> <span>Mandated participation  				of parents with children three years and older</span>?</li>
<li> <span>Mandated participation  				of parents with children six months and older</span>?</li>
<li> <span>Child care for more  				than 2 children would have to meet health and safety standards set by  				state</span>.</li>
<li> <span>Child care would have  				to meet acceptable standards of health and safety</span>? How would your agency  				insure that "acceptable standards" were met? What do you think would be  				"acceptable standards"?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What are the implications if federal legislation requires that  		  <strong>government provide or make available regulated child care</strong> for  		  children of work-welfare participants?</li>
<li><span>Priorities of care</span>:  		  How will you prioritize participants needing child care (e.g., teenage parents,  		  parents in education/training programs, employment)?</li>
<li>Given the comments and perceptions you have expressed, what  		  <span>funding alternatives</span> might you  		  consider in implementing work-welfare related child care?</li>
<li><span>What kind of child care  		  programs/practices will be necessary</span> for your state to implement a  		  work-welfare program? Are there any innovative or special child care programs  		  or projects currently in place that will facilitate work-welfare implementation  		  in your state? (Also probe for any special problems  		  identified/anticipated).</li>
<li><span>Who will be responsible for  		  the decision-making</span> to implement a new (if any) federal work-welfare  		  program in your state?</li>
</ol><h3><a name="append2" id="append2">HEAD START DISCUSSION  		GUIDE</a></h3>
<h4>I. Description of Program</h4>
<ol type="A"><li><span>General description</span>.  		  We are interested in finding out about Head Start programs that help serve  		  working mothers by, in some way, providing full-day services. Could you  		  describe your program?</li>
<li><span>Families served</span>. What  		  sorts of families are served in the program? Are some of the mothers in  		  training programs, some working? Are some families referred by Child Protection  		  Services?</li>
<li><span>Selection of  		  children</span>. How do you decide, among many applicants, which children you  		  will be able to serve?</li>
<li><span>Ages of children  		  served</span>. What ages of children are served? If you serve 3-year-olds, do  		  they remain in the program until they enter school? Has the Policy Council or  		  Head Start staff seen any problems with serving some children multiple years  		  when other children in the community cannot be served at all?</li>
<li><span>Younger siblings</span>.  		  Where are the younger siblings of the children you serve? If you help to serve  		  them, how does this operate? If you do not serve them, have parents presented  		  this as a problem?</li>
<li><span>Hours per day</span>. Do all  		  of the children in your program come for the same number of hours per day? If  		  not, how do the hours differ? How do you decide which families participate in  		  the full-day option?</li>
<li><span>Pressure for new  		  slots</span>. If some children are not full day, is there pressure to increase  		  full-day slots? From whom? Have working parents been turned away or decided not  		  to use Head Start because their children could only be accepted part day?</li>
<li><span>Full year</span>. Does the  		  program operate 12 months? through vacations? If not, how do parents organize  		  care when the program is closed? Have you discussed extending the program  		  year?</li>
<li><span>Other services</span>. Do  		  all families receive the same services (e.g., health and social services)? If  		  not, how does service provision differ?</li>
<li><span>Regulations</span>. Are any  		  Head Start regulations a problem for the full-day program (e.g., that 90% of  		  participants be within the income guidelines; class size minimums; home visits;  		  parent involvement)? How do you ensure parent involvement?</li>
</ol><h4>II. Funding Sources</h4>
<ol type="A"><li><span>Identify</span>. What  		  sources provide funding for the program?</li>
<li><span>History</span>. If there is  		  joint funding, how was this joint funding arranged? Were there difficulties?  		  How did you resolve them?</li>
<li><span>Comingling</span>. If you do  		  receive other funds, are funds comingled or do you decide what services will be  		  paid for by each funding source? If the latter, how do you decide what is paid  		  for by Head Start, what by other funds?</li>
<li><span>Problems</span>. Have you  		  had any problems with either funding source with regard to this joint funding?
<ol><li><span>Eligibility</span>. If  				there are different eligibility requirements, e.g., for Head Start and Title  				XX, have these created any problems with funding sources? Do you differentiate  				services offered to different children?</li>
<li><span>Families served</span>.  				In deciding priorities for whom will be served by the program, have you had any  				problems with either funding source? For example, the Head Start emphasis on  				serving the most needy might contradict a desire to serve working parents.</li>
<li><span>Audit</span>. Have the  				auditors or program officials from either funding source expressed concern over  				records? What seems to have been the problem?</li>
<li><span>Marginal cost</span>.  				From your point of view, how much more does it cost you to do this option than  				a regular 4-hour Head Start program? What, specifically, are the extra costs  				(e.g., personnel, occupancy, food, supplies and equipment)?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><h4>III. Issues with Program Operation</h4>
<ol type="A"><li><span>Concerns</span>. When you  		  first discussed full-day operation, what issues were debated in the Policy  		  Council? Have you tried different program schedules? What are the current  		  concerns about full-day operation?</li>
<li><span>Families served</span>. Has  		  the selection of some families over others worked well, i.e., are you serving  		  the families you feel you should serve? Are you serving those you feel you can  		  serve the best?</li>
<li><span>Funding</span>. Is the joint  		  funding a concern or have all problems been worked out?</li>
<li><span>Working parents</span>. Is  		  there concern expressed in the Policy Council, among staff, or in the community  		  to increase services for working parents?</li>
</ol><h4>IV. Coordinating with AFDC</h4>
<ol type="A"><li><span>Current relationship</span>.  		  Do you now have a good relationship with staff working for AFDC? Do you  		  coordinate with WIN so that women on AFDC who are entering education or  		  training programs can find slots in your full-day program?</li>
<li><span>Issues</span>. What sorts of  		  issues have arisen in coordinating with AFDC/WIN staff?</li>
<li><span>Work/welfare</span>. Under a  		  new work/welfare program which lowers the age of children whose mothers must  		  enter a training program, is there a way you could help these mothers?</li>
</ol><h4>V. Expansion</h4>
<p><b>Think about possibilities for expanding your program. How could you  		serve working mothers better? Would you expand the program you have by adding  		classrooms? family day care homes? What sort of funding would be  		required?</b></p>
