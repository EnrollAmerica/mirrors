<hr /><p>This article compares the organization and financing of long-term care  		for the elderly in the United States with that of other advanced industrial  		countries. While the article is based largely on the author's own research  		(Doty, 1998; Doty and Mizrahi, 1989), including studies carried out from 1983  		to 1986 under the auspices of the International Social Security Association and  		during 1987 and 1988 for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  		Development, it also draws on recent studies by other researchers (American  		Association of Retired Persons, 1986; Monk and Cox, 1989; Dieck, 1989; Moss,  		1989; Newman, 1987; and Zappolo and Sundstrom, 1989).</p>
<p>As the United States debates reform of long-term-care financing,  		examining other countries' approaches to long-term care for the elderly can  		help expand the range of reform options for consideration. To draw useful  		lessons from other countries' experiences, however, we must first reexamine  		many of the preconceived notions we have about how their approaches to  		long-term-care financing differ from ours.</p>
<h2>MYTHS</h2>
<p>"America," writes Thomas Jazwiecki (1989), "still lags behind western  		Europe and several other countries in developing a comprehensive and integrated  		long-term healthcare plan." Gail Shearer (1989) of the Consumer's Union  		characterizes U.S. financing of long-term care as different from that of other  		countries in "requiring impoverishment as a condition of eligibility for public  		benefits" and being "biased toward institutionalization." According to  		Brookings Institution researchers Alice Rivlin and Joshua Wiener (1988):  		"Although most western European countries and Canada cover long-term care along  		with acute care under their national health insurance or national health  		service, the United States makes a sharp distinction between the two kinds of  		care. Acute care is covered by social insurance under the Medicare program, and  		long-term care is primarily covered by Medicaid, a means-tested welfare  		program."</p>
<p>Similar comparisons have been made by politicians arguing for enactment  		of a comprehensive public long-term-care insurance program by the United  		States. For example, during the 1988 presidential race, one of the candidates  		in the Democratic primaries, Senator Paul Simon, declared it shameful that the  		United States--unlike other advanced industrial nations--did not already  		provide public insurance coverage for long-term care.</p>
<p>The above represent what many American policy analysts and policymakers  		believe to be true about the organization and financing of long-term care  		abroad. This author's research indicates, however, that these beliefs are for  		the most part based on myths, misconceptions or--at best--half-truths.</p>
<p><i>Myth 1: Other countries provide comprehensive long-term-care coverage  		along with acute-care benefits under their national health service/national  		health insurance programs.</i></p>
<p>In actuality, other advanced industrial countries--like the United  		States--have been and remain reluctant to expand health insurance coverage  		beyond medical and nursing home to include long-term care, especially those  		services considered primarily "social" rather than "medical" in character. No  		country provides comprehensive long-term-care coverage--that is, services  		across the continuum of institutional and home-and community-based  		care--through the same public insurance system that covers acute medical care  		or through a comprehensive public long-term-care insurance program. Thus, while  		Israel, for example, has recently implemented a form of public long-term-care  		insurance, funded like Social Security and medical insurance through payroll  		taxes, program benefits are limited to nontechnical home care intended to  		supplement and support family caregiving; nursing home and other residential  		care continues to be supported by a combination of private and government  		funding.</p>
<p>In all countries, national health insurance coverage of inpatient (in  		other words, "institutional") long-term care is limited to medically oriented  		chronic hospital or nursing home care. Similarly, coverage of noninstitutional  		long-term care under national health insurance is generally limited to medical  		daycare ("day hospitals") and home health (professional nursing and therapy)  		visits. In most advanced industrial countries, home-delivered long-term-care  		services such as homemaker/chore and personal care ("home help") are labeled  		social rather than health services. As social services, they are usually  		organized and--to a very considerable degree--funded at the local or regional  		level. In Canada, for example, the federal social services funding match to the  		provinces is 50 percent. In Sweden, only about 35 percent of financing for home  		care, on average, is provided by the central government. In Denmark the  		percentage is 25, with the rest coming from municipal revenues. Heavy reliance  		on regional and local funding, with funding levels left largely to local or  		regional option, and the absence of nationally uniform service requirements or  		eligibility standards imposed by the central government result in considerable  		local and regional variability in publicly funded home- and community-based  		care.</p>
<p>The extent of coverage for institutional long-term care under national  		health plans depends largely on whether institutional long-term care in a  		particular country is provided mainly in hospitals or in free-standing  		facilities and whether the latter are considered primarily "medical" or  		"social" care settings. Countries differ greatly in the proportion of their  		long-term-care institutions that are officially defined as "medical" versus  		"social." These labels are quite meaningful insofar as they reflect implicit  		political choices about the limits of health insurance coverage for long-term  		care--but they are not so meaningful in distinguishing types of care provided  		or clientele served. Thus, a preponderance of "social" care facilities  		emphasizing residential services may signify a philosophical aversion to the  		"medical model" of long-term care and an attempt to make long-term-care  		institutions more homelike. The European literature on long-term care makes  		clear, however, that many "social" care facilities are in fact older  		institutions that were originally established to serve poor and socially  		isolated but ambulatory residents but that increasingly care for older persons  		with chronic medical conditions and functional disabilities. Often what is at  		issue in the balance of long-term-care institutions designated "nursing homes"  		versus "residential" facilities is the political will to pay higher costs  		associated with providing increased medical and nursing services.</p>
<p>In Canada, about 8 percent of the elderly reside in long-term care  		institutions. Of these, only 1-2 percent live in welfare-financed personal-care  		homes, while the remainder receive care in nursing homes or hospital-based  		"extended care facilities" that are covered under provincial health insurance  		plans. Similarly, in Australia, about 6.8 percent of the elderly are in  		institutions--mostly nursing homes funded through a federal funding mechanism  		that provides the equivalent of "social insurance" coverage but is separate  		from coverage for acute care.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, however, fewer than a third of long-term-care  		institutions qualify for health insurance funding. Some 3 percent of elderly in  		the Netherlands reside in these "AWBZ" nursing homes, which are covered under  		the Exceptional Medical Expenditures Act. Like Medicare skilled nursing  		facilities (SNFs) in the United States, the AWBZ homes were originally intended  		to provide primarily postacute, rehabilitative, and convalescent care. However,  		they have evolved into something that is broader in coverage than a Medicare  		SNF yet more narrowly specialized and more heavily medical and nursing-oriented  		than the typical U.S. Medicaid-certified nursing home. An additional 8 percent  		of Dutch elderly reside in "old people's homes" (many of which provide what in  		the United States would be considered nursing home care) where the government  		subsidizes the cost of care only for those who cannot pay privately. Forty-four  		percent of the costs of care in these old peoples' homes comes from private  		payments, as compared to 4 percent in AWBZ homes.</p>
<p>In England, about 4.1 percent of the elderly population are in  		institutions, but only one in five receive care in geriatric wards of National  		Health Service (NHS) hospitals, which is the form of inpatient long-term care  		covered under the NHS system.</p>
<p>In the Federal Republic of Germany, where about 4.5 percent of the  		elderly population reside in homes for the aged and nursing homes, all such  		institutions are considered to be "social care" facilities and therefore  		ineligible for coverage by the Sickness Funds.</p>
<p>France and Belgium have adopted a different approach to the "medical"  		versus "social" care distinction. In these countries, national health insurance  		covers the medical component of care in long-term-care institutions, but  		residents themselves are responsible for paying the costs of the residential  		component of care. In France, national health insurance may cover up to 50  		percent of daily charges in the most medically intensive facilities, but, on  		average across all long-term-care institutions, national health insurance  		covers only about 14 percent of costs.</p>
<p><i>Myth 2: The United States is the only country that bases access to  		public long-term-care coverage on a means test or requires that individuals  		"impoverish" themselves by first exhausting their capacity to pay privately for  		care.</i></p>
<p>It should already be clear from the above discussion of limits on  		national health insurance coverage of long-term care that the United States is  		not alone in means testing eligibility for publicly funded institutional care.  		To the extent that care in long-term-care institutions is considered "social"  		rather than "medical," residents are frequently expected to exhaust their  		private-pay capacity before public funding is made available. In the Federal  		Republic of Germany, for example, nursing homes and homes for the aged are  		funded by private payments or through public assistance provided by the  		individual <i>Lander</i> (states). Welfare authorities in Germany carry means  		testing even farther than Medicaid agencies in the United States in also  		assessing the resources of adult children to determine whether they should be  		required to contribute toward the costs of their parents' care. It is estimated  		that about half the residents of German nursing homes and old age homes receive  		some welfare support. In England, the great majority of institutionalized  		elderly reside either in local authority homes or in private nursing and  		residential care homes. Residents of local authority homes have traditionally  		been supported by local welfare funds; however, in recent years the supply of  		such places has failed to keep pace with growth in the older disabled  		population, with the result that increasing numbers have sought care in  		privately run nursing homes and residential care institutions. In the early  		1980s, Britain created means-tested supplemental Social Security payments to  		help residents of private facilities who could not afford to pay the full costs  		of care. In France, individuals who cannot afford to pay the nonmedical (room  		and board) component of daily charges must apply for public assistance. It is  		estimated that about 50 percent of residents in "long-stay facilities" (that  		is, nursing homes) and about 39 percent of residents in the lower-cost  		retirement homes, including both those with and without nursing units, receive  		public assistance.</p>
<p>However, even countries that do not require means testing for access to  		public funding for long-term care typically require income-related cost sharing  		on the part of patients rather than the fixed rate, percentage-of-cost  		co-payments characteristic of health insurance coverage for acute medical care.  		Cost-sharing requirements for patients also tend to be much higher for  		institutional long-term care than for acute hospital care--in recognition of  		the substantial component of costs that goes toward basic living expenses.  		Thus, in Canada and Australia, resident fees are set in relation to Social  		Security benefits. In Canada, for standard care in a long-term-care  		institution, the resident is usually charged a monthly fee equal to the maximum  		federal monthly income security benefits less a comfort of about $50. For  		additional services or upgraded accommodations (such as a private room), the  		resident may be charged more. In Australia, residents' fees are set at 87.5  		percent of the Social Security pension. In the Scandinavian countries (Sweden,  		Norway, Denmark), nursing home residents must contribute their Social Security  		pensions plus between 60 and 80 percent of other private income, including that  		from interest, toward the cost of care. However, they are not required to tap  		the principal of investment assets, liquidate investments, or sell their  		homes.</p>
<p>Like the U.S. home health benefit under Medicare, similar benefits in  		other countries that provide home nursing typically require no co-payments.  		However, unlike the United States, where means testing usually limits access to  		publicly supported homemaker and personal care services to the poor or "near  		poor," most European countries (for example, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the  		Netherlands, and France) offer these types of home help to all citizens on a  		sliding scale, income-related fee basis (which in some countries can reach 100  		percent of costs for individuals with higher incomes). In England, where home  		care is primarily aimed toward the low-income elderly, some local authorities  		charge no fees, while others charge on a sliding scale. In Canada, co-payments  		for home care are charged by some provinces on a sliding scale, while others,  		such as Manitoba, offer these services free of charge.</p>
<p><i>Myth 3: Long-term-care service systems in other advanced industrial  		countries are more integrated and "rational," not fragmented like the U.S.  		system.</i></p>
<p>Clearly, since other countries do not offer comprehensive long-term-care  		coverage under national health insurance, then national health insurance  		funding cannot provide the mechanism for coordinating acute medical and  		long-term care or for integrating institutional and noninstitutional  		long-term-care services into a cohesive long-term-care service "system."  		Indeed, as in the United States, the financing, organization, and delivery of  		the various long-term-care services in other countries also tends to be  		fragmented and poorly coordinated. Which levels of government, which agencies  		and programs, and which provider organizations become involved and what roles  		they play depend on whether the long-term-care service in question is perceived  		as predominantly a housing, income support, medical, or social service. Only  		Denmark and, to a lesser degree, New Zealand and some Canadian provinces such  		as Manitoba and British Columbia have managed to superimpose organizational  		structures that systematically coordinate assessment of need and delivery of  		long-term-care services to individual clients. In Denmark, this coordination  		appears to have been achieved by purposefully rejecting a "medical insurance"  		model of financing and organizing the delivery of long-term care in favor of a  		"municipal social services" model. Linkage between acute and chronic medical  		care and long-term care is maintained, however, through the use of  		hospital-based geriatric assessment units as the principal  		transfer/coordination point between the two otherwise separate care  		systems.</p>
<p><i>Myth 4: Other countries do a better job of preventing  		institutionalization through generous public funding of home- and  		community-based alternatives.</i></p>
<p>European and other advanced industrial countries vary greatly in the  		emphasis they have placed on home- and community-based care or, for that  		matter, on preventing institutionalization as a goal. Historically,  		alternatives to institutionalization have been accorded a much stronger policy  		emphasis in Britain and the Scandinavian countries than in France, Belgium, or  		Germany, and publicly funded home care remains largely nonexistent in Japan.  		Moreover, while Britain and the Scandinavian countries have traditionally  		provided much more in the way of publicly funded home care for the disabled  		elderly than we have (Kane and Kane, 1976; Kahn and Hammerman, 1976; Senate  		Aging Committee, 1984), the lack of available home- and community-based care in  		the United States tends to be overstated. For example, a number of  		states--California, Illinois, Oregon, and Massachusetts, in particular--have  		statewide programs that do not limit services to cash assistance for people who  		are eligible for Medicaid.</p>
<p>A lack of good data makes it difficult to accurately compare U.S. and  		European rates of provision of home- and community-based services. Use of  		available data often makes for comparisons of the apples versus oranges  		variety. For example, Scandinavian and British statistics on home- and  		community-based long-term-care services regularly include local social services  		provisions because most funding is of this nature, whereas American statistics  		generally include only Medicaid-funded services and exclude those with funds  		from Social Services Block Grants and the Older Americans Act and state- and  		county-funded services because national statistics for these programs are  		difficult to obtain. Two recent reports (Intergovernmental Health Policy  		Project, 1988; World Institute on Disability; 1987) based on surveys of the  		states found, however, that Medicaid figures represent only half of total  		public spending on home- and community-based care in the United States.  		Similarly, in discussing home- and community-based long-term care in the United  		States, American analysts frequently exclude the over $2 billion annually spent  		on Medicare home health benefits because this is considered primarily  		"postacute" rather than "long-term" care. Yet, statistics on home care in  		Europe regularly include home nursing as well as home aides services.</p>
<p>Arguably, policies promoting home- and community-based alternatives to  		institutionalization should be compared and judged mainly on outcomes not  		inputs. This means looking at comparative institutionalization rates--not just  		rates of use of publicly funded home- and community-based services. It is so  		often said that public financing for long-term care in the United States is  		institutionally biased that it comes as quite a surprise to discover that the  		United States, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the United Kingdom have the  		lowest institutionalization rates among Western industrialized  		countries--around 4 to 5 percent. Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands have the  		highest rates--ranging between 9 and 11 percent. France, Belgium, Denmark,  		Australia, and Canada have institutionalization rates in the middle range of 6  		to 8 percent.</p>
<p>If we look in depth at the factors that appear to be responsible for  		these variations in institutionalization rates, we find that the countries that  		have invested more in publicly funded home- and community-based care are not  		generally those with the lowest institutionalization rates--if anything, the  		correlation is in the opposite direction. The Scandinavian countries claim to  		have reduced their institutionalization rates during the 1970s by expanding  		availability of home- and community-based care, but some Scandinavian observers  		believe that reductions in bed supply may have been more significant. Moreover,  		these countries started at a higher level of institutionalization than the  		United States and remain at a higher level even after the reductions. Finally,  		most of the reductions in institutional use have been achieved by phasing out  		nonmedical homes for the aged in favor of service flats with home-delivered  		care. There is little evidence to suggest that public funding for home- and  		community-based care has resulted in less use of nursing homes. According to  		Sundstrom (1985) home- and community-based long-term care largely serves a  		different population, as was found by the National Channeling and other  		demonstrations of home- and community-based alternatives in the United States  		(for a thorough review, see <i><b>Health Services Research</b></i>, 1988).</p>
<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p>This article has attempted to dispel some myths concerning how much  		greener the grass is in long-term-care systems on the other side of the U.S.  		border or across the ocean. The purpose is not to deny that other countries  		could have some better ways of doing things--only to suggest that we stop  		berating ourselves for failing to live up to excessively idealized images of  		what other countries have achieved. In considering reforms for long-term-care  		financing in the United States, Americans can benefit from studying the  		experiences of other countries. The more we broaden our horizons and examine  		the variety of approaches employed in other countries, the more we will be in a  		position to consider a broader range of options and to understand their  		respective advantages and disadvantages.</p>
