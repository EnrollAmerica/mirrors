</dl><p>As Federal and state programs affecting persons with developmental  		disabilities have been reevaluated in the last 20 years there has been a rapid  		growth in the demand for information about these persons. Unfortunately, little  		comprehensive information has been available about the general characteristics  		of this group. As a result, many of the new interventions had to be developed  		without basic information about the number, demographics, functioning, economic  		status, and overall health of persons with developmental disabilities,  		particularly those persons living in the community rather than in  		institutions.</p>
<p>Information from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)  		can be used to address this paucity of information about persons with  		developmental disabilities.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> SIPP is a nationally-representative survey  		that collected data about the characteristics of noninstitutionalized persons,  		including information about basic demographics, income, work, use of government  		programs, and general health and disability. While it is not possible to  		identify precisely persons with developmental disabilities in SIPP, the  		available information can be used to develop a profile of persons who are  		likely to have developmental disabilities. This population profile provides  		valuable insight into the general nature of this group.</p>
<p>The first section of this profile provides an overview of SIPP. The  		second section examines the definition of developmental disabilities and the  		ways in which the information collected in SIPP can be used to approximate this  		definition. The third section then provides information about the number of  		characteristics of persons who are identified as being likely to have  		developmental disabilities.</p>
<h2><a name="overview" id="overview">OVERVIEW OF THE SURVEY OF INCOME AND PROGRAM  		PARTICIPATION</a></h2>
<p>The Survey of Income and Program Participation is a nationally  		representative longitudinal survey of the adult civilian noninstitutionalized  		population in the United States. This survey collects detailed monthly  		information on income, program participation, and wealth. It is a multi-panel  		longitudinal survey to which replacement panels are added each year. The first  		(or 1984) Panel began in October 1983 and interviewed a longitudinal sample of  		persons at four-month intervals for a period of two and one-half years. The  		SIPP sample is defined by adults, age 15 or older, residing in approximately  		20,000 addresses (dwelling units) forming a cross-section sample of dwelling  		units in the United States. Although the survey is longitudinal, it is designed  		to support cross-sectional estimation for persons, families, and households  		residing in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>Each round of interviewing (or wave) asks a standard "core" set of  		questions about income, employment, and participation in several government  		programs. Most wavers also include topical modules that ask supplemental  		questions pertaining to a variety of issues that vary from interview to  		interview. One topical module in the 1984 Panel collected information about  		health conditions and limitations in functioning and work. It is this module  		from which this profile of persons with developmental disabilities has been  		developed.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Estimates of persons with developmental disabilities presented in this  		paper reflect the population in April 1984. The population estimates pertain to  		the U.S. civilian noninstitutional population, which comprises about 98 percent  		of the total U.S. population. The estimates are based on sample weights that  		reflect the probability of selection into the sample and adjustments to account  		for interview nonresponse and to reflect independent estimates of persons by  		age, race, and sex.</p>
<p>Because these estimates are derived from a sample survey, they are  		subject to sampling and nonsampling error. Sampling error stems from the  		natural variation of characteristics in the population and the fact that only a  		sample of the population is interviewed. Sampling error is explicitly taken  		into account when presenting estimates and making comparisons. Estimates where  		the standard error is more than 30 percent of the estimates's value are  		explicitly marked in the table. Furthermore, all comparisons discussed in the  		paper have been found to be statistically significant at the 90 percent level  		using a two-tailed test; other differences may not be significant. Formulas for  		approximating standard errors and making statistical tests are presented in  		U.S. Bureau of the Census (1987) and in Bye and Gallicchio (1988). In reporting  		estimates, all population counts have bee rounded off to the nearest 1,000  		persons. Estimates of percentages are computed on the unrounded numbers, but  		are reported rounded to one decimal place.</p>
<p>Nonsampling error cannot be explicitly measured or completely  		eliminated. Examples of nonsampling errors which affect the estimates presented  		here include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Misreporting of key variables used to classify persons as  			 developmentally disabled, particularly the variables pertaining to limitations  			 in work and the age at which such limitations became manifest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noninterviews which although they are corrected in part by the  			 weighting process may still result in some bias because sample attrition in  			 SIPP is not random.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Item nonresponse and inconsistencies across responses which are  			 corrected in part by the edit and imputation procedures employed by the Census  			 Bureau in producing the data. However, these procedures do not always perform  			 well, particularly at the extremes of the income distribution.</p>
</li>

<h2><a name="define" id="define">DEFINING DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WITH DATA FROM  		SIPP</a></h2>
<p>The distinguishing feature of developmental disabilities is that they  		become manifest during childhood and severely interfere with the typical course  		of a person's development. Initially, the term developmental disabilities was  		used to refer to persons with mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and  		autism. Since the late 1970s, the focus of the definition of developmental  		disabilities has shifted away from lists of specific conditions and now  		emphasizes limitations in specific life activities and individuals' needs to  		deal with these limitations. Developmental disabilities are currently defined  		by the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act Amendments  		of 1987 as: a severe, chronic condition that:</p>
<ol><li>is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or a combination  		  of mental or physical impairments</li>
<li>is manifested before the person attains age twenty-two</li>
<li>is likely to continue indefinitely</li>
<li>results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the  		  following areas of major life activity:
<ul><li>self-care</li>
<li>receptive and expressive language</li>
<li>learning</li>
<li>mobility</li>
<li>self-direction</li>
<li>capacity for independent living</li>
<li>economic self-sufficiency</li>
</ul></li>
<li>reflects the person's need for a combination and sequence of special,  		  interdisciplinary, or generic care, treatment or other services which are of  		  lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned or coordinated.</li>
</ol><p>SIPP does not contain sufficient information to operationalize this  		complete definition, even if it were clear what this definition meant by a  		"substantial" functional limitation or how to determine a need for lifelong  		interdisciplinary services. Thus, it is necessary to approximate this  		definition using the information available in SIPP, paying particular attention  		to approximating two critical aspects of the definition: the severity of the  		limitation and onset prior to adulthood.</p>
<h3>1. Measures of the Severity of Limitations</h3>
<p>For persons ages 16 to 72, SIPP contains information about severe  		limitations in four of the seven major life areas listed in the definition of  		developmental disabilities: economic self-sufficiency, self-care, independent  		living, and mobility. Limitations in economic self-sufficiency are measured by  		questions that ask whether the person's health or condition either (1) prevents  		them from working or (2) limits the amount or kind of work that he or she can  		do.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup> Limitations in  		self-care can be inferred from questions that ask about the need for assistance  		with basic Activities of Daily Living (ADLs): eating, dressing, personal  		hygiene, getting in and out of bed, and ambulation in the home.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> Limitations in the ability to  		live independently are measured by questions that ask about the need for  		assistance with some of the activities typically included in lists of  		Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), specifically light housework,  		meal preparation, and getting around outside the house.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup> Mobility is assessed in questions about  		difficulty climbing stairs or walking three blocks.</p>
<p>This information about limitations in work and the need for assistance  		with ADLs or IADLs provides a good basis for identifying persons with severe  		limitations. However, there are two important weaknesses with this information.  		First, SIPP addresses only four of the seven life areas contained in the  		definition of developmental disabilities. This focus means that some  		individuals with severe limitations in self-direction, communication, or  		learning may be missed by a classification scheme using only the data in SIPP.  		Second, SIPP does not explicitly distinguish between limitations that are  		expected to persist indefinitely and short-term limitations. Thus, persons with  		temporary limitations related to illnesses, accidents, or childbirth may be  		classified in the same manner as persons with chronic limitations related to  		mental retardation or cerebral palsy.</p>
<p>For children, both the practical definition of developmental  		disabilities and the information collected in SIPP are different than for  		adults. Many of the life areas are ill-defined or do not pertain to children,  		particularly the life areas of economic self-sufficiency, self-direction, and  		independent living. Thus, a simpler definition based on typical activities for  		children would be appropriate. SIPP essentially uses such a modified approach  		by collecting information about whether a child (age 17 or younger):</p>
<ul><li>Has a long-lasting physical condition that limits his or her ability  		  to walk, run, or play</li>
<li>Has a long-lasting mental or emotional problem that limits his or her  		  ability to learn and do regular school work</li>
</ul><p>While there are undoubtedly some measurement problems with respect to  		these questions, children with limitations in either of these two areas are  		likely to be developmentally disabled.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>2. Measures of the Onset of Limitations</h3>
<p>SIPP collects information about the onset of limitations only in  		relation to work. For persons who report being limited in the amount or type of  		work that they can do, SIPP determines whether the limitation began before the  		person became of "working-age." For persons who report being unable to work,  		SIPP determines whether they have ever been able to work. While working-age is  		not explicitly defined in SIPP, it seems to provide an acceptable approximation  		to the aspect of the definition of developmental disabilities pertaining to  		onset prior to adulthood.</p>
<p>No age of onset is determined for limitations in ADLs or IADLs. However,  		for persons who report that their limitation(s) are due to mental retardation,  		it is reasonable to infer an onset during childhood. Children who are reported  		in SIPP as being limited in physical activities or learning have an onset prior  		to age 22 by definition.</p>
<h3>3. Identifying Persons with Developmental Disabilities  		in SIPP </h3>
<p> The information available in SIPP about persons ages 16 to 72 has been  		used to define three groups of persons that approximate to different degrees  		the population of persons with developmental disabilities:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Narrow Definition</b> classifies persons as being developmentally  			 disabled if they report that their health or condition has always prevented  			 them from working at a job or business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Middle Definition</b> includes all persons who meet the narrow  			 definition plus two other groups of persons:</p>
<ol><li>those who report being currently unable to work and having a work  				limitation that started prior to working age</li>
<li>those who report having mental retardation <b>and</b> either  				needing assistance with ADLs or IADLs or receiving disability  				benefits.<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup></li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p><b>Broad Definition</b> includes all the persons who meet the narrow  			 definition or who report a work limitation that began prior to their reaching  			 working-age.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The narrow definition includes persons with relatively severe  		limitations that arose prior to adulthood. Thus, persons meeting this  		definition are generally likely to be developmentally disabled. The drawback of  		this definition is that it may exclude persons who have attempted to work  		despite their severe limitations or who have worked in supportive settings such  		as sheltered workshops or supported employment programs. Also, as noted  		earlier, persons with limitations in life areas other than work will be  		excluded from this definition.</p>
<p>The middle definition addresses these two deficiencies of the narrow  		definition by including persons with limitations due to mental retardation and  		persons whose work disability had its roots in limitations that arose prior to  		working-age. This middle definition is probably the most accurate of the three  		alternative SIPP-based definitions.</p>
<p>The broad definition is almost certainly over-inclusive since some  		persons who are limited in the amount or type of work they can do would not be  		impaired sufficiently to be considered to have a developmental disability.  		Nevertheless, this group provides a useful reference since it contains persons  		who have work limitations that arose prior to their reaching working-age.</p>
<p>In addition to these three groups, it is useful to consider those  		persons who would not be classified as developmentally disabled under any of  		the definitions. This group, which encompasses over 97 percent of the  		noninstitutional population ageas 16 to 72, includes persons with no  		limitations in functioning as well as persons whose limitations arose in  		adulthood. This group provides a reference point for interpreting the  		information about persons with developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>These four groups are defined for persons ages 16 to 72, the persons who  		are asked the questions about work limitations. It would also be possible to  		define a fifth group: children who are limited in their ability to walk, run,  		play, or learn. These children are profiled in Mathematica Policy Research  		(1989).</p>
<h2><a name="profile" id="profile">A PROFILE OF PERSONS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL  		DISABILITIES</a></h2>
<p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> presents the characteristics of the groups  		identified by the three alternative definitions of developmental disabilities  		as well as the characteristics of the persons without developmental  		disabilities. As noted, the estimates in this table pertain to adults included  		in the SIPP sample who are between the ages of 16 and 72 years old.</p>
<p>The profile begins with an assessment of the accuracy of the SIPP-based  		definitions of developmental disabilities. It then turns to examine the  		demographic, economic, and health characteristics of the persons identified as  		developmentally disabled. The paper concludes with some general observations  		about using survey data to identify persons with developmental disabilities and  		about the information available in SIPP about this population.</p>
<h3>1. The Accuracy of the SIPP-Based Definitions of  		Developmental Disabilities</h3>
<p>There is no independent information with which to verify the SIPP-based  		classifications of persons as having or not having developmental disabilities.  		The classifications must therefore be judged on their consistency with other  		available information about persons with developmental disabilities. This can  		be done by comparing the prevalence rates implied by the SIPP data with rates  		estimated from other information. In addition, the severity of developmental  		disabilities should be reflected in the SIPP data about impairments and receipt  		of disability benefits.</p>
<p><b>The Prevalence of Developmental Disabilities</b>. The prevalence  		estimates presented in the first two rows of <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>  		clearly indicate the differential inclusiveness of the three alternative  		definitions. The narrow definition classifies almost 1.3 million  		noninstitutionalized persons between the ages of 16 to 72 years old as having  		developmental disabilities. This estimate suggests a prevalence rate for  		developmental disabilities of approximately 0.8 percent of the adult  		noninstitutional population. The middle definition indicates that over 1.7  		million adults (1.1 percent of the population group ages 16 to 72) would have  		developmental disabilities while the broad definition classifies 4.6 million  		such persons (2.8 percent of this age group) as developmentally disabled.</p>
<p>In order to compare these rates with those derived from other data  		sources, it is necessary to add in the persons with developmental disabilities  		who are excluded from SIPP. In particular, it is necessary to add in the  		estimated 250,000 persons who live in state and community-based facilities for  		persons with mental retardation and the approximately 80,000 persons with  		mental retardation who live in nursing homes.<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>

</tr></table><p>When these persons are added to the 1.7 million persons classified as  		developmentally disabled in the middle definition, the resulting total of just  		over 2 million adults implies a prevalence rate for adults of 1.3 percent. This  		rate is slightly below the prevalence rate of approximately 1.5 percent of the  		adult population (including persons in institutions) estimated by Kiernan and  		Bruininks (1986) on the basis of their review of the available prevalence  		literature. The prevalence rate corresponding to the narrow definition would be  		1 percent while the rate corresponding to the broad definition would be 3  		percent. Thus, the estimates based on SIPP appear to bracket the currently  		available prevalence estimates for developmental disabilities, with the middle  		definition coming closest to approximating the prevalence estimates derived  		from other studies. This consistency provides some reassurance that the  		SIPP-based classification identifies persons who are developmentally disabled.  		Of course, given the level of uncertainty inherent in the existing prevalence  		literature, it is unclear whether much importance should be attributed to the  		difference between the 1.3 percent prevalence rate estimated using SIPP data  		and the 1.5 rate suggested by the literature review of Kiernan and  		Bruininks.</p>
<p><b>The Extent of Impairments and Disability-Benefit Receipt Among  		Persons Classified as Having Developmental Disabilities</b>. The sets of  		estimates following the prevalence estimates in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>  		provide two alternative measures of disability.<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup> The first is based on limitations in  		functioning and the second on receipt of benefits from programs targeted toward  		persons with disabilities. Because these measures of disability are based on  		some of the same variables as the classifications of developmental  		disabilities, some degree of correlation is expected. Nevertheless, these  		estimates suggest a consistency between the classification of developmental  		disabilities and other disability classifications. Furthermore, the estimates  		indicate the severity of impairments among persons classified as  		developmentally disabled.</p>
<p>For example, almost 36 percent of the persons identified by the narrow  		and middle definitions of developmental disabilities reported needing  		assistance with ADLs or IADLs. Another 25 percent reported having serious  		physical or sensory limitations. Less than 25 percent of the persons classified  		by these two definitions as having developmental disabilities reported no need  		for assistance and no physical or sensory limitation. The corresponding figure  		for the general population without developmental disabilities is approximately  		84 percent.<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> also indicates the extent to which persons  		receive disability benefits. Because information about receipt of disability  		benefits can only be obtained from SIPP for persons from 18 to 64 years old,  		the comparison of definitions of developmental disabilities and receipt of  		disability benefits is limited to persons in this age range.</p>
<p>SIPP data about the receipt of disability benefits is based, in part, on  		special procedures developed by the Social Security Administration (Vaughan,  		1989). These procedures provide a means for using information in SIPP to  		determine whether Social Security beneficiaries under 65 years old are  		receiving benefits because of their own disability.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup> In addition, Supplemental  		Security Income recipients under 65 years old can be assumed to be receiving  		these benefits because of disability as can those recipients of Veterans'  		Administration (VA) benefits who report having a 100 percent VA disability  		rating.</p>
<p>The estimates in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> show relatively high  		rates of disability-benefit receipt among persons identified in the SIPP as  		having developmental disabilities. Approximately 60 percent of the persons  		identified under the narrow and middle definitions are estimated to receive  		disability benefits. Not only does this indicate that many of these persons are  		sufficiently impaired to be considered disabled under the Social Security  		Administration's disability determination process, but it also indicates the  		relatively high use of public support by the persons classified as  		developmentally disabled.</p>
<p>Overall, these comparisons suggest that the SIPP-based definitions of  		developmental disabilities provide an imperfect but reasonable basis for  		identifying such persons. The high proportion of persons with limitations in  		functioning among those classified as developmentally disabled (particularly by  		the narrow and middle definitions) indicates the severity and  		multi-dimensionality of the limitations faced by persons in this group. The  		severity of the limitations is also indicated by the high fraction receiving  		disability benefits.</p>
<p>One disconcerting aspect of this comparison is that over 20 percent of  		the persons identified by the narrow definition report no need for ADL/IADL  		assistance or any sensory/physical impairments. It is unclear whether these are  		persons whose limitations are manifest only the respect to work or whether  		their limitations are not captured in SIPP. Given that the SIPP questions focus  		primarily on physical impairments, it seems likely that some persons whose  		limitations are primarily cognitive may not have reported being limited in  		SIPP. In the conclusion section we will return to the issue of the accuracy of  		the three definitions, after reviewing the estimated population  		characteristics.</p>
<h3>2. Characteristics of the Persons Identified as  		Developmentally Disabled</h3>
<p> All three of the alternative SIPP-based definitions of developmental  		disabilities identify, on average, persons who tend to have less education,  		earn less, live in poor households, and have poorer health relative to persons  		who are not developmentally disabled. In general, the characteristics of the  		groups identified by the narrow and middle definitions are similar, while  		persons identified as developmentally disabled by the broad definition tend to  		have characteristics that would place them in between the groups defined by the  		other developmental disability definitions and the general population.</p>
<p> <b>Demographics</b>. The most striking findings with regard to basic  		demographics pertain to gender and race for persons classified using the narrow  		and middle definitions. In both these groups, approximately 60 percent are  		female while 52 percent of the non-developmentally disabled population is  		female. With respect to race, the fraction of Blacks among the persons  		identified by the narrow or middle definition is approximately 2.5 times the  		fraction for the general population. The broad definition also yields a higher  		than expected fraction of Blacks classified as developmentally disabled,  		although that definition did not produce a difference with respect to  		gender.</p>
<p>The reason for such differences is unclear. In part, it may reflect a  		combination of factors including the nature of the labor market and the focus  		of the narrow and middle definitions on being unable to work. If Blacks and  		women who become impaired at an early age perceive that there are few labor  		market opportunities, they may be more likely than other persons to drop  		completely out of the labor market. Given the overall patterns of earnings  		among groups defined by race and gender, such a perception might not be  		surprising. One implication of such a perception would be that Blacks and women  		would be more likely than similar persons in other groups to report in a survey  		that they were unable to work.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup> Correspondingly, Blacks and females would be  		more likely to be classified as developmentally disabled under the narrow or  		middle definitions. Under the broad definition, which includes persons who are  		limited in work as well as being prevented from work, the distribution of men  		and women is essentially the same as the overall population, although there are  		still slightly more Blacks classified as developmentally disabled by the broad  		definition than would be expected on the basis of the overall population racial  		mix.</p>
<p>Clearly, these patterns warrant additional research into both the  		classification methods and possible explanatory factors. In addition, these  		patterns must be kept in mind when interpreting the other statistics in  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a> since most of the other population  		characteristics examined are correlated with race and gender.</p>
<p>The information in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> about education  		reflects the early onset of disability and the corresponding delays in  		educational attainment for persons with developmental disabilities. Two-thirds  		of the persons who meet the narrow definition of developmental disabilities did  		not complete high school compared with only a quarter of the general  		population. Similarly, fewer than 10 percent of the persons identified in the  		narrow and middle definitions have post-secondary education compared with about  		35 percent of the non-developmentally disabled population.</p>
<p>The delay in development may also explain the observed differences with  		respect to living arrangement. We find that relatively few adults who are  		identified as having developmental disabilities are living independently,  		either by themselves or with a spouse. Most adults with developmental  		disabilities (almost 70 percent) are unmarried and living with relatives. In  		contrast, among the general population most adults are married and living with  		their spouse or are living alone. These findings are consistent with the  		limitations expressed in the formal definition of developmental  		disabilities.</p>
<p><b>Economic Status</b>. The reliance on public support, which was seen  		in the fraction of persons receiving disability benefits, is also seen in the  		statistics pertaining to economic well-being. Persons identified as  		developmentally disabled under the narrow and middle definitions appear to live  		in households that receive over 55 percent of their cash income from Social  		Security or government transfer programs.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup> These households report receiving less than  		40 percent of their income from earnings. In comparison, among the general  		population, households report receiving 75 percent of their cash income from  		earnings.</p>
<p>Despite the receipt of various types of income support, persons  		identified as having developmental disabilities tend to live in households that  		are substantially poorer than the general population. The average and median  		household income (in April 1984) for persons identified under the narrow and  		middle definitions was 40 to 45 percent less than for the general population.  		Among persons identified under these two definitions, approximately one-third  		live in poor households, three times the rate of the general population. An  		additional 16-17 percent of the developmentally disabled persons (identified  		with the narrow or middle definitions) are in near-poor households with incomes  		between 1 and 1.5 times the poverty level. When the poor and near poor groups  		are combined, almost half of the developmentally disabled persons are estimated  		to live in needy households. This raises concern about the availability of  		these households to meet the needs to persons with developmental  		disabilities.</p>
<p>Correlated with the observed low income of persons with developmental  		disabilities is a very low rate of employment. Less than 6 percent of the  		persons identified by the middle definition were working at the time of the  		interview compared with 65 percent of the general population. Even when they  		work, the persons identified through the middle and broad definitions earn  		substantially less than workers in the general population.</p>
<p><b>Health Characteristics</b>. The measures of health indicate that the  		narrow and middle definitions of developmental disabilities identify groups  		that have relatively poor health. Over half these persons report being in poor  		or fair health, with about 25 percent reporting that they are in poor health.  		In contrast, less than 15 percent of the general population report being in  		fair or poor health. Persons identified by the narrow and middle definitions  		also spend more days in the hospital, visit the doctor more often, and spend  		more time bedridden than the general population.</p>
<p>Due in large part to the coverage of Medicare and Medicaid, persons with  		developmental disabilities appear to be as able as the general population to  		obtain health insurance coverage. (The estimated fractions of persons without  		coverage classified under the narrow and middle definitions are not  		statistically different from the estimated fraction for the population as a  		whole.) Persons identified under the narrow and middle definitions, participate  		in the Medicare and Medicaid programs almost 5 times as much as do persons in  		the general population (two-thirds of the developmentally disabled groups have  		Medicare or Medicaid coverage compared with 14 percent of the general  		population). This differential rate of public coverage offsets the  		substantially lower rates of private health-insurance coverage among the  		persons identified as developmentally disabled.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that among persons identified by the broad  		definition of developmentally disability, the fraction without health insurance  		is higher than among the overall population. Persons meeting the broad  		definition are, on average, less impaired than persons meeting the narrow or  		middle definitions, although persons meeting the broad definition may still  		have substantial difficulties, particularly in obtaining and holding  		well-paying jobs. As a result, persons meeting the broad definition may fall in  		a gap between the major sources of health insurance: they are not covered by  		Medicare or Medicaid programs that would provide public coverage and yet they  		have too little employment, on average, to obtain private health insurance.</p>
<p>Another aspect of health pertains to the specific conditions that limit  		persons in work or other activities. SIPP collects information about the  		conditions that limit respondent's ability to work or perform basic activities  		(specifically, getting around and light housework/meal preparation). This  		condition information is potentially problematic because of misreporting of  		stigmatizing conditions. Marquis et al. (1981) found a large negative bias in  		reporting mental illness and it seems likely that there are similar problems  		with self-reports of mental retardation. Thus, it is likely that these types of  		stigmatizing conditions are under-reported or misreported.</p>
<p>With this qualification in mind, it is interesting to note that only 23  		to 27 percent of the persons classified as developmentally disabled under the  		narrow and middle definition indicate that their limitation is due to mental  		retardation. This rate is far below even the wide range of estimates reported  		in the literature, which indicate that between 35 and 90 percent of the  		developmentally disabled population is mentally retarded (U.S. Department of  		Health and Human Services, 1988). Thus, the finding in SIPP that fewer than 30  		percent of the persons identified as developmentally disabled are mentally  		retarded suggests that there are problems with the classification scheme or the  		condition data. The number of persons reporting other conditions is generally  		too small to provide an adequate basis for precisely estimating the fraction of  		persons with other conditions.<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>3. Conclusions from the Profile of Persons with  		Developmental Disabilities</h3>
<p> Two general conclusions stem from the estimates reported in  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. One pertains to the use of survey data like that  		contained in SIPP to identify persons with developmental disabilities. The  		other is the poor economic and health condition of many of the persons  		identified as developmentally disabled in SIPP.</p>
<p> <b>Using Survey Data to Identify Persons with Developmental  		Disabilities</b>. No definitive assessment of the accuracy of survey-based  		identification of persons with developmental disabilities can be made without  		some sort of independent collaborative evidence. The SIPP-based classification  		suggests, however, that it is possible to use survey data to identify persons  		who are likely to have developmental disabilities. Prevalence rates derived  		from SIPP are generally consistent with the currently accepted prevalence rate  		estimates derived from other sources. In addition, persons identified in SIPP  		as having developmental disabilities generally have limitations in more than  		one area, a finding that is consistent with the multi-dimensional nature of  		developmental disabilities.</p>
<p> The challenge in identifying persons with developmental disabilities  		appears to be that definitions based on a single dimension may miss some  		persons who have severe limitations in other dimensions. Thus, the narrow  		definition, which is based only on an inability to work that originated prior  		to working age, identifies only about two-thirds of the number of persons  		expected to be developmentally disabled on the basis of independent prevalence  		estimates. In order to obtain a prevalence estimate that is consistent with  		those in the literature (e.g., the middle-definition rate), it is necessary to  		include persons identified as having limitations in other life areas such as  		self-care or independent living.</p>
<p> The inability to identify persons with developmental disabilities  		solely by asking about one life area reflects the complex nature of  		developmental disabilities. It may also reflect the results of formal and  		informal services which may enable persons with developmental disabilities to  		work or perform other basic functions despite their impairments. Thus, it seems  		that survey procedures to identify persons with developmental disabilities will  		need to ask about all or most of the life areas in the definition and possibly  		about specific conditions or support-service use.</p>
<p> The SIPP data also suggest that the administrative records of the SSI  		or SSDI programs would be an inadequate basis for identifying the general  		population of persons with developmental disabilities. <a href="#table1">Table  		1</a> indicates that only 60 percent of the persons identified as having  		developmental disabilities in SIPP received disability benefits from these  		programs. While this estimated participation rate is not conclusive--due to the  		imprecision in identifying persons with developmental disabilities--the SIPP  		evidence does suggest that a sizable number of persons of interest to the  		developmental disabilities system may not be participating in the SSI or SSDI  		programs.</p>
<p><b> Characteristics of Persons with Developmental Disabilities</b>.  		Beyond the methodological results of this profile lies the picture of a group  		who, on average, have limited economic resources with which to meet their  		needs. Compared with the general population, persons with developmental  		disabilities are less likely to hold a job, tend to earn less when employed,  		are more likely to live in poor households, and have poorer health. The  		relatively poor health status of persons with developmental disabilities (as  		show in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>) coupled with expectations about the  		nature of developmental disabilities suggest that these are persons who need  		more than average levels of service to meet basic living standards. However,  		the earnings and income findings indicate that these persons have less than  		average resources even when counting government income maintenance programs,  		although they appear to have an average level of access to health insurance as  		a result of the Medicare and Medicaid programs.</p>
<p> The general conclusion of this profile therefore reinforces the notion  		that efforts to assist persons with developmental disabilities cannot focus  		solely on specific health or physical conditions. These individuals and their  		families are likely to share traits common to other population groups that are  		poor or otherwise disadvantaged. Their problems are likely to reflect their low  		income, health concerns, living arrangements, educational attainment, and job  		prospects, just as much as the specific condition underlying their disability.  		Efforts to address this multi-dimensional problem must therefore be ready to  		address a range of issues and to function in the context of a group with high  		rates of poverty and low rates of employment.</p>

<p><a name="note1" id="note1">The</a> U.S. Bureau of the Census (1986) and  			 Mathematica Policy Research (1989) present SIPP-based profiles of persons with  			 disabilities and impairments in general. Additional information about the  			 implementation of SIPP and the types of data collected is presented in U.S.  			 Bureau of the Census (1987).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note2" id="note2">Specifically,</a> data are drawn from Wave 3 of the  			 1984 panel supplemented with information from Waves 1, 2, and 4 and with edited  			 data developed by the Social Security Administration (Vaughan, 1989). The  			 integration of data from the Social Security Administration was necessary to  			 supplement the Wave 3 information about beneficiary status for recipients of  			 Social Security benefits in order to identify those persons who were receiving  			 benefits because they were disabled rather than because they were retired or  			 were survivors or dependents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note3" id="note3">Persons</a> who have worked at any time in the last  			 four months are not asked about whether they are prevented from working. Thus,  			 persons who have recently attempted to work and failed or who have worked in  			 supported settings will only be asked about work limitations not whether they  			 are prevented from working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note4" id="note4">Katz</a> et al. (1963), Lawton (1970), and Phillips,  			 Baxter, and Stephens (1981) discuss how the need for assistance with ADL  			 indicates a meaningful limitation in a person's ability to care for  			 him/herself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note5" id="note5">Other</a> activities commonly included on lists of  			 Instrumental Activities of Daily Living include shopping, using the telephone,  			 traveling beyond walking distance, taking medications, and managing finances  			 (see Phillips, Baxter and Stephens (1981). The specific IADLs included in SIPP  			 appear to be oriented more toward physical activities than are some of the  			 excluded IADLs such as the need for assistance with shopping, using the  			 telephone, and money management. Thus, the data available in SIPP may miss  			 persons whose ability to live independently is limited due to cognitive rather  			 than physical limitations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note6" id="note6">Two</a> types of measurement problems are likely to  			 arise. First, parents may not be aware of developmental problems for very young  			 children, particularly those children who have not entered school (at which  			 time problems are more likely to be identified through school-based screening  			 and testing efforts). Second, the SIPP questions do not provide an objective  			 basis for respondents to determine how severe a limitation must be before it  			 should be reported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note7" id="note7">SIPP</a> collects information about conditions only  			 in connection with reported limitations in work or the need for assistance with  			 ADLs or IADLs. Disability benefits are those from the Supplemental Security  			 Income (SSI) program, the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program,  			 or Veterans Programs where the person has a disability rating of 100  			 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note8" id="note8">Lakin,</a> et al. (1989) provides estimates of the  			 number of persons with mental retardation in community-based facilities, while  			 White, et al. (1987) provides an estimate of the number of such persons in  			 state-operated facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note9" id="note9">These</a> disability classifications were developed  			 by Mathematica Policy Research (1989) in the process of developing a SIPP-based  			 profile of all persons with impairments and disability. <a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a> provides a full definition of the categories and  			 the specific SIPP variables used in their construction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note10" id="note10">It</a> is interesting to speculate about the nature  			 of the persons who meet the narrow definition (that is those who have always  			 been prevented from working) yet have no need for assistance with ADLs or IADLs  			 and report no physical or sensory limitations. One possibility is that these  			 individuals have cognitive limitations that prevent them from working but are  			 not captured by the impairment-related questions in SIPP that focus primarily  			 on the ability to perform physical activities such as ambulating inside or  			 outside the house, climbing stairs, and lifting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note11" id="note11">Beneficiaries</a> who are older than 65 are paid  			 out of the retirement trust fund and are considered as retired rather than  			 disabled for Social Security purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note12" id="note12">Chirikos</a> and Nestel (1981) and Parsons (1980)  			 reports evidence of such tendencies among survey respondents: specifically,  			 persons with poorer larbor-market opportunities are more likely to report being  			 disabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note13" id="note13">The</a> income estimates reported in  			 <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> include only cash income and exclude the value of  			 food stamps, Medicaid, rent subsidies, and other forms of in-kind  			 income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note14" id="note14">The</a> estimate of no persons with mental  			 retardation among the general non-developmentally disabled population reflects  			 the way in which SIPP collects data about conditions. Only persons who report  			 needing assistance with ADL or IADL activities or report being limited in work  			 are asked about the conditions that create the limitation. Because persons who  			 report mental retardation as a cause for one of these activities will be  			 classified as developmentally disabled under one of the three alternative  			 definitions, no persons reporting mental retardation will be included in the  			 non-developmentally disabled population.</p>
