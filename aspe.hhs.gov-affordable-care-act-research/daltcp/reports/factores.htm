</dl><h2><a name="literature" id="literature">LITERATURE REVIEW</a></h2>
<p>The stress and burden experienced by many caregivers to the elderly has  		recently been the focus of considerable research. The general concept of  		caregiver burden is developed from the stress theory perspective (Romeis, 1989)  		which focuses on the caregivers ability to cope with the presumed stress of  		caregiving. Kinney and Stephens (in press) have identified three sources of  		such stress: characteristics of the impaired elderly person, characteristics of  		familial and other relationships involved in caregiving, and the behaviors  		required for caregiving (cited in Lawton, et al., 1989). In addition, the  		characteristics of the caregiver may be a source of stress.</p>
<p>Recognizing the sources and types of stress experienced by caregivers is  		a prerequisite to alleviating the burden associated with caregiving. Informal  		caregivers such as family and friends perform a vital service to disabled  		elderly people in the community. According to recent national surveys, informal  		caregiving is currently the dominant mode of providing long tern care services  		to the functionally disabled elderly (Doty, 1986). As the number of elderly  		people increases, the role of family caregivers may become even more  		important.</p>
<p>Many investigators believe that caregiver stress leads to decisions to  		institutionalize recipients of care and that interventions to reduce caregiving  		burden would prolong caregiving. Some studies suggest the decision to end  		caregiving and to institutionalize generally follows a period of cumulative  		stress and fatigue for the caregiver (Colerick and George, 1986; Zarit, Todd,  		Zarit, 1986). These studies by Colerick and George (1986) and Zarit, Todd, and  		Zarit (1986) have found that it is the characteristics and the well-being of  		the caregiver, as well as the caregivers' subjective burden, which are related  		to the decision to institutionalize a care recipient rather than objective  		indicators of patient illness or disability.</p>
<p>Research in the area of caregiver burden is generally of two types:  		studies which focus on conceptual models of burden related to caregiving and  		empirical studies of the impact of caregiver burden. Comparisons among studies  		that measure burden are difficult since a wide variety of variables pertaining  		to caregiver burden have been investigated. This review will define what is  		generally meant by caregiver burden and will describe the measures of burden  		most frequently used. In addition, evidence of the impact of caregiver burden  		with respect to specific physical and emotional health outcomes will be  		discussed.</p>
<h3>Defining and Measuring Caregiving Burden</h3>
<p>The stress or burden experienced by a caregiver to a frail elderly  		person can be defined as physical, emotional, and financial (Cantor and Little,  		1985, George and Gwyther, 1986; Horowitz, 1985). These categories can be  		divided further into objective or subjective measures of burden. Objective  		measures of caregiving burden include such factors as time spent on caregiving,  		tasks performed, health problems that develop, effect on employment, and  		limitations on one's social life. Subjective burdens are the caregiver's  		attitudes and emotional response to caregiving. Although subjective burden is  		more difficult to measure, the importance of caregivers' subjective perceptions  		and interpretations of the burdens they experience should not be minimized.</p>
<p>Some investigators suggest that the emotional burden which may accompany  		caregiving is the most pervasive problem and has the most severe consequences  		(Brody, 1985; Cantor, 1982). Emotional burden may be experienced as depression,  		demoralization or negative feelings; adverse effects in various spheres of  		personal or family life; and feelings of embarrassment and overload (Horowitz,  		1985). Physical burden may be characterized by difficulties in performing  		specific caregiving tasks and by deterioration in physical health (Poulshock  		and Deimling, 1984).</p>
<p>The effects of caregiving are usually conceptualized as unidimensional  		or as multidimensional (Horowitz, 1985). A unidimensional approach uses  		instruments, such as the widely-applied Burden Interview developed by Zarit and  		associates (1980) and the more recent Caregiver Strain Index developed by  		Robinson (1983), to examine a single aspect of the effects of caregiving, such  		as emotional burden. Poulshock and Deimling (1984) take a multidimensional  		approach in their study of 614 families living with and caring for an impaired  		elderly person. Their study examines the relationship of burden to impairment  		levels of the recipient and the effects of this burden on the relationship  		between caregivers and those receiving care. Their research indicates that  		reported burden correlates with the frail elder's impairment in cognitive  		functioning, in everyday behaviors such as sociability, and in activities of  		daily living. These factors in turn affect the quality of the relationship  		between the caregiver and the frail elderly person and lead to more or less  		interpersonal conflict, as well as restriction of activities for  		caregivers.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of the Care Recipient on the Impact of  		Caregiving</h3>
<p>As noted by Poulshock and Deimling (1984), most research on the burdens  		related to caregiving have focused on caring for persons who are cognitively  		impaired. Many studies use Alzheimer's patients and family support groups as  		study populations (e.g. George and Gwyther,1986). A recurring question in the  		literature is whether there are differences in caregiving burden by whether the  		recipient is cognitively or only physically impaired (Horowitz, 1985). Some  		studies indicate that caring for those with cognitive impairment appears to be  		the most stressful for caregivers (Horowitz, 1985; Cantor and Little, 1985).  		However, other studies have found the presence of cognitive impairment to be  		less critical than the specific disruptive behaviors which stem from it  		(Noelker and Poulshock, 1982; Horowitz, 1985; Cantor and Little, 1985; Zarit,  		Todd, Zarit, 1986).</p>
<p>In a review of the literature, Silliman (1988) addresses the differences  		in burden between caring for the cognitively impaired and the physically  		impaired. The literature she reviews suggests that the demands on caregivers to  		the physically impaired elderly are different from those on caregivers to the  		cognitively impaired. For example, elderly people with hip fractures require  		significant physical effort on the part of the caregiver, whereas patients with  		dementia are often less physically demanding but may require substantial  		supervision. Finding time away from caregiving may be very difficult for those  		who care for the cognitively impaired which may lead to increased stress.</p>
<p>Many additional studies have investigated the negative effects of caring  		for a frail elderly person. For instance, Zarit, Reever, and Bach-Peterson  		(1980) describe financial difficulties, role strain, and physical health  		deterioration fron providing care to an elderly relative with Alzheimer's  		Disease. A study by Coppel, Burton, Becker, and Fiore, 1985, found that 81% of  		a sample of spousal caregivers of Alzheimer's patients reported the presence of  		a diagnosable clinical depression at some point during the illness of the care  		recipient.</p>
<p>George and Gwyther (1986) compared indicators of well-being for those  		with caregiving responsibilities and similar individuals without these  		responsibilities (Romeis, 1989). Their study, using a sample of 510 family  		caregivers providing some level of care to memory impaired older adults,  		investigated four measures of well-being: physical health, mental health,  		social participation, and financial resources. They found that the resources  		available to the caregiver and the caregiving situation affected caregiver  		well-being more than the condition of the patient. Caregivers, compared to  		those without caregiving responsibilities, displayed decreased well-being in  		the areas of mental health and social participation. However, no evidence was  		found that caregivers experience declines in physical health and financial  		security relative to those who were not caregivers.</p>
<h3>The Burden of Cargiving by Characteristics of the  		Caregiver and the Structure of the Caregiving Relationship</h3>
<p>The burden of caregiving is not felt uniformly by all caregivers  		(Cantor, 1983). Spouses have different worries than children and report a  		greater degree of physical and financial strain than children and other  		relatives (Cantor, 1983). George and Gwyther (1986) also describe the  		heightened vulnerability of spouse caregivers. They report that spouse  		caregivers had significantly more doctor visits and poorer self-rated health  		than adult children and other relatives. Additionally, Fengler and Goodrich  		(1979) found that although morale was generally low in their study of wives  		caring for elderly disabled husbands, it was possible to separate the wives  		into low and high morale groups. The most frequently mentioned problems of the  		low morale wives were isolation, loneliness, economic hardship, and role  		overload. On the other hand, the overwhelming concern of children and younger  		relatives involved with frail elderly people is often their ability to obtain  		necessary help (Cantor, 1983).</p>
<p>Gender differences have been found in the type of care provided and the  		coping behaviors of caregivers (Barusch and Spaid, 1989). Fitting, Rabins,  		Lucas, and Eastham (1986) report that important differences in age and sex of  		caregivers are related to caregiving burden. Women's subjective reactions to  		caregiving tend to be more negative than those of men. Research has found that  		women report higher levels of burden and psychological distress associated with  		caregiving (Zarit, 1982); lower morale (Gilhooly, 1984); have higher depression  		scores on the MMPI (Fitting and Rabins, 1985) and report more negative symptoms  		feelings (Siegler and George, 1983).</p>
<p>Several reasons for women's greater sense of burden have been suggested.  		Since women caregivers are typically younger than men, they may experience  		greater "role" overload due to the other responsibilities that compete with  		caregiving (Fitting and Rabins, 1985). Men are harder to care for than women  		since they may rely more exclusively on the primary caregiver (Zimmerman,  		1986). Male caregivers receive more support from informal and formal sources to  		ease the burden of care and may cope more effectively with life stresses, and  		thus, cope more effectively with caregiving (Billings and Moos, 1981).</p>
<p>A study by Barusch and Spaid (1989) attempted to further explore gender  		differences in caregiver burden. They interviewed 131 spouse caregivers to  		explore why women typically report greater burden associated with caregiving.  		Their results suggest that age differences in male and female caregivers  		contribute to the observed differences in burden. Colerick and George's (1986)  		longitudinal investigation of 209 caregivers to patients with Alzheimer's  		Disease elaborated on the gender and age differences found regarding the level  		of caregiving burden predictive of institutionalization. They found that  		caregivers who institutionalized their patients were again more likely to be  		female, younger, employed, and children of the patient.</p>
<p>A study by Young and Kahana (1989) also supported the notion that burden  		and role strain are not uniform among caregivers. Their study of 183 heart  		patient-caregiver dyads analyzed gender and relationship singly and jointly  		with respect to the process and outcome of caregiving. Their results showed  		consistent patterns of strain with women. In particular nonspousal caregivers  		and daughters were found to experience the most severe caregiving burden.</p>
<p>Deimling, Bass, Townsend, and Noelker (1989) investigated the  		care-related stress of 180 spouse and adult-child caregivers in both shared and  		separate residences. Their approach utilized three measures of care-related  		stress: caregiver reports of physical and/or emotional health decline  		attributed to caregiving; caregiver perceptions of tension, strain, and upset  		in family relationships; and caregiver's activity restriction resulting from  		caregiving. Deimling and his colleagues found that spouse and adult child  		caregivers in shared households experience similar levels of care-related  		strain. However, when adult children in shared and separate households were  		compared considerable differences in strain were found. Adult children who  		shared households with the care recipient showed significantly greater activity  		restriction but less relationship strain than adult children in separate  		households.</p>
<p>Furthermore, strain decreases progressively with decreasing centrality  		of the relationship. Thus, friends and neighbors appear to be the least  		involved and register the least amount of strain in the role of primary  		caregiver (Cantor, 1983). In contrast, spouse caregivers report the greatest  		degree of strain, especially physical and financial strain. However, emotional  		strain, unlike physical or financial strain, is unique in that children and  		other relatives are just as likely to be negatively affected as spouses  		(Cantor, 1983).</p>
<p>Cantor's (1983) study of a sample of 111 caregivers found that the  		extent of impact on the everyday life of the caregiver appeared to be clearly  		related to the closeness of the kinship bond and the availability of the  		caregiver for continual involvement. As a result, the impact was most severe in  		the case of spouses, all of whom lived in the same house as the care recipient.  		The next most severely affected were caregiver children, followed by other  		relatives. Friends and neighbors were the least affected.</p>
<h3>The Longitudinal Effects of the Burden of  		Caregiving</h3>
<p>As the above studies have shown, assisting frail homebound elderly  		people involves significant strain and often requires changes and adjustments  		in lifestyle on the part of the primary caregiver. Cantor (1983) has found that  		the caregivers she studied handled the dilemma of conflicting demands and  		interpersonal strains not by denial of responsibility but by considerable  		personal sacrifice. Thus, free time for oneself and opportunities to socialize  		with friends, take vacations, have leisure time pursuits, and run one's own  		home were sacrificed in order to provide the time to care for a dependent  		elderly person. Most caregivers also maintained their relationship with their  		immediate families and their work situation at considerable personal cost  		(Cantor, 1983).</p>
<p>Research shows that caregiver's feelings of burden are associated with  		nursing home placement (Colerick and George,1986; Zarit, Todd, and Zarit,  		1986). The study by Zarit, Todd, and Zarit (1986) of 64 caregivers of dementia  		patients suggests that caregiver burden is a cumulative process. When demands  		exceed resources for a significant period of time the decision to  		institutionalize may result. Their findings are consistent with a model in  		which the negative impact of caregiving is mediated by the caregiver's  		perception of stress and coping responses. Not all caregivers find the same  		problems equally burdensome. They react differently to problem behaviors and  		they vary in their skills for managing these problems. For example, some  		caregivers may find incontinence burdensome, while others have more difficulty  		with repetitive behaviors.</p>
<p>The longitudinal studies by Colerick and George (1986) and Zarit, Todd,  		and Zarit (1986) suggest that caregiver burden is not directly influenced by  		the specific behavioral problems of the patient but is mediated by the  		caregiver's ability to tolerate these problems. Zarit, Todd, and Zarit (1986)  		found that caregivers' ability to tolerate problem behaviors often increases  		over time, even though the disease (and behaviors) may worsen. Caregivers  		themselves indicate they learn to manage problems more effectively or learn not  		to let problems bother them as much. The daily routine for providing care which  		many caregivers establish, although not without its stresses, is not  		excessively demanding or burdensome.</p>
<p>Winograd, et al. (1987) in their study of 18 Alzheimer's Disease  		patients and their families also found that both problem-solving coping and  		emotion-focused coping improve over time. They found that as caregivers learn  		more about the disease process, gain skills in patient management, and share  		with others their stress and negative feelings, the caregivers become better  		able to separate feelings of burden and low morale from intolerance toward the  		patient's behaviors.</p>
<p>Different caregivers also vary in their ability to tolerate stress.  		Spouse caregivers, possibly due to their enhanced sense of commitment to the  		care recipient, display a strong tendency to cope with the burdens of  		caregiving often until deterioration of their own health prevents them from  		providing care. Colerick and George (1986) found that one of the factors which  		significantly reduced the probability of institutionalization was the  		relationship of the caregiver to the patient, spouses being much less likely  		than others to institutionalize the patient. However, Zarit, Todd, and Zarit  		(1986) found that despite initial differences in subjective burden between  		husbands and wives, there were none two-years later. Although, children,  		followed by other relatives, friends, and neighbors, appear to have lower  		tolerance for the burden of caregiving than spouses.</p>
<p>In addition to learning how to tolerate stressful behaviors among care  		recipients, caregivers must continually renegotiate management strategies for  		caregiving (Colerick and George, 1986). Although the health status of the frail  		older adult may change, the frequency of memory or behavior problems may not  		increase. For example, Zarit, Todd, and Zarit (1986) found that as the  		patient's dementia worsened, some behaviors diminished in frequency or ceased  		altogether. Some of the most troublesome behaviors experienced with dementia  		patients such as wandering, paranoid accusations, and restlessness, were no  		longer manifested at the two-year follow-up. In contrast, the number of  		difficulties with activities of daily living were found to increase. Thus,  		caregiving demands for care recipients with dementia shift over time, but do  		not necessarily increase as patients move from moderate to severe levels of  		cognitive impairment.</p>
<h3>Summary and Direction for Future Research</h3>
<p>Overall, these studies suggest that the responsibilities of caregiving  		are burdensome for different people in different ways. In some studies personal  		characteristics of the caregiver appear most important while in others the  		level or nature of care required was more significant. Some of the variations  		in these results may be due to small samples of different types of caregivers  		to recipients with various diagnoses. In addition a heterogeneous mix of  		variables as well as different indices are used to measure stress and stain.  		Finally, differences in regional or socioeconomic characteristics may  		contribute to inconsistencies among the studies.</p>
<p>Future studies need to approach caregiving burden from the perspective  		of both the caregiver and the care recipient in the context of their specific  		caregiver relationship. In addition, the activities which are most burdensome  		for caregivers need to be determined. The heterogeneity of the caregiving  		experience must be further explored, as well as the implication of caring for  		people with different types of impairment. At a minimum, future studies need to  		differentiate between the strain of caregiving that is serious enough to  		adversely affect the continuation of the caregiver relationship and those  		strains which are transitory or existed prior to the need for caregiving  		(Romeis, 1989).</p>
<h2><a name="preliminary" id="preliminary">MEASURES AND PRELIMINARY FINDINGS</a></h2>
<h3>Definitions of Key Variables</h3>
<p><b>Primary Caregivers</b>: Those caregivers who were the sole caregiver  		or who took main responsibility for the elderly person. Each Sample Person (ie.  		care recipient) has a primary caregiver (n= 1327 primary caregivers). In 47  		cases, two people claimed "main responsibility" and both were retained as  		primary caregivers. In three cases there were three primary caregivers. Primary  		caregivers were not defined by relationship and included persons who were a  		spouse, child, other relative or nonrelative to the recipient.</p>
<p><b>Ending Caregiving</b>: The dependent variable in this study was  		ending caregiving (87 cases). Ending caregiving occurred when the caregiver  		stopped providing care because the care recipient entered a nursing home or  		other institution or the caregiver reported being no longer able to provide  		care, that the recipient was getting other care or was caring for him/herself.  		Cases in which caregiving ended because the recipient died were excluded (145  		cases). An additional 66 excaregivers who were secondary caregivers also are  		excluded from this study.</p>
<h3>Description of Tables</h3>
<p><b>Table 1</b>: <a href="factores.htm#table1">Table 1</a> provides the unweighted  		number of current primary caregivers and excaregivers by selected  		characteristics.</p>
<p><b>Table 2</b>: This table compares the distribution of caregivers by  		relationship to recipient in two studies, both using the ICS. Stone et al.  		(1986) indicate that among all caregivers a little over a third were spouses,  		close to two-fifths children and about a quarter were "others". The current  		study focuses on primary caregivers and as might be expected a higher  		proportion of these individuals are spouses, close to half. Together, spouses  		and children account for 83% of all primary caregivers.</p>
<p><b>Table 3 and Table 4</b>: <a href="factores.htm#table3">Table 3</a> represents  		characteristics of current primary caregivers (weighted) and <a href="factores.htm#table4">Table 4</a> represents the same characteristics among  		excaregivers (weighted). (Excaregivers are restricted to those who stopped  		giving care for reasons other than death of recipient.) Comparing, current  		caregivers to excaregivers indicates excaregivers are:</p>
<ul><li>Less likely (32.8% vs. 49.5%) to be a spouse of the care recipient  		  and more likely to be a daughter (35.7% vs. 28.2%).</li>
<li>More likely to be divorced or separated (14.7% vs. 8.4%).</li>
<li>More likely to be in the highest income group (300%+ of poverty)  		  (24.8% vs. 16.1%).</li>
<li>Twice as likely to be in the youngest age group, ages 14 to 44,  		  (24.2% vs. 11.5%) since they are more likely to be daughters or other  		  relatives.</li>
<li>More likely to be in households with three or more individuals  		  (indicating they have a family of their own) (26.9% vs. 15.7%).</li>
</ul><p><b>Table 5</b>: <a href="factores.htm#table5">Table 5</a> describes characteristics  		of current primary caregivers by cognitive impairment of the care recipient  		(weighted). The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (Pfeiffer, 1975) was  		used to determine cognitive impairment in the 1982 NLTCS. About three-quarters  		of the sample answered the SPMSQ and anyone with three or more errors was  		regarded as cognitively impaired. If education was less than eight years an  		additional error was allowed. For persons who did not answer the SPMSQ, a proxy  		response concerning the sample person's mental state was used.</p>
<ul><li>One third (32.8%) of recipients receiving care from informal  		  caregivers are cognitively impaired.</li>
<li>Caregivers who are 45-64 years old are more likely than other  		  caregivers to care for recipients who are cognitively impaired.</li>
<li>Female caregivers are more likely than males to take care of  		  recipients who are cognitively impaired (35.8% vs. 24.4%).</li>
<li>Non-white caregivers care for a greater percentage of cognitively  		  impaired recipients (46.8% vs. 30.3%). This finding should be interpreted with  		  caution due to the small numbers of non-whites in the data set.</li>
<li>Caregivers who are children and other relatives are more likely to  		  care for cognitively impaired recipients (daughter (42.2%), son (38.4%), other  		  relative (38.5%).</li>
<li>Caregivers who have a secondary caregiver available are more likely  		  to care for a cognitively impaired recipient than those who do not (38.2% vs.  		  26.7%).</li>
<li>Caregivers with 4 or more people in their household are more likely  		  to care for cognitively impaired recipients.</li>
</ul><p><b>Table 6</b>: <a href="factores.htm#table6">Table 6</a> reflects characteristics  		Of current primary caregivers by specific vulnerabilities (age 75+; below  		poverty; in fair or poor health; and with one or more ADLS). Among current  		caregivers 17.2% are 75 or older, 16.0% are poor, 38.6% report their health as  		fair or poor, and 5.3% report being limited in one or more activities of daily  		living. In addition:</p>
<ul><li>Of caregivers whose household income is below the federal poverty  		  level, three-fourths (72.3%) are female and more than one quarter (29.5%) is  		  non-white.</li>
<li>Of those caregivers who are age 75 or older, 88.9% are married to the  		  person receiving care.</li>
<li>Of caregivers who report fair or poor health, about two thirds  		  (68.0%) are women and 17.3% are non-white.</li>
<li>Of those caregivers with one or more ADLS, three-fourths (73.4%) are  		  women--two-thirds are spouses and one-quarter are daughters.</li>
<li>Within each group of "vulnerable" caregivers, over half indicate they  		  do not have a secondary caregiver available, a higher percentage than generally  		  occurs for caregivers overall.</li>
</ul><p><b>Table 7</b>: This table shows age of caregiver by characteristics of  		recipients of care.</p>
<ul><li>21.4% of all caregivers care for someone age 85 or older.</li>
<li>53.4% care for a person with three or more ADLS.</li>
<li>84.5% care for a person with three or more IADLS.</li>
<li>One-third care for a person who is both functionally limited and  		  cognitively impaired.</li>
<li>Caregivers under age 64 are likely to be caring for an aging parent.  		  Among 45 to 64 year old caregivers, 27.7% care for a person 85 or older and  		  69.6% care for someone 75 or older. Among younger caregivers (14-44 years old)  		  the recipient of care is more often below age 85 and 56.8% are below age  		  75.</li>
<li>A much higher percentage of those being cared for by 45 to 64 year  		  old caregivers are cognitively impaired (41.0%) compared to 22.4% for younger  		  caregivers).</li>
<li>Levels of ADL and IADL impairment, among those being cared for, are  		  about the same between caregivers under age 45 and those 45 to 64.</li>
</ul><p><b>Table 8</b>: <a href="factores.htm#table8">Table 8</a> shows the poverty level of  		current primary caregivers by characteristics of recipients of care.</p>
<ul><li>Caregivers in the highest income groups are more often caring for  		  someone 85 or older (30.9% compared to 15.6% in the lowest income group). These  		  are probably more often children in the work force which accounts for higher  		  incomes.</li>
<li>Levels and types of impairment of recipients of care do not differ  		  greatly within caregiver income levels.</li>
</ul><p><b>Table 9</b>: <a href="factores.htm#table9">Table 9</a> displays the health status  		and physical impairment of current primary caregivers by characteristics of  		recipients of care.</p>
<ul><li>Caregivers with one or more ADLS are more likely to care for someone  		  below age 75.</li>
<li>Levels and types of impairment of recipients of care do not differ  		  greatly by whether caregivers report their health as excellent/good or  		  fair/poor.</li>
<li>Caregivers with one or more ADLS themselves are less likely to care  		  for severely ADL-impaired people. 21.8% care for someone with no ADLS. However,  		  48.5% care for someone with 3 or more ADLS. In addition, they are as likely as  		  caregivers with no ADL impairment to care for IADL-impaired or cognitively  		  impaired individuals.</li>
</ul><p><b>Table 10 and Table 11</b>: These are preliminary tables which show  		aspects of caregiving or recipient behavior as relate to instrumental (<a href="factores.htm#table10">Table 10</a>) and emotional (<a href="factores.htm#table11">Table 11</a>)  		burden. These two tables show variables by whether differences between the  		responses of current and excaregivers were or were not statistically  		significant.</p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="analyses" id="analyses">WHY CAREGIVING ENDS: FACTORS RELATED TO ENDING  		CAREGIVING AMONG HELPERS TO ADL-IMPAIRED ELDERLY PEOPLE IN THE  		COMMUNITY</a></h2>
<p>The growing research literature on caregiving continues to document the  		stressful nature of caring for functionally disabled elderly people and the  		potentially harmful effects of caregiver burden (Romeis, 1989;Poulshock and  		Deimling, 1984; Cantor and Little, 1985; Pruchno and Resch, 1989; George and  		Gwyther, 1986). The primary focus in this line of research is to assess the  		effects of caregiving on the physical and psychological well-being of the  		caregiver. However, aside from diminished well-being, caregiving when  		burdensome may have behavioral implications. The quality of caregiving may  		suffer for example (Horowitz, 1978; Tobin and Kulys, 1979). This study  		investigates one behavioral outcome that is of considerable importance, the  		decision by a caregiver to end caregiving. In many instances, this is the point  		at which an elderly person is institutionalized, though a broader definition  		would include transitions for people in the community from one caregiving  		arrangement to another.</p>
<p>Two areas of research are pertinent to the issue of ending caregiving,  		studies of the effects of caregiving on those who provide help and studies of  		the process of institutionalization. Most studies of caregiving tend to focus  		on the impact of caregiving for the person providing care (Stoller and  		Pugliesi, 1989; Cantor and Little, 1985; Lawton, Brody, Saperstein, 1989;  		Barusch and Spaid, 1989; George and Gwyther, 1989). However, two recent studies  		of caregivers to dementia patients were concerned with factors that led  		caregivers to seek nursing home placement for recipients. Colerick and George  		(1986) in a study of 209 caregivers to Alzheimer's patients found that the  		caregiver's well-being and characteristics, such as age, employment status and  		relationship to the recipient, were more important predictors of  		institutionalization than characteristics of the patient, such as symptom  		severity and illness duration. Zarit, Todd and Zarit (1986) in a two-year  		followup of a sample of 64 spouse caregivers also found severity of the  		patient's symptoms was not related to nursing home placement. The caregiver's  		feelings of burden were associated with the decision to institutionalize and  		the ability of caregivers to successfully cope with their situation depended on  		a number of factors other than severity of illness.</p>
<p>Studies of predictors of institutionalization often focus on variables  		reflecting characteristics of the recipient (Branch and Jette, 1982; Greenberg  		and Ginn, 1979; Shapiro and Tate, 1988), though some measure of informal  		support is usually considered. These studies for the most part find informal  		support to be related to likelihood of institutionalization even though there  		is considerable variety in the way informal support is operationalized.  		Variables used include help from relatives (Greenberg and Ginn, 1979), having  		none or few children (Palmore, 1976; Greenberg and Ginn, 1979), living alone  		(Branch and Jette, 1982), and having a spouse at home. Studies that focus on  		predictors of institutionalization often have limited information about  		caregivers, as a result caregiver characteristics or perceptions are rarely  		included.</p>
<p>The present study examines factors related to ending caregiving among  		primary caregivers to disabled elderly people living in the community. Ending  		caregiving is defined in two ways. The first is an indication by a primary  		caregiver that they stopped providing help for a variety of reasons (excluding  		death of the recipient). The second reflects institutionalization of the  		recipient of care over a two-year period.</p>
<p>One objective of the study is to examine the relative importance of  		several factors which previous research suggests may play a role in ending  		caregiving. The factors of interest are recipient characteristics, caregiver  		characteristics, aspects of the caregiving role and perceptions of that role. A  		second objective of the study is to assess both the increased likelihood and  		the probability of ending caregiving in the presence of factors predictive of  		this outcome.</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p><b>Data</b>. The data for this study are from the 1982 National  		Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) and the Informal Caregiver Survey (ICS). The  		NLTCS is a nationally representative sample of functionally disabled (by ADL or  		IADL criteria) elderly people and the ICS is a random sample of caregivers to  		the ADL-impaired members of the NLTCS.</p>
<p>The NLTCS sampling frame was the population 65 years of age or older  		eligible for Medicare benefits. Screening interviews were conducted with 36,000  		Medicare beneficiaries to identify functionally impaired elderly people living  		in the community. Any person with 1 or more ADL or IADL limitations lasting or  		expected to last 3 months or longer was considered functionally impaired. Of  		the 6,393 individuals identified using these criteria, detailed interviews were  		conducted with 6,088 concerning functional limitations, assistance provided by  		others and use of health services (see Manton, 1988; Manton and Liu, 1987 for  		more details of the NLTCS study design).</p>
<p>The Informal Caregiver Survey was administered to a subsample of unpaid  		caregivers over the age of 14 assisting persons in the NLTCS who reported ADL  		limitations. For each respondent to the NLTCS interview, names and addresses of  		all caregivers, the type of help they gave and whether they were paid was  		obtained and used to determine the eligibility of caregivers for the ICS. A  		subsample of 2,089 caregivers was selected for interview and 1,925 interviews  		were completed. Procedures for selecting the subsample of caregivers resulted  		in a self-weighting sample representative of the national population of  		informal caregivers to ADL-impaired elderly people (Tourangeau, 1984).</p>
<p>The present analysis focuses on primary caregivers, people who were the  		sole caregiver or took main responsibility for the elderly person. From the  		total ICS sample, 1,417 primary caregivers were identified. The study group was  		further reduced by eliminating caregivers to people who died between the NLTCS  		interview and administration of the ICS. The final study group is 1,327 primary  		caregivers providing assistance to 1,274 functionally limited elderly people in  		the community. (For 47 people, two caregivers claimed "main responsibility" and  		for two respondents, three caregivers did so.)</p>
<p><b>Variables</b>. The dependent variable in this analysis is whether a  		caregiver has ended caregiving. It is defined in two ways.</p>
<p><b><i>Ending caregiving in the short-term</i></b>: This variable makes  		use of information from the ICS concerning "helpers no longer giving care to  		sample persons." The ICS was conducted between mid-October and mid-January of  		1982-83, following the NLTCS interview period from June to October, 1982. As a  		result, some of the people named as caregivers in the NLTCS were no longer  		acting as such when the ICS was administered. These individuals were  		interviewed using a Questionnaire for Helpers No Longer Giving Care. This  		questionnaire mirrored the one administered to persons still actively providing  		help with the exception that respondents were asked to answer questions with  		reference to "the time just before you stopped taking care of (person's  		name)".</p>
<p>People who ended caregiving in the short-term are those who said they  		stopped taking care of the sample person because they were no longer able,  		because the person gets other care or no longer needs help, or because the  		person was institutionalized. In 46% of the cases caregiving ended because the  		recipient was institutionalized. The next most common reason was that the  		elderly recipient was "getting other care" (23%). Fifteen percent of former  		caregivers reported they were no longer able to care for the recipient.</p>
<p>The question concerning reasons the caregiver stopped taking care of the  		respondent was open-ended, so respondents could give more than one response.  		Since caregivers were not read the list of reasons however, it is difficult to  		know the full range of reasons that might apply. For example, many caregivers  		who said they stopped providing care because the recipient was  		institutionalized might also have said they were no longer able to care for the  		recipient had they been asked. For this reason, everyone who ended caregiving  		for any reason, other than death of the recipient, is included. Of the 1,327  		primary caregivers, 1240 are current caregivers and 87 are former  		caregivers.</p>
<p><b><i>Ending caregiving in the long-term</i></b>: The NLTCS is a  		longitudinal survey in which individuals selected for interview in 1982 were  		reinterviewed in 1984. It is possible to determine institutionalization or  		death of sample persons over this two year period. Caregiving is regarded as  		ongoing if the recipient was still in the community in 1984, regardless of  		intermittent nursing home admissions. Caregiving is viewed as having ended for  		persons who were institutionalized in 1984 or who were institutionalized prior  		to death between 1982 and 1984. Under this definition, among the 1,327 primary  		caregivers, there are 1157 current caregivers and 170 former caregivers.</p>
<p><b><i>Factors related to ending caregiving</i></b>: Independent  		variables are grouped by whether they reflect recipient characteristics,  		caregiver characteristics, caregiver role responsibilities, or appraisal of the  		caregiver role.</p>
<p>Recipient characteristics include age, presence of cognitive impairment,  		availability of a secondary caregiver and living alone versus with others. The  		Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (Pfeiffer, 1975) was used to  		determine cognitive functioning. Anyone with 3 or more errors was regarded as  		cognitively impaired (an additional error for fewer than 8 years of education  		was allowed). For persons who did not complete the SPMSQ, indications of  		"senility" by proxies were used (see Kasper, 1990 for definitions of cognitive  		impairment in the NLTCS sample).</p>
<p>Caregiver characteristics include age, perceived health status  		(excellent, good, fair, poor), employment status (working or not), income  		(under $10,000 versus at or above), presence of children under 18 years of age,  		and whether the caregiver was a spouse.</p>
<p>Aspects of the caregiver role include numbers of ADL activities with  		which the caregiver assists (bathing, dressing, eating, getting around inside,  		getting in and out of bed, and toileting); hours of assistance categorized as  		under 2 hours or 2 hours and above (in response to "because of recipient's  		disability how many <b>extra</b> hours do you spend helping on an average  		day?"); and whether the caregiver reported being unable to leave the recipient  		alone.</p>
<p>The variables included under appraisal of the caregiver role reflect the  		caregiver's assessment of the burden and impact of the caregiver role (Lawton  		et al., 1989). Caregivers were asked whether "taking care of him/her has caused  		my health to get worse," whether caregiving "is hard on me emotionally,"  		whether the caregiver "ever feels he/she is doing things for the recipient that  		the recipient can do for him/herself," and whether caregiving "limits my social  		life or free time."</p>
<p>In addition two other indicators of caregiver appraisal were constructed  		from questionnaire items. One reflects whether the caregiver viewed the  		relationship with the person receiving care as in any way reciprocal. The other  		indicates satisfaction with the caregiving relationship relative to stress.</p>
<p>A view of the relationship with the recipient as reciprocal is indicated  		if the caregiver said the recipient "was helpful" in any one of a series of  		five items including "household chores" and "keeps me company." It has been  		suggested that relationships which are characterized by excessive giving or  		receiving may be detrimental to participants (Depaulo and Fisher, 1980).  		Caregivers who feel there is reciprocity also may feel less burdened by  		caregiving reponsibilities.</p>
<p>Lawton et al. (1989) suggests that satisfaction with caregiving is a  		separate dimension in appraisal of the role. A variable reflecting the ratio of  		satisfaction to stress was constructed from two indicators: "How many points  		would you give to show how much stress it causes you to do all of the things  		you do to help?" and "How many points would you give to show how good it makes  		you feel to help--the better it makes you feel, the bigger the number you would  		give." For caregivers whose ratio of satisfaction points to stress points was  		greater than one--about three-quarters of all primary caregivers--satisfaction  		related to caregiving was viewed as greater than stress (see Appendix  		<a href="factores.htm#tableA">Table A</a>).</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Only a small percentage of people who have taken on the responsibility  		of caring for elderly people with ADL limitations give up this role--6.8%  		within an 8 month period (short-term) and 12.8% over two years (long-term)(<a href="factores.htm#table12">Table 1</a>). Almost half of primary caregivers are married to  		the person being cared for (48.4%), and spouse caregivers are a smaller  		percentage of those who end caregiving (32.8% of those who stop in the  		short-term, and 39.5% of those who stop in the long-term.) Most other  		caregivers are overrepresented among those ending caregiving, for example 28.7%  		of all caregivers are daughters but they represent 35.7% (short-term) to 38.8%  		(long-term) of those who end caregiving.</p>
<p><a href="factores.htm#table13">Table 2</a> presents coefficients for univariate  		relationships between ending caregiving and characteristics of recipients,  		caregivers, caregiver role responsibilities and appraisal of that role. Among  		the variables measuring characteristics of recipients and caregivers, only  		presence of cognitive impairment and a nonspouse caregiver are significantly  		related to ending caregiving over both the short and long-term. In contrast to  		some studies of predictors of institutionalization, living alone was not  		significantly related to ending caregiving. In this sample of ADL-impaired  		elderly people, only 12% live alone, in contrast to 23% of the disabled elderly  		in the community (ADL or IADL-impaired) and 130%. of elderly people in general  		(data from the NLTCS and Kasper, 1988) . Thus there may be insufficient numbers  		of people living alone to assess its impact relative to ending caregiving.</p>
<p>Several caregiver tasks including helping with 3 to 6 ADLs, spending two  		or more hours a day providing assistance, and being unable to leave the  		recipient of care alone are all significantly related to ending caregiving. In  		addition, most of the measures of caregiver role appraisal are related. For  		characteristics significantly related to ending caregiving, odds ratios are  		provided indicating the increased likelihood that caregiving will end given the  		presence of the characteristic of interest.</p>
<p>Lawton et al. (1989) examined a large array of items reflecting the  		feelings and perceptions of caregivers in an effort to identify the major  		dimensions on which caregivers assess their role. The three that were  		identified were subjective burden, caregiving impact (measured in objective  		behavioral terms) and caregiving satisfaction. Fewer items reflecting caregiver  		appraisal are available from the ICS. However, <a href="factores.htm#table14">Table 3</a>  		indicates that feeling caregiving is emotionally hard is highly correlated with  		feeling caregiving has worsened health (.38) and limited social life/free time  		(.40). These items are similar to ones that grouped along Lawton's burden  		dimension of appraisal. Viewing the relationship as reciprocal and feeling the  		recipient could do more for him/herself, more closely reflect what Lawton  		characterizes as the impact of caregiving. The reciprocity variable is based on  		reports of ways in which the recipient of care helps out, and the second is  		similar to Lawton's item, "the recipient asks for more help than he/she needs."  		Correlations of these items with the subjective burden items are less than .20.  		Based on these relationships, appraisal of caregiving is represented in the  		multivariable analyses by the following: feeling that caregiving is emotionally  		hard (subjective burden), viewing the relationship as reciprocal and feeling  		the recipient could do more for him/herself (impact of caregiving), and whether  		satisfaction with caregiving is greater than stress (caregiving  		satisfaction).</p>
<p>Variables significantly related to ending caregiving are entered in  		separate multivariable analyses for ending caregiving in the short and  		long-term. For ending caregiving in the short-term, the final model shows  		significant factors to be whether one is caregiver is a spouse (negatively  		related), assisting with more ADL tasks, being unable to leave the recipient of  		care alone, and feeling the stress of caregiving outweighs the satisfaction  		(Model 3 in <a href="factores.htm#table15">Table 4</a>). Though a significant univariate  		relationship exists between cognitive impairment and ending caregiving in the  		short-term (<a href="factores.htm#table14">Table 3</a>), presence of cognitive impairment  		is no longer significant once caregiver role variables are introduced. One of  		the role variables, being unable to leave the recipient, is correlated with  		presence of cognitive impairment. However the correlation is not high  		(.17).</p>
<p><a href="factores.htm#table16">Table 5</a> examines factors significantly related to  		ending caregiving over a longer period of time and uses a definition of ending  		caregiving that is the equivalent of institutionalization of the recipient.  		Model 3 indicates factors related to ending caregiving in the long-term are  		presence of cognitive impairment in the recipient, whether one's caregiver is a  		spouse (negatively related), assisting with more ADL tasks, and viewing  		caregiving as emotionally hard. Since age of caregiver and spouse/nonspouse  		relationship to recipient were correlated, only the relationship variable was  		used. In both the short and long-term, a nonspouse caregiver and assisting with  		3 or more ADLs are related to ending caregiving.</p>
<p>Appraisal of the role is important as well though a different dimension  		is significant in each analysis--satisfaction greater than stress in the  		short-term and viewing caregiving as emotionally hard in the long-term. The  		reciprocity variable is not related. As it turned out, 90% of caregivers  		reported the recipient helped in some way so this particular measure of  		reciprocity may not discriminate reciprocal from nonreciprocal relationships  		very effectively. The other measure of caregiver impact, whether the caregiver  		felt the recipient could do more for him/herself, dropped out of the  		multivariable analyses as well.</p>
<p>Age was related to ending caregiving in the long-term in the univariate  		analysis. Adding age of the recipient to the model increases the explanatory  		power of the model (Model 3 + Age, <a href="factores.htm#table16">Table 5</a>). This is not  		surprising since increasing age is consistently shown to relate to greater  		likelihood of institutionalization (Branch and Jette, 1982; Shapiro and Tate,  		1985). Age reduces to nonsignificance the relationship of ending caregiving to  		two other variables, whether the caregiver is a spouse and the number of ADL  		tasks with which the caregiver assists (the relationship for ADL tasks borders  		on significance at p=.06). As might be expected, the correlation between having  		a spouse caregiver and increasing age is negative (-.30 for recipients of care  		age 85 or above, and -.08 for those age 75 to 84). Both cognitive impairment  		and an appraisal of the caregiver role as emotionally hard remain related to  		ending caregiving in this model. Though the introduction of age improves the  		model, in all likelihood it masks differences among the ADL-impaired elderly in  		health status and social support that are related to institutionalization.</p>
<p><a href="factores.htm#table14">Table 3</a>, <a href="factores.htm#table15">Table 4</a>, and  		<a href="factores.htm#table16">Table 5</a> indicate the increased likelihood that  		caregiving will end given the presence of certain factors reflecting  		characteristics of the recipient of care, the caregiver, the role of the  		caregiver and his/her appraisal of that role. Several of these factors  		substantially increase the likelihood that caregiving will end. Nonetheless for  		events as rare as ending caregiving, the probability of occurence may still be  		quite small. Consequently it is important to evaluate whether these factors  		affect in a meaningful way the magnitude of the probability caregiving will  		end.</p>
<p><a href="factores.htm#table17">Table 6</a> indicates the probability that caregiving  		will end in the presence of characteristics shown to be important in the  		previous analyses.<sup><font><a href="factores.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup>  		Several individual factors have an effect. Probability that caregiving will end  		in the long-term is .14 for cognitively impaired individuals and only .08 for  		those with no impairment. In the short-term, the probability that caregiving  		will end is .09 when caregivers do not view satisfaction as greater than stress  		and .04 when they do. Though most of the factors significantly related to  		ending caregiving increase the probability of its occurence, in the short-term  		no individual factor increases the probability above 10%. In the long-term,  		feeling caregiving is emotionally hard had the greatest effect, increasing the  		probability of ending caregiving to 16%.</p>
<p>It has been suggested by other researchers that examining the effects of  		combinations of characteristics may be a more useful approach to targeting  		those at risk of events such as institutionalization (Shapiro and Tate, 1988).  		Given the low probability that caregiving will end, even in the presence of  		specific characteristics that increase one's risk, this approach is applied  		here. Overall characteristics taken in combination have a substantial effect on  		the probability that the primary caregiver ends caregiving. If the caregiver is  		not the spouse, assists with 3 or more ADLs, is unable to leave the recipient  		alone and appraises caregiving negatively, there is a 30% chance that  		caregiving will end in the short-term. The chances of the primary caregiver  		ending caregiving in the long-term are greater than one in three for a  		combination of characteristics including cognitive impairment and appraising  		caregiving negatively. Using age in place of the variables concerning  		relationship to recipient and level of ADL assistance yields only a small  		increase in the probability that caregiving ends (.38 versus .36). In the  		absence of these combinations of circumstances, for example a spouse caregiver  		performing fewer ADL tasks with a positive appraisal of the caregiving role,  		the probability of ending caregiving is quite small--.02 in the short-term, .04  		in the long-term (not shown in <a href="factores.htm#table17">Table 6</a>).</p>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>Most elderly disabled people living in the community rely on family and  		friends for assistance with routine daily tasks that have become difficult to  		perform independently. The key role of informal caregivers in providing this  		care makes it important to understand the factors that contribute to their  		ability to continue to do so or result in a decision to end caregiving.</p>
<p>Variables on characteristics of recipients of informal care and those  		acting as caregivers, as well as on caregiving activities and appraisal of the  		caregiving role, were used in this study to examine ending caregiving in two  		contexts. These are people who were no longer acting as caregivers within a  		relatively short period of time (within 8 months) following their  		identification as a caregiver, and people who were no longer acting as  		caregivers over a longer period of time because the recipient of care had been  		institutionalized (within 2 years). Only elderly people with ADL limitations  		and their primary caregivers--those who take main responsibility or are the  		sole caregiver--are included.</p>
<p>At the outset it is important to note that despite the difficulties  		usually associated with providing assistance with routine activities of daily  		living, only a small percentage of primary caregivers end caregiving in either  		the short or long-term. Studies of caregiving strain or burden and studies of  		predictors of institutionalization suggest a wide range of variables might  		influence who does and does not relinquish the caregiver role. Characteristics  		of recipients and levels of disability are usually the focus of studies  		considering factors in institutionalization, while perceptions of stress and  		burden are seen as more important in understanding caregiver well-being. Both  		types of variables are included here. In the univariate results few of the  		recipient characteristics or caregiver characteristics were significantly  		related. Several aspects of the caregiver's role and indicators of appraisal of  		that role were important in ending caregiving.</p>
<p>The multivariable results for ending caregiving in the short and  		long-term are somewhat different, though an aspect of role appraisal, aspects  		of the caregiver's role and whether the caregiver is a spouse are important in  		both (Model 3, <a href="factores.htm#table15">Table 4</a> and <a href="factores.htm#table16">Table  		5</a>). Different appraisal variables were related in the short-term and  		long-term. Viewing caregiving as providing greater satisfaction than stress was  		negatively related to ending caregiving in the short-term and finding  		caregiving emotionally hard was positively related in the long-term. The  		interpretation of this difference is not clear. One possibility is that because  		ending caregiving in the short-term included changes in caregiving that were  		less drastic than institutionalization, different aspects of appraisal come  		into play. Another is that there may be a sequence to the appraisal process.  		People who ended caregiving over the short-term were much closer to the point  		of stopping than most of those who ended caregiving over the long-term. There  		is little empirical evidence concerning how the dimensions of caregiver  		appraisal change over time or are expressed in behavioral terms, such as the  		decision to end caregiving.</p>
<p>Cognitive impairment and age are the two recipient characteristics  		important in ending caregiving over the long-term i.e. institutionalization of  		the recipient. Cognitive impairment is not related to ending caregiving in the  		short-term once other variables are taken into account, though it is correlated  		with inability to leave the recipient which was related. Including age of the  		recipient in the multivariable model for ending caregiving over the long-term  		improved the fit. However, age is probably a proxy for additional differences  		in health status and social support that contribute to ending caregiving.</p>
<p>Ending caregiving is a rare event. Though the variables identified  		increase the likelihood that caregiving to an ADL-impaired elderly person will  		end, no single variable is a particularly good predictor of the probability of  		ending caregiving. Even the presence of significantly related factors such as  		cognitive impairment, do not increase the probability that the primary  		caregiver will end caregiving beyond 10 to 15 percent. However, the probability  		that caregiving will end is greatly increased when several factors related to  		ending caregiving occur in combination. By examining combinations of variables  		related to ending caregiving, it may be possible to develop profiles of  		caregivers who are at risk of ending caregiving and in need of intervention  		such as external support or assistance. In addition, it seems clear that what  		the caregiver does and his/her appraisal of the role are important components  		of this profile. Of the individual characteristics, the variables reflecting  		appraisal of the caregiver role discriminated most strongly between the  		probability of ending or continuing caregiving (<a href="factores.htm#table17">Table  		6</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, further research on the dynamics of changes in caregiving is  		needed to understand how various characteristics contribute to ending  		caregiving over time. If support to informal caregivers is an important policy  		consideration, it is necessary to know not only which combination of  		characteristics warrants assistance and intervention but when in the process to  		intervene. When the probability of ending caregiving becomes too great, no  		amount of intervention or assistance may be able to alter the outcome.</p>
