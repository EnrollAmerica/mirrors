<p>A recent focus of proposals to expand publicly financed nursing home  		benefits has been coverage for the initial months of care. This paper presents  		information from the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey to describe the  		phenomenon of multiple nursing home admissions and to examine the effects of  		multiple admissions on the number of individuals who would be fully covered by  		"front-end" policies. For example, in contrast to an expected 51 percent of  		admissions that would be fully covered by a 3-month benefit, we estimated that  		only 39 percent of cases would be fully covered after adjusting for multiple  		admissions.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>A recent focus of many proposals for expanding public financing for  		nursing home care has been the coverage of the initial days, or the  		"front-end," of nursing home stays. The idea of front-end coverage was first  		introduced by Robert Ball, the former Commissioner of the Social Security  		Administration. His proposal was to cover the first six months of nursing home  		stays for all Medicare beneficiaries and to provide coverage of 12 months for  		individuals who were married. Most recently, The Pepper Commission proposed to  		provide total public financing for the first three months of a nursing home  		stay. The rationale for the coverage of the initial days of nursing home stays  		is that individuals with relatively short stays are the patients who are most  		likely to return alive to the community. Public coverage of their relatively  		brief stays in nursing homes would serve to protect their financial resources  		so that they would not face financial hardships after discharge from the  		nursing home. Provisions for additional coverage for married persons are  		designed to reduce the risk of spousal impoverishment.</p>
<p>The impetus for revising public programs to cover particular portions of  		of nursing home stays stems largely from the concern over fiscal constraints on  		expansion of public long-term care financing. The targeting of proposals to the  		front-end of nursing home stays reflects the recognition, based on research,  		that the distribution of nursing home stays is highly skewed with many  		individuals being discharged after a very short time (e.g., three months) while  		others remain residents for many years (Keeler et al., 1983, Liu and Manton,  		1983). Moreover, a higher proportion of individuals with relatively short stays  		returned to private residences, as opposed to those patients with longer stays  		who were most likely to remain in nursing homes until death.</p>
<p>Estimates of the number of nursing home residents and the duration of  		their nursing home use have largely been based on data sources such as the  		National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS). Until 1985, the NNHS length of stay  		information consisted only of one isolated stay per nursing home resident.  		Consequently, if an individual had more than one nursing home stay, those stays  		could not be linked to analyze patterns of multiple admissions. However, the  		1985 NNHS collected information on nursing home "histories", thereby providing  		an opportunity to refine estimates of the length of stay distribution of  		nursing home residents. A recent paper by Spence and Wiener (1990) showed, for  		example, that combining multiple stays into episodes of care had a substantial  		impact on the average length of stay of nursing home patients.</p>
<p>This paper uses data from the 1985 NNHS to develop further<i>  		</i>insight into the effects of multiple admissions on the distribution of  		nursing home patients by length of stay. Our first aim is to present  		information on patterns of multiple admissions in nursing homes. Our second aim  		is to demonstrate the importance of accounting for multiple admissions when  		estimating the number of people who would be affected by front-end policies  		such as those proposed by former Commissioner Ball and the Pepper Commission.  		In the following, we first describe the data and methodology used in this  		analysis. The next three sections describe the histories of multiple admissions  		and intervals between stays, the effects of multiple admissions on length of  		stay distributions, and the relationship between histories of prior admissions  		and discharge outcomes. In the final section, we present estimates of the size  		of the aged nursing home population stratified by several different  		specifications of nursing home stay, including the expected length of stay  		after multiple stay segments are combined. We employ this information to  		discuss the importance of incorporating multiple stay information in the  		assessment of front-end nursing home financing options.</p>
<h2><a name="data" id="data">II. DATA AND METHODS</a></h2>
<h3>The 1985 National Nursing Home Survey</h3>
<p>The 1985 National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS) was conducted by the  		National Center for Health Statistics to provide nationally representative  		information on facilities, staff, and residents. Information in the NNHS was  		collected after cases were selected through a stratified two-stage probability  		sample design. The first stage was the selection of facilities, and the second  		stage was the selection of nurses, current residents, and discharged residents  		from the sample facilities. The results presented in this paper are based on  		data from the discharge resident component of the NN HS. A sampling list of all  		persons discharged alive or dead during the 12 months preceding the survey data  		was compiled. Persons who were discharged more than once during this 12-month  		period in the same nursing home were listed for each discharge. A sample of six  		or fewer discharges per facility was selected and data were collected for each  		sample discharge by interviews with a member of the nursing staff who referred  		to medical records during the interview. The survey response rate of 95 percent  		corresponds to a final sample of 6,023 persons (Hing et al., 1989). For each  		person in the sample, data are available on the sample stay which selected the  		individual for the survey. This information includes the dates of admission and  		discharge, as well as demographic characteristics and diagnoses. Although  		detailed information pertains only to the sample stay, several general  		questions were also asked regarding other nursing home stays, both in the  		sample facility as well as in other facilities.</p>
<p>For this analysis, we selected the sample of individuals who were over  		65 years of age in 1985. The sample consisted of 5,228 unweighted cases, which  		represented 1,062,895 persons after sample weights were applied.</p>
<p>Central to this analysis is the "history" of nursing home stays  		experienced by the discharge sample. Our examination of the information on  		prior stays indicated that data on other stays in the sample facility were  		generally reliable. For example, with the exception of a few cases, dates of  		successive stays were chronologically consistent. In contrast, data on the  		number and duration of stays in other facilities were inconsistent and missing  		for most cases. For example, of the 986 residents who indicated that they had a  		prior stay in a different nursing facility, only 386 had usable information on  		the dates of such stays. Hence, it was not possible to link intervals of prior  		stays in other facilities with those in the sample facility. Because of the  		unreliability of this information, we focused our analysis of nursing home  		histories on multiple stays in the sample facilities. In addition, histories of  		other stays refer generally to stays that occurred prior to the sample stay,  		although in some cases length of stay information was available on stays after  		the sample stay. Because the discharged resident survey was not designed to  		track future nursing home use of individuals who were discharged alive from the  		sample stay, this information was not directly available on all cases. As a  		result, only the stays that occurred prior to the sample stay were used in this  		analysis. Finally, it is important to note that patient characteristics (e.g.,  		diagnosis) available on the survey refer only to the sample stay.</p>
<h2><a name="history" id="history">III. HISTORIES OF MULTIPLE NURSING HOME  		ADMISSIONS</a></h2>
<p>This section examines the histories of prior nursing home use among the  		individuals in the 1985 NNHS discharge sample. The information in this section  		refers to nursing home use in the sample facility prior to the sample stay and  		does not reflect future stays beyond the survey's sample stay.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Persons by Multiple Admissions</h3>
<p><a href="muladmes.htm#table1">Table 1</a> presents the distribution of admissions by  		the length of the sample stay. About 78 percent of the discharges had only one  		admission to the sample facility.<sup><font><a href="muladmes.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup> The remaining 22 percent had multiple  		admissions, with half of them experiencing only two admissions. By length of  		sample stay, a smaller proportion of long-stay patients had multiple admissions  		than either those with short or medium stays. The highest incidence of multiple  		admissions was found for persons whose sample stays were three months to one  		year (medium LOS).</p>
<p>Information in <a href="muladmes.htm#table1">Table 1</a> also shows that the average  		number of stays per person in the discharge sample was 1.4. Although not shown,  		the mean number of stays for those who had multiple stays was 3.0. Because most  		of the individuals in the discharge sample were not discharged dead, they had  		opportunities for readmissions in the future. Hence, the incidence of multiple  		admissions in <a href="muladmes.htm#table1">Table 1</a> underestimates the eventual  		incidence of multiple admissions for the sample. This bias, due to the  		limitations of the data, results in underestimates of both lifetime nursing  		home use and multiple admissions occurring within the episode of illness  		captured by the sample stay.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the incidence of multiple admissions that we could estimate  		from the discharge sample indicates that the occurrence of this phenomenon is  		substantial. In a later section of this paper, we estimate the extent to which  		future admissions associated with the sample stay affect the nursing home  		length-of-stay distribution.</p>
<h3>Intervals between Stays</h3>
<p>An important question regarding the incidence of multiple admissions is  		whether or not they represent segments of a single episode of nursing home care  		that is broken by short intervals, for example, for acute care in hospitals.  		Alternatively, multiple admissions might reflect totally distinct episodes of  		care, possibly for different conditions. In order to estimate the extent to  		which these two phenomena occur, we examined the intervals between multiple  		stays. We would expect that short intervals indicate an extension of the  		episode captured by the sample stay and that longer intervals are  		characteristic of discontinuous episodes of care. Because most of the cases  		with multiple stays had only two, we focused on the intervals of time between  		the sample stay and the stay immediately preceding the sample stay. These  		results are presented in <a href="muladmes.htm#table2">Table 2</a>.</p>
<p>For all of the cases with multiple admissions, 59 percent had  		intervening intervals of less than 14 days and 17 percent had intervals ranging  		from 15 to 29 days. Thus, it appears likely that for these cases (comprising 75  		percent of those who had multiple admissions), the multiple admissions were  		simply segments of the same episode of care within which the nursing home  		patient required intervening acute care. In contrast, 13 percent had multiple  		stays that were broken by more than 180 days (6 months). These cases were  		likely to reflect the use of nursing home care for specific episodes by  		individuals whose health status did not otherwise require continuing  		institutionalization.</p>
<p><a href="muladmes.htm#table2">Table 2</a> also presents the distribution of  		intervals by the duration of the first stay of the pair. The pattern indicates  		that short-stay patients tend to stay out of nursing homes for a longer time  		before returning than longer stay patients. For example, 17 percent of the  		short-stay patients had intervals of 180 or more days, whereas only 9 percent  		of the long-stay patients had a long break before readmission. This pattern is  		consistent with prior observation that the more time a person spends in a  		nursing home, the less likely he is to return to community residence. Although  		short-stay patients have a greater likelihood of returning to the community  		after a nursing home stay, the table shows that, like their longer stay  		counterparts, most short-stay patients have multiple admissions within short  		periods of time. In fact, the patterns of multiple admissions by types of stays  		indicates that 20 percent of the multiple admission cases were those with  		exclusively short stays.</p>
<p>The information in <a href="muladmes.htm#table2">Table 2</a> does not provide  		support for the notion that many elderly persons go to nursing homes, return to  		the community and are then readmitted many months later for a different episode  		of health care. Although not presented in the table, we also examined the  		occurrence of long intervals between nursing home stays across all pairs of  		stays for the persons with multiple admissions. In that analysis, we found that  		17 percent of the cases had a long break at some point in their nursing home  		use history, a result that does not differ notably from that in  		<a href="muladmes.htm#table2">Table 2</a>.</p>
<p>Because the discharge survey of the NNHS did not continue to follow the  		future nursing home use of individuals who were discharged alive, we could not  		measure the proportion of individuals who had only one nursing home stay over  		their lifetime. Hence, the question of how many persons have only temporary, in  		contrast to permanent, stays over their lifetime remains a question for future  		studies.</p>
<h3>Multiple Stays by Patient Characteristics</h3>
<p><a href="muladmes.htm#table3">Table 3</a> presents the effects of specific personal  		characteristics on the likelihood of histories of readmission. The first column  		reveals the percentage of cases with multiple admissions for different  		subgroups by age, sex, marital status, and selected primary diagnoses. The next  		three columns provide information on the way in which multiple admissions  		affect the different measures of length of stay. Column 2 presents the median  		LOS for the sample stay while column 3 presents the median LOS after multiple  		stays separated by no more than 30 days have been combined. The differences  		between these measures are presented in column 4.</p>
<p>From <a href="muladmes.htm#table1">Table 1</a> we know that 22 percent of cases had  		multiple stays in the same facility, but the likelihood of a history of  		readmission varies by age, sex, and marital status, and primary diagnosis. The  		differences by demographic characteristics are not large. Greater differences  		are seen among the subgroups by primary diagnosis at admission. For example,  		only 13 percent of individuals with dementia had histories of multiple  		admissions, whereas 29 percent of persons with lung disease had histories of  		multiple admissions. These results reflect the tendency of dementia patients to  		be admitted for long stays with relatively few acute-care needs requiring  		hospitalization. In contrast, persons with lung disease tend to be more  		susceptible to acute illness and therefore more likely to require  		hospitalization. Finally, because episodes of illness in a nursing home are  		often interrupted by hospital stays, it is not surprising that individuals  		admitted from hospitals had considerably higher risks (30%) of histories of  		readmission than those admitted from other locations.</p>
<p><a href="muladmes.htm#table3">Table 3</a> also shows major differences in the effect  		of multiple admissions on the cumulative length of nursing home stays. By  		age--although the median sample stay of the 65-74 age group (74 days) is about  		22 days shorter than that of the 85+ age group (96 days)--the difference  		increases to 51 days after adjusting for multiple stays. This difference  		reflects in part the higher incidence of multiple admissions among the 85+  		group. Similarly, while females and non-married persons tend to have longer  		lengths of stay than their counterparts when sample stays were compared,  		adjustment for multiple admissions further increases the differences.</p>
<p>For specific diagnoses, the effects of multiple admissions on length of  		stay are dramatic. The largest effect is seen for persons with lung diseases.  		Whereas the sample LOS is 66 days, combining stays broken by less than 30 days  		increases the LOS to 114 days, a 73 percent increase. In contrast, patients  		with hip fracture show only an 18 percent increase in median cumulative stays  		when multiple segments are combined. This reflects in large part the short  		additional stays of these patients (column 1). Persons with neoplasm have  		relatively low risks of multiple admissions as well as short durations of stay  		even after multiples are combined. Half of these cancer patients would have  		stays of less than 36 days regardless of whether nursing home use were measured  		by single stays or multiple stays.</p>
<p>By source of admissions, histories of multiple stays increased the  		median stays by 60 percent for persons admitted from hospitals. Nevertheless,  		these patients tend to have shorter stays overall as compared to those admitted  		from the community.</p>
<p>The results in <a href="muladmes.htm#table3">Table 3</a> show that the nursing home  		population is heterogeneous in terms of its histories of multiple admissions.  		For the most part, however, the patterns of length of stay by patient  		characteristics tend to reflect those observed for single stays. For example,  		cancer patients have relatively short durations of nursing home use whether we  		are comparing simple stays or cumulative durations in an episode.</p>
<h2><a name="discharge" id="discharge">IV. DISCHARGE OUTCOMES</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we examine the relationship between multiple admissions  		and outcomes, with the expectation that knowing about the presence of multiple  		admissions can refine our estimates of expected discharge outcomes beyond those  		observed for subgroups of the population by single stays alone (Liu and Manton,  		1984). <a href="muladmes.htm#table4">Table 4</a> presents the the percentage distribution  		of discharge outcomes by type of sample stay and whether or not multiple  		admissions were experienced.</p>
<p>Of the short-stay group with no prior stays, 33 percent were nursing  		home deaths and 35 percent were discharged alive to a private  		residence.<sup><font><a href="muladmes.htm#note2">2</a></font></sup> This pattern  		illustrates the fact that nursing homes are often used for short-term terminal  		care and for post-acute rehabilitation. A relatively small proportion, 19.6  		percent, of this group was discharged to a hospital. The next row presents the  		pattern for short-stay patients who had a prior stay that was less than 30  		days, and shows that individuals with multiple short stays in nursing homes  		have similar outcome patterns to those with only a single short stay. The  		pattern is considerably different, however, when a short stay follows a  		relatively longer stay in a nursing home (i.e., more than 30 days). In this  		case, more than 80 percent of the sample stays resulted either in death or in a  		discharge to the hospital.</p>
<p>The medium-stay group has a lower proportion returning to community  		residence than the short-stay group. The most notable effect of multiple  		admissions on this group is that persons with multiple admissions have a 50  		percent higher likelihood of being discharged to a hospital.</p>
<p>For the long-stay patients with single stays, the most common outcome  		was death (57.1 percent). Another 27.2 percent were discharged to hospitals,  		and only 6.2 percent were discharged to private residences. Our finding here  		indicates that individuals with minimum stays of one year have a negligible  		chance of returning to a private residence. Long-stay patients with multiple  		admissions have a lower chance of being discharged dead than those with only a  		single stay. Instead, they are discharged to hospitals.</p>
<p><a href="muladmes.htm#table4">Table 4</a> highlights several key relationships.  		First, as length of stay increases, regardless of whether it is a long single  		stay or an accumulation of multiple stays, the likelihood of returning to  		private residence decreases. About 5 percent of persons with stays longer than  		one year return to the community. Second, the occurrence of multiple stays,  		regardless of their length, increases the likelihood of discharge to hospitals.  		Finally, the results in <a href="muladmes.htm#table4">Table 4</a> reflect the three general  		types of nursing home patients: short-term terminal care patients, short-term  		rehabilitation patients, and long-term care patients. The long-term care  		patients appear to be divided between those who require extensive acute care  		(e.g., those with multiple admissions and discharge to hospital) and those who  		are simply long-stay patients who die in nursing homes.</p>
<h2><a name="multiple" id="multiple">V. MULTIPLE ADMISSIONS AND PAYMENT SOURCES</a></h2>
<p>Unlike acute-care services, most nursing home care is not financed by  		either Medicare or private long-term care insurance. Individuals who enter  		nursing homes are required to pay first dollar for care until their personal  		resources are depleted, at which point they have "spent down" and become  		eligible for Medicaid payment. Individuals who are indigent before entering  		nursing homes are Medicaid eligible at the time of admission. Because of the  		process of paying for nursing home care, the more time an individual spends in  		a nursing home, the more likely he is to become a Medicaid patient. For this  		reason, histories of multiple admissions are likely to affect the pattern of  		payment sources.</p>
<p><a href="muladmes.htm#table5">Table 5</a> presents the distribution of cases by type  		of sample stay and duration of prior stays. Among the short-stay patients with  		no prior stays in the same facility, 23 percent were Medicare and 52 percent  		were private pay throughout their stays. Only 24 percent were Medicaid at  		admission and less than 1 percent spent down to Medicaid. In contrast, for  		persons with a prior stay, the proportion private pay decreases and the  		proportion Medicaid increases.</p>
<p>Because Medicare coverage is limited to 100 days, it plays a much  		smaller role for medium- and long-stay patients. Private payment was still half  		of all medium-stay patients, and Medicaid admissions comprised 43 percent of  		the cases. In comparison to the short-stay patients, the Medicaid spend-down  		cases become a more prominent type of patient. For medium-stay patients with  		prior admissions, the proportion private was only 31-39 percent while Medicaid  		admissions were 39-63 percent of the patients. For the long-stay admissions,  		histories of multiple admissions were also associated with a higher proportion  		of patients who were Medicaid eligible at admission to the sample stay.</p>
<p><a href="muladmes.htm#table5">Table 5</a> supports the hypothesis that having had  		prior nursing home stays increases the likelihood that a person would be  		eligible for Medicaid at admission. However, the NN HS data on primary payment  		sources at admission and discharge are available only for the sample stay. As a  		result, it is not surprising that spend-down cases are observed in  		disproportionately high numbers for single stay residents, regardless of past  		nursing home use. <a href="muladmes.htm#table5">Table 5</a> also shows that the proportion  		of Medicaid admissions increases in the subsets of the population who had prior  		nursing home stays. For example, approximately 70 percent of the long stay  		patients who had prior nursing home stays were Medicaid eligible upon admission  		to the sample stay as opposed to only 48 percent of the long stay patients who  		had no prior nursing home history.Thus, it is reasonable to assume that not all  		of these patients were eligible for Medicaid at the time of their first nursing  		home admission and that a substantial proportion of those Medicaid admissions  		must have spent-down to Medicaid at some point during their past nursing home  		use. Unfortunately, the data do not allow us to ascertain the exact point at  		which the resident became eligible for Medicaid; other data sources are  		required to fully explicate the relationship between spend-down and length of  		stay.</p>
<h2><a name="imply" id="imply">VI. IMPLICATIONS OF MULTIPLE STAYS FOR FRONT-END  		POLICIES</a></h2>
<p>The preceding sections presented direct information from the NNHS on the  		incidence and effects of multiple nursing home admissions. As we noted above,  		limitations of the NNHS do not allow us to fully capture the incidence of  		multiple admissions, either from the perspective of lifetime nursing home use  		or for the episode of illness surrounding the sample stay. There are two types  		of limitations. First, information on past nursing home use outside of the  		sample facilities was inconsistent and often missing. Second, information on  		future use of nursing homes after the sample stay was not generally available.  		Both of these restrictions result in underestimates of the incidence of  		multiple admissions. Because of multiple stays, it is certain that the  		length-of-stay distribution based on sample stays underestimates the episode  		distribution that is obtained after incorporating multiple stay  		information.</p>
<p>To estimate the impact of various front-end policies, we used the data  		from NNHS to simulate the episode distribution of the sample of discharges. The  		results of the simulation will permit us to compare the number of individuals  		that would be fully covered based on episodes of care adjusted for multiple  		stays in contrast to those covered based on observed sample stays only. The  		former will be a more accurate estimate of policy impact.</p>
<p>The weighted NNHS discharge survey sample approximates a nationally  		representative sample of admissions to nursing homes in a given year. Although  		there will be other patients using nursing homes during the year, they would be  		highly representative of very-long-stay patients for whom the "front-end"  		policies will not apply.</p>
<p>The general strategy in this simulation is to estimate the likelihood  		that an individual who was discharged alive would be readmitted in the same  		episode in the future and how the additional segment would shift his  		classification by length of stay. For simulating the likelihood of future  		admissions, we combined estimates on two groups of patients. The first group  		was composed of individuals who were discharged from the sample facility  		directly to another nursing home. Thus, we know with certainty that all persons  		in this group experienced another nursing home admission after the sample stay  		discharge. The second group consisted of all other live discharges from the  		sample stay facility. Although we can not ascertain the exact number from this  		group who will be readmitted, it seems reasonable to assume that a certain  		percentage of these live discharges will experience another stay in the sample  		facility. In order to obtain that proportion, we calculated the ratio of  		individuals in the sample stay who had prior stays to individuals in the sample  		stay who were discharged alive but not to another nursing home.<sup><font><a href="muladmes.htm#note3">3</a></font></sup> This ratio was then applied to  		the number of live discharges (that did not go directly to another nursing  		facility) to estimate the number of persons with expected readmission to the  		sample facility. The two groups of patients with readmissions (to the same or  		different nursing home) were then compared to all live discharges. In this way,  		we estimated that 41 percent of those discharged alive would be readmitted  		within 30 days and that 50 percent would be readmitted if the timing of the  		readmission were not constrained.</p>
<p>To estimate the distribution of the adjusted stays, we used information  		on the cases with histories of at least two admissions including the sample  		stay. The prior stay was viewed as the initiating event to estimate the  		proportion who had a subsequent stay of a specified duration. Specifically,  		four length-of-stay categories were defined: (a) less than 90 days; (b) 90 days  		to 180 days; (c) 180 days to 365 days; and (d) greater than 365 days. For the  		prior stays with a specified duration (e.g., less than 90 days), we derived the  		length-of-stay distribution of subsequent stays according to the same four  		categories. The hypothetical future stay distribution was then used to adjust  		the prior stay distribution to derive estimates of the ultimate episode  		adjusted distribution.<sup><font><a href="muladmes.htm#note4">4</a></font></sup>  		Finally, this episode adjusted distribution was applied to the number of  		sample-stay cases that were discharged alive and therefore at risk of  		readmission. The final episode durations represent the expected stay if we  		could observe not only the sample stay and past nursing home history but also  		the future readmissions.</p>
<p><a href="muladmes.htm#table6">Table 6</a> presents the results of the simulation.  		The first column shows the distribution of stays for the observed sample stay.  		The second column presents the adjusted episode when only prior stays not  		separated by more than 30 days are added to the sample stay. The third column  		presents the expected duration if both prior stays and an additional future  		stay separated by less than 30 days from the sample stay are added to the  		sample stay. The fourth column presents the expected distribution if prior  		stays and an additional future stay unconditional on the interval are added to  		the sample stay.</p>
<p><a href="muladmes.htm#table6">Table 6</a> shows that 51 percent of the patients had  		stays of less than 90 days if only the sample stay were considered. The  		implication for front-end policies, such as that recommended by the Pepper  		Commission, is that approximately half of the persons who enter nursing homes  		in the year may be <b>fully</b> covered for their nursing home stay if public  		financing is expanded to cover the first three months of nursing home care.  		Similarly, under the Ball proposal, almost 63 percent of the admissions would  		be fully covered if Medicare provided benefits for the first six months of  		nursing home care.</p>
<p>Although a front-end policy would provide some specified period of  		coverage for all nursing home admissions in a year, <a href="muladmes.htm#table6">Table  		6</a> also shows that smaller proportions of cases would be fully covered if  		adjustments are made for multiple admissions. Adjusting only for prior stays,  		we see that 45 percent would be fully covered by a three-month front-end  		policy. If we adjusted for expected future stays as well, only 39 percent would  		be fully covered by the three-month policy. Hence, relative to the estimated 51  		percent of admissions that was based on sample stays alone, the adjustment for  		multiple admissions indicates that 25 percent fewer persons would be fully  		covered by the three-month front-end policy.</p>
<p><a href="muladmes.htm#table6">Table 6</a> shows relatively consistent proportions of  		persons with stays of between 90 and 180 days (11-12 percent) and stays of  		between 180 and 365 days (11-13 percent), regardless of adjustments for prior  		and future stays. Hence, the major differences in number of persons who would  		be covered under different options for front-end coverage are due to  		differences in the first three-month interval. To the extent that the rationale  		for specific front-end policies depends upon the number of persons fully  		covered, <a href="muladmes.htm#table6">Table 6</a> provides a basis for estimating the  		incremental effects of extending coverage beyond 90 days to 360 days. As we  		noted above, persons who remain in the nursing home for more than a year are  		unlikely to return to private residence in the community. These persons would  		not, in general, be the targeted beneficiaries of front-end policies. Moreover,  		the high proportion of such persons after adjustments are made for multiple  		admissions (i.e., 37 percent) indicates that the effects of longer term nursing  		home coverage policies need to be reevaluated in light of the prevalence of  		multiple admissions.</p>
<p>The implications of the multiple admissions for front-end coverage  		policies are important if the policies are specified in terms of total nursing  		home use during a "spell of illness." The Ball proposal to cover the first six  		months of nursing home stays, for example, would presumably be a spell of  		illness policy. Hence, the distribution of length of stay by sample stay  		indicates that 63 percent of episodes would be covered completely by the Ball  		proposal. In contrast, the episode adjusted distribution of stays would suggest  		that only 51 percent of stays would be covered.</p>
<p>If the front-end policies were to specify that coverage would be  		provided for a certain number of months per admission, the stay patterns would  		be the most useful in determining how many persons would be fully covered. Our  		purpose in illustrating the effects of multiple admissions was to estimate the  		number of persons who would be fully covered under different options. Perhaps  		more importantly, the simulation demonstrates that it is essential for future  		legislative proposals to specify whether eligibility for coverage under a  		front-end policy is based upon spells of illness or some other length of stay  		measure (e.g. each admission, calendar year).</p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">VII. DISCUSSION</a></h2>
<p>This paper presented an analysis of multiple nursing home admissions  		using data from the 1985 NNHS. The first sections of the paper discussed  		results that were derived directly from the data. These sections were presented  		to describe the incidence and effects of multiple admissions. The final section  		presented simulated results to highlight the importance of adjusting for  		multiple admissions in the consideration of front-end options. The direct  		information from the NNHS and the simulation results provide insights into the  		nature of multiple nursing home admissions. This is important for the  		consideration of further research as well as policy options.</p>
<p>The occurrence of multiple nursing home admissions is quite common.  		Although our analysis indicated that only 22 percent of the discharges had  		prior stays in the same nursing home, initial analysis of prior stays in the  		sample and other nursing homes indicated that approximately 33 percent of the  		discharges had experienced prior nursing home use. For individuals who were  		discharged alive from the sample stay, we estimated that quite a few would be  		at risk of a future nursing home stay. Combining prior use with expected future  		use, it is plausible that about half of the patients in the discharge sample  		would ultimately experience multiple nursing home admissions. This result would  		be consistent with findings from analyses of nursing home patients in  		Connecticut (Gruenberg et al., 1989; Liu and Manton, 1990) and California  		(Lewis et al., 1985). Collectively, these results suggest that every other  		nursing home patient can be expected to have at least two admissions over his  		lifetime.</p>
<p>Although we focused on durations of stay in nursing homes, data on the  		durations of intervals between nursing home stays are also important for policy  		formulation, particularly in light of the high incidence of multiple  		admissions. Along with specification of periods of coverage, further  		specification is required regarding the role of intervals between stays. For  		example, does a policy to cover the first six months of nursing home stays  		apply to the first six months of lifetime nursing home use even though an  		initial stay of three months may have occurred a year before any additional  		nursing home use is required? Similarly, how would intervals between stays be  		counted in terms of deductible or elimination periods if initial private  		payments are required before public or private insurance policies begin  		coverage? The importance of intervals between multiple stays appears to be most  		important when policies are specified in terms of "spells of illness."</p>
<p>A particular pattern of multiple admissions requires attention because  		of its frequent occurrence. These are the short-stay nursing home admissions  		with intervening hospital stays. For example, data from the NNHS indicated that  		one-third of persons who were admitted from hospital were likely to have had a  		prior nursing home admission. In contrast, only 12 percent of those admitted  		directly from the community experienced a prior nursing home stay. In addition  		to the association with prior hospital admission, short-stay patients were also  		linked with diagnoses such as hip fracture, lung disease, stroke, and cancer.  		All of these characteristics are frequently associated with eligibility for the  		Medicare SNF benefit. The incidence of multiple admissions is therefore  		important in the consideration of the adequacy of the Medicare SNF coverage for  		a maximum of 100 days per spell of illness. Further analysis is required to  		determine the extent to which beneficiaries exceed nursing home use of 100 days  		because of multiple admissions. It is interesting to note that this question  		would have been less relevant if benefits were specified on a calendar year  		basis, as they were under the 1988 Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act.</p>
<p>Although data limitations preclude a more thorough analysis of the  		relationship between length of stay measures and payment sources for nursing  		home care, we did find that long durations of nursing home use were associated  		with greater likelihood of having Medicaid as a payment source. Our analysis of  		multiple admissions indicated that if a person had a prior stay which exceeded  		30 days, the individual had a 58 percent chance of being a Medicaid patient at  		admission to the sample stay. This can be contrasted to short-stay patients  		with no prior stay history who had a 24 percent chance of being a Medicaid  		patient. Our payment source analysis also found that about one quarter of the  		patients would be private pay even if they had long sample stays and prior  		stays. Until other data become available to better describe the payment source  		and nursing home use relationships, these results provide a benchmark for  		estimating the distribution of nursing home discharges by payment source after  		accounting for multiple admissions.</p>
<p>The simulation of the number of people who would be affected by  		"front-end" coverage options was presented to highlight the importance of  		multiple admissions for a particularly attractive set of options. We found that  		individuals with relatively short stays have higher than average chances of  		returning alive to community. Because of the high per diem costs of nursing  		home care, the results suggest that even short stays can be an excessive  		financial burden for many persons who are only temporary nursing home  		residents. Finally, the results of the simulation highlight the importance not  		only of measuring length of stay to estimate effects of policies, but also of  		choosing the appropriate measure of length of stay with which to address  		policies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the common occurrence of multiple nursing home admissions  		implies that public policy proposals to expand coverage of nursing home care  		must specify how multiple stays would be addressed in the consideration of  		benefit periods as well as periods when coverage is not available. Although  		information on multiple admissions is most important to policies oriented  		toward short benefit periods, such as the front-end policies, the accumulation  		of stays over time also has important implications for long-stay policies.  		Needless to say, the occurrence of multiple admissions has similarly important  		implications for private long-term care insurance policies and how their  		provisions are specified.</p>

<ol><li>
<p><a name="note1" id="note1">Because</a> information on stays in facilities other  			 than the sample facility was incomplete and likely to be very selective, we  			 focused our discussion on utilization history in the sample facilities. Based  			 on the available information from the NNHS, we estimated that the incidence of  			 multiple admissions increases to about one-third of the sample of discharges  			 when the data on use in other facilities are included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note2" id="note2">We</a> included persons who were known to have died  			 in a hospital after discharge from the nursing home. This decision rule reduces  			 the percentage of patients who were classified as being discharged to the  			 hospital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note3" id="note3">The</a> calculation of this ratio is based on the  			 assumption that the number of sample stay cases with a prior stay is a  			 reasonable approximation of the number of individuals from any (in this case,  			 the prior stay) cohort who were eventually readmitted to the same nursing  			 home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note4" id="note4">There</a> are two important assumptions which made  			 it possible to simulate the effect of expected future stays on the length of  			 stay distribution. The first assumption is that the proportion of live  			 discharges discussed above is the same across each initial length of stay  			 category; that is, the same readmission rate is assumed for each live discharge  			 regardless of prior length of stay. Second, we assume that the distribution of  			 the future stays of the residents who were discharged directly to another  			 nursing facility was the same as the future stay distribution of discharges who  			 were readmitted to the sample facility. This assumption was necessary because  			 the NNHS provides no information on the duration of stays in facilities other  			 than the sample facility.</p>
