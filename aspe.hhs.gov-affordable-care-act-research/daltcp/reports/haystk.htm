<h3>PURPOSE</h3>
<p>The purpose of this survey is to determine 1) whether the Census  		provides a suitable frame for selecting board and care places and 2) whether  		the questionnaire will elicit sufficient information to identify such places.  		Board and care places are housing units or group quarters which provide room,  		meals and one or more services to dependent persons. The services center on  		activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living. They can  		be as concrete as assisting the dependent person with eating or as abstract as  		providing protective oversight.</p>
<h3>METHODS</h3>
<p>Drawn from the central Missouri census dress rehearsal file, the survey  		included three frames. Two were housing units and one was group quarters. The  		housing unit frames were designated by the number of nonrelatives and, in some  		cases, the presence of a disabled household member. The nonrelatives were  		classified as housemate, roommate, boarder, roomer, foster child or other  		nonrelative. All households with three or more nonrelatives were included in  		the survey. Since the number of households with one or two nonrelatives was  		very large and since there was a limited budget, additional criteria were used  		to select households with one or two nonrelatives. Households with one or two  		nonrelatives in the above specified categories were included if they were long  		form respondents and they had a disabled member in the household.</p>
<p>The Group Quarters were selected by category. we included every place in  		the categories designated by the sponsor. The categories were selected to be  		inclusive.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted in three stages: 1) a mail out/ mail back  		questionnaire with a second mailing to places which did not respond within  		three weeks, 2) a telephone followup, and 3) personal visits.</p>
<h3>FINDINGS</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Eighty six percent of the places provided completed questionnaires;  			 13 percent were vacant or no longer in existence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identified board and care places were 1.3 to 7.2 times expert  			 estimates. Two different estimates and the decision to include or exclude group  			 quarters account for the wide range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The screening questions were effective: 3.4 percent of housing units  			 and 37 percent of group quarters were board and care.</p>
<blockquote><p>Unit screening questions effectively distinguished board and care  				places from places such as boarding homes which housed independent  				nonrelatives. It did not separate board and care places from those with  				professional care services such as skilled nursing facilities.  				</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among housing units, the proportion of board and care places is  			 higher for places which have the same owner/renter as 2 1/2 years ago (i.e.  			 during the dress rehearsal) (7 percent) than it is for places with a different  			 owner or renter. It is also higher among long form respondents who reported a  			 disabled household member in the dress rehearsal (6.6 percent) than it is among  			 long form respondents with 3 or more nonrelatives and no disabled household  			 member or among short form respondents with 3 or more nonrelatives with  			 disability status not known.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 5 board and care places whose survey responses led to the  			 incorrect conclusion that they were not board and care (i.e. false negatives)  			 included 3 units which do not provide meals and-2 places which misreported the  			 presence of nonrelatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 169 places whose survey responses led to the incorrect  			 conclusion that they were board and care (i.e. false positives) included 90  			 places with professional services, 50 places with independent nonrelatives some  			 of whom are quasi-families, 23 foster families and 6 schools, prisons or  			 converted units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Board and care places usually provide both protective oversight and  			 housekeeping services. Eighty four percent of housing units and 97 percent of  			 group quarters provide at least these two services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The presence of nonrelatives, a census and unit screener, appears to  			 be frequently misreported. Among housing units with the same owner/renter as  			 1988, 48 percent claim to house only relatives during the period of the dress  			 rehearsal through the survey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provision of services to nonrelatives is also misreported. Fifty  			 eight percent of respondents in housing units with independent nonrelatives  			 claimed to provide one or more of the ADL (activities of daily living) or IADL  			 (instrumental activities of daily living) services to nonrelatives. Many  			 confused a division of labor with the provision of services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eighty percent of Group Quarters were board and care, professional  			 care facilities or vacant/delete. However, 10 of the Group Quarter categories  			 contain no board and care places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most (78 percent) board and care housing units have clients who have  			 physical disabilities and/or mental problems. Most (83 percent) board and care  			 group quarters have clients with mental problems and/or mental retardation, or  			 physical disabilities and/or senility, or mental problems and/or substance  			 abuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Board and care housing units in this survey usually care for either  			 adults 65 or older only or those under 65 only. Most board and care group  			 quarters care for both persons 65 or older and persons under 65.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most board and care housing units (62 percent) have one of four  			 disability and age combinations. They have clients with physical disabilities  			 who are either 65 and over or under 65, or clients with mental/emotional  			 problems who are under 65 or under 18.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Half of the board and care housing units and 82 percent of board and  			 care group quarters have one or more clients who receive social security or  			 veterans' administration payments because of their disability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The match rate between the survey and the independent Lewin/ICF list  			 of licensed places was high. Overall, 80 percent (n=107) of the licensed places  			 on the Lewin list are in the survey. A maximum of between 10 and 27 places on  			 the Lewin list that could have been on the survey were not on the  			 survey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The survey identified more board and care units than did the list of  			 licensed places. There were 157 board and care places in the survey; 47 of  			 these board and care places were not on the Lewin/ICF list of licensed  			 places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The survey identified most of the board and care housing units. The  			 matched places were primarily from group quarters, and secondarily from the  			 frame of 3 or more nonrelatives. One place was in the frame of 2  			 nonrelatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The matched places include both board and care and professional care  			 facilities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>The decennial census provides feasible frames for a national study  			 of board and care places. It effectively targets housing units with a board and  			 care population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two alternative frames of housing units for a national survey are  			 presented. The first replicates the housing unit frames of the pretest; the  			 second uses long form respondents only. In both alternatives, group quarters  			 are treated separately. Either separate questionnaires are developed, or group  			 quarters data are collected in conjunction with other surveys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommendations which could reduce survey costs include 1)  			 conducting research to examine characteristics of nonrelatives in survey  			 housing units such as their age, educational status, and tenure in relation to  			 the units' board and care status in order to eliminate places housing college  			 students and other young adults sharing living quarters for financial or social  			 reasons only, 2) more extensive and detailed use of reverse telephone  			 directories, and 3) screening potential target housing units clustered in  			 limited geographical areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommendations which improve data quality include 1) the  			 development of separate questionnaires for housing units and group quarters, 2)  			 adding questions to distinguish places providing more sophisticated  			 professional and medical care from board and care places, 3) revising the  			 service question or adding instructions so that the response reflects services  			 to <b>dependent</b> persons, 4) obtaining data for each person rather than  			 aggregated responses, and 5) reduction/ elimination of the "other" catch-all  			 category.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>This report presents the results of research designed to locate and  		describe board and care places. The Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation in the Office of the Secretary and the Office of the Assistant  		Secretary for Health in the Public Health Service in the U.S. Department of  		Health and Human Services jointly sponsored the survey. They contracted with  		the Bureau of the Census to conduct the survey in FY 1990 - FY 1991.</p>
<p>The purpose of this survey is to determine 1) whether the decennial  		Census provides a suitable frame for selecting board and care places and 2)  		whether the questionnaire will elicit sufficient information to identify such  		places. Board and care places are housing units or group quarters which provide  		room, meals and one or more services to dependent persons. The services center  		on activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living. They  		can be as concrete as assisting the dependent person with eating or as abstract  		as providing protective oversight.</p>
<p>Board and care places are part of a continuum of living arrangements. On  		one side are places that rent rooms or spaces and those which provide room and  		board to independent persons; on the other side are places that provide varying  		levels of professional services such as skilled nursing care or professional  		therapeutic services to dependent persons.</p>
<p>Neither the prevalence of board and care places nor the demand for them  		is known. However, several demographic trends indicate there may be an  		increasing need for such places. Longer life expectancy at older ages is  		increasing the size of the frail elderly population. At the same time, fewer  		family members may be available to care for elderly or other dependent family  		members as a result of high labor force activity by both men and women, divorce  		and separation and substantial geographic mobility.</p>
<h2><a name="survey" id="survey">SURVEY POPULATION</a></h2>
<p>The survey population was drawn from the 1988 census dress rehearsal  		file from central Missouri. It included the City of St. Louis, all of Boone,  		Camden, Cole, Cooper, Franklin, Gasconade, Howard, Laclede, Maries, Miller,  		Moniteau, Morgan, Osage and Pulaski counties as well as parts of Audrain,  		Calloway, Chariton, Crawford and St. Louis counties. (See <a href="haystk.htm#appendA">Appendix A</a>.) This area comprises a large metropolitan  		center, suburbs, smaller cities and rural areas.</p>
<p>The final sample of 1754 included 288 group quarters, and 1466 housing  		units. The group quarters were all those places from the Missouri dress  		rehearsal classified in categories selected by the sponsors as potential board  		and care classes. The categories are inclusive. A wide net was cast so that any  		place which might be a board and care place was likely to be included. A list  		of the categories is in <a href="haystk.htm#appendB">Appendix B</a>. Since the Missouri  		dress rehearsal site does not have one or more places in every group quarters'  		classification, other census categories may include board and care places.</p>
<p>Two frames contributed to the 1466 housing units. They were delineated  		by three criteria:</p>
<ul><li>type of census form (i.e. short or long),</li>
<li>number of nonrelatives of selected types, and</li>
<li>a yes response to the disability questions for one or more household  		  members.</li>
</ul><p>The census dress rehearsal fielded two types of questionnaires: a short  		form and a long form. The long form was sent to 1 out of 6 households. The long  		form contains all of the questions found on the short form plus additional  		questions on disability and demographic characteristics. Both the short form  		and the long form obtained data on the relationship to householder of every  		household member.</p>
<p>Nonrelatives who were classified as</p>
<ol><li>roomer, boarder or foster child,</li>
<li>housemate, roommate or</li>
<li>other nonrelative</li>
</ol><p>made the household a potential subject. Nonrelatives who were unmarried  		partners or paid employees were excluded. Subsequent discussion in this report  		will use the term "nonrelatives" to mean nonrelatives of the three types listed  		above.</p>
<p>There was some discussion about including the "housemate, roommate"  		category. Board and care places were found in each of the three nonrelative  		categories used by the Bureau of the census in the 1988 dress rehearsal.  		However, most of the places classified by the survey as board and care claimed  		only one type of nonrelative.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>49 percent identified each of their nonrelatives as "roomer, boarder  			 or foster child".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>22 percent checked the "housemate, roommate" boxes for each of their  			 nonrelatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>22 percent checked the "other nonrelative" boxes for each of their  			 nonrelatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6 percent checked two or three of the nonrelative types. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The disability questions were asked only on the long form and applied  		only to persons 15 years of age or older. (See <a href="haystk.htm#appendC">Appendix  		C</a> for the disability questions.) The disability questions ask whether a  		health condition of 6 or more months duration limits or prevents employment or  		inhibits a person's mobility or personal care activities.</p>
<p>The number of households with nonrelatives decreases as the number of  		nonrelatives in the household increases. There were 1,208 households with 3 or  		more nonrelatives, 2,234 households with 2 nonrelatives and 11,719 households  		with 1 nonrelative in the 1988 census dress rehearsal.</p>
<p>There were two frames for housing units. The first frame included all  		households with three or more nonrelatives. The second frame contains housing  		units with one or two nonrelatives which meet additional criteria. Because  		there were a large number of places with one or two nonrelatives, and there was  		a limited budget, all of these households could not be included. Nevertheless,  		there was substantial interest in collecting data on board and care housing  		units with one or two clients. In order to collect data within the budget  		constraints, a frame was designed to include a select subsample of these  		housing units. The stratum was chosen in such a way that selected units were  		more likely to be board and care than those drawn from a random sample. This  		frame included all of the long form respondent households with one or two  		nonrelatives which had one or more disabled members over the age of 15. The  		added specifications of long form respondents and a disabled household member  		over 15, radically decreased the number of eligible households to 258 units  		while probably increasing the likelihood that they would be board and care.  		Since many board and care places are assumed to have few members it was  		important to include the units with only one or two nonrelatives. This frame is  		subdivided into housing units with one nonrelative and housing units with two  		nonrelatives.</p>

Note that for  		long form frames with 1 or 2 nonrelatives, the household member with a  		disability is not necessarily a nonrelative.</p>
<p>Since the first frame contains both short and long form respondents with  		3 or more nonrelatives and since the long form provides data about household  		members with a disability, this frame is subdivided when it is pertinent to do  		so. Of the 1208 housing units in the frame with 3 or more nonrelatives,</p>
<ul><li>1094 are short form respondents,</li>
<li>86 are long form respondents with no disabled household member  		  and</li>
<li>28 are long form respondents with one or more disabled  		  residents.</li>
</ul><p>Some cautionary notes must be sounded. Long form response rates with  		sample data for the census dress rehearsal were approximately 90 percent of  		those mailed out. That is, 10 percent of long form respondents either did not  		return their questionnaire or the data which was on the long form portion (i.e.  		sample data) was blank. This ultimate response rate is lower than typical  		census response rates. Furthermore, this lower response rate is exacerbated by  		differential response rates. Typically, response rates are higher for educated,  		middle-class, suburbanites than for their counterparts. The subpopulation most  		likely to respond may be one of the least likely to operate board and care  		homes.</p>
<h2><a name="develop" id="develop">QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPMENT</a></h2>
<p>The questionnaire was designed with the small board and care home in  		mind. Subject experts suggest that the modal caregiver is likely to be a female  		with limited education. Consequently, every effort was made to keep the  		language and concepts as simple as possible and to limit skip patterns. As a  		result, most questions required checking the appropriate box or writing in the  		number of people with a given characteristic. <a href="haystk.htm#appendD">Appendix D</a>  		has a replica of the questionnaire.</p>
<p>There were three skip patterns but only one would have applied to board  		and care places. That is, respondents for board and care places would respond  		to all of the questions in the order presented unless they had no nonrelatives  		living with them at present. In this case they would skip one question about  		the number of nonrelatives (# 6b). Places which were not board and care ideally  		would have skipped to the last question either after the two questions about  		the presence of nonrelatives (# 6a and 7) or after the questions about services  		(# 8a through 8i).</p>
<p>Some questions on the questionnaire were culled from related surveys and  		modified for the target population; other questions were developed specifically  		for this survey. The questions asked about the type of unit or place, its  		existence at the time of the census dress rehearsal, services provided,  		existence, number and characteristics of clients/patients at the present or the  		past three years.</p>
<p>The questionnaire was pre-tested on nine Board and Care places in the  		Washington, D.C. area. Eight were small residential units and one was a large  		group quarters. Some questions were modified as a result of this pretest.</p>
<h2><a name="collect" id="collect">DATA COLLECTION</a></h2>
<p>The questionnaire was fielded in three stages. The first stage was mail  		out/ mail back; the second was a telephone follow-up; the third stage was a  		personal visit.</p>
<p>Following OMB approval, the first wave of the mail out/ mail back was  		sent in November, 1990. It was sent to all housing units and group quarters  		with a unique address. Some group quarters had duplicate address listings.  		These were held back for personal visit only. For the places with duplicate  		address listings, Field division was advised that there may be more than one  		unit at a given address and the places may have diverse populations. Eighteen  		percent (n=306) returned their questionnaires from the first mail out.</p>
<p>A second questionnaire was mailed in early December, 1990 to each unit  		with a unique address which did not respond to the first questionnaire. Places  		which the post office returned as vacant or could not find were not sent a  		second questionnaire. The field staff confirmed that vacant places were, in  		fact, unoccupied. Ten percent (n=176) returned questionnaires from the second  		wave. Typical for surveys, the total return for the mail out/mail back stage  		was 28 percent (n=482).</p>
<p>At the beginning of the field work, headquarters staff provided  		telephone numbers for 45 percent of the places. Reverse directories were the  		source for most of the numbers. Generally, these directories cover only urban  		areas. In this instance one Haynes directory covered the St. Louis metropolitan  		area, a second Haynes directory covered outlying suburbs of St. Louis and a  		Polk directory covered the Columbia metropolitan area. The Haynes directory  		indicates the number of years the resident has lived at the given address. This  		was valuable information since the dress rehearsal occurred two and one half  		years before the survey.</p>
<p>The initial telephone response rate of 68% of the 99 units assigned to  		telephone interview suggests that reverse directories are cost effective.  		However, the timing and duration of the telephone interview stage probably  		reduced the overall rate. Since survey response rates typically are low during  		the Christmas holidays, a hiatus in activity was anticipated. However, some  		telephone followup commenced. Ultimately census employees obtained complete  		interviews by telephone from 287 places resulting in completion of 23 percent  		of the remaining interviews or 16 percent of the total survey population.</p>
<p>Census field representatives completed the remaining 964 interviews  		during the personal visit phase. Interviewers were tenacious. Many made several  		personal calls in an effort to locate the respondent. The disposition of the  		remaining 21 interviews is not known because they were not classified in the  		boxes for the disposition of cases.</p>
<p>Complete interviews with the owner, renter, spouse, proprietor, manager,  		or assistant manager were obtained for most of the sample. <a href="haystk.htm#table2">Table 2</a> reveals that 86 percent (n=1501) answered the  		applicable questions. A few additional interviews (n=6) were completed by  		proxies. Nine percent (n=161) of the places were vacant and four percent (n=74)  		of the addresses were deletes because the unit does not exist. Fewer than six  		cases occurred in any of the other categories: partial interview, refused,  		noninterview and last resort.</p>

One hundred fifty five respondents indicated  		that their address was different from that of the address label. Most of these  		(n=105) were addressed to a Rural Route, P.O. Box, General Delivery, city name  		only or individual name and city. Two additional questionnaires were addressed  		to trailer parks. These 107 account for 69% of those who indicated their  		address differed from that on the label. In addition, fourteen had designations  		such as 1/2 (e.g. 4537 1/2 Main St.) or apartment numbers. Some respondents  		noted that the post office changed their address from the one on the label.</p>
<p>Approximately 7 weeks into the personal visit followup, one of the  		sponsors and the project managers made a site visit to St. Louis. Each one  		accompanied one of the field representatives on interviews in the morning. In  		the afternoon, the field representatives and their supervisors discussed their  		observations of the data collection. The report of the Field Coordinator is in  		<a href="haystk.htm#appendE">Appendix E</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="review" id="review">DATA REVIEW AND EDIT</a></h2>
<p>The central purpose of this research is to evaluate how well the  		screening questions identify board and care places. These are defined as  		facilities which provide meals and one or more other services to nonrelatives.  		It was apparent that the collected data did not separate board and care places  		from those which provide professional care such as hospitals and skilled  		nursing facilities. In addition, there were some anomalous results such as  		places that provide services but no meals to nonrelatives and places that claim  		to provide services to nonrelatives while stating that they house only  		relatives.</p>
<p>In order to assess the research results more carefully, the project  		manager reviewed the questionnaires of three groups of places:</p>
<ol><li>those that claimed to provide services but no meals (n=38), </li>
<li>those that claimed to house only relatives presently and in 1988 but  		  which also stated they provide services to non relatives (n=11), and</li>
<li>those that qualified as board and care places (n=326).</li>
</ol><p>If comments or information on the questionnaire clarified the nature of  		the place, the board and care status was edited to reflect the additional  		information. In most cases telephone calls to respondents were necessary to  		ascertain whether the unit was a board and care place.</p>
<h2><a name="negative" id="negative">FALSE NEGATIVES</a></h2>
<p>Among the 38 places in the first category, 3 units not initially  		classified as board and care were reclassified as a result of this review.  		These places do provide services to dependent nonrelatives. For example, one of  		the places provides services to substance abusers but each person prepares  		his/her own meals.</p>
<p>Most (i.e. 31) of the units housed nonrelatives who were roommates or  		who rented rooms or space in the respondent's unit. Four were unusual cases.  		They illustrate the difficulty of classifying some places. None of these four  		are classified as board and care places in this survey.</p>
<p>Two of the four housed roommates who had been in the state hospital for  		the mentally ill. The two roommates shared chores and helped each other. Some  		services were provided by a third party but that party did not reside in the  		unit. Specifically, an agency returned a certain amount of their check to them  		for their budgeted expenses.</p>
<p>Another residence housed two single parents, one with three children and  		the other with one. In addition, three juveniles who were put out of their own  		homes lived there. It was the researcher's impression that this was an informal  		arrangement.</p>
<p>In the fourth instance, the respondent rented space to his foster son  		and the foster son's wife and child. The foster son and his family, in turn,  		provided room and services to an elderly man who was unrelated to them.</p>
<p>Eleven of the 621 respondents (1.77 percent) who stated that no  		nonrelatives currently reside at the unit and none resided there during the  		past three years claimed to provide one or more services to nonrelatives. Two  		of these places actually house nonrelatives. These are board and care places  		and were reclassified as such. The other 9 house relatives only. These  		respondents missed or ignored the skip pattern. Their board and care status  		remained unchanged.</p>
<h2><a name="positive" id="positive">FALSE POSITIVES</a></h2>
<p>The third and most important review covered all places that initially  		qualified as board and care. Three hundred twenty six of the 1754 (18.59%)  		claimed to provide services to nonrelatives and had nonrelatives currently  		living at the residence and/or had nonrelatives living there during the prior 3  		years. It was clear that at least some of these were likely to provide more  		sophisticated services than typical board and care places. Address labels  		suggested that medical hospitals, psychiatric facilities and other group  		quarters with professional services were included in the sample frames.</p>
<p>The data from the questionnaire discriminated board and care places from  		boarding houses and places that housed college roommates; they did not separate  		board and care places from professional care facilities such as hospitals.</p>
<p>Each of the questionnaires was reviewed and, in many cases a follow up  		telephone call was made to obtain the data needed to classify the unit in  		question.</p>
<p><a href="haystk.htm#table3">Table 3</a> shows the number and categories of the 326  		units initially defined as board and care. It is divided into those which we  		classified as board and care and those we classified as not board and care.</p>

</tr></table><p>Of the 326 places initially classified as board and care, 48 percent (  		n=157) retained the designation. For purposes of this analysis board and care  		places include both state licensing categories (e.g. RCF I, group home) and  		descriptive categories (e.g., places treating substance abuse).</p>
<p>Most (i.e. 169) of these 326 units are not board and care. These are  		false positives. The largest group (n=90) includes places with substantial  		professional services such as nursing homes with skilled or intermediate  		nursing care, and general and psychiatric hospitals. The second largest group  		(n=49) is independent nonrelatives, some of whom are quasi-families. For  		example, one household houses the former live-in housekeeper who is now  		elderly. Many are groups of religious men or women who may care for elderly  		members. The third group is foster parents (n=23). There are only one or two  		places in each of the other categories. These categories are:</p>
<ul><li>prisons which provide or provided skilled care in the past but whose  		  essential identification is that of a prison,</li>
<li>schools for the blind or deaf,</li>
<li>doctors offices converted from other uses which may have been board  		  and care.</li>
</ul><p>Although no tallies were kept, it is the project manager's impression  		that many of the respondents reinterviewed by phone identified their place by  		state licensing terms such as "RCF" or "group home". Pre-test questionnaire  		respondents tended to use the terms of the District of Columbia's licensing  		agency. This suggests that future research may find it effective to use locally  		relevant categories in addition to descriptors to identify places. The locally  		relevant terms would facilitate accurate response of licensed places. Its  		effect on unlicensed places is not known.</p>
<h2><a name="expert" id="expert">EXPERT ESTIMATES OF BOARD AND CARE PLACES</a></h2>
<p>The census screeners proved effective in narrowing the search for the  		board and care subpopulation needle in the demographic haystack. The ratio of  		survey board and care places to expected board and care places range from a  		minimum of 1.3, or 30 percent more places than expected, to a high of 7.2 times  		the number of expected places.</p>
<p>Experts had estimated that between one-twentieth and one-tenth of one  		percent of all places (i.e. housing units and group quarters) are board and  		care facilities. We estimate how many board and care places we would expect to  		find using these percentages for housing units alone and for housing units and  		group quarters combined.</p>
<p>Although the estimated percentages are believed to apply to housing  		units and group quarters combined, we also calculate the more conservative  		estimate of housing units only. The ratio of the survey board and care housing  		units to the estimated board and care housing units will be lower than  		comparable figures for housing units and group quarters because there are  		relatively few group quarters in the dress rehearsal site and because they  		comprise the majority of board and care places in the survey. In other words,  		when using housing units only rather than housing units and group quarters, the  		total number of units is only marginally smaller but the number of survey board  		and care units is substantially smaller. (<a href="haystk.htm#appendF">Appendix F</a>  		shows the computations annotated with explanations.)</p>
<p>The simplifying assumption in these calculations is that the dress  		rehearsal file contains all housing units and group quarters. Although roughly  		10 percent of long form respondents either did not respond or did not provide  		sample data, this assumption is consistent with the fact that places lacking  		data could not enter the survey population. Applying these two estimates of  		one-tenth and one-twentieth of one percent to the 394,425 housing units and  		group quarters in the Missouri dress rehearsal site (i.e. returned  		questionnaires) gives estimates of 394 and 197 board and care places  		respectively. Assuming an even distribution of places among all group quarters  		and housing units with nonrelatives in the selected categories, the resulting  		percentages yield 43 expected board and care places for the one tenth of 1  		percent estimate and 22 expected places for the one-twentieth of 1 percent  		estimate.</p>
<p>Among housing units and group quarters in the survey, 157 of the 1754  		places (9 percent) were identified as board and care. Depending on which  		estimate (one-tenth or one-twentieth of 1 percent) is used, this represents  		between 3.6 and 7.2 times the expected number of board and care places.</p>
<p>Since group quarters comprise a small part of the base but a large part  		of the board and care units and since group quarters were selected by their  		category names, estimates are made for housing units only. For housing units  		only the estimate of board and care units are 38 and 19 for one-tenth and  		one-twentieth of one percent respectively. The 50 board and care housing units  		identified in the survey are 1.3 (for one-tenth of one percent) and 2.6 (for  		one-twentieth of one percent) times the expected number of board and care  		places.</p>
<h2><a name="screen" id="screen">EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CENSUS SCREENER</a></h2>
<p>We turn now to the survey results. The results give the percentage of  		survey units or survey units of a given type which exhibit the characteristics  		in question. They are not estimates for the dress rehearsal site.</p>
<p>For the units in the survey, 37 percent of group quarters and 3.4  		percent of housing units are board and care. Since group quarters were included  		on the basis of their category and housing units were targeted primarily on the  		basis of the number of nonrelatives, it is not surprising that group quarters  		include more board and care units. </p>
<p>The 3.4 percent of housing units which are board and care places is an  		average across the frames. For purposes of comparison, the frame for 3 of more  		nonrelatives is subdivided by census form and, for long form respondents,  		presence of disabled members. <a href="haystk.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a> and  		<a href="haystk.htm#table4">Table 4</a> reveal the notable differences between the  		frames. The use of long form respondents in conjunction with the disability  		question yields higher proportions of board and care places than short form  		respondents.</p>

</tr></table><p>Both the number and percentage of board and care places is small.

However, if long form  		respondents with three or more nonrelatives are separated according to whether  		or not there is a disabled household member the results are striking. Though  		small in number, 11 percent of long form respondents having 3 or more  		nonrelatives and a disabled household member are board and care places (3  		units). In contrast, none of the long form respondents with three or more  		nonrelatives but no disabled member are board and care.

Six percent of each frame (13 units and 3  		units respectively) are board and care units.</p>
<p>Given the difference in the selection and outcome of group quarters vis  		a vis housing units, the analysis in this report is done separately for these  		two categories.</p>

</tr></table><p><a href="haystk.htm#table5">Table 5</a> shows that for residences which house the  		same owner or renter as April, 1988, seven percent of the housing units are  		board and care. This is double the 3.4 percent of all housing units which are  		board and care. Only one half of one percent of those residential units which  		claimed to be living elsewhere in April of 1988 were board and care units in  		late 1990.</p>
<p>The results are less dramatic for group quarters. Forty three percent of  		the places which existed in April of 1988 compared to 37 percent of all group  		quarters are board and care.</p>
<p>Note that a larger proportion of housing units than group quarters  		change occupancy. Forty percent of the survey housing units changed hands  		during the 2 1/2 years between the dress rehearsal and the survey. A  		substantially smaller 3 percent of group quarters changed during this  		period.</p>
<h2><a name="character" id="character">CHARACTERISTICS OF PLACES THAT ARE NOT BOARD AND  		CARE</a></h2>
<p>Although our focus is on board and care places, it is useful to know the  		characteristics of sample units which are not board and care. Between 73 and 84  		percent of the occupied housing units in each frame house only relatives or  		house nonrelatives but do not provide pertinent services. There is a notable  		pattern among the frames. Frames with one or two nonrelatives (50 to 58  		percent) are more likely than those with 3 or more nonrelatives (30 to 37  		percent) to report having only relatives at present and during the past three  		years. Frames with 3 or more nonrelatives (32 to 53 percent) are more likely  		than frames with 1 or 2 nonrelatives (20 to 23 percent) to report having  		nonrelatives currently or during the past three years. Perhaps places that have  		few nonrelatives do not recall their presence in the past and/or may be more  		likely to misreport their relationship status. More benignly, this may reflect  		the response of different household members. One researcher using the 1980  		census remarked that many children appeared to be identified as nonrelatives by  		their step parents. Although stepchildren may have been more accurately  		identified in the 1988 dress rehearsal as a result of a specific category for  		them, an inaccurate relationship for some household members may have  		occurred.</p>
<h2><a name="unit" id="unit">EFFECTIVENESS OF UNIT SCREENING QUESTIONS</a></h2>
<p>Two sets of questions comprised the unit screeners. The first asked  		about the presence and number of nonrelatives; the second inquired about the  		types of services provided to nonrelatives. The question numbers are given in  		parentheses.</p>
<p>The two questions about the presence of nonrelatives were linked to  		time. The first (# 6a) asked whether nonrelatives currently lived at the survey  		site. A later question (# 7) asked whether nonrelatives lived at the survey  		place during the prior three years. This question allows us to screen in places  		that may have been board and care places in the past but no longer are or who  		may not have clients at the time of the survey. For those who stated they had  		nonrelatives currently living with them, a subsequent question asked for the  		number of nonrelatives.</p>
<p>The second element is a set of nine questions (# 8a to 8i) directed only  		to those who have or had nonrelatives living with them. Each question asks  		whether or not a given service which may be provided by a board and care  		facility is or is not provided for nonrelatives living at the survey unit. The  		services are designed to cover a wide variety of dependent populations:  		elderly, mentally ill, mentally retarded, substance abusers, and physically  		disabled.</p>
<h2><a name="presence" id="presence">PRESENCE OF NONRELATIVES</a></h2>
<p>Among board and care places, sheltering nonrelatives seems to be fairly  		consistent over time. Most places which currently house nonrelatives, had  		nonrelatives living there in the past three years. <a href="haystk.htm#table6">Table  		6</a> shows that 76 percent of housing units and 91 percent of group quarters  		which are board and care currently have nonrelatives in residence and had them  		in the past three years also. Only 14 percent of housing units and 5 percent of  		group quarters which are board and care had no nonrelatives at the time of the  		survey but did have them in the past three years.</p>

</tr></table><p>The question about "other services" was more misleading than  		enlightening. Board and care places in housing units which responded yes to the  		other services question answered yes to four or more of the specified services.  		Thus no additional units were identified as board and care places as a result  		of this question.</p>
<p>The problems with the "other services" question were diverse. Miscoding,  		misinterpretation and no specification occurred.</p>
<p>Among the four respondents who responded yes only to the other services  		item, one person wrote in "None -- no one but me" meaning she lived alone. A  		second is a religious group which provides meals to nonresident homeless  		people. The remaining two respondents checked "yes" but did not specify the  		service provided.</p>
<p>Given that "other services" is not illuminating and not specific, this  		analysis focused on the seven specified services other than preparing  		meals.</p>
<h2><a name="misreport" id="misreport">MISREPORTING</a></h2>
<p>Each of the unit screeners appears to be misreported by at least some of  		the respondents.</p>
<p>The two questions about the presence of nonrelatives allow a check for  		consistency between the dress rehearsal and the survey. If responses to the  		dress rehearsal questionnaire were accurate, respondents in every place that  		did not have a change in the owner, renter or type of place should have  		answered "yes" to at least one of the questions about the presence of  		nonrelatives.</p>
<p>Among those places where the respondent lived or the facility existed in  		April of 1988, 48 percent of the respondents in housing units and 13 percent of  		group quarter's respondents claimed to shelter only relatives. For respondents  		in housing units, this response about nonrelatives is inconsistent with the  		responses in the dress rehearsal.</p>
<p>Responses to questions about services to nonrelatives is misreported in  		a number of ways. Those who claim to have only relatives at present and in the  		recent past either misunderstood the question, misreported the presence of  		nonrelatives or, most likely, missed the skip pattern. Fifty six percent of  		respondents in units housing only relatives since the dress rehearsal claim to  		provide one or more services to nonrelatives.</p>
<p>Fifty eight percent of respondents in housing units sheltering  		nonrelatives and which are not board and care claim to provide one or more  		services to nonrelatives. The key factor differentiating these places from  		board and care is that independent persons shared household tasks rather than a  		caregiver providing services to dependent persons. Some seem to confuse a  		division of labor with the provision of services. College roommates,  		fraternities, medical residents, and co-renters on limited incomes reported  		providing services to nonrelatives. In one unit, a fraternity claimed to  		provide all of the services listed to its members. In another example, a  		college student sharing an apartment said he helped with "activities outside  		the residence" because only he owned a vehicle and he took his roommates  		grocery shopping.</p>
<p>This result suggests that the questions about services provided to  		dependent nonrelatives need more precision. Perhaps the question should specify  		that these services are provided to persons whose physical limitations or  		mental conditions prevent them from living independently. It is also necessary  		to distinguish whether the recipient is a dependent or independent person. In  		addition, close editing and followup may be needed in any future survey.</p>
<h2><a name="group" id="group">GROUP QUARTERS CATEGORIES</a></h2>
<p>The final task for evaluating the unit screeners is to examine the  		outcome for group quarters. Eighty one percent of the group quarters are either  		board and care (37%), facilities with staff that provide professional services  		(32%), schools (1%), places which are now vacant or demolished (11%), or  		duplicate questionnaire sent to a given place (&lt;1%).</p>
<p>Another 12 percent report having only relatives and 7 percent have  		nonrelatives but do not qualify as board and care. Most of these group quarters  		with nonrelatives which are not board and care are places that do not provide  		services. Some are religious groups; others are fraternities or college  		roommates; and the remaining three are diverse categories. Group quarters with  		relatives only reported no nonrelatives at the time of the survey and none in  		the past three years.</p>
<p>To improve future studies, it is useful to distinguish group quarters  		categories which have board and care places from categories which do not. All  		of the places in 4 categories are board and care; none of the places in 10  		categories are board and care; in the remaining 10 categories some are board  		and care and some are not.</p>
<p><a href="haystk.htm#table10">Table 10</a> divides group quarters' categories by  		board and care, professional facilities, not board and care places and mixed  		types. For mixed types, the proportion which are board and care is given in  		parentheses.</p>

</tr></table><h2><a name="board" id="board">CHARACTERISTICS OF BOARD AND CARE UNITS</a></h2>
<p>Having compared the screening indicators for board and care places, this  		analysis examines selected characteristics of these places. The analysis is  		exploratory. The purpose of this section is to describe the population and  		ownership characteristics of board and care places in this survey, specifically  		the disability and age of the resident nonrelatives, the receipt of disability  		payments and the type of ownership or operation. Characteristics of board and  		care housing units are described separately from those of board and care group  		quarters.</p>
<h2><a name="disable" id="disable">DISABILITIES OF NONRELATIVES</a></h2>
<p>Respondents classified the disabilities of their nonrelatives. The six  		broad disability categories in addition to an "other" category were:</p>
<ul><li>physical disability,</li>
<li>senility or forgetfulness </li>
<li>mental or emotional problem </li>
<li>mental retardation</li>
<li>autism, epilepsy or cerebral palsy </li>
<li>drug or alcohol dependency</li>
</ul><p>Almost four fifths of the housing units have nonrelatives with  		disabilities in two single categories and approximately four fifths of the  		group quarters have nonrelatives with disabilities concentrated in three  		combination categories with two common disabilities.</p>
<p>The disabilities of nonrelatives in housing units are diverse but  		typically dependent residents in housing units have one or both of the two most  		prevalent disabilities. <a href="haystk.htm#figure3">Figure 3</a> and <a href="haystk.htm#table11a">Table 11a</a> show that 78 percent of the 50 board and care  		housing units (n= 39) claimed residents had physical disabilities and/or mental  		or emotional problems. Some of these places housed clients with other kinds of  		disabilities. In order not to count places more than once, a sieve technique  		was used for classification. If a place could be classified in the first  		category (viz. mentally ill), it could not be classified in subsequent  		categories, even if the place housed persons with the less prevalent  		disabilities.</p>

<p>Combining either age groups or types of disability with kinds of  		services provides little additional information. Since 68 percent of board and  		care residential units and 93 percent of board and care group quarters provide  		six or seven services including protective oversight and housekeeping, the most  		prevalent combinations always occur within this service category. Furthermore  		the most prevalent age and disability categories reflect those which dominate  		the bivariate distributions. Since these tabulations shed little light on board  		and care places there is no further discussion of them. Seventy two percent of  		board and care places in housing units cared either for elderly persons only  		(24 percent) or they cared only for persons under age 65 only (48 percent). Ten  		percent cared for persons under age 65 as well as persons 65 years of age or  		older and ten percent cared for children under age 18 only.

<p>Both the census screeners and the unit screeners identified board and  		care places. However the unit screeners did not discriminate board and care  		places from professional care facilities. Nevertheless, the screeners did  		substantially better than expert estimates would lead us to expect.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying board and care places, broad information  		about the age and disability characteristics of the dependent population as  		well as some data about the size of these places, the services they provide and  		their operation was obtained. Furthermore, this data is available for both  		residential units and the larger group quarters.</p>
<h2><a name="compare" id="compare">COMPARISON TO AN INDEPENDENT LIST</a></h2>
<p>The presence of an independent list of licensed places provides a unique  		opportunity to evaluate how completely we targeted licensed board and care  		places. Comparing survey units with those of the independent list, we determine  		what proportion of eligible licensed places are in the survey. In addition, we  		note the number of survey places which are not on the</p>
<p>The state of Missouri has extensive licensing requirements. Under  		certain conditions, they license places which have only one client. The  		Department of Health and Human Services contracted with Lewin/ICF to develop a  		list of the names and addresses of licensed places. Drug and alcohol abuse  		treatment centers and foster homes were excluded from the Lewin/ICF list. This  		list was matched to the board and care survey using the following method.</p>
<p>Since the survey only targeted places in the dress rehearsal site, which  		is in central Missouri, we made a file of places on the Lewin/ICF list that had  		zip codes which matched the ones in the dress rehearsal site. Places on the  		Lewin/ICF list were then hand matched to places on the survey list. Out of 210  		places, there were 102 matches and 8 probable matches (or 110 matches).  		However, three of these were duplicates so there are effectively 107  		matches.</p>
<p>Since it is known that the zip code boundaries are wider than the dress  		rehearsal boundaries, the next step required identifying which of the remaining  		100 places were likely survey targets. Survey candidates were distinguished by  		a number of factors which are listed below.</p>

Places  		not interviewed were located on maps to determine if they were in the dress  		rehearsal site.</p>
<p>As a result of these interviews and the research, we identified 10  		places which appear to be survey candidates and 55 which are not. Most of the  		latter are excluded because they are outside the dress rehearsal area but  		between 1 and 5 cases were excluded for other reasons. The number of places and  		the reasons for their exclusion are listed below.</p>

<li>5 did not exist at the time of the dress rehearsal.</li>
<li>2 were apartment complexes with 1 or 2 residents per unit. </li>
<li>4 were not target populations (e.g. prisoners). </li>
<li>2 provided only day care.</li>
<li>2 had 1 or 2 persons in March, 1988. </li>
<li>1 was licensed after March, 1988.</li>
<li>1 was licensed between 10/87 and 3/88 and had few clients  		  initially.</li>

<ul><li>7 were licensed for 1 or 2 beds.</li>
<li>1 city/zip code was not in the dress rehearsal site. </li>
<li>7 telephones were disconnected or not in service.</li>
</ul><p>Places with 1 or 2 persons would be in the survey only if they received  		and returned the long form of the census dress rehearsal questionnaire and  		reported a disabled household member.</p>
<p>We assume that places with numbers not in service are either not in  		operation or demolished.</p>
<p>Of the remaining 20 places, 3 are duplicates and 17 are in the dress  		rehearsal site but could not be contacted by phone because either no number was  		available or no one answered. Consequently, it is not known if the places  		actually are eligible target units. The many reasons why these 17 places may  		not be eligible units reflect those which identify excluded places: date  		commencing operation, size and type of population, presence of 24 hour care and  		current status as a residence for a dependent population. Another possibility  		is that some of these may not have responded to the 1988 dress rehearsal.</p>

<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">CONCLUSION</a></h2>
<p>The results of matching the survey data with an independent list  		indicate that the search for board and care places was notably successful,  		capturing at least 80 percent of the places on the independent list. However,  		while it did not capture all licensed places, it did capture some places which  		may be unlicensed. Places may be unlicensed because of ignorance, disinterest  		or an active intent to be unknown to regulating officials.</p>
<h2><a name="estimate" id="estimate">ESTIMATE OF BOARD AND CARE PLACES FOR DRESS  		REHEARSAL SITE AND U.S.</a></h2>
<p>Following are estimates of board and care housing units in the dress  		rehearsal site and the United States. The estimates only include housing units;  		they do not include group quarters. For the dress rehearsal site the 107 board  		and care group quarters can be added for a total. However, comparable data on  		board and care group quarters for the United States is not available.</p>
<p>We estimate that there are 141 board and care <b>housing units</b> for  		the central Missouri dress rehearsal site. <a href="haystk.htm#appendG">Appendix G</a>  		shows the calculations. The calculations require multiplying the long form  		board and care units by two factors, 1.11 to account for the 90 percent data  		capture rate and 6 to account for the 1 in 6 sampling for the long form. These  		numbers were then added to the number of board and care units from the frame  		for 3 or more nonrelatives.</p>
<p>These 141 board and care units comprise .62 percent of the 22,660  		households with nonrelatives of any kind and .93 percent of households with  		nonrelatives who belong to the three categories used in the sampling frames  		(i.e. roommates and housemates, roomer, boarder or foster child, and other  		nonrelative).</p>
<p>Any estimate for the United States requires additional simplifying  		assumptions. In order to use the data from this survey, one assumes that the  		central Missouri dress rehearsal site is either a microcosm of the U.S. or a  		reasonable average for the United States. There is no data to suggest that  		central Missouri is such a microcosm. However, lacking a better model, we make  		the very general assumption that the dress rehearsal site data provides a  		reasonable average. The amount and direction of any bias is not known but this  		provides a working estimate that can be revised or replaced when a better model  		or better data becomes available.</p>
<p>Applying the .93 percent figure to the 6,317,000 households with 1 or  		more nonrelatives gives an estimate of 39,165 board and care housing units in  		the U.S. The household figure is from the Current Population Survey of March,  		1990, Table 16 which is reproduced in <a href="haystk.htm#appendH">Appendix H</a>. When  		using this rough estimate, remember that it is housing units only; group  		quarters are excluded.</p>
<h2><a name="recommend" id="recommend">RECOMMENDATIONS</a></h2>
<p>Following are some recommendations generated from the pretest. Ideally,  		they will strengthen future research.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>More precision is needed in the questionnaire. Since board and care  			 homes are part of a continuum, it is necessary to separate them from units on  			 either side which are not board and care. Boarding homes and rental rooms are  			 often distinguished by the nonrelative status and services question. Still  			 needed is a question or questions which would screen out skilled nursing  			 facilities and other places which provide more professional services. In doing  			 this, one observation from interviews of the 'hot house' respondents should be  			 kept in mind. Most of these respondents distanced themselves from a stronger  			 question about medical care. As a result of the reaction, the question was  			 modified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separate questionnaires are needed for group quarters and housing  			 units. The use of single questionnaire created some confusion among  			 respondents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clarify the services to <b>dependent</b> nonrelatives. Distinguish  			 people who are capable of living independently but do not because of economic  			 or social reasons from those who are truly dependent. Distinguish a division of  			 labor from the provision of services to dependent persons. This may require  			 phone or personal visit followup if a mail out/ mail back instrument is used.  			 Close editing and followup is essential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the Census identifier (e.g. District Office/Address Register  			 Area/ Block/ Map Spot/ ID) rather than a sequence number because consecutive  			 sequence numbers are reassigned at the second mailout. This results in  			 different units sharing the same sequence number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolve multiple entries in the field. That is, obtain correct data  			 if respondent marks two boxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include a clerical operation in Jeffersonville to make the documents  			 ready for keying. This may involve computing percentages of a number when a  			 number was requested but a percentage was entered, transferring a code that was  			 circled or entered above its coding block, or entering a number when the word  			 representing the number is written out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolve duplicates before keying, preferably in the field  			 office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Output area code and telephone number as separate items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key any portion of the telephone number even if it is  			 incomplete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider using long form respondents as the frame for future  			 research. In this research long form respondents with a disabled household  			 member targeted a larger proportion of board and care places. In the long form  			 frame with 3 or more nonrelatives, the few board and care places had one or  			 more disabled members. None had no disabled member. However, sixteen percent of  			 board and care places claimed to have no disabled persons or no  			 nonrelatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider using state licensing categories in addition to generic  			 descriptive categories to identify board and care units.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2><a name="feasible" id="feasible">FEASIBILITY OF A NATIONAL STUDY</a></h2>
<p>A national study requires many considerations but the results of the  		pretest provide pertinent data about:</p>
<ul><li>the feasibility of using the decennial census to define survey  		  frames,</li>
<li>incorporating group quarters and housing units in the same  		  survey,</li>
<li>the effect of changing residences,</li>
<li>the use of reverse directories,</li>
<li>possible misreporting of nonrelative status and</li>
<li>the potential for identifying areas with high concentrations of  		  housing units sheltering nonrelatives but with few board and care places.</li>
</ul><p>Survey results suggest that the decennial census provides suitable  		frame(s) for a national study of board and care places. However, since the two  		basic types of places, housing units and group quarters, are very different,  		they must be distinguished.</p>
<p>Selected on the basis of their category classification, board and care  		places which are group quarters are easier to locate. It may be both possible  		and preferable to identify these in conjunction with other existing surveys or  		to treat these places separately from housing units.</p>
<p>At a minimum, a separate questionnaire is needed: one for group quarters  		and a different one for housing units. Due to cost considerations, one  		questionnaire was used for both housing units and group quarters in the pretest  		survey. Questions were worded to apply to these diverse places and some  		questions applied only to one type of place. This necessary compromise created  		some confusion. In fact, some respondents wrote in comments expressing a degree  		of frustration. Separate questionnaires are likely to improve data quality and  		responses while marginally reducing respondent burden. In addition, the  		resulting simplification of the questionnaire is likely to be very important  		for a population with limited education.</p>
<p>For housing units, the use of information gleaned from the pretest  		provides a basis for locating board and care places by selecting housing units  		which have specific characteristics. There are two alternatives to be  		considered.</p>
<p>The first alternative uses the same housing unit frames as the pretest.  		These frames identified more board and care places than would be expected given  		expert estimates prior to the survey but the board and care places comprised  		only 3.4 percent of all housing units selected for the pretest. In other words,  		50 of the 1466 housing units were board and care. Thus, although the census  		screening questions narrowed the field to places with one or two potential  		board and care characteristics, a large number of housing units still had to be  		surveyed to find a small number of board and care places. However these board  		and care places exceeded the expected number of units.</p>
<p>The second alternative uses only long form respondents. Based on the  		findings that</p>
<ul><li>the pretest had a higher percentage of board and care places among  		  long form respondents with a disabled household member than among either short  		  form respondents with 3 or more nonrelatives or all survey housing units  		  and</li>
<li>the pretest had no board and care units among long form respondents  		  with three or more nonrelatives but no disabled household members,</li>
</ul><p>future research should consider using the long form respondents for the  		frame in order to use the additional information about disability. Screening on  		the basis of two characteristics, nonrelatives and disability, is likely to  		result in higher percentages of board and care places among survey units than  		using only the number of nonrelatives. However, some sampling of long form  		respondents with no disability should be considered since ten percent of the  		board and care places reported on the survey that they housed no disabled  		dependent persons. The results would be weighted to provide estimates of the  		total number of board and care places. It should be remembered that the numbers  		of board and care units in the long form frames were small but the percentages  		of units that were board and care were always larger than for all housing units  		or housing units with three or more nonrelatives from the short form.  		Consequently, this alternative is likely to be more cost effective.</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services sponsored a second research  		project during 1990-1991 to identify potential board and care places. Mentioned  		earlier, this is the Lewin/ICF list of licensed places. Under contract to HHS,  		Lewin/ICF developed a list of licensed places that could be board and care. The  		Lewin/ICF list contains licensed places but they are not necessarily board and  		care places.</p>
<p>Sponsors of future research may wish to consider using this source as a  		supplement to or in conjunction with research using decennial census frames.  		Comparisons of places on the Lewin/ICF list with the list of places on the  		census pretest revealed that some places were only on one of the lists. Between  		10 and 27 potential board and care places were only on the Lewin/ICF list and  		47 identified board and care places were only on the census pretest survey.  		Furthermore, most of the places on the Lewin/ICF list which matched the survey  		list were group quarters; only a small proportion were housing units. Eighty  		eight of the 107 places were group quarters, nineteen were housing units and 3  		were duplicates. Of the nineteen housing units, only 10 of the Lewin/ICF places  		(20 percent) were among the 50 board and care housing units on the pretest  		survey; 9 were not board and care places. Since</p>
<ul><li>there is substantial interest in unlicensed places and the census  		  frame is the only one of these two sources capable of capturing unlicensed  		  places,</li>
<li>the census pretest captured more of the board and care places than  		  the Lewin/ICF list and</li>
<li>80 percent of the identified board and care housing units are only on  		  the census pretest</li>
</ul><p>the decennial census is a more productive source for future  		research.</p>
<p>Lists of licensed places from each state could be the basis for a  		supplemental survey in future research or they could be part of a dual  		estimation procedure. Note, however, that state licensing requirements vary.  		Some experts suggest that Missouri has more rigorous licensing standards than  		many other states. To the extent this is true, the Missouri list is likely to  		encompass a larger proportion of board and care places than many other states.  		Future research may wish to survey places on state lists of licensed places  		which are not included in a survey developed from census frames. If only  		housing units are included in a census based survey, then licensed places which  		are group quarters would be excluded and only housing units not covered by the  		census frames would be interviewed in the supplemental survey. If the pretest  		results are representative and similar frames are used, then the number is  		likely to be relatively small. Using the matched places for the Lewin/ICF list  		and the census pretest as a guide, most places (82 percent) were group  		quarters. Among the other 18 percent, twelve percent were from the short form  		frames and six percent were on the long form frames.</p>
<p>Using licensed lists for a supplemental survey would be more practical  		if the survey used frames similar to the pretest which are designed to tap most  		of the board and care population (viz. all housing units with three or more  		nonrelatives and long form respondents with 1 or 2 nonrelatives and a disabled  		household member). If the frames are likely to capture most of the community  		based dependent care facilities then a high match rate is possible. However, if  		frames such as long form respondents form the basis for the survey then a high  		match rate is unlikely. Since long forms were sent to 1 in 6 housing units,  		most units would have no chance of being in the survey and thus no chance of  		being matched to an independent list.</p>
<p>Other information from the survey may prove useful in reducing survey  		costs and/or improving quality: residential mobility, the use of reverse  		directories, misreporting of nonrelatives and the existence of clusters of  		housing units with a large proportion of units with nonrelatives but a small  		proportion of board and care units.</p>
<p>Over half (53 percent) of the housing units in the pretest had a change  		of owner/tenant or were vacant or deleted. These are places whose population  		characteristics in 1988 indicated they were potential board and care places.  		Reflecting their changed composition, very few of these housed board and care  		clients. Elimination or reduction of personal visits to these places would  		reduce survey costs substantially. Reverse directories may be helpful here. The  		Haynes reverse directories indicate the length of residence and the Polk  		directory notes the presence of a new householder. Assuming telephone numbers  		are available, restricting the followup of respondents in housing units with a  		new tenant or owner to telephone calls could reduce field costs while verifying  		the information that there are new occupants and ascertaining board and care  		status.</p>
<p>Many of the households in the pretest were college roommates or young  		adults sharing living quarters. Reducing personal visits to this population  		would also be cost effective. Some reverse directories indicate occupation,  		including the designation of student. Households with designated  		characteristics (e.g. students) could be restricted to telephone followup only  		insofar as telephone numbers are available.</p>
<p>Although there is not sufficient data to make a definitive statement,  		some preliminary evidence supports the ad hoc assumption that many units with  		nonrelatives are clustered in a limited geographical area. The subject ARAB  		contain proportionately more housing units than expected if one assumed an even  		distribution of housing units. Note that these areas do have a few board and  		care units.</p>
<p>For example, in the Columbia district office, six percent of the Address  		Register Areas (ARA) (i.e. 19 out of 318 ARAs) contain 57 percent of the  		pretest housing units for that district office (i.e. 414 of the 724 housing  		units in the survey) but only 17 percent of the board and care places (4 of the  		24). Since most of these ARAs are near universities and colleges (viz. the  		University of Missouri at Columbia, Columbia College and Stephens College which  		are geographically close together) there are likely to be many residences of  		students and staff.</p>
<p>Additional suggestive evidence is found in tenure and residential  		mobility. Eighty nine percent of the 414 housing units either had a new  		resident since the 1988 dress rehearsal (84 percent) or were vacant (5  		percent). Most of these were renters: 73 percent of the 414 housing units  		housed renters who moved in after April 1, 1988. The combination of renting,  		recent residential mobility and proximity to colleges is typical of a college  		student/ young adult population. A strategy for quickly screening these places  		could retain response quality while reducing response burden and field costs.  		Population characteristics such as age and educational enrollment may provide  		additional clues regarding places unlikely to be board and care. Additional  		research would be needed to examine this possibility.</p>
<p>In addition to using reverse directories in specified cases such as  		those above, telephone followup could be used to reduce the field costs of  		nonresponse followup in general. Recall that the initial telephone followup  		attained a high percentage of completed questionnaires.</p>
<p>Forty percent of housing unit respondents claim to house only relatives  		currently and since the dress rehearsal in 1988. This is not accounted for by  		changes in the resident owner or tenant: 48 percent of housing units with the  		same owner or tenant claimed to have only relatives during the period between  		the dress rehearsal and the survey. Refining the questionnaire to require data  		on each individual in a manner similar to the decennial census questionnaire  		may provide more accurate data or at least provide a basis for examining  		possible reasons for discrepancies. Comparison of survey results with the 1988  		dress rehearsal file may provide additional clues.</p>
<p>In short the decennial census is a viable source for future research.  		The results of this pretest suggest some methods of refining the search to  		obtain valid results while containing some of the costs inherent in searching  		for a needle in a haystack.</p>

<p>FROM THE DIRECTORBUREAU OF THE CENSUS</p>
<p>The Bureau of the Census is conducting a survey for the  		Department of Health and Human Services. This survey will identify places where  		persons with physical or mental disabilities live and receive some kind of  		support services from someone not related to them. Your participation in this  		survey is critical to our success in understanding the role of these types of  		places in helping people.</p>
<p>Some of the support services provided may include:</p>
<ul><li>Helping people with personal grooming.</li>
<li>Taking them shopping or to the doctor's office.</li>
<li>Preparing meals and making beds for them.</li>
<li>Helping them manage their money.</li>
<li>Looking out for their general well-being.</li>
<li>Having a general idea of their whereabouts throughout the day.</li>
</ul><p>We have identified your address as a place where one or  		more of these important services may be provided. Please fill out this  		questionnaire as completely and accurately as you can. We estimate that it will  		take about 8 minutes to complete. Even if your residence does not fit the  		description above, we would like you to answer the first seven questions.</p>
<p>While your participation is voluntary, we would appreciate  		your returning this questionnaire within five days of receiving it. Please note  		that although your phone number is requested in this survey, the Census Bureau  		will use if only if it needs to contact you for futher clarification of the  		information you are providing. All information will be kept strictly  		confidential; the Census Bureau will use the data only for statistical  		purposes.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation in this important survey. We  		are very grateful for your help.</p>
<p>Sincerely,Barbara Everitt Bryant</p>

</tr></table><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>A field debriefing for supervisors and interviewers who worked on the  		Board and Care Survey Missouri Pretest was held in St. Louis on February 12.  		Participants included survey sponsors, Field Division headquarters staff, the  		survey supervisor, Supervisory Field Representatives (SFRs), and Field  		Representatives (FRs). The survey sponsors attending were Bill Downs and Mary  		Naifeh from Housing and Household Economic Statistics Division and Bob Clark  		from the Department of Health and Human Services. I represented Field Division  		headquarters staff and chaired the debriefing proceedings.</p>
<p>The debriefing's objective was to gain a better understanding of field  		operations for the Board and Care Survey Pretest. Field Rep comments and  		concerns are helpful in planning a potential national Board and Care Survey. We  		wanted to learn what worked well, what did not work well, and what improvements  		the survey supervisor, SFRs, and FRs would suggest regarding procedures,  		materials, and the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Before the afternoon debriefing, we spent the morning observing Board  		and Care Survey field interviews the survey supervisor had assigned each St.  		Louis FR. The field visit helped us to evaluate respondent reaction to the  		survey and to understand field problems.</p>
<h3>Survey Materials</h3>
<p>During the debriefing, FRs had few comments about the Field  		Representative's Self Study. They felt that the Self Study provided a good  		orientation for the survey. Several FRs suggested that we increase the time  		allotted to complete the Self Study from 3 hours to 4 hours.</p>
<p>FRs and SFRs had more comments on the Field Representative's Manual.  		Several thought that a glossary was necessary. For instance, the terms "private  		residence" and "group home" should be defined to help FRs, classify units whose  		status was unclear. Decennial-released FRs were inclined to use the census  		definition of group home which requires the presence of 10 or more unrelated  		people, but the Board and Care Survey sample includes group homes with fewer  		than 10 people.</p>
<p>FRs found that the Manual answered most of their questions. The sections  		which were used most frequently included those on telephone techniques, vacancy  		rules, and mover rules. FRs suggested expanding the section on mover rules to  		include more information regarding follow up on movers. The survey supervisor,  		Donna Edwards, suggested that the manual should include instructions on what to  		do if the address is different from the address reported in the 1988 Dress  		Rehearsal.</p>
<p>The 1988 Dress Rehearsal map-spotted ARA maps were generally adequate to  		locate rural addresses. FRs did not report any significant problems associated  		with locating addresses.</p>
<h3>The Questionnaire</h3>
<p>The survey supervisor, SFRs, and FRs made several recommendations  		concerning the Board and Care Survey questionnaire. FRs recommended combining  		items 2 and 3, which identify the respondent's eligibility to answer the survey  		and their status on April 1, 1988. FRs suggested moving item 4, which verifies  		the address, to the front page of the questionnaire so FRs could refer to the  		respondent's address easily without flipping the page.</p>
<p>Several FRs found the wording of item 7 awkward, and recommended  		rephrasing it by deleting the reference period. Apparently, referencing the  		last 3 years caused some respondents who had nonrelatives currently living with  		them to respond negatively which skipped them past the questions about support  		services and characteristics of dependent nonrelatives. One FR thought  		questions on support services and health problems should be screened according  		to the age of the dependent population. The questions were designed with an  		adult dependent population in mind, so some questions do not apply to children  		who are dependent nonrelatives.</p>
<p>FRs recommended emphasizing "dependent" when asking about providing  		support services to nonrelatives. Healthy nonrelatives living together wanted  		to answer "yes" to support services questions (that is, they help each other  		with preparing meals and housekeeping). FRs had to explain that to qualify, the  		nonrelative must be dependent upon the care giver for these services.</p>
<p>Item 10 asks whether the nonrelative receives Social Security or  		Veterans payments because of a disability. Often, the care giver does not know  		whether elderly nonrelatives are receiving Social Security primarily because of  		age or, because of a pre-existing medical condition.</p>
<p>The St. Louis SFR suggested accepting either a number or a percentage in  		response to item 11 which lists the number of nonrelatives by age category. She  		found that group home administrators are more likely to know the percentage of  		residents who fall into each age category rather than the exact number.</p>
<p>FRs thought that the 8-minute time estimate to complete an average  		interview was reasonably accurate. Interviews at sample units with no dependent  		nonrelatives required considerably less time, though. FRs cited a range of 42  		seconds to 2 hours to complete the interview.</p>
<h3>Survey Procedures and Materials</h3>
<p>FRs did not follow the suggested 3 callbacks for personal visit  		interviews. They found that limiting callbacks to just 3 did not allow them to  		get complete interviews in some instances. They recommended increasing the  		number of authorized callbacks.</p>
<p>FRs were asked whether adding flashcards would help them explain the  		definitions of support services, the types of disabilities that require  		custodial care, and the classifications of group homes. Most FRs did not  		recommend using flashcards since flashcards would simply be another item for  		which they would need to keep track.</p>
<p>A couple of FRs did recommend providing callback cards to help arrange  		appointments for return personal visits. Another FR recommended using "Type C"  		to remove certain units from the sample. For example, a number of sample  		addresses had been demolished since the Dress Rehearsal.</p>
<h3>Respondent Reaction</h3>
<p>FRs reported that respondents did not understand the survey, but were  		willing to tolerate an 8-minute interview since the FR was already there. Those  		respondents who reacted negatively considered the survey a waste of time and  		did not feel it pertained to them. Respondents had no specific reaction to the  		Letter from the Director -- most simply handed the letter back without reading  		it. In the sense of looking "official" though, the letter probably served a  		useful purpose.</p>
<p>Most FRs took very few proxy interviews. Some FRs guessed that only 1%  		of their interviews were by proxy. Proxies were limited to household members at  		private residences and to supervisory employees at group homes. FRs found that  		proxies were very knowledgeable. In fact, a couple of FRs suggested that group  		home administrators, bookkeepers, and head nurses who served as proxies were  		more knowledgeable than the proprietors and managers who are the preferred  		respondents.</p>
<p>Respondents needed explanations for some census concepts, such as  		"nonrelative" or "live here." This prompted FRs to question whether mail  		returns would be as accurate as personal visit and telephone interviews since  		mail return respondents had no one to explain census terms.</p>
<p>The St. Louis SFR said that during personal visit interviews she handed  		a blank questionnaire to the respondent so the respondent could follow along.  		This allowed the respondent to read definitions of support services which  		appear on the questionnaire and calmed respondent concerns about the nature of  		the interview.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Respondents generally were cooperative, although many did not understand  		the purpose of the survey. Respondents mentioned that they assumed since the  		survey was voluntary, they did not need to complete and return the  		questionnaire that they received in the mail.</p>
<p>FRs recommended a number of questionnaire changes which would help the  		interview go more smoothly, but they did not find the questionnaire especially  		difficult to use. FRs found that most of their cases ended in complete  		interviews.</p>
