<p>In this country, the public sector responsibility for long term care  		system development has rested almost entirely at the state level. While federal  		attention is now being given to proposed financing expansions, long term care  		has been a significant state policy and budget issue for decades. The  		state-administered Medicaid program has been the predominant source of third  		party long term care coverage; therefore, Medicaid's historic bias toward  		institutional care has significantly influenced the nature and scope of the  		entire long term care delivery system. </p>
<p>A growing number of states are developing more comprehensive long term  		care delivery systems that substantially improve the availability of home and  		community based services. However, state policymakers wishing to develop such  		systems are often apprehensive over the potential increase in recipients and  		costs. While demonstration project findings have often shown that such growth  		is a real possibility, surveys of older persons consistently confirm a strong  		preference to remain in their homes and community if at all possible. Faced  		with a growing elderly population in need of these services, the preference for  		community care, and often severely constrained state resources, state  		policymakers have frequently expressed the need for affordable strategies to  		develop and provide community care services. </p>
<p>This study was undertaken to address that state information need by  		analyzing and comparing the experience and delivery infrastructures in states  		that have implemented such statewide community care systems. The U.S.  		Department of Health and Human Services fortunately shared NGA's interest and  		provided funding for this project. An expert panel selected study states that  		have made better use of limited resources by integrating multiple long term  		care programs and services. </p>
<p>The text begins with an <a href="strfrm.htm#execsum">Executive Summary</a> and  		Policy Implications section which provides an overview of the most significant  		findings from the study. A descriptive analysis of each of the six states' long  		term care program infrastructures can be found in <a href="strfrm.htm#overview">Chapter  		II</a>. The remainder of the study presents comparative analysis of the study  		states' policies, organizational structures, and financing and delivery system  		characteristics. For readers interested in a quick initial review of the many  		subissues covered, we have <i>highlighted key observations</i> throughout the  		text. </p>
<p>The publication of this document is the culmination of an exhaustive  		effort by Diane Justice, who served as project director. The analysis reflects  		insights from well over 100 individuals who set policies for, manage, or  		analyze state community care systems. A wealth of information and experience is  		presented that we hope will be more broadly applied to better meet the needs of  		frail elderly persons. </p>

<p><i>State Long Term Care Reform</i> compares and analyzes the approaches  		undertaken by six states to make their systems more responsive to the needs of  		older people. The success of these initiatives are in large measure due to the  		professional expertise and personal dedication of a diverse group of state  		officials who are intent upon improving the lives of older people in need of  		long term care. We are deeply indebted to these individuals who willingly  		participated in time consuming interviews in order to share their insights with  		other states. They offered candid observations of both the strengths and  		weaknesses of their state's programs. Over 100 individuals were interviewed  		during the course of this project. </p>
<p>State officials who served as the primary state contacts for this  		project deserve special thanks. They not only provided extensive background  		information but also suggested key state policymakers who should be added to  		our interview schedule. In addition, they reviewed drafts of this report to  		ensure its accuracy. Their assistance was invaluable. They are Carol Rasco and  		Herb Sanderson (Arkansas), Jean Blaser (Illinois), Trish Riley (Maine), Donna  		Folkemer (Maryland), Dick Ladd (Oregon) and Tom Hamilton and Donna McDowell  		(Wisconsin). </p>
<p>The identification of policy issues that would be of greatest interest  		to other states was aided tremendously by the project advisory committee,  		composed primarily of state officials; the members are listed below. In  		addition their review of the interview questionnaire helped sharpen our  		inquiries and elicit more informative responses. </p>
<p>At various points during the project several individuals made unique  		contributions. As noted on the Title page, <a href="strfrm.htm#finance">Chapter VI</a>  		and <a href="strfrm.htm#appendI">Appendix I</a> and <a href="strfrm.htm#appendII">Appendix II</a>  		were separately authored by Lynn Etheredge, John Luehrs and Brian Burwell,  		respectively. Bonnie Preston conducted background research on the twelve state  		long term care systems reviewed in the early stages of this project and  		coordinated scheduling of the numerous interviews conducted during site visits  		to the study states. Throughout the duration of the study, John Luehrs  		generously provided substantive input, guidance on the administrative aspects  		of the project and unflagging support. Bob Applebaum drafted portions of the  		interview guide. Special appreciation goes to Janine Breyel, Marie Alcazar,  		Cindy Wellons and Jennifer Fohs for their tireless work in preparing this  		document for publication. Felicity Skidmore's extraordinary editing skills  		significantly improved the format and style of this manuscript. </p>
<p><a href="strfrm.htm#appendI">Appendix I</a> presents comprehensive, longitudinal  		data and information on state spending for long term care services for the  		elderly across all programs and funding sources. To our knowledge, this is the  		first time that such an effort has been made. Completing this task required  		substantial work by officials in each state to compile the data and respond to  		numerous questions from NGA staff. Our thanks to the following individuals and  		their staffs: Herb Sanderson (Arkansas), Jean Blaser (Illinois), Elaine Fuller  		(Maine), Lillian Moran (Maryland), Dick Ladd (Oregon) and Tom Hamilton  		(Wisconsin). </p>
<p>This project was made possible by funding from the Office of the  		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) granted through the  		Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). Glen Harelson of ASPE, who served  		as the project officer and Leslie Saber (HCFA) were particularly supportive.  		Their knowledge of long term care issues and experience with other research  		projects were very helpful. </p>
<p>The National Association of State Units on Aging (NASUA) and the  		National Governors' Association (NGA) provided substantial financial support  		for the staff time necessary to conduct this project. Special appreciation is  		extented to Dan Quirk, Executive Director of NASUA who willingly reorganized  		staff responsibilities to allow the project director time to conduct this  		reseach. </p>
<p>Rick Curtis, Director of Health Policy Studies, National Governors'  		Association, provided invaluable guidance on all aspects of this project. His  		understanding of how state government works, combined with his substantive  		knowledge of long term care issues contributed greatly to the quality of this  		report. His support, enthusiasm and patience made it possible to complete this  		study within the context of competing time demands on project staff. </p>

<p>The financing and delivery of long term care services for the elderly is  		one of the most pressing issues facing the states today. For the past two  		decades, state governments have made major commitments to expand these  		services. Those commitments are reflected in the expenditure of state matching  		funds to support services through Medicaid, in the establishment of long term  		care programs financed totally with state general revenues, and in the  		development of detailed policies governing the provision of long term care  		services. </p>
<p>Over the past several years, most states have been faced with severe  		fiscal constraints due to recession-induced revenue declines and reductions in  		federally supported domestic programs. At the same time, there has been  		significant growth in state Medicaid expenditures devoted to nursing home care.  		Long term care spending now accounts for almost half of all expenditures in  		Medicaid, which usually is the largest state-administered program in state  		budgets. These fiscal pressures are compounded by the dramatic rise in the  		number of persons over age seventy-five, the population group most likely to  		need long term care services. Since 1980 this group has grown three times as  		fast as the overall U.S. population. </p>
<p>Until recently long term care services for the elderly were considered  		synonymous with nursing home care. Public officials, physicians, insurers, and  		even the elderly shared this perception. Medicaid became, by default, the  		primary federal and state funding source for long term care services and  		practically the only source of third party payment. Regulations and limited  		community service options under that program reinforced the notion that older  		people needing long term care services by definition needed nursing home care.  		This resulted in an institution-based delivery system. </p>
<p>A policy revolution now is underway. When state debates focus on long  		term care system reform, discussions now are likely to highlight ways to expand  		the availability of community care services rather than emphasize only the  		detailed nuances of nursing home reimbursement. </p>
<p>Older people strongly prefer to receive long term care services in the  		community. To date, these strong preferences have been more frequently and  		forcefully articulated in state capitols than in Washington, D.C. The Medicare  		and Social Security programs have been the primary focus of elderly advocacy  		efforts in the nation's capitol; long term care has been the top priority  		advanced in state capitols. </p>
<p>Faced with the need for long term care services for a growing elderly  		population, the preference for community based care, and constrained state  		resources, many states are seeking more affordable strategies for restructuring  		long term care financing and delivery systems. There is a sense total long term  		care costs for the elderly are destined to rise if for no other reason than the  		rapid growth of this population. Therefore, state policymakers are attempting  		to channel the growth in expenditures to services provided in the community, as  		the elderly prefer, instead of to continued expansion of nursing home beds.  		</p>
<p>Important lessons can be learned from those states which have been  		particularly successful in developing new systems of care. Their experiences  		certainly are relevant for other states designing similar community care  		systems. Private insurers also can benefit from state successes in managing  		total costs while responding to the preferences of older people for care  		provided in their homes. Federal policymakers, facing increased demands for a  		national long term care strategy, may find that the structure and operation of  		large statewide systems provide more pertinent insights than the experiences of  		individual community projects. </p>
<p>The NGA study provides an in-depth comparative analysis of six states'  		approaches to long term care system reform. Arkansas, Illinois, Maine,  		Maryland, Oregon, and Wisconsin were chosen for analysis because of their  		successful experiences in integrating multiple long term care financing and  		delivery systems. The study was not designed to formally evaluate these state  		systems; instead their characteristics were analyzed and compared to identify  		for other states a broad range of policy options which already have been  		tested. The study's findings are presented to highlight the range of decisions  		states must make in designing new approaches. Individual states can combine  		various system components to reflect their unique demographic, administrative,  		and political environments. </p>
<h3>Major Features of State LTC Systems</h3>
<p>Community care systems for the elderly are not developed in a vacuum,  		but are designed within the context of human services delivery systems  		developed to address other concerns. In designing new long term care systems,  		states must integrate existing services for the aged, including social services  		and health. They cannot start from scratch. In order to overcome the  		fragmentation of existing service programs and make better use of the new  		resources being allocated to long term care, states are reorganizing the  		administrative responsibilities of state and local agencies. </p>
<p><b>STATE AGENCY ADMINISTRATION</b>. Three basic models of state agency  		structures have emerged to manage long term care systems. One consolidates all  		long term care responsibilities covering both institutional and community based  		care into a single, sole-purpose agency; this involves major reorganization of  		state government. The Oregon Senior Services Division manages Medicaid payments  		to nursing homes, Medicaid home and community based services waivers, the Older  		Americans Act, and state general revenue funds devoted to community care for  		the elderly. Interestingly, of the six study states, Oregon also has by far the  		largest proportion (30.1 percent) of its long term care budget going to  		community care services. Under this organizational model, all long term care  		expenditures for the elderly are consolidated into one budget, which makes  		resource allocations between community based care and institutional care a  		direct and visible trade-off. </p>
<p>A less radical model uses a human services umbrella agency structure,  		with some internal shifting of responsibilities and increased interdivision  		coordination. Arkansas, Maine, and Wisconsin use this model. </p>
<p>The third model retains independent, cabinet-level agencies for managing  		various programs, but establishes an official interagency long term care  		committee to at least keep agencies informed of each other's activities and,  		preferably, to coordinate the development of interagency policies as well.  		Illinois and Maryland use this model. </p>
<p>In all three models, the state office on aging and the Medicaid agency  		usually have been assigned primary responsibility for long term care program  		management. Given their respective traditional approaches, compromises are  		required. Aging agencies have been forced to accept some of the rigidities of  		the Medicaid program to have access to its funds. Medicaid agencies have had to  		adjust to programs which are much less standardized than hospital and nursing  		home care. </p>
<p>The organizational challenge to state governments is to integrate the  		resource allocation and policy development activities of the various state  		offices responsible for some aspect of long term care so that a coordinated  		system of care can be developed, rather than one reflecting a diffuse  		constellation of individual programs. Regardless of the organizational  		approaches adopted, the issues which must be examined across various programs  		are the same. They include: designing a single delivery system supported by  		multiple funding sources; developing eligibility criteria for individual  		programs to ensure equitable treatment of persons with similar needs and  		resources; and examining the mix of community care services supported by each  		funding stream. Ultimately, the goal of these coordinated efforts is to create  		the continuum of care which each individual program rhetorically has embraced  		but cannot by itself achieve. </p>
<p><b>LONG TERM CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS</b>. How programs are organized at  		the local level is even more important than how state responsibilities are  		organized. Older people come in direct contact with local agencies and their  		differing eligibility criteria, service packages, and funding sources. If state  		policies are successful, the elderly will have access to appropriate care  		without having to contact multiple agencies to receive services for which they  		are eligible. Therefore, most of the study states have designated a single  		local agency in each part of the state to serve as the client access point for  		receipt of all publicly financed community care programs. Centralizing entry  		helps make the system less fragmented from the perspective of older people in  		need of assistance, while helping states gain better control of total program  		costs. Client assessments, pre-admission screening programs, and case  		management are the key components of access systems for community based care  		programs. Each are present in the six study states. </p>
<p><i>Client assessments</i> for community based care focus on an older  		person's ability to conduct activities of daily living. The results are used by  		case managers to initially determine if an individual is sufficiently impaired  		to qualify for long term care programs. Most of the six states' long term care  		programs provide services only to those older persons who have impairment  		levels equivalent to those required for nursing home care. </p>
<p>The scope of <i>pre-admission screening programs</i> in the six study  		states varies substantially. One key difference is the target population group  		which must be screened--specifically, whether required participation is limited  		to Medicaid-eligible nursing home applicants or whether a broader group is  		included, such as persons who are expected to become eligible for Medicaid  		within a certain time frame after nursing home placement. Another difference is  		whether the screening process results in a binding decision on placement or is  		merely advisory. State officials note that since most older people prefer to  		stay in the community, simply having a process to discuss community care  		options helps limit nursing home entry even if it only results in an advisory  		recommendation. And, locating the screening programs in the same local agency  		which serves as the entry point for community care services increases the  		potential that clients will receive advice on all the alternatives. </p>
<p><i>Case management</i> functions are central to the entire community  		care system, especially when multiple funding sources with differing  		eligibility criteria and service providers are involved. As a result, state  		policies on the designation of case management agencies are among the most  		hotly debated long term care issues. Arkansas, Maine, and Oregon have selected  		area agencies on aging, while Wisconsin and Maryland have designated county  		social services departments. Illinois uses local agencies chosen on a  		competitive basis. </p>
<p>Specific functions assigned by the six states to case management  		agencies vary. However, general areas of responsibility include developing cost  		effective individual care plans, authorizing needed services, and following up  		to ensure needed services actually are provided. Most importantly, case  		management and assessment agencies are the only client access point for receipt  		of services financed through the major community care programs in the study  		states. States have limited the resources which case managers can spend for  		program participants; this limit either is applied to each client's care plan  		or is averaged over the case management agency's entire caseload. Usually the  		limit is tied to the cost of nursing home care. </p>
<p>The scope of services brokered through case management are fairly  		similar in the various states' long term care systems. The most commonly  		provided services are personal care, homemaker, and chore services. The  		assistance provided often includes light housekeeping, meal preparation, and  		assistance with dressing, bathing, and other aspects of personal care. By  		specific design, the states' policies allow substantial flexibility in the  		types of services which can be supported with public funds, consistent with the  		philosophy of tailoring programs to individual needs. </p>
<p><b>FINANCING OPTIONS</b>. The six study states each use a combination of  		funding sources to support community care systems, even though it would be much  		easier to use only one funding stream and thereby avoid the multiple of rules  		and restrictions accompanying each individual program. Due to these  		restrictions, particularly those associated with Medicaid, however, no single  		source is flexible or large enough to support a comprehensive long term care  		system. The three major financing sources are state general revenues, Medicaid  		home and community based services waivers, and the Medicaid optional state plan  		services of personal care services and adult day care. Each of the study states  		uses one of these as its primary funding vehicle supplemented by one or more of  		the other funding sources, along with smaller amounts of the Older Americans  		Act and the Social Services Block Grant. Wisconsin, Illinois, and Maryland  		primarily use state funds. Oregon relies chiefly on the Medicaid home and  		community based services waiver authority to support most long term care  		services. Arkansas finances its community care system by exercising the option  		to cover personal care services under the Medicaid state plan. Maine uses a  		combination of all major funding sources. </p>
<p>Each of these financing sources has advantages and disadvantages. State  		general revenues offer maximum flexibility in designing community based care  		systems. The obvious disadvantage is the lack of federal financial  		participation. All of the study states use state general revenues to some  		extent, either as the primary vehicle or as a supplement to expand the scope of  		available services, or to partially or fully subsidize care for persons who are  		not financially eligible for Medicaid. </p>
<p>The Medicaid home and community based services waiver, established as  		part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, can provide a broad  		range of non-medical long term care services. Four of the study states make  		some use of the waiver authority for providing services to the elderly, with  		Oregon using the authority most extensively. This state was the first in the  		country to be granted such a Medicaid waiver, and as a result, its program is  		substantially larger than most waivers approved in subsequent years. Waiver  		programs are viewed as a mixed blessing by the study states. The federal  		financial participation in community care programs is very appealing. Yet,  		state officials cite changing federal interpretations of program rules,  		stringent ceilings placed on the number of persons who can be served, and  		excessive administrative costs as factors limiting the usefulness of this  		financing source. </p>
<p>Section 4102 of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987 provides states  		with a second home and community based services waiver option that will address  		some of these problems. States using this new option will be able to increase  		the number of persons served and expenditures for Medicaid waiver services as  		long as total Medicaid long term care spending (including nursing home outlays)  		for the elderly does not increase more than a specified percentage above  		outlays for the base year. The percentage growth limit until October 1, 1989 is  		7 percent per year.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup>  		After this date, the rate of increase is the greater of 7 percent or a formula  		to be developed measuring: the state's age seventy-five and older population  		growth, plus appropriate indices of goods and services costs facing long term  		care providers, plus a 2 percent intensity factor. This new option may be a way  		for those states with adequate base-year Medicaid outlays for total long term  		care to meet the needs of a growing population by substantially expanding  		community care while restraining the growth of institutional services. In March  		1988, Oregon submitted the first application for a waiver under this new  		authority. </p>
<p>Exercising the option to cover personal care and adult day care services  		under the Medicaid state plan is the third major option for financing state  		community based care initiatives. In contrast to waiver services, no  		extraordinary administrative requirements are imposed and no ceilings are  		placed on the number of persons who can receive services. However, since  		services are provided under the Medicaid state plan, states cannot limit this  		service to just the elderly long term care population, limit availability to  		one geographic area, or increase income eligibility thresholds to make them  		more comparable to nursing home eligibility levels. </p>
<h3>Policy Implications</h3>
<p>The experiences of the six study states in designing large statewide  		community care programs have implications for policy development in other  		states, for the expansion of federal support for community based care systems,  		and for private insurers responding to the long term care needs of a rapidly  		expanding older market. Several observations are relevant for all three  		audiences. </p>
<p>First, all six states have expanded community based care services  		without generating runaway costs in total long term care spending. While total  		costs have risen over a five-year period, the increases are modest, averaging  		6.2 percent annually per person age seventy-five and older. (See  		<a href="strfrm.htm#appendI">Appendix I</a>, which analyzes long term care expenditure  		growth in each of the six states.) Fears over uncontrollable costs and  		increases in service utilization have led states, the federal government, and  		private insurers to approach expansion of community based care services with  		great caution. The experiences of the study states indicate that, even when  		community care services are a benefit under a public entitlement program,  		overall costs can be contained. Several factors help make community care  		programs affordable. limiting program eligibility to persons who have multiple  		limitations in conducting activities of daily living, using a managed care  		approach to authorize the amount and scope of services needed by individuals,  		and establishing cost sharing provisions for moderate-income persons all help  		keep program costs manageable. </p>
<p>Second, the six states have shown that some aspects of community care  		systems can be tightly structured and uniform statewide without compromising  		their ability to flexibly respond to individual service needs. Uniform  		assessment tools, explicit financial eligibility criteria, and system entry  		channeled through case management agencies have all made access to community  		care more predictable from a client's perspective and more standardized as  		viewed by program administrators. Yet, the actual services provided often are  		very loosely defined, giving local program managers considerable latitude in  		tailoring service packages to individual needs. </p>
<p>Third, non-medical supportive services form the core of state long term  		care programs. State officials note that although some limited skilled home  		nursing care may at times be provided, community based long term care services  		usually are needed by older people in response to limitations in functional  		capacity as opposed to specific medical conditions. The services needed most  		often are non-medical, in-home supports such as homemaker and personal care.  		Since federal and state officials and private insurers are much more familiar  		with skilled home health services than with these other services, there may be  		a tendency to structure supportive services in a medical context. Officials in  		the six study states believe that would be a mistake. </p>
<p>Some study findings are particularly relevant for other states. The  		experiences of the six states indicate that some state general revenues are  		essential for developing a community care system which meets the needs of low-  		and moderate-income persons. Despite exemplary state efforts to improve  		coordination and to strengthen management control and allocate resources  		wisely, rules tied to each federal funding source limit the categories of  		persons who can be served and the scope of services which can be funded. </p>
<p>Second, containing the growth of Medicaid nursing home expenditures was  		an explicit component of state strategies to expand community care in four of  		the six study states. In each case, certificate of need policy was used to  		limit the number of new beds constructed. State officials found the notion of  		"reinvesting" into community based care the savings resulting from a freeze on  		bed expansion to be a useful concept. This policy not only articulates the end  		goal of long term care system reform, but also actually reduces the rate of  		growth in Medicaid nursing home expenditures. Curtailing future institutional  		expenditures will free state resources to expand community based care. </p>
<p>Third, each of the six states developed their systems incrementally.  		Three of them (Maryland, Wisconsin, and Oregon) phased in statewide  		implementation of long term care initiatives by geographic area. All added  		various program components over a period of several years. For example,  		pre-admission screening programs often were added after the supply of community  		care services was expanded, enabling screening program staff to offer persons  		seeking nursing home placement some viable community service options. However,  		since the various components of community care systems all interrelate,  		undertaking a comprehensive planning process before major new initiatives are  		underway makes it easier to add new elements in the future. </p>
<p>The study states found that a broad planning effort achieves other  		objectives. It helps get multiple agencies and organizations committed to the  		success of long term care initiatives and fosters consensus on policy goals and  		objectives. This lays a positive framework for resolving more difficult  		operational conflicts in the future. Membership organizations of older people  		often were active participants in state planning processes. Generally they did  		not press for overly ambitions proposals but rather understood state fiscal  		limits and worked within them. A consistent concern of these groups in all  		states but Wisconsin was designing a system which was not identified as being  		part of the "welfare system." This orientation affected their preferences for  		the selection of lead management agencies at the state and local level, but did  		not preclude support for client cost sharing policies and other mechanisms to  		maximize allocation of available state resources to persons with the least  		ability to pay. </p>
<p>Other study findings are especially pertinent for the development of  		federal financing policies for community based long term care. First, one of  		the most difficult tasks faced by the six study states was linking together  		separate systems for social services, aging programs, and health care delivery.  		Decisions had to be made concerning the best local agencies to perform case  		management, assessment, and direct service delivery. In addition, states had to  		decide how to expand the capacity of the delivery system to provide an  		increased supply of services. Sometimes new provider agencies were created,  		other times new types of services were developed which previously were not  		available, and frequently existing agencies took on new responsibilities. State  		activities to build the capacity of local delivery systems necessarily varied  		with state circumstances. If federal long term care initiatives are to relate  		to existing state human services delivery systems, states are in a unique  		position to design approaches that will best build upon the existing  		infrastructure. </p>
<p>Second, where possible the six study states preferred to hold local long  		term care systems accountable for end results rather than trying to control  		every detail of local administration. This approach recognizes differences  		among communities in local practices and traditions and avoids emphasizing  		process requirements. As more states adopt new community care programs,  		diversity among states will increase. This model of accountability used by the  		study states will be appropriate for federal/state relationships in any new  		federal community care initiative. </p>
<p>Finally, the six study states have demonstrated to private insurers and  		other public payers that it is feasible to provide multiple community care  		services (not traditionally covered by health insurance) if there is a  		systematic process for assessing client needs, authorizing a package of  		services, and coordinating multiple providers. Case management systems can  		perform such functions and allow private or social insurance plans to expand  		the services covered under long term care policies to include various social  		supports which are more affordable than medical services traditionally covered  		by insurance policies. Insurers have been reluctant to offer these services,  		which typically have low unit costs, in part because they view the  		administrative costs to be disproportionately high. In addition, insurers are  		concerned about uncontrollably high utilization rates since they expect older  		people to actively seek these services while going to great lengths to avoid  		nursing home placement. The six study states had similar concerns when their  		programs began but found that improved assessment techniques can effectively  		limit the eligible population and that case management structures can allocate  		services to individual clients within overall budget limits. </p>
<h2><a name="design" id="design">I. STUDY DESIGN</a></h2>
<h3>Major Areas of Inquiry</h3>
<p>Important lessons can be learned from states that have made significant  		progress in developing more balanced systems of care. The purpose of this study  		is to provide an in-depth analysis of the approaches to long term care system  		reform adopted by six such states in order to assist other states in developing  		similar systems. The study focuses primarily on how states have integrated  		multiple resources and consolidated policy and management control of long term  		care services at the state and local levels. Since no single state or federal  		funding source is sufficiently flexible or large enough to support a  		comprehensive long term care system, states use a patchwork of multiple  		programs, allocating resources to community care from several funding streams.  		Each of these programs have their own rules, are frequently administered by  		different agencies in state government, and may use separate local delivery  		systems. This study explores how six states have coordinated these federal and  		state programs to maximize available resources while creating a more rational  		system of care from the perspective of elderly consumers. </p>
<p>Arkansas, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Oregon and Wisconsin were chosen  		for in-depth analysis because of their successful experiences in integrating  		multiple long term care financing and delivery systems. As the first step in  		selecting the study states, documents from twenty-one states describing the  		programmatic and financing features of their long term care systems were  		reviewed by project staff. Each of these states were measured against the  		criteria for inclusion in the study established under the grant which supported  		this research from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The  		criteria were three: each potential study state was required to have a  		statewide community care system for the elderly, multiple funding sources  		devoted to community based care, and state level organizational structures for  		consolidating long term care management responsibilities. While an increasing  		number of states have established statewide community care programs, the three  		selection criteria together were present only in twelve states. Those states  		included the six study states plus Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota,  		South Carolina and Texas. </p>
<p>Project staff prepared a report on the organizational structures and  		financing mechanisms used by the twelve states for managing state long term  		care delivery systems. A panel of state and federal officials and researchers  		convened by HHS used this background information to select the states to be  		included in the comparative analysis. Since all twelve states met the basic  		criteria for inclusion, the panel's primary concern was to select a mix of  		states representing a diverse set of characteristics. Of particular interest  		was selecting a combination of states with differences in state level  		organizational structures, local delivery systems, financing mechanisms,  		geographic location and population size. </p>
<p>In addition to collecting written information on each of the six states'  		systems, project staff conducted week-long site visits to each of the study  		states. A structured information collection guide was used to conduct  		approximately 20 interviews in each state, with a wide range of individuals  		involved in the development of state long term care policy. Key executive  		branch respondents in each state included a member of the Governor's staff, the  		directors of the state aging and Medicaid offices, staff responsible for health  		planning and the Social Services Block Grant, and an official of the state  		budget office. Other key contacts included state legislators, local level  		program managers, advocacy organizations of older people and state associations  		of nursing home providers and home health agencies. Substantial amounts of time  		were spent with middle management state staff who have primary responsibility  		for long term care programs. </p>
<p>Reviewing written materials was the primary vehicle for collecting  		factual program information; interviews were used to solicit the perspectives  		of key contacts on why certain strategies were chosen, the major implementation  		problems faced, and an assessment of both the successes and shortcomings of  		state policies. Given the diverse group of individuals interviewed within each  		state, the level of consensus on key points was remarkable. State officials  		also provided candid assessments of their systems' limitations, reflecting in  		part the continual process of long term care system reform. </p>
<h3>Related Research</h3>
<p>Federally supported research and demonstration projects conducted over  		the past decade have made significant contributions to the knowledge base  		needed to establish community care systems. Many of these projects have been  		undertaken in partnership with state governments through experimentation with  		Medicaid policy changes. Such efforts -- conducted in the late 1970s and early  		1980s in limited geographic areas of New York, Georgia, South Carolina,  		Connecticut, California and Oregon -- identified improved ways of organizing  		and managing community care services as alternatives to institutional care.  		</p>
<p>The largest research effort undertaken in this area was the National  		Long Term Care Channeling Demonstration, begun in 1980 and completed in 1986.  		The demonstration states applied for and won contracts from the U.S. Department  		of Health and Human Services to conduct demonstrations in designated local  		sites to test the effects of using case management systems to improve the  		provision of community care services. States participating in the research  		include Florida, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New  		York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. The final report on the Channeling  		Demonstration reports notes "the channeling evidence indicates that expansion  		of case management and community services beyond what already exists does not  		lead to overall cost savings. But it does yield benefits in the form of  		increased in-home care, reduced unmet need, and improved satisfaction with life  		for clients and the informal caregivers who bear most of the care burden.  		Whether these benefits are commensurate with its costs is a decision for  		society to make."<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the awards made to the 10 states for multi-year  		channeling demonstration projects, 15 other states received one-year systems  		development grants to formulate state strategies for improving the coordination  		and management of long term care services. States receiving these federal  		grants include Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia,  		Idaho, Illinois, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode  		Island, South Dakota, Washington and Wisconsin. These grants were awarded  		through a competitive process at the same time that the other 10 states were  		selected for channeling demonstrations. These grants helped to further support  		existing state interests in improving the delivery of long term care services.  		</p>
<p>Knowledge about long term care continues to grow as research produces  		new findings. To date, most long term care research has focused on program  		design and implementation within individual communities; minimal attention has  		been given to research on statewide programs. This void has left states with  		limited experience to draw upon in developing complex large scale systems.  		Certainly the results of long term care research based on individual community  		programs can give states guidance in designing components of statewide systems  		such as individual client assessments and case management functions. However,  		more than just structuring individual program components, states must consider  		how to combine these components to foster community care systems that can fit  		diverse local delivery systems. Often states face the trade off between the  		desirability of flexible programs with significant local discretion in  		implementation and the need for tightly managed cost effective systems. This  		study analyzes the approaches used by six states in addressing this dilemma.  		</p>
<h2><a name="overview" id="overview">II. OVERVIEW OF SIX STATES APPROACHES TO LONG TERM  		CARE</a></h2>
<p>The approaches to long term care system reform in the six states  		included in this overview share the same fundamental goal: to create a more  		rational allocation of public resources between community based and  		institutional care. They share other similarities as well. They have all  		developed managed systems of care which coordinate services needed by frail  		older people through a central access point. They have all used state funds to  		greatly expand the scope of available community based services to meet these  		needs. And regardless of their current program structure, they have all built  		their systems incrementally, on foundations laid in the late 1970s. </p>
<p>There are also significant differences, however. In some states, for  		example, nursing home capacity controls are integral components of larger  		strategies for increasing community care options. In other states, growth in  		nursing home expenditures has never been considered a deterrent to the  		expansion of home and community based services. Some states have targeted  		assistance primarily to Medicaid eligible individuals. Other states have  		subsidized care for moderate income older people as well. </p>
<p>This chapter reviews the evolution of each state's long term care  		initiatives, beginning with a brief summary of the long term care system  		currently in place and highlighting major milestones. These experiences make it  		clear that lasting change does not come easily or quickly. </p>
<h3>Arkansas</h3>
<p><i>Personal care services financed through the state's Medicaid program  		constitute the core of Arkansas' community based long term care system. By  		exercising the option to cover personal care services under the authority of  		the Medicaid state plan, Arkansas has not needed a Home and Community Based  		Services waiver to expand in-home services for the elderly. In fiscal year  		1986, $10 million in Medicaid funds were spent in Arkansas for this purpose.  		</i></p>
<p>Medicaid state plan services are augmented by the state-funded  		Supplemental Personal Care Program, serving lower-income older people whose  		incomes are higher than the Medicaid eligibility ceiling but below 125 percent  		of poverty. State funds also finance the Alternative Care Program, which  		supports a variety of services such as day care, chore and respite services,  		informal caregiver training and support groups. In addition, the Social  		Services Block Grant and the Older Americans Act both fund some community care  		services. </p>
<p>Under contract with the state Department of Human Services, locally  		based Client Assessment Teams conduct functional assessments of all clients  		seeking Medicaid personal care services, authorize the amount of care to be  		paid by Medicaid, and refer clients to personal care providers. In one quarter  		of the state, these Client Assessment Teams also conduct pre-admission  		screening for Medicaid clients seeking nursing home care. In the rest of the  		state, determination of need for Medicaid funded nursing home care is performed  		at the state level through a paper review of client information. Local offices  		of the Department of Human Services determine whether a client meets the  		financial eligibility criteria for Medicaid. </p>
<p><i>Within state government, administrative responsibility for community  		based care programs is shared by two components of the Department of Human  		Services -- the Division of Aging and Adult Services and the Division of  		Economic and Medical Services. In most parts of the state, area agencies on  		aging actually provide the personal care services. In two areas of the state,  		however, these agencies are precluded from direct service delivery because they  		have statewide responsibility for the Client Assessment Teams and would face  		potential conflicts on interest. A community action agency and a local health  		department provide personal care services in those two regions.  		<a href="strfrm.htm#figureII-1">Figure II-1</a> depicts the organization of community  		care programs in Arkansas. </i></p>

</tr></table><p><b>DEVELOPMENT OF STATE POLICY INITIATIVES</b>. Arkansas' initial  		efforts to establish community based care can be traced back to 1977, when an  		area agency on aging in one region of the state initiated a small demonstration  		project providing in-home services to persons at risk of entering a nursing  		home. This effort was funded in part by state funds and in part through the  		Older Americans Act. The following year, with a $110,000 grant from the  		Administration on Aging, a case management system was implemented to better  		coordinate the provision of in-home services. </p>
<p>Since funding for this initiative was only temporary, state officials  		and project staff focused on securing more permanent financing. An agreement  		was developed among the state Medicaid division, the state aging division and  		the area agencies on aging to amend the Medicaid state plan to include personal  		care as a covered service. With little fanfare or debate the legislature  		approved a proposal to allow state funds which previously had been spent for  		in-home services to match Medicaid expenditures for personal care. Area  		agencies on aging became the only certified providers of personal care  		services, with the state office on aging playing a major role in establishing  		service standards and operating procedures. </p>
<p>Three years later, in 1982, the legislature passed a bill which  		reflected support for further development of community based care as well as  		concern about accessibility and coordination of existing services. The  		legislation mandated the various divisions and agencies involved in long term  		care to establish assessment agencies on a demonstration basis in limited parts  		of the state to test procedures for conducting client assessments and making  		referrals to appropriate care providers. </p>
<p>The executive branch's response was the creation of two pilot Client  		Assessment Teams (CAT) to conduct individual client functional assessments in  		one quarter of the state. The CAT teams also served as the state's agent in  		authorizing the provision of Medicaid funded long term care services --  		including personal care, home health and nursing home care -- in those regions.  		Area agencies on aging were selected in each of the two regions to carry out  		the CAT functions; a local health department and a community action agency  		became personal care providers in those regions since the CAT agencies were  		precluded from direct service delivery. </p>
<p>The expansion of community care stimulated policymakers to undertake an  		intense examination of Medicaid institutional expenditures, particularly as  		they related to the supply of nursing home beds. In 1983 a two-year moratorium  		was placed on nursing home construction, during which the State Health  		Coordinating Council conducted an in-depth review of the existing criteria used  		for certificates of need and developed a long term care need methodology.  		Working through a study committee comprising representatives of other state  		agencies, consumers and providers, the council applied the new methodology to  		an examination of the supply of nursing homes, board and care facilities and  		in-home services. The resulting projections called for major increases in  		personal care and board and care facilities with very minimal, selective  		additions to the nursing home bed supply. Since that time there have been no  		certificates of need approved for nursing home construction. </p>
<p>To bring about an increased supply of personal care, one of the major  		recommendations of this study committee was that the availability of personal  		care services be expanded beyond the Medicaid-eligible population and that  		other types of services be developed. In his 1985 legislative budget request,  		Governor Clinton proposed and received funding for a new two-part program. The  		first part is the Supplemental Personal Care Program which, as noted, serves  		older people whose incomes are higher than the Medicaid eligibility ceiling but  		below 125 percent of poverty. The second component is the Alternative Care  		Program which funds one Community Based Care Developer in each area agency to  		identify unmet needs and develop new services to meet those needs. The  		Alternative Care Program also supports a variety of activities and services for  		family caregivers. </p>
<p>With the advent of these two programs and the growth of the Medicaid  		personal care program, the state Department of Human Services decided to gain  		more control over the authorization process for personal care services. The  		Client Assessment Teams which covered two regions of the state were expanded to  		have statewide responsibility for conducting client assessments to determine  		eligibility for personal care and home health. Nursing home pre-admission  		screening was not expanded beyond the pilot two regions. </p>
<p><b>FACTORS SHAPING ARKANSAS' APPROACH</b>. Arkansas has one of the  		oldest populations in the country, ranking third in the nation in the  		percentage of its population age 65 and over. It also has one of the highest  		poverty rates in the country; in 1980, 55 percent of Arkansas' population age  		75+ living alone had incomes below the poverty level. This combination makes  		the use of Medicaid to fund community care services a very viable approach for  		Arkansas. Despite stringent Medicaid eligibility criteria (federal SSI income  		and asset standards, no medically needy program) the high poverty rate results  		in many older people qualifying for care under Medicaid. And the low per capita  		income level results in a very favorable ratio of federal financial  		participation (75 percent). </p>
<p>The possibility of using Medicaid waivers has been consistently rejected  		as a funding alternative in Arkansas. The high investment of state staff time  		required and the multitude of federal policy constraints are frequently cited  		as reasons for this decision. </p>
<p>There is no single major initiative or event which dramatically shaped  		the service delivery system in Arkansas. The milestones are subtle, building  		gradually and steadily on current or previous activity. State officials note  		that this incremental approach is a major factor in their state's success. With  		no dramatic new initiatives there have also been no major system upsets. </p>
<p>Several factors help to explain the gradual nature of Arkansas' system  		development. First, until 1986 the Governor was elected to only a two-year  		term. The shortness of the term had two disadvantages. It allowed minimal time  		to accomplish any major initiative. It also led to instability in the state's  		leadership -- when the Governor changes, so do most of the top level management  		staff in state agencies. Nonetheless, the strong support for community care by  		Governor Clinton and, in the early years, Governor Pryor, is frequently cited  		as one reason for the program's success. The second factor restricting rapid  		policy change is the particularly difficult state fiscal climate, although  		fiscal stringency has not prevented the Governor from proposing and the  		legislature from approving a commitment of new state funds for services  		provided to low income older people above the Medicaid eligibility limit. The  		third factor contributing to the incremental growth of home care services is  		the political strength of the nursing home industry. This is cited repeatedly  		by state officials and advocacy groups as a deterrent to more dramatic program  		expansion. Recognition of the industry's power, in fact, is one of the major  		reasons that the pre-admission screening functions of the client assessment  		teams were not extended statewide along with personal care authorizations. </p>
<p>The American Association of Retired Persons and the area agencies on  		aging are the primary advocate groups pushing for an expansion of community  		care services. In fact they share an office in Little Rock during the  		legislative session. There is a strong perception of legislative support for  		home care. But the nursing home lobby is stronger than the community care  		lobby. This seems to be because the nursing industry has a clear sense of what  		they want, whereas there is still an experimental aura about home care, with  		uncertainty about where the system is headed. </p>
<p>State officials share these concerns and frequently mention that no  		interagency long range planning effort has yet been undertaken. A major goal of  		these officials is to enhance their policy analysis and planning capacity over  		the next several years. </p>
<h3>Illinois</h3>
<p><i>The major components of Illinois' community long term care system are  		under the umbrella of the state's large Community Care Program (CCP). In  		response to a class action suit brought against the Department on Aging in  		1982, the CCP functions as an entitlement program with a budget of $72 million  		in FY 1986. Although most of the funding for this program is from state  		sources, about 30 percent of the total budget reflects payment for services to  		clients financially eligible for Medicaid waiver services. </i></p>
<p>All program participants must be assessed as meeting the functional and  		medical criteria for nursing home admission. Non-Medicaid clients must have  		less than $10,000 in liquid assets in order to be eligible. And a client  		co-payment is required which is set according to an individual's income and  		level of service needed. </p>
<p>CCP provides three direct services -- adult day care, homemaker and  		chore services. In addition it pays for assessments, care planning and ongoing  		case management. </p>
<p><i>As in most of its other human services programs, Illinois uses a  		state centralized form of administration with state government contracting  		directly with providers. State administrative responsibility for the program  		belongs to the Department on Aging. The Department of Rehabilitation is  		responsible for a similar program for the physically disabled. Both agencies  		work with the Department of Public Aid in developing program rules which meet  		Medicaid requirements in order to receive some federal funds to support  		community programs. </i></p>
<p>All assessment and case management functions are performed by Community  		Care Units (CCUs) under contract with the Department on Aging. They are  		prohibited from direct delivery of CCP services. About one third of the 63 CCUs  		are home health agencies; another third are senior service agencies; the  		remaining third are a mix of other agency types, mainly family social service  		agencies, health clinics, and mental health centers. In addition to assessing  		client for functional levels in determining eligibility for community care, the  		CCUs also conduct pre-admission screening for nursing home care. Medicaid  		clients and persons expected to be eligible for Medicaid within 60 days of  		nursing home entry are required to participate. Financial eligibility for  		Medicaid is determined by local offices of the state Department of Public Aid.  		The CCUs also use Older Americans Act funds to do assessments and care plans  		for persons who do not meet the CCP eligibility criteria. </p>
<p>Until 1986, service providers were chosen by a competitive bid process  		focusing on price. They are now chosen on the basis of quality and paid a fixed  		rate for each service. Illinois' 13 area agencies on aging provide  		administrative support to CCP. Under contract with the Department on Aging,  		area agencies help CCUs resolve billing problems and develop new services not  		covered by the CCP. <a href="strfrm.htm#figureII-2">Figure II-2</a> depicts the  		organization of community care programs in Illinois. </p>

</tr></table><p><b>DEVELOPMENT OF STATE POLICY INITIATIVES</b>. Illinois' state funded  		Community Care Program (CCP) was first established in 1978 as an income tested  		program and placed in the Department of Public Aid. The in-home services  		program was transferred to the Department on Aging the following year, however,  		in response to aging advocacy group objections that the program as currently  		administered carried a welfare stigma. The income eligibility criteria were  		also eliminated. The Department allocated the funds through a state formula to  		the area agencies on aging, who performed case management and then awarded  		funds to local service providers. </p>
<p>After one year of operation under the Department on Aging, the decision  		was made to centralize program administration and allocation of funds to area  		agencies on aging was discontinued. Also eliminated were the case management  		functions performed by area agencies. Instead the state contracted directly  		with service providers who also were responsible for client assessment and case  		management. Despite the apparent conflict in combining service authorization  		with service provision, the care plans were in fact low-cost ones, due to the  		tremendous pressure from the community to stretch the funds over large numbers  		of clients. Even with low-cost plans, in a short period of time the program had  		a full enrollment and providers had extensive lists of persons waiting to  		receive services. Those on the waiting lists, of course, could only receive  		program services through natural attrition of program clients. </p>
<p>In 1982 a class action suit was filed on behalf of clients who had been  		placed on waiting lists. This court case is the key factor shaping Illinois'  		current community care policy. The suit argued that those who had applied later  		for services were being discriminated against. Negotiations with the plaintiff  		attorney resulted in a court decree which eliminated waiting lists, in effect  		making the CCP an entitlement program. The decree also required the Department  		to report on the time elapsed between making an application and determining  		need, and between determination of need and receipt of services. </p>
<p>Major changes resulted, including a more stringent review of functional  		capacity, a limit on the liquid assets program participants could have, and a  		sliding fee scale for client cost sharing. In addition, because the new  		entitlement nature of the program contained an implicit incentive to expand  		services, the state separated the assessment and case management functions from  		service provision. Care Coordination Units (CCUs) were designated to conduct  		client assessments, authorize the provisions of service and perform on-going  		case management. Because of the mandated separation of case management from  		service, most of the participating agencies had to decide whether to provide  		assessment and case management (and apply to become a CCU), or to provide  		direct services. By July 1983, the CCUs had been selected, awards had been made  		to service vendors and the pre-admission screening program was in place. </p>
<p>Until this point state general revenues had provided all the CCP  		funding. The new entitlement aspects of the program required so much expansion  		that it made sense to seek a 2176 waiver to fund services for Medicaid-eligible  		clients. In July of 1983 the waiver program began. </p>
<p>CCP is now a mature program. Thus, the state is no longer dealing with  		basic structural issues, but rather with fine tuning various components, in  		particular the rates paid to and selection of providers. Over the last several  		years, the state's large and politically well connected private nonprofit  		service providers have been increasingly underbid by proprietary agencies. This  		led to the creation of a task force chaired by the Governor's office, to review  		the current system and to recommend changes. As a result, providers will now be  		competitively selected based on quality measures identified through compliance  		monitoring, and each of the three direct services funded by the program will be  		reimbursed at a fixed rate. Of this rate, 73 percent must be passed on to  		direct salaries and benefits for workers. This provision was adopted in  		response to charges that workers' salaries and benefits were being adversely  		affected by rate competition. </p>
<p><b>FACTORS SHAPING ILLINOIS' APPROACH</b>. The primary factor shaping  		Illinois' current policies, as noted, was the 1982 court case defining the CCP  		as an entitlement program. A tightly run program with a strong cost containment  		focus resulted. In fact, this emphasis on keeping costs down led eventually to  		major political problems due to the competitive bid process for selecting  		providers and setting rates. At the same time, the legislature has wanted to  		spend more money on the program than the executive branch has requested. In  		fiscal 1986, in fact, the legislature appropriated more state funds than the  		Department could use. </p>
<p>CCP has broad based political support. As a state legislator noted, with  		a Republican Governor and a Democratic Legislature few programs escape detailed  		criticism but this one does. During the most difficult fiscal times, while  		other programs were cut back and taxes were raised, this program grew. Aging  		advocates now take the program for granted; although they were very influential  		in getting the program established there is little organized advocacy needed  		now. </p>
<p>The administrative structure of the CCP follows the pattern used for  		most other state human services functions in Illinois -- a centralized form of  		administration, using a state contracting system to award service funds to a  		well established private nonprofit delivery system. While several state  		agencies may be direct providers of service through local offices of state  		government, there is no significant human services role for county government.  		Therefore the administrative structure of the Community Care Program is similar  		to that used for other state human services functions. </p>
<p>Many state officials emphasized that the program was transferred from  		the Department of Public Aid because the elderly would have objected to the  		"welfare" image. However, the assets test and the required client cost sharing  		seem to stimulate only minimal objections since these policies were adopted as  		part of the major program expansion. </p>
<p>Finally, Illinois is the only state of the six studied that was not  		concerned about a growth in nursing home beds. Their 1986 bed ratio was  		70/1000, significantly higher than the national average. Even so, nursing home  		capacity controls are clearly not a component of their approach to expand  		community care options. In fact several state officials express the view that  		excess nursing home capacity is an advantage in that it helps keep costs down  		due to competition among facilities. </p>
<h3>Maine</h3>
<p><i>Maine's long term care system has been primarily built upon the Home  		Based Care Program. HBC provides a broad range of services to older people who  		are assessed as meeting the medical and functional criteria for nursing or  		boarding home care. Although it was originally initiated as a totally state  		funded program, by fiscal year 1986 about two thirds of the $2.6 million  		program was supported by state revenues and one third was supported by state  		and federal Medicaid funds authorized under a 2176 waiver.</i> There are few  		specifically defined services, leaving substantial flexibility for local  		program managers to decide on and fund the types of assistance needed. Personal  		care assistance is the most frequently used service, often provided by a  		neighbor or someone known to the client. In 8 percent of the state-funded  		cases, family members are paid providers -- which requires state agency  		approval. Payment to families is not allowed in those cases supported by the  		Medicaid waiver. </p>
<p>A small amount of Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) funds are available  		for impaired older persons receiving agency-provided homemaker services. The  		Older Americans Act funds case management services conducted for clients of the  		HBC. It also funds case management for the Congregate Housing Program. This is  		a small ($100,000 a year) state-funded program providing meals, housekeeping  		and personal care services for low and moderate income elderly living in  		subsidized housing. Eligibility for it is determined through individual client  		assessments reviewed by the housing manager, the area agency case manager and a  		home health agency nurse. </p>
<p><i>At the state level all of these programs are supervised by the  		Department of Human Services. The Bureau of Maine's Elderly administers HBC  		and, cooperatively with the Bureau of Medical Services, shares supervision of  		the Medicaid waiver component. The Bureau of Maine's Elderly also administers  		the Congregate Housing Program. </i></p>
<p>At the local level, area agencies on aging administer HBC (including the  		Medicaid waiver component) and the Congregate Housing Program; and they have  		access to a negotiated number of SSBG-funded homemaker slots for priority  		clients. A regional plan is required every two years and is reviewed in a  		public meeting to which a state-specified list of local providers are invited.  		A regional Quality Assurance Review Committee is also required, comprising  		representatives of home health agencies, hospitals, homemaker agencies, nursing  		homes and consumers. The committee, which must be chaired by a health  		professional not employed by the area agency, is required to review all program  		policies and procedures of the area agency; participate in the development of  		the annual report submitted to the state agency; and review randomly selected  		cases to note any policy or operational changes that should be made by the area  		agency. The Committee must meet at least bi-monthly and minutes of the meeting  		must be sent to the Bureau of Maine's Elderly. </p>
<p>Area agency on aging staff perform individual client assessments,  		develop care plans and serve as case managers. The Department of Human Services  		has developed a standardized assessment tool which is used for all clients  		seeking home care services through HBC and congregate housing. It is used also  		by hospital discharge workers in making a referral to either HBC or a nursing  		home, and by area agencies in pre-admission assessments of Medicaid eligible  		clients who are currently living in their own homes and are seeking nursing  		home admission. Local offices of the Department of Human Services determine  		financial eligibility for Medicaid. <a href="strfrm.htm#figureII-3">Figure II-3</a>  		depicts the organization of community care programs in Maine. </p>

</tr></table><p><b>DEVELOPMENT OF STATE POLICY INITIATIVES</b>. Development of Maine's  		long term care policy initiatives started with two events in 1979. The first  		was imposition of a one-year moratorium on new nursing home bed construction,  		following rapid expansion of nursing home beds in the 1970s. The second was  		creation by the governor of a task force of consumers, legislators, state  		agency staff and providers to develop a report on the long term care needs of  		the state's elderly. The task force report resulted in administrative policies  		to further constrain the growth of institutional expenditures. It also served  		as the impetus for the state-funded HBC established in 1981. </p>
<p>During the same period Maine was selected as one of the states  		participating in the National Channeling Demonstration. As part of its planning  		for the channeling demonstration, the Bureau of Maine's Elderly held meetings  		across the state to solicit input on long term care policies. In the process it  		helped to build a statewide constituency for creating a home care program to  		serve the whole state, not just the part covered by channeling. At a  		legislative hearing in 1981, for example, over 1,000 older people attended to  		show their support of new state funding for home care -- those parts of the  		state not covered by channeling wanted a home care program too. </p>
<p>Thus the state began implementing HBC at the same time the local  		channeling site began operation. As in many states, the local turf issues were  		especially thorny, with the Medicare certified home health agencies and the  		area agencies on aging in direct competition for lead agency status in both  		programs. This represented a significant change in the home health agencies'  		stated position. Several years before, the Bureau of Maine's Elderly had  		approached the home health agencies to generate interest in providing  		non-health-related long term care services. At that time they were not willing  		to change their medical focus. When funds became available, however, they  		wanted part of the action. Competition was most heated over the case management  		function, with home health agencies claiming it on the grounds that they  		already did case management. Ultimately area agencies were designated as the  		lead local agencies, in part due to state rules (no longer in effect) that  		identified case management as a mandated function but prohibited the use of HBC  		funds for this purpose. Area agencies had other resources under the Older  		Americans Act funds, and chose to use them for case management. </p>
<p>The other components were added to the long term care delivery system  		incrementally. The state-funded Congregate Housing Program began operation in  		1982. In 1983 the Bureau of Maine's Elderly began a series of demonstrations  		involving nursing homes in the provision of community care services. Specific  		grants were given to nursing homes for adult day care, respite care and some  		in-home services. In partial response to the limited entry of nursing homes  		into the home care field, home health agencies pushed for and received  		legislation which required state licensure for home heath agencies. </p>
<p>In 1984, the state applied for and received approval of a 2176 waiver  		request. Some of the state general revenues previously devoted to HBC became  		matching funds for the Medicaid component. State officials emphasize that an  		initial use of state funds to develop a program resulted in a better system for  		Maine than would have resulted had they built their system around the  		requirements of the waiver. </p>
<p>The most recent addition to Maine's system is the Alternative Long Term  		Care Program. This program combines the optional Medicaid state plan services  		of private duty nursing, personal care and traditional home health services and  		bills them at an hourly rate. Prior authorization is required from the Bureau  		of Medical Services. This packaging is an attempt to control what had been  		runaway costs for these services while at the same time meeting medical long  		term care needs. Clients receiving Alternative Long Term Care services must be  		nursing-home eligible and the costs of their service packages may not exceed  		nursing home costs. </p>
<p>One of the most unique aspects of Maine's long term care strategy is its  		approach to determining nursing home bed needs. The 1979 moratorium resulted in  		a strategy of planned growth. Since then beds have increased by approximately 7  		percent, most of which is attributable to beds that were authorized in 1979 but  		not yet built. The legislature has the annual responsibility of determining the  		state's bed needs, with recommendations from the health planning agency. The  		rationale for the legislature's involvement is that since such a high  		proportion (80 percent) of nursing home residents are Medicaid recipients, the  		approval of new beds is a de facto Medicaid expenditure. Therefore since only  		the legislature can appropriate funds, then the legislature should approve the  		number of new beds. The geographic location of these new beds, however, is left  		up to the health planning agency. </p>
<p><b>FACTORS SHAPING MAINE'S APPROACH</b>. The Maine program is based on a  		strongly held state philosophy of building on informal supports for the  		provision of publicly financed care. It is for this reason, combined with its  		rural nature, that personal care assistance by a neighbor or friend is the most  		commonly used service. </p>
<p>Other major factors shaping Maine's approach are the early battles  		between the home health industry and area agencies on aging for lead agency  		designation. These have resulted in compromises that give home health agencies  		a larger role in the long term care system than they have in the other five  		states studied. Home health agencies, for example, usually chair the Quality  		Assurance Review Committees. They are also the providers of care under the  		Alternative Long Term Care Program. In fact this program was created as part of  		a compromise between the home health industry and the state over the  		designation of area agencies as case management organizations. </p>
<h3>Maryland</h3>
<p><i>Responsibility for long term care programs for the elderly is divided  		among three state agencies: the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the  		Department of Human Resources and the Office on Aging. The directors of these  		three agencies constitute the Interagency Committee on Aging Services (IAC),  		created by the legislature to improve state level coordination. </i></p>
<p><i>The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene administers Medicaid  		personal care services at a level of $3 million in FY 1986, state general  		revenue grants and Medicaid reimbursement for adult day care at a level of $3.5  		million, and state funded geriatric evaluation services consisting of both  		pre-admission screening and community care evaluations funded at a level of 1.2  		million.</i> The Department also manages Medicaid nursing home payments. At the  		local level, Medicaid personal care services are provided by independent  		contractors supervised by a nurse who is frequently employed by a home health  		agency. The day care centers have a variety of organizational affiliations. The  		geriatric evaluation service is part of the county health department. </p>
<p><i>The Department of Human Resources is responsible for social services  		and income maintenance programs.</i> Specifically the Department manages In  		Home Aides Services, funded at $5.7 million in FY 1986 from the Social Services  		Block Grant and state general revenues. Also funded with state general revenues  		(at $2.9 million annually) are case management services and (at $.6 million) in  		subsidies for domiciliary care for older people. Those programs are all  		administered through local social services offices of the Department of Human  		Resources. </p>
<p><i>The Office on Aging administers the Older Americans Act of which $1.5  		million is devoted to home delivered meals.</i> Locally, Older Americans Act  		funds are administered by area agencies on aging, which are part of county  		government. The Office on Aging also administers the state-funded sheltered  		housing program, which provides $1 million for personal care and chore services  		on a sliding fee basis to frail residents of subsidized housing. Grants are  		made to housing facilities on behalf of the elderly recipient. The Gateway II  		program ($1.1 million in state general revenues) is also administered by the  		Office on Aging in collaboration with the other two members of the IAC. This  		program provides case management and gap filling funds to counties for services  		to older persons assessed as being at risk of nursing home placement. County  		officials decide whether the local lead agency will be the health department,  		the area agency on aging or the social services department. Counties also are  		required to establish a local Interagency Committee on Aging Services and  		develop a plan for the coordination of all publicly financed services.  		<a href="strfrm.htm#figureII-4">Figure II-4</a> depicts the organization of community  		care programs in Maryland. </p>
<p><b>Development of Maryland's Policy Initiatives</b>. Coordination of  		long term care services has been a long standing concern in Maryland. From the  		mid 1970s to the early 1980s, aging advocacy organizations were pressing for  		the creation of a Department on Aging under which all resources devoted to  		serving older people could be consolidated. Ultimately this approach was  		rejected; however this pressure has led the three state agencies responsible  		for aging services to approach coordination efforts cautiously. </p>
<p>In 1980, Maryland expanded its focus on long term care in several ways.  		The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene amended the Medicaid State Plan to  		begin covering personal care services and adult day care. At the same time, the  		Office on Aging received two grants for community care demonstrations. The  		first, funded as part of a multi-state effort by the Robert Wood Johnson  		Foundation, led to a long term care coordination project administered in  		Baltimore County. The second was for the National Channeling Demonstration to  		be implemented in the city of Baltimore. Federal requirements for channeling  		mandated that a state level working group comprising at a minimum the three  		state agencies administering Medicaid, the Social Service Block Grant and the  		Older Americans Act, be established to prepare a state long term care plan and  		to establish policies for the new demonstration. </p>

</tr></table><p>A year and a half later, former Governor Hughes decided to make services  		to the elderly a major priority within his 1982 legislative package. The  		interagency task force had just completed its state long term care plan and had  		several new proposals waiting. These included Gateway I, designed to improve  		service access for older people through strengthening statewide information and  		referral services. The second proposal, Gateway II, called for local  		demonstrations in pilot counties to better organize the delivery of long term  		care services. </p>
<p>Both Gateway proposals also reflected the concerns of the major  		membership organizations of older people that services be better coordinated.  		While advocates wanted more money, their foremost concern was that older people  		were falling through the cracks of the various state and federal programs. Both  		Gateway I and II were adopted by the legislature. Advocate groups again raised  		the issue of consolidating the state's various long term care programs in a new  		Department on Aging. As a compromise, the legislature addressed the  		coordination concerns by creating an Interagency Committee on Aging Services  		(IAC) comprising the three state agencies involved in long term care services  		for the elderly, with lead responsibility assigned to the Office on Aging. By  		statute, this committee is responsible for setting policy for the Gateway II  		program, addressing coordination problems across the three agencies, and  		developing an interagency annual budget request for aging services. </p>
<p>In the fall of 1984, the Department of Budget and Fiscal Planning  		released a study undertaken at the direction of the legislature to examine the  		various programs financing in-home services in Maryland. The three state  		agencies responded by making a number of changes in their programs. One of the  		major findings was that much of the gap filling funds of the Gateway II program  		were being spent for in-home services that could have been funded under other  		programs. Specifically, Gateway II funds were being spent because workers could  		not be recruited to deliver Medicaid personal care services and funds for the  		Department of Human Resources' in home aides had been exhausted. The report  		recommended that the traditional programs be fully funded before support for  		Gateway II was expanded. It also proposed changes in the personal care program  		to decrease the likelihood that either in-home aides or Gateway II services  		would be provided to clients who are Medicaid eligible. </p>
<p>Finally, the report recommended that the IAC establish more uniformity  		in the way Gateway II is administered across the state. In many ways this  		recommendation is counter to the program's original purpose -- of providing  		flexible funds to counties to increase service coordination. However, the IAC  		agreed that since the legislature had appropriated funds to achieve statewide  		coverage by July 1986, the time had come for more uniformity. Several important  		policies were adopted, including standardized financial eligibility criteria  		and a methodology for allocating funds to counties. One of the most  		controversial proposals -- which would have designated the local offices of the  		Department of Human Resources as the primary agencies to perform case  		management -- was not adopted. </p>
<p>In order to minimize the start-up difficulties faced by the Gateway II  		pilot counties, the three state agencies have developed a systematic process  		for bringing new counties on board. Some of these efforts, like providing more  		lead time to counties in developing their plans and conducting county meetings  		attended by each of the three state agencies on the IAC, were designed to  		obtain better coordination from the start. </p>
<p>The most recent addition to Maryland's long term care initiatives is  		preadmission screening, which began July 1986. Screening is required for all  		persons who are currently eligible for Medicaid as well as those who would be  		financially eligible within 6 months of nursing home placement. The Geriatric  		Evaluation Service in each local Health Department administers the screening  		program. Staff of the three state agencies serving on the IAC have developed a  		single assessment tool which will now be used for pre-admission screening and  		all the community care programs of the IAC agencies. </p>
<p><b>FACTORS SHAPING MARYLAND'S APPROACH</b>. Maryland's policy  		initiatives over the years have assured that each of the three relevant state  		agencies has a carefully negotiated role in long term care programs for the  		elderly. Each state agency acknowledges the difficult task of achieving  		three-way cooperation while at the same time maintaining the current division  		of responsibilities. Coordination has become increasingly effective over the  		past several years, in part because of the personal commitment of the three  		agency heads to improving the system. Many sources noted the symbolic  		importance of the three secretaries testifying together at a budget hearing in  		1986 on behalf of all aging programs -- with moderate increases for each  		agency. </p>
<p>Each of the three state agencies have their own local delivery systems.  		The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has local health departments; the  		Office on Aging has area agencies on aging. Both are part of county government.  		The Department of Human Resources local offices are part of state government.  		In addition, independent personal care contractors and their supervisors relate  		directly to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene or the Department of  		Human Resources depending on the funding source. Some state officials note that  		their increased commitment to work together filters down to the local level;  		others believe that coordination is, in any case, more effective at the local  		level than at the state level. </p>
<p>Maryland has made an explicit choice not to pursue a 2176 waiver to  		serve the elderly (they are already administering a waiver program for the  		developmentally disabled population). State officials are unanimous in their  		reasons for rejecting the waiver approach. They note that Maryland wants to see  		community based care services grow substantially. With limits on the number of  		people that can be served by waiver programs and limits on total expenditures,  		Maryland feels that expansion will be more substantial and reliable if it comes  		about by encouraging greater use of Medicaid personal care services and adult  		day care provided under the state plan. </p>
<h3>Oregon</h3>
<p><i>Oregon bas consolidated all components of its long term care programs  		into a single administrative structure at the state level and a highly  		integrated delivery system at the local level. A single state agency, the  		Division of Senior Services, manages all of the state's community and  		institutional long term care programs.</i> These include Medicaid, a Home and  		Community Based Services Waiver, the state funded Oregon Project Independence  		and the Older Americans Act. In addition to developing community care systems,  		the Division licenses and certifies nursing homes, reimburses them for the care  		of Medicaid clients, and develops policies governing the participation of  		nursing homes in Medicaid. This administrative structure is the most  		consolidated of any of the long term care policy approaches included in this  		study. </p>
<p><i>The Medicaid Home and Community Based Services waiver is the core of  		Oregon's community care system. In 1986 over $19 million was spent under the  		waiver for community care services provided to Medicaid eligible persons  		assessed to need institutional care.</i> Individual client assessments and case  		management services are financed through Medicaid administration funds. <i>In  		addition Oregon Project Independence, funded with state general revenues  		provides similar services to persons who have the same functional impairments  		as waiver clients but who do not meet Medicaid financial eligibility  		criteria.</i> These persons receive services based on a sliding fee scale,  		which starts at an income level of 125 percent of poverty. </p>
<p>Major components of the service delivery system include case management,  		relocation planning, risk intervention and pre-admission screening. All these  		functions are performed by case managers who assess client needs, develop a  		care plan authorizing the provision of services, and establish financial  		eligibility for Medicaid and income maintenance programs. </p>
<p>Case managers assigned to relocation planning help institutionalized  		older people return to the community. Since 1982 over 5000 nursing home  		residents have been relocated to community settings. Risk intervention case  		managers develop care plans for persons who do not meet the functional or  		financial criteria for the waiver program or Oregon Project Independence.  		Services are privately purchased and/or provided by neighbors and voluntary  		organizations. Pre-admission screening is conducted for persons who are  		currently Medicaid eligible or will be within three months of nursing home  		placement. Staff also identify persons who might require only a short  		placement, so relocation case managers can follow up. </p>

</tr></table><p>Local administration of Oregon's community care system is the  		responsibility of the area agencies on aging, with the scope of responsibility  		dependent upon their type of governing structure. The vast majority (90  		percent) of clients are in jurisdictions where the area agencies are part of  		local government (counties or councils of government). These agencies  		administer all funding sources and programs including Medicaid waiver services,  		OAA, and Project Independence. They also conduct case management, relocation  		planning, risk intervention and pre-admission screening. </p>
<p>In the remainder of the state, the area agencies on aging are private  		non-profit organizations. They administer the OAA and Project Independence  		programs. In these jurisdictions, district offices of the state Senior Services  		Division manage the waiver program, and perform case management and  		pre-admission screening. <a href="strfrm.htm#figureII-5">Figure II-5</a> depicts the  		organization of community care programs in Oregon. </p>
<p><b>DEVELOPMENT OF STATE POLICY INITIATIVES</b>. Like many other states,  		Oregon's emphasis in the 1970s was on building new nursing homes. In an attempt  		to reverse that trend, Oregon Project Independence, a state funded Community  		Care Program, was created in 1975. In addition, the state in 1979 received  		approval from the Administration on Aging and the Health Care Financing  		Administration to undertake a demonstration in several geographic areas, using  		Medicaid funds for community care services and setting up a formal process to  		improve coordination of service delivery. At approximately the same time Oregon  		began a statewide pre-admission screening program. These efforts laid the  		groundwork for a more comprehensive long term care initiative. </p>
<p>Planning for the new approach was facilitated by a federal Long Term  		Care Systems Development Grant. Concurrently the Governor gave the Commission  		on Aging the responsibility of formulating proposals to reorganize the way  		services to older people are administered. A wide range of interests were  		represented on the planning committee, including state officials, service  		providers, community planners and older people themselves. There were two major  		results. </p>
<p>The first was state legislation enacted in 1981 which dramatically  		reorganized the state and local administrative structures for long term care  		services. The Division of Senior Services was created by merging the functions  		of the previous state aging agency with the long term care unit of the state  		Medicaid agency. At the local level, the new legislation also changed the role  		of state government's district offices. In those parts of the state where area  		agencies are part of local government, they could choose to perform their  		traditional functions as well as assuming the responsibilities of the state's  		district offices. Most area agencies chose this expanded role which included  		determining both functional and financial eligibility for Medicaid, as well as  		conducting case management and pre-admission screening. </p>
<p>The second was development of an application for a waiver for Home and  		Community Based Services. The request was granted and, with the new  		reorganization in place, Oregon became the first state to receive a waiver. In  		implementing the waiver program, Oregon not only attempted to divert new  		nursing home admissions by providing community services; it also embarked on an  		effort to relocate existing nursing home residents to community settings. Due  		to state budget constraints in the early 1980s and federal reductions in Social  		Services Block Grant funds, some of the state's programs serving less frail  		persons were terminated. Oregon's response was the risk intervention initiative  		which provides case management assistance to persons ineligible for publicly  		financed services. </p>
<p>The dramatic changes in Oregon's long term care system in such a  		relatively short time, not surprisingly, led to significant tensions among the  		state agency, area agencies on aging, service providers and aging advocacy  		groups. To address the major disagreements that arose, a process called the  		Negotiated Investment Strategy was undertaken. The interests of the state, area  		agencies, service providers and elderly advocate groups were each represented  		by their own five member team. These four teams met for a full day every other  		week for more than six months, at the end of which agreements were reached that  		successfully clarified the roles and expectations of all parties. </p>
<p>A major outgrowth of the Oregon change from central office control of  		state district offices to a state supervised locally managed program was a new  		program monitoring system. It changed from a concern for structural and process  		measures of quality of care, to a system that focuses on client outcomes. State  		teams look at a sample of case files and interview individual clients in their  		own homes to review appropriateness of care. This approach was seen by state  		staff as the final step in the transition from state to local program  		management begun in 1981. </p>
<p>By 1985 there were only two long term care activities which the Senior  		Services Division did not manage, both of which are now under the Division. One  		was Inspection of Care -- a federally mandated process of reviewing service  		provision and utilization as part of the certification process for nursing  		homes participating in Medicaid; the second was nursing home licensure. The  		Division became responsible for Inspection of Care in 1985 and the state survey  		and licensure functions in 1987. </p>
<p>With the expansion of community care options during the late 1970s, the  		health planning agency began tightening nursing home bed need criteria.  		Although Oregon never implemented an official moratorium on approval of  		certificates of need, the bed need criteria was so stringent that it achieved  		the same result with only 300 new beds authorized since 1981. Health planning  		officials note the importance of limiting bed expansion in conjunction with the  		Senior Services Division's emphasis on controlling nursing home utilization and  		keeping occupancy rates down. As a result, there has been minimal demand for  		new construction. </p>
<p><b>FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO OREGON'S APPROACH</b>. Both state officials  		and older people themselves played an active role from the late 1970's on in  		Oregon's planning for long term care policy change. Passage of the 1981 state  		legislation which dramatically reorganized the community care delivery system  		coincided with Congressional enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act  		of 1981, which included authorization for the Medicaid Home and Community Based  		Services waivers. The newly developed state long term care plan was translated  		into a waiver request -- and Oregon was granted the first waiver in the  		country. </p>
<p>Being first has not always been advantageous, however. Oregon's waiver  		program is among the country's largest. At least in part for this reason it has  		faced extensive federal pressure to reduce the number of persons served. In  		addition, the program was in full operation before the federal requirements  		governing the waivers were in place. Waiver policies were constantly evolving  		for the first several years of state program operation, necessitating constant  		program changes. </p>
<p>Another major influence on Oregon's long term care initiative was the  		severe economic recession which developed as Oregon began program  		implementation. The recession, combined with the major reduction in federal  		funds flowing to states led to a strong emphasis on cost control. Keeping down  		Medicaid nursing home case loads became a major objective leading to more  		pressure on community care services. Functional impairment levels for waiver  		services eligibility also were tightened; and the same tightened eligibility  		levels were applied to the previously flexible Oregon Project Independence.  		</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that aging services are the only component of human  		services in Oregon not directly managed by state government. The sharing of  		responsibility with the area agencies on aging led to major frictions. While  		state officials were accustomed to tightly controlling all aspects of policy  		implementation, area agencies on aging were accustomed to having substantial  		flexibility and autonomy. They did not easily adapt to fairly rigid Medicaid  		rules. </p>
<p>The combination of difficulties that the Oregon long term care  		initiative faced during the first several years of operation -- unpredictable  		federal waiver policy, strong state cost control pressures, changing  		relationships between state and local government in human services management,  		and new agencies at the state and local level learning to cope with the  		complexities of Medicaid -- could easily have caused Oregon's system to topple.  		Instead, Oregon has created a strong well managed community care system that  		many states would like to emulate. A good deal of the credit goes to state  		officials who were willing to take risks and to persevere. </p>
<h3>Wisconsin</h3>
<p><i>The Community Options Program is the focal point for the coordination  		of all federal, state and local resources devoted to community care services.  		The Community Options Program, (COP) like initiatives in a number of states,  		was created in response to a crisis -- that of rapidly escalating Medicaid  		expenditures for nursing home care. Unlike the responses in other states,  		however, Wisconsin responded with a program that did not focus only on the  		elderly.</i> The state funded COP is designed to serve all populations needing  		long term care, including the elderly, physically disabled, developmentally  		disabled, chronically mentally ill and chemically dependent. Both children and  		adults are served. In addition to supportive services, COP also funds  		individual client assessments, care planning and on-going case management.  		State government has not defined a particular group of services which must or  		can be funded; nor has it prescribed extensive administrative procedures which  		must be followed in implementing the program locally. Rather, state guidelines  		concentrate on developing county plans for coordinating existing service  		programs, and involving the client and family in developing individual care  		plans. </p>
<p><i>With a funding level of $17 million in 1986, approximately half of  		COP's expenditures are spent on the elderly. The resources coordinated with COP  		include Supportive Home Care funded at approximately $11 million for FY 1986  		with state funds comprising 80 percent of the total and the Social Services  		Block Grant comprising 20 percent. They also include special supplements to the  		Federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payment to older people for persons  		with special needs.</i> (These payments are in addition to a basic state  		supplement to SSI for all older people meeting SSI income and assets criteria).  		As in a number of other states, these payments help finance the costs of board  		and care. However, Wisconsin also provides these special supplements to persons  		receiving more than 40 hours of publicly funded home care services a month,  		with the assumption that these individuals are likely to incur other additional  		living expenses due to their frailty. Recent state initiatives to support  		families of persons with Alzheimer's disease resulted in several major program  		thrusts -- including an expansion of COP eligibility for those with Alzheimer's  		disease, and a state appropriation of $1.2 million for cash grants of up to  		$4,000 a year to Alzheimer's family caregivers. </p>
<p><i>Finally Wisconsin has four 2176 Medicaid waivers. Two waivers serve  		developmentally disabled persons and two serve the elderly and physically  		disabled.</i> The largest waiver is entitled the Community Integration Program.  		Counties may access the Community Integration waiver on behalf of older people  		when there has been a reduction of licensed nursing home beds in the county,  		either due to a public or private facility closing or a decrease in the number  		of licensed beds in an individual nursing home. Wisconsin's payment system  		contains provisions which help nursing homes maximize Medicaid reimbursement if  		a certain occupancy level is maintained; this provides an incentive for a  		facility to reduce licensed beds in order to maintain high occupancy levels.  		</p>
<p><i>All of these long term care programs are supervised by the Community  		Services Division of the Department of Health and Social Services.</i> Local  		implementation is through county government, a strong and long-standing pattern  		of human service administration in Wisconsin. In most cases, County Social  		Services Departments are responsible for program planning and coordination,  		eligibility determination, and individual case management. Frequently counties  		subcontract with other agencies for service delivery; in some cases county  		government directly provides services or uses independent contractors.  		<a href="strfrm.htm#figureII-6">Figure II-6</a> depicts the organization of community  		care programs in Wisconsin. </p>

</tr></table><p><b>DEVELOPMENT OF STATE POLICY INITIATIVES</b>. Wisconsin has a long  		history of leadership in human services programs. In 1980, Wisconsin had the  		nation's second highest number of nursing home beds in relationship to their  		elderly population. In the 1970s that was an indication of a responsive,  		caring, human services policy. As priorities changed, however, the large  		nursing home capacity became a liability in attempting to direct more resources  		to community care. This factor, along with a tradition of strong advocacy  		groups and a willingness to experiment with new approaches, converged in the  		late 1970s to result in major policy changes. </p>
<p>From the late 1960s on, the major funding source in Wisconsin for  		community services for persons of all ages has been Community Aids, which is an  		allocation of both federal and state appropriated funds awarded to counties on  		a formula basis. Counties have substantial discretion in determining how funds  		are spent, except that a portion of each county's allocation is earmarked for  		state mandated expenditures. Supportive home care provided to the elderly is  		one of those mandated program areas and until the creation of COP, was the  		major source of community care for the elderly. </p>
<p>In 1976 Wisconsin pilot-tested four demonstration projects to provide  		comprehensive community care as alternatives to nursing homes. Established with  		an 1115 Medicaid waiver, this Community Care Organization (CCO) demonstration  		covered four counties and provided assessments, case management and services to  		allow older people to stay in the community. The general consensus in the state  		is that the project was somewhat of a failure, in part because it was managed  		through the Lt. Governor's office, instead of being part of the long term care  		system under the Department of Health and Social Services. At the local level  		the project was similarly unconnected to the primary administrator of all human  		services programs, county government. This isolation from the state's well  		established delivery system resulted in neither state nor county government  		being willing to continue the project at the end of the federal demonstration  		period. However, the CCO project did familiarize policymakers and advocates  		with the notion of providing comprehensive packages of long term care services  		in the community and helped change perceptions of who needs nursing home care.  		</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, the state's substantial investment in nursing home  		care began to sky rocket, stimulating considerable support for seeking new  		approaches. In 1979 alone total Medicaid expenditures increased by $100 million  		due to increased nursing home costs. Advocates for the developmentally disabled  		and the physically handicapped were well organized and had been urging the  		expansion of home care services for several years. The aging groups also began  		calling for alternatives to nursing home care. Ultimately a coalition of  		various groups helped to generate legislative support for policy change. </p>
<p>The Department of Health and Social Services had in fact been planning  		for change, officially beginning in mid-1979 with the establishment of an ad  		hoc planning group of upper level managers. The result was a package of  		policies presented to the legislature in early 1981. This package had two major  		components. First, due to the extremely high proportion of nursing home beds in  		relationship to the state's elderly population, the legislature adopted a  		moratorium on nursing home bed expansion, which is still in place today.  		Secondly they approved as a pilot program the Community Options Program (COP),  		to begin in eight counties in 1982, with eventual statewide coverage in 1986.  		The authorizing legislation specified that program participants must be  		assessed as requiring nursing home care and that on average, COP service  		expenditures per person could not exceed the state's share of Medicaid  		expenditures (42 percent) for an individual's monthly nursing home costs. The  		moratorium on nursing home construction was central to financing COP. State  		funds which would have been devoted to matching Medicaid for increased nursing  		home care were to be spent instead on community care. </p>
<p>Wisconsin was awarded its Long Term Care Systems Development Grant about  		the same time that the COP program was created. This grant provided the state  		with supplemental staff to develop an implementation plan, including a phase-in  		timetable for achieving statewide coverage. As part of the phase-in plan, the  		nursing home pre-admission screening component in each county's program was  		scheduled to cover all nursing home admissions during the fifth year of COP  		operation in that county. The program did, in fact, become statewide on  		schedule. </p>
<p>Other programs were subsequently developed to supplement COP. In 1984 a  		new component was added to the state supplement to SSI. Older people receiving  		more than 40 hours of publicly supported home care services are entitled to an  		extra SSI supplement designed to address the higher living costs encountered by  		the frail elderly. In 1985, a state funded program for support to family  		caregivers of persons with Alzheimers Disease was established. </p>
<p>Also in 1985, the state applied for and received a 2176 waiver to  		support a small proportion of new elderly COP clients with Medicaid funds.  		Wisconsin had deliberately delayed seeking a Medicaid waiver until all of the  		basic components of their system were in place. While the waiver brings a small  		amount of federal funds to a system which is otherwise state funded, state  		officials question the value of the federal contribution in relation to the  		high investment of time required in developing the waiver application,  		implementing the program and monitoring the results. They note that their  		waiver request by design insured cost effectiveness since a waiver slot would  		not be activated unless a nursing home bed was removed from the supply. Even  		so, it still took almost two years to obtain approval. Late in 1986 Wisconsin  		received approval for its second Medicaid waiver for the elderly; this one is  		not dependent on the closure of existing nursing home beds. </p>
<p><b>FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO WISCONSIN'S APPROACH</b>. A significant  		factor which shaped Wisconsin's approach was the availability of state general  		revenue funds as the primary financing source for their community care system.  		The strong principle of client choice in developing individual care plans, and  		the flexibility given to local administrators to implement those plans, is in  		large part possible because of the state's ability to totally finance the  		program. This brings with it a flexibility in program design that is hard to  		achieve under the constraints of federal program regulations. </p>
<p>In deference to Wisconsin's long tradition of a state supervised/county  		administered human services delivery system, state officials consciously  		avoided detailed prescriptions of local administrative structures for community  		care programs in the design of COP. A local planning committee including at  		least five consumers of services is required to develop a county COP plan.  		State decisions regarding state and county roles were primarily those on the  		margin -- like how much flexibility should counties have in structuring their  		delivery system rather than a basic yes/no decision on whether the system  		should be standardized in all 72 counties. Instead of concentrating on the  		issue of administrative structures, state officials focused on clearly defining  		program values and outcomes. There are no disallowed services, only disallowed  		settings (i.e., settings which are not small and community-integrated). </p>
<p>Finally, Wisconsin's community care system serves all populations  		requiring long term care services. This can be done effectively due to the  		enormous flexibility of the program. Even after five years of operation, there  		is very little debate on whether separate systems should be established for  		each population group. In part the generic approach has been preserved by the  		advocate groups who believe that the program is more likely to grow if the  		various interests all unite. At the same time, however, there is some  		discussion of earmarking portions of the state's large community aids grants to  		counties, with designated amounts to be spent on social services for certain  		client groups. </p>
<h3>State Demographic Context for Long Term Care Policy  		Development</h3>
<p>The characteristics of the elderly population in the six study states  		seemed to influence the choice of financing mechanisms for long term care  		services. As noted in <a href="strfrm.htm#tableII-1">Table II-1</a>, the percentage of  		Arkansas' 65+ population that falls below the poverty rate is substantially  		larger than in the other five states. Consequently Arkansas has targeted its  		long term care assistance to persons qualifying for Medicaid personal care  		services and, in state funded home care programs, to persons with incomes below  		125 percent of poverty. State funds are not used to partially subsidize  		services for moderate income persons through sliding fee scales. Wisconsin, in  		contrast, has an elderly poverty rate far below the national average of 14.9  		percent. The state's Community Options Program supports individual assessments  		and care planning for all older people needing long term care. Services,  		however, are provided with clients sharing in the cost of their care based upon  		ability to pay. Approximately 75 percent of all Wisconsin long term care  		clients contribute to the cost of their care, with one quarter paying for the  		full amount. Both Arkansas and Wisconsin have responded to the unique  		characteristics of their elderly populations, resulting in very different  		approaches. </p>

<p>Long term care initiatives in each of the six states have focused on  		investing public funds in new approaches to meet the needs of older people.  		This chapter identifies the long term care strategies adopted and the state and  		local administrative structures responsible for implementing those new  		policies. Those policies were shaped by the context of their initial adoption  		and the differing objectives of state long term care initiatives. This chapter  		begins with a brief outline of the demographic context of the six study states.  		</p>
<h3>Development of State Long Term Care Policy</h3>
<p>The six states included in the study fall into two distinct groups,  		according to whether they made plans for explicit long term care system reform  		from the start, or whether their system evolved out of more modest objectives  		pursued without major system reform in mind. Arkansas, Maryland and Illinois  		began funding community care services gradually in the late 1970s without a  		conscious attempt to achieve reform in their overall long term care systems or  		to reduce the growth of Medicaid nursing home expenditures. Their objective was  		simply to enable older people to remain in their own homes a little longer.  		With little fanfare or advance planning Arkansas and Maryland added personal  		care to the services covered by their Medicaid state plan and Illinois  		established a modest state funded home care program. </p>
<p>The other three states in the study -- Maine, Oregon and Wisconsin --  		set out to deliberately control long term care expenditures through system  		changes. Each began with an extensive planning process, and in each case, the  		resulting initiatives reflected assessments of the prevailing problem that were  		unique to each state's particular circumstances. Oregon, for example, in  		response to coordination barriers identified through a broad based public  		planning process, consolidated responsibility for all long term care programs  		in a single state agency and a single entry point at the local level. Wisconsin  		created its Community Options Program as a response to rapidly escalating  		nursing home costs and a serious overall budget deficit. For this reason COP  		was accompanied by a freeze on nursing home construction, with the estimated  		savings to be funneled into the Community Options Program. Maine responded to a  		perceived lack of non-medical services, establishing a program that could be  		flexibly run using a wide variety of providers. While the state funded Home  		Based Care program was implemented in a time of great fiscal constraint, cost  		containment never became a primary thrust. </p>
<p>Several factors distinguish the group of states that undertook a  		comprehensive approach from the group that followed an evolutionary one. First,  		the incremental states began their initiatives before major state budget crises  		hit. The other three states were forced to take a broader view; as a result,  		nursing home capacity controls became integral components of strategies to  		expand community care. Second, the three evolutionary initiatives started from  		the efforts of a single individual or a small group. States setting out to  		completely change their systems involved numerous participants in major  		planning efforts. </p>
<p>The issues each state had to face were similar, whether the initial  		approach was incremental or comprehensive. States that undertook a  		comprehensive approach, however, emphasize that their planning activities in  		the 1970s laid a solid foundation for more substantial efforts in the 1980s --  		a foundation that they feel greatly improved the effectiveness of their current  		long term care system over what would have been possible without extensive  		prior planning. </p>
<p><b>STATE AGENCY COLLABORATION IN POLICY DEVELOPMENT</b>. Interagency  		collaboration was important in all states for both initial policy development  		and ongoing program management. However, the coordination structures created,  		the specific participants involved and the duration of the effort depended on  		whether the structures were established for policy development or for actual  		policy implementation. This section explores collaboration on policy  		development; later in this chapter, state level management integration will be  		discussed. </p>
<p>All the states included in the study emphasized that coordination among  		state agencies and the programs they administer is necessary to develop a  		continuum of care capable of offering a range of health and social services to  		persons with diverse needs. Such a continuum of care typically necessitates a  		combination of policies cutting across various state agencies if lasting change  		is to be achieved. Each agency affected by these changes has different  		expertise and resources; collaboration helps to maximize both. This is not an  		easy task, as years of turf battles indicate. However, in these six states and  		across the country, resource constraints, pressures from interest groups and  		strong gubernatorial leadership have forced more collaboration, and the results  		have been invariably positive in reducing turf battles. </p>
<p>Coordinating committees are frequently established to develop new state  		approaches to meeting the long term care needs of older people. The evolution  		of these policy work groups shared several major similarities across the six  		states. </p>
<p><i>First, in their initial phase, planning groups typically include  		participants from both inside and outside state government. Aside from the  		substantive benefits of broad based input, multiple interests are more likely  		to support policy change if they are identified with its success. </i></p>
<p><i>Second, in contrast to structures established for ongoing  		coordination of interagency program management, policy work groups tend to have  		higher level state officials as members. This is important both symbolically  		and substantively. When representation gets assigned to lower level state  		staff, the issues addressed tend to change from broad policy issues to narrower  		issue of program operation. </i></p>
<p><i>Third, in the six states studied, policy development efforts often  		were part of an official research or planning effort.</i> Five of the six  		states were recipients in 1980 of either Channeling awards or State Systems  		Development Grants. While some of these states had already designed the basic  		structure of their initiatives, these federally financed planning grants helped  		in further refining approaches. If a state level coordinating committee did not  		already exist, recipients of both types of awards were required to establish  		one that included at a minimum the Medicaid, aging and social services  		agencies. </p>
<p>In Oregon and Maine, even before the federal planning grants had been  		awarded, the governors had appointed committees with broad based membership to  		study long term care and make recommendations for change. The Oregon planning  		group's recommendations were later adopted by the legislature, including a  		consolidation of all state responsibilities into one agency, thereby  		eliminating the need for future state level coordinating committees. In Maine  		the Governor's task force on long term care had almost completed its work and  		had achieved consensus on major directions for policy change by the time it  		received a Channeling award. A smaller group began implementing those changes  		at the same time as the channeling demonstration was begun. </p>
<p>In Illinois and Maryland interagency policy development was particularly  		important since both states have multiple independent cabinet level agencies  		responsible for some aspect of long term care. Illinois' policy group included  		the directors of the departments of public aid, aging, mental health,  		rehabilitation and budget, and a representative of the Governor's office.  		Within a year, this group had successfully addressed most of the policy,  		planning and budget issues surrounding the establishment of a new long term  		care system. Since then most major policy issues have been resolved during  		meetings of Cabinet officers who head the various state agencies responsible  		for human service programs; a working group of midlevel staff meets regularly  		to resolve implementation problems. In Maryland, a policy group was established  		similar in composition to Illinois' committee. After adopting a package of  		proposals recommended by the policy group, the legislature formally established  		the Interagency Committee on Aging Services (IAC) comprising the Department of  		Human Resources, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Office on  		Aging. This committee still exists. </p>
<p>While its primary focus has been implementation of the Gateway II  		community care program, the IAC has a broader mandate to improve coordination  		among the three agencies' programs and to develop a coordinated annual budget  		request for aging services across state agencies. As the state begins new  		initiatives like pre-admission screening, the IAC has provided a forum for  		working out policy differences. Last year the IAC submitted to the legislature  		a consolidated budget request for aging services. It was not a unified budget,  		but rather a compilation of budget decisions made by each department; yet, as  		noted elsewhere in this report, the symbolism was considered important by both  		state officials and advocacy groups. It is the only example in the six states  		of a single public document aggregating all state expenditures on behalf of the  		elderly. </p>
<p>Wisconsin has devoted extensive time and effort to policy planning,  		retaining and expanding its planning committee established under the systems  		development grant. The committee, called the Long Term Support Management  		Reference Group, includes directors of the offices of Medicaid, aging, health  		planning, state institutions, vocational rehabilitation, community services,  		policy and budget, program initiatives and the deputy secretary of the  		Department of Health and Social Services. The group meets every two weeks and  		rarely do members send substitutes. Policy issues that might be decided in a  		single division in another state are addressed through a team approach here.  		Since counties make the detailed administrative decisions governing all of the  		state's community care programs, developing state policies that help coordinate  		Wisconsin's multiple programs at the local level is a major priority. </p>
<p>Arkansas is the only one of the six state that has not undertaken a  		major interagency effort to develop state long term care policy. The nearest  		thing to it is a report prepared by the health planning agency with input from  		the other state agencies on future long term care needs. As part of an effort  		to develop a methodology for determining the need for new nursing home beds,  		the plan examined the supply of both nursing home care and home care,  		recommending that the availability of home care be significantly expanded.  		Arkansas state officials have been frustrated by their lack of staff to conduct  		long range strategic planning. Their recent receipt of a long term care  		planning grant, however, has now enabled them to initiate Project 2000, the  		goal of which is to develop a long term care plan for the state. </p>
<p><i>The experiences of these six states in developing a coordinated  		package of state policies offer two major development lessons for other states.  		First, where collaboration was most successful, substantial blocks of time  		during the initial planning stages were devoted to discussing philosophy and  		goals.</i> This emphasis was displayed constantly in Wisconsin where, in  		response to interview questions, state officials invariably began by discussing  		the state's value system. And that perspective was identical regardless of  		whether the Medicaid director, the director of the Bureau on Aging or the  		deputy director of the Department of Health and Social Services was expressing  		an opinion. Other states also noted the importance of obtaining consensus on  		goals and expectations, perhaps since they had to revisit this issue during  		their program implementation. While it may seem extravagant to spend  		substantial amounts of time on clarifying intentions instead of resolving  		"real" operational issues, in the long run it pays off in a common  		understanding among all the actors. </p>
<p><i>Second, especially during the early stages, it is important to get  		people at the highest level involved. While mid-level staff may actually do  		most of the work, the visible commitment to change and to interagency  		cooperation that is provided by top level participation lays a positive  		framework for resolving more difficult operational conflicts in the future.  		</i></p>
<p><b>GENERIC OR CATEGORICAL: POPULATIONS COVERED BY LONG TERM CARE  		POLICIES</b>. Several population groups in addition to the elderly have long  		term care needs, including the developmentally disabled, mentally ill, and  		physically handicapped. Although these populations have different  		characteristics, they share similar objectives: to receive needed care in their  		own homes when possible and maximize their own independence. In designing long  		term care systems, states must decide whether they will address only the needs  		of the elderly; whether they will establish similar yet separate delivery  		systems for older people and other populations; or whether they will design a  		generic system to serve all populations needing long term care. </p>
<p><i>The way this decision has been made in the study states depends in  		part on the type of advocacy group activity in the state -- if there is a  		coalition of different groups it is more likely that a generic approach will be  		taken, or at least a parallel approach for various populations. It depends also  		in part on historical considerations -- if community care services are already  		in place for one population group such as the developmentally disabled,  		programs for the elderly may develop separately as well. Finally, it depends in  		part on the organization of state government; the existence of a human services  		umbrella agency tends to lead to a more generic approach. </i></p>
<p>The six states approached this question in various ways. With its high  		proportion of older people, Arkansas focused primarily on the elderly. Some of  		Maryland's programs serve all long term care populations, particularly Medicaid  		personal care; however, Maryland has enough coordination problems with three  		state agencies involved in providing services to the elderly; there are  		different systems for other groups. </p>
<p>Illinois, Oregon and Maine have separate but parallel systems for the  		different populations. Illinois' Community Care Program initially served both  		the elderly and physically handicapped. After one year advocacy groups for both  		populations achieved a program split, with the Department on Aging  		administering the program for the elderly and the Department of Rehabilitation  		Services managing the program for the physically disabled. These two  		populations are now served through two state-funded programs and two 2176  		waiver programs administered through the two departments' delivery systems.  		Oregon's state reorganization affected only the management of services to the  		elderly; however, its first waiver application included the developmentally  		disabled as well as the elderly. Waiver services for these two groups were  		always separately managed and delivered. Now, as required by federal  		regulations, Oregon submits one waiver request for services to the elderly and  		another one for the developmentally disabled. </p>
<p>Maine's Home Based Care program was established to serve several  		populations. Five percent of program funds are used for non-elderly populations  		who are chronically or terminally ill. The remaining funds are allocated to  		three groups: the elderly who receive 75 percent of the funds, the physically  		handicapped who receive 20 percent, and adult protective services clients who  		receive the remaining 5 percent. While some generic program rules apply to all  		populations, separate state and local delivery systems manage the program for  		each population group. </p>
<p>Wisconsin's system is generic, with the Community Options Program  		serving five population groups -- the elderly, physically disabled,  		developmentally disabled, chronically mentally ill and chronic substance  		abusers -- through the same state and local delivery system. Several factors  		influenced this approach. First, there is a long history of program integration  		as reflected by the broad scope of both the Department of Health and Social  		Services and the Community Aids fund (which provides a flexible allocation of  		state funds to counties for social services directed to all needy populations).  		Second, the strong philosophy of stressing client choice, enhancing  		independence and strengthening the informal support system was sufficiently  		general to apply to all groups. Third, program designers wanted to create a  		very flexible program; by including five population groups, the resulting  		structure by necessity was not rigidly defined. While some support is growing  		for earmarking the Community Aids allocation to counties for expenditures  		devoted to each population group, there is minimal discussion of earmarking the  		Community Options Program. One of the main factors is political. In difficult  		fiscal times, would budgets closely identified with specific populations fare  		better in the legislature than a generic allocation to counties? To date  		Wisconsin has felt that the answer to this question is no. </p>
<p>Advice on this topic offered to other states by officials in the study's  		six states varied dramatically. As one would expect, Wisconsin advised  		integration. Oregon recommended separation by client group. Maine is in the  		middle, having created separate delivery systems for different population  		groups and now wondering if some integration might be in order. The answer  		seems to be based more on the previous patterns of providing services to  		various populations and political alliances than on inherent advantages to a  		particular program design. </p>
<p><b>NURSING HOME CAPACITY CONTROLS: RELATIONSHIP TO COMMUNITY BASED CARE  		POLICY</b>. Faced with the rapid growth of the elderly population, states  		expect their expenditures for long term care to grow. However, in the past  		decade they have attempted to channel that growth into services provided in the  		home -- as the elderly usually prefer -- instead of supporting the continued  		expansion of nursing home beds. An on-going concern is the current and future  		cost of maintaining the institutional expenditure base, which ultimately  		affects the amount of remaining state resources for expanding community based  		care. </p>
<p>Initiatives to slow the growth of Medicaid nursing home expenditures  		frequently focus on using certificate-of-need (CON) policy to limit the number  		of new beds constructed. Most of the study states subscribe to the philosophy  		that a bed built is a bed filled and have taken strong measures to limit  		growth. </p>
<p>Health planning agencies in each of the six states have devoted at least  		one chapter of their state health plan to community based care. Most have  		tightened their criteria for determining nursing home bed need. Three of the  		six have placed a moratorium on nursing home construction at some point during  		the last several years. <i>Moratoriums adopted in conjunction with an expansion  		of community care frequently provide a planning period for developing and  		implementing new approaches and serve to place these new initiatives in a  		context of fiscal responsibility and cost containment. "Reinvesting" the  		savings resulting from moratoriums into community based care has become a major  		component of some states' policy packages.</i> </p>
<p>Wisconsin, Arkansas, Maine and Oregon have severely limited the growth  		of the nursing home bed supply. Wisconsin has the longest running moratorium,  		begun in 1981 and renewed in each subsequent legislative session; it is  		currently extended through fiscal year 1989. Faced in 1981 with the nation's  		second highest ratio of nursing home beds per 1000 elderly, policy makers  		received widespread support for taking this action. </p>
<p>Arkansas had a two-year moratorium on nursing home expansion (1983 and  		1984). During this period an interagency task force was appointed to review the  		existing supply of long term care services, including both community based and  		nursing home care. Its final report recommended tightening nursing home bed  		need criteria and greatly expanding community care. Since then only 300 beds  		have been authorized and new state funded community services have been  		initiated to supplement Medicaid personal care. </p>
<p>Maine also adopted a two-year moratorium on nursing home construction  		(1979-1980). Like Arkansas, a gubernatorial task force appointed in 1979  		proposed tightly constrained bed growth and a substantial increase in community  		care. With Medicaid recipients comprising 75 percent of all Maine nursing home  		residents, the state legislature assumed responsibility for approving any  		additional nursing home beds. Authorizing new beds in essence commits state  		matching funds for future Medicaid expenditures, and only the legislature has  		the authority to appropriate state revenues. This policy very visibly links  		nursing home capacity to state long term care expenditures. </p>
<p>Oregon never adopted a moratorium, but it did significantly tighten its  		methodology for determining nursing home bed needs while expanding community  		care. Few beds have been approved since then, and officials note that, with the  		state's low bed occupancy rate, there is no pressure for more construction.  		</p>
<p>Each of these four states perceive a strong relationship among nursing  		home bed growth, Medicaid institutional expenses and funds remaining for  		community care. They have generally found collaborative interagency policy  		development very fruitful. Health planning officials are pleased with their  		role in advancing their state's objectives of shifting long term care growth to  		community care. And Medicaid directors emphasize the importance of nursing home  		capacity controls in containing the growth of their institutional expenditures.  		</p>
<p>The experience of Maryland and Illinois is in sharp contrast.  		Policymakers in those two states do not perceive a strong relationship between  		community care growth and institutional expansion. In fact in Illinois both  		Medicaid officials and health planning staff see bed expansion as a way to  		increase competition and thereby contain nursing home rate increases. Health  		planning officials have, however, established policies to encourage nursing  		home providers to become involved in community care by giving such facilities  		an advantage in CON approval. </p>
<p>Unlike the other states, Maryland has not encountered a major budget  		crisis over nursing home expenditures. Instead, rising hospital costs have been  		their major concern. As a result Maryland developed one of the first hospital  		prospective payment systems. The health planning agency has undertaken several  		endeavors to give community care more visibility, while favoring a simultaneous  		expansion of both nursing home and community care. State officials note,  		however, that nursing home costs are rising rapidly and may lead to a future  		budget crisis. </p>

</ol></td>
</tr></table><p>Freezing the existing bed supply has not been strongly opposed by the  		nursing home industry in any of the study states. As Douglas Nelson, former  		Wisconsin official noted at a recent NGA conference, "Wisconsin's moratorium  		created a regulated public monopoly that guaranteed existing nursing home  		operators a market and a monopoly that greatly increased the value of  		certificates of need and the facilities that they covered."<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Neither does the nursing home industry, except in Arkansas, appear to  		oppose the expansion of community based care. Almost all nursing home  		spokespersons note, however, that they resent the rhetoric used to advocate for  		increased public funds for in-home services. Especially resented are arguments  		that people do not want to enter a nursing homes and that home care will save  		money. </p>
<p>Some nursing homes have also become community care providers, but most  		have not. The low payment level for community care services seems to be the  		major stumbling block to greater participation. As one would expect, the  		nursing home industry usually strongly opposes pre-admission screening  		programs. This opposition has kept both Maine and Arkansas from implementing  		pre-admission screening programs statewide and has resulted in a screening  		program in Maryland with non-binding recommendations to clients. </p>
<p>Nursing home payment policies do not seem to be related directly to  		community care policies. Maryland and Illinois adopted case mix reimbursement  		systems in 1983. While their payment systems make it less profitable than it  		used to be for nursing homes to accept residents with lower care needs, the  		primary motivation was to make sure that heavier care persons would not be  		turned away and that these persons would receive the intensified services they  		needed. Oregon and Wisconsin are currently (1987) implementing case mix  		systems. Maine also is developing a case mix system and has over the past  		several years adjusted payments to accommodate changes in the severity of  		patients served. Arkansas uses flat rates. With freezes on the nursing home bed  		supply, the initiation of pre-admission screening programs and the expansion of  		community care options, the study states have found that on the average clients  		entering a nursing home are more impaired than in the past. In light of these  		changes states can expect to face pressures for increased per diem rates. </p>
<p><b>ROLE OF ADVOCACY GROUPS IN SHAPING STATE POLICY</b>. In each of the  		six study states, membership organizations of older people were very  		influential in the adoption of new state long term care policies. In  		Washington, D.C. most of the attention of these groups is focused on Social  		Security and Medicare. In state capitols their top concerns relate to long term  		care. </p>
<p><i>State officials in governors' offices and in numerous state agencies  		remarked on the symbiotic relationships established with advocacy groups as  		policy initiatives were advanced. Their experiences offer other states valuable  		lessons. Strong support by older people for community care was no accident, but  		rather the result of concerted efforts by state officials to make activists  		more realistically informed about long term care options. While these  		relationships facilitated the creation of new programs, they also shaped  		advocacy groups' perceptions of state limits in the amount of resources  		available for long term care. The recognition of overall cost constraints led  		to support on the part of advocacy groups for cost sharing and other attempts  		to target resources to persons who, because of income or functional impairment,  		are most in need of services. </i></p>
<p>In Maine, Illinois, Oregon and Wisconsin organized advocacy efforts were  		critical factors in achieving long term care system reform. In the other two  		states support of older people, although less organized, was also important in  		adopting some of the incremental measures. When the new systems are firmly  		established, organized advocacy groups become less involved. As legislators in  		some states noted, these programs appeal to a large constituency and do not  		need organized advocacy efforts to support program expansion. Older people  		continue to be involved in ongoing policy discussions, however. Because older  		people themselves actively participated in designing Oregon's system, for  		example, they remained actively invested in its implementation. In particular,  		when the tensions of rapid change became a threat to the system's continued  		existence Oregon embarked on its Negotiated Investment Strategy. Older people  		formed one of the negotiating teams along with separate teams of providers,  		area agency staff and state staff. State officials note the value of involving  		older people themselves in both soliciting their input and giving advocates a  		better understanding of management issues. </p>
<p>In Wisconsin, advocacy groups have also had an active role in overseeing  		program implementation. The Community Options Program serves all populations  		needing long term care including the elderly, developmentally disabled,  		physically handicapped and the chronically mentally ill. Organizations  		representing these groups formed a coalition to push for the program's  		enactment and now maintain that coalition for program oversight. Since official  		state policy emphasizes the involvement of client groups in serving as members  		of state and local advisory committees, the advocacy coalition has numerous  		individual members actively engaged in program operational issues. </p>
<p>The six states' experiences illustrate several principles related to the  		role of advocacy organizations. First, they are extremely influential in  		pressing for the adoption of state long term care initiatives. Second, in  		cooperation with state officials, they can understand states' fiscal limits and  		work within them. Finally, a long range strategy of supporting community care  		stimulates so much popular support that the role and influence of organized  		advocacy generally tends to decline as programs become more stable. </p>
<h3>State Agency Program Management</h3>
<p>At a recent NGA conference, Charles Reed, Assistant Secretary for Aging  		and Adult Services in Washington State noted that it would be easier to start  		from scratch in designing a long term care system than to try to put together a  		number of health, social services and aging systems that are already in  		place.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note4">4</a></font></sup> States, however,  		do not have that luxury. </p>
<p>Most state level human services agencies were created to address other  		issues, such as income maintenance, acute health care for poor families and  		children, food programs for low income persons of all ages, mental health, etc.  		Only recently has long term care policy for the elderly become a major issue  		for state government. </p>
<p>As a result, long term care programs and policies for the elderly tend  		to be scattered throughout various agencies in state government. These include  		the separate agencies or divisions administering Medicaid, the Older Americans  		Act, and the Social Services Block Grant, with the state Medicaid agency  		focusing on health care and the other two agencies dealing with supportive  		services. Health planning agencies, budget offices and policy research bureaus  		may also have a role. <i>The challenge to state officials is to find a way to  		integrate the resource allocation and program management activities of these  		various offices so that a coordinated system of care can be developed rather  		than a diffuse constellation of individual programs. Ultimately, the goal of  		these coordination efforts is to create the continuum of care that each  		individual agency rhetorically has embraced but cannot by itself achieve.</i>  		</p>
<p>In order to achieve this goal, a number of systems development issues  		must be considered: designing a single delivery system supported by multiple  		funding sources; developing eligibility criteria for individual programs to  		ensure equitable treatment of all clients according to their needs and  		resources; and examining the mix of community care services supported by each  		funding stream. Perhaps the most challenging aspect of systems development is  		addressing the relationship between community and institutional expenditures in  		order to strike an appropriate balance between the two models of care. This  		requires the intensive involvement of Medicaid agencies and budget offices in  		conjunction with the state agencies responsible for various social services  		programs. </p>
<p>Three basic models of state agency structures have emerged to manage  		long term care systems. One consolidates all long term care responsibilities  		covering both institutional and community based care into a single sole purpose  		agency; this involves major reorganization of state government. Another,  		somewhat less radical, model uses a human services umbrella agency structure,  		with some internal shifting of responsibilities and increased inter-division  		coordination. Frequently the State Unit on Aging and the Medicaid division  		share major responsibilities for managing long term care programs. The third,  		least radical, model retains independent cabinet level agencies for managing  		various programs, but establishes an official inter-agency long term care  		committee to at least keep agencies informed of each other's activities and  		preferably, to coordinate the development of interagency policies as well.  		<a href="strfrm.htm#tableIII-2">Table III-2</a> summarizes the management  		responsibilities of state agencies in the six study states. </p>
<p>Oregon has created a single agency, the Senior Services Division (SSD),  		within the Department of Human Resources to administer all long term care  		programs. Under the structure adopted in 1981, Medicaid long term care  		services, eligibility determination for income maintenance programs and adult  		protective services were transferred out of the Adult and Family Services  		Division (AFS) to SSD and combined with the agency on aging that was handling  		Older Americans Act programs and Project Independence. AFS central office staff  		managing these functions were transferred to the SSD central office; AFS  		district office staff were transferred to area agencies on aging.  		Responsibility for nursing home licensure and certification was transferred to  		SSD from the Health Division in 1987. </p>

</tr></table><p>Under this consolidation model, all long term care expenditures are  		placed in one budget, making resource allocations between community based and  		institutional care a direct and visible trade-off. This provides program  		managers with an incentive to give their nursing home caseloads as much  		scrutiny as their community based expenditures. (In fact local program managers  		suggest that too much emphasis is placed on keeping institutional expenditures  		down in relationship to expanding community care.) From a programmatic  		perspective this organizational structure also enhances linkages among various  		programs. For example, there are no inter-agency battles over which assessment  		form to use for determining eligibility for institutional and community care.  		</p>
<p>Oregon officials caution that this approach may not be right for every  		state.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note5">5</a></font></sup> Such a major  		reorganization requires the strong support of the affected state agencies, the  		local delivery system and older people themselves. </p>
<p>Arkansas and Maine have human services umbrella agencies encompassing  		the major long term care programs serving the elderly. They are both small  		states with small bureaucracies, which undoubtedly facilitates coordination. In  		both states the Aging division and the Medicaid division are the major actors.  		In both states the Aging agency and the Medicaid agency use the same delivery  		system for their long term care services and any serious disagreements between  		the two agencies have long since been resolved. </p>
<p>In Arkansas, until recently the Medicaid division provided all the  		funding for community care, with the aging division addressing most of the  		program development and operational issues. When state funds were appropriated  		to supplement Medicaid personal care services, the Aging division became  		responsible for managing the new program and adopted the Medicaid rules as  		operating policy. Arkansas created an intradepartmental long term care  		committee of mid-level staff chaired by the Division on Aging and Adult  		Services to address on-going operational issues. This committee has now been  		replaced by a working group created as part of Arkansas Project 2000, a  		recently initiated long term care planning project. </p>
<p>The Bureau of Maine's Elderly was both the leading advocate within state  		government for establishing the Home Based Care (HBC) program and was its major  		architect. As a result the Bureau became responsible for its implementation.  		Several years later a 2176 waiver program was developed jointly by the Medicaid  		and Aging agencies to secure Medicaid funding to expand the HBC program. This  		waiver program is administered by the Bureau of Medical Services, in  		coordination with the HBC program administered by Bureau of Maine's Elderly.  		Maine also has an intradepartmental long term care committee chaired by the  		Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Human Services, with the directors of  		the Bureau of Maine's Elderly, Bureau of Medical Services, and the Bureau of  		Rehabilitation as members. Placed outside the Department of Human Services yet  		within state government, the Maine Committee on Aging has been created to serve  		as an internal and external advocate. Most other states have an advisory  		committee on aging whose members are appointed by the governor; usually this  		group is staffed by the state aging agency. The Maine Committee on Aging has  		its own staff, who administer the long term care ombudsman program and hold an  		annual statewide conference for older people, co-sponsored by the Bureau of  		Maine's Elderly, to develop a legislative advocacy agenda for the following  		year. </p>
<p>Wisconsin also has a human service umbrella agency which administers all  		of its long term care programs. However, Wisconsin is a much larger state than  		Maine and Arkansas, with a significantly larger state bureaucracy. Several  		other factors also complicate state level coordination. First, Wisconsin's  		human services agency is the most comprehensive in the country -- it even  		includes the state correctional system. As a result many individual divisions  		and bureaus have responsibilities comparable to those of separate agencies in  		other states. Simply locating all these programs in one single department does  		not in any way guarantee coordination. Second, Wisconsin has created a generic  		long term care system serving many different populations. Therefore, not only  		is coordination needed among the Medicaid, aging, health planning, and social  		services block grant programs, but also with the program offices for mental  		health, developmental disabilities, the physically handicapped and drug and  		alcohol abuse. </p>
<p>Wisconsin has deliberately not created a singular entity with  		consolidated authority over all long term care services. In fact numerous state  		officials emphasize that decentralization of responsibility at the state level  		is a factor contributing to the state's success. Having many persons involved  		in decision-making, they argue, helps to take advantage of differing expertise,  		enables more people to claim ownership of new policies, brings divergent  		viewpoints to the table, and stimulates greater creativity. However, the agency  		did create a new Bureau of Long Term Support to administer the generic  		Community Options Program and to serve as a focal point for coordination of all  		community long term support services. </p>
<p>Because of its reliance on coordination rather than consolidation,  		Wisconsin makes extensive use of its Long Term Care Support Management  		Reference Group and associated work groups. With Wisconsin's multi-population  		approach to long term care systems development, this seems essential. The  		members of the Management Reference Group include the directors of the offices  		of Medicaid, aging, health planning, state institutions, vocational  		rehabilitation, developmental disabilities, community services, policy and  		budget, program initiatives and the Deputy Director of the Department of Health  		and Social Services. The directors rarely send substitutes. </p>
<p>While the amount of time devoted to this process seems excessive, the  		results are impressive. All individual program decisions which might possibly  		have an effect on related community care programs are brought to the group such  		as changes in eligibility criteria, scope of services or reporting  		requirements. Subgroups have studied such questions as whether the state should  		amend its Medicaid state plan to include case management as a covered service,  		whether to apply for Medicaid waivers, and whether the state should adopt a  		case mix nursing home reimbursement system. </p>
<p>The group is chaired by the Department's Director of Policy and Budget  		and meets every two weeks. The day before each meeting, the directors of the  		Community Services Division's program offices meet to formulate the Division's  		position on issues to be resolved during the Reference Group meeting and to  		discuss any management problems encountered with counties. The program  		directors also share expertise and contribute specialized knowledge to the  		implementation of COP. All of these coordination activities obviously consume a  		great deal of senior state officials' time. However, no one identified this as  		a problem or felt that it was time not well spent. </p>
<p>Illinois and Maryland have separate cabinet level agencies responsible  		for various aspects of their long term care programs. Like the other states,  		however, they have created structures to enhance the coordination of program  		management. </p>
<p>Two agencies in Illinois are responsible for long term care programs for  		the elderly. The Department of Public Aid manages the state's Medicaid program,  		including payments to nursing homes and handles all contacts with HCFA  		regarding federal reporting and claims processing for the 2176 Waiver Program.  		The Department on Aging manages the state's Community Care Program, which is  		partly funded through state general revenues and partly through the Medicaid  		waiver. Within Medicaid rules, the Department on Aging develops the program's  		operational policies, monitors service providers and processes provider  		payments for both state funded and Medicaid funded services. </p>
<p>State officials note that an unexpected benefit of the Medicaid waivers  		has been greater cooperation among state human services agencies. The  		Department of Public Aid, the Department on Aging and the Department of  		Rehabilitation (which manages a waiver program for the physically handicapped)  		have formed a work group to address ongoing waiver implementation. Issues  		addressed include responses to HCFA assessments, waiver applications and  		renewals, joint training sessions for state and local staff, and state budget  		requests. </p>
<p>Medicaid program staff began involving staff from the other agencies in  		conference calls to the HCFA regional office when seeking clarification on  		Medicaid rules, following up on HCFA assessments and responding to federal  		questions regarding waiver renewals and amendments. Each Department noted the  		positive effect of this practice on interagency relationships in reducing  		misunderstandings, avoiding paranoia and giving the operating agencies a direct  		opportunity to follow-up on policy interpretations. </p>
<p>No serious consideration has been given to reorganizing state government  		to consolidate the separate departments responsible for various human services  		functions. The relevant departments appear to have few turf battles and are  		able to resolve policy differences. This process has undoubtedly been helped by  		the governor's office and the Bureau of the Budget, both of which place great  		emphasis on the importance of cooperation. </p>
<p>In Maryland things are more complicated. The Department of Health and  		Mental Hygiene administers the Medicaid program which funds nursing home care,  		personal care and adult day care; it funds and supervises the pre-admission  		screening program through the geriatric assessment service; and it licenses and  		certifies nursing homes. The Department of Human Resources administers the  		In-Home Aides program and provides case management through its local offices.  		The Office on Aging administers the Older Americans Act, manages the Gateway II  		program and staffs the IAC. These three state agencies have a long history of  		disagreements over the division of responsibilities and authority. </p>
<p>In the late 1970's and early 1980's aging advocates were pressing for  		the creation of a single department where all long term care resources and  		other programs for the elderly could be consolidated. Instead the legislature  		created the Interagency Committee on Aging in 1982. </p>
<p>To address coordination problems across the three agencies, the IAC was  		given a broad mandate, including developing an interagency annual budget  		request for aging services and setting policy for the Gateway II program. Most  		of its activities to date have centered on Gateway II, but it has also  		consolidated the three agency budgets for services to the elderly into one  		request that all three agencies support. As the Gateway II program becomes  		fully operational, the IAC has the potential to address other issues. </p>
<p>Coordination has improved, as evidenced by the successful implementation  		of a new pre-admission screening program, and development of a standard  		assessment tool not only for pre-admission screening but for all community care  		programs. But the difficulty with which related issues were resolved (such as  		selecting which local agencies would administer the screening program)  		indicates the need for further coordination. </p>
<p>Maryland's situation is unique among the six study states. Maryland's  		three state human services agencies are all equally involved in community care  		services. In the other five states, one agency (or at most two) dominates. In  		addition, each state agency in Maryland has its own local delivery system and  		all three local systems want a role. Also there is no one single program or  		financing source dominating the community care system in Maryland, so there is  		no automatic presumption about which should be the lead state agency. Instead  		Medicaid, the Social Service Block Grant, state general revenue funds and the  		Older Americans Act form a delicate balance. In summary, Maryland's  		coordination problems seem to result from the strengths of three separate  		systems, each created for purposes other than delivering long term care  		services to the elderly, and each anxious to maintain and expand their current  		role. </p>
<p>The organizational approaches used by these six states can provide some  		guidance to other states. The structure of agencies in state government is not  		easily changed to respond to new issues, particularly in the management of  		human services. Traditional ways of administering programs significantly shape  		the approach used to organize and manage community care programs. </p>
<p>Oregon has taken the most dramatic step and reorganized major parts of  		state government to create an agency whose sole purpose is to manage all of the  		state's long term care programs. Of equal importance is Oregon's decision to  		reorganize their local delivery system to create one local agency responsible  		for long term care. Without reorganization at both levels, significant  		consolidation would not have been achieved. The advantages of this option are  		significant, primarily in being able to mesh policy and resource allocation for  		both community and nursing home care. However, states considering it should  		recognize that such a dramatic change makes it imperative to have the broad  		support of most or all of the affected organizations. Even with that support,  		as was present in Oregon, be prepared for several rocky years. </p>
<p>Arkansas, Maine and Illinois without any major reorganization have  		achieved good management coordination at the state level. In each of the three,  		the aging and Medicaid agencies have jointly developed their community care  		systems and use the same local delivery system for their programs. In contrast  		to Oregon, the main component missing in Arkansas, Maine and Illinois is  		consolidated control over both institutional and community care programs.  		Wisconsin's management model is based on coordination rather than  		consolidation, which is probably essential given its policy goals. With so many  		different programs and population groups comprising Wisconsin's institutional  		and community based long term care systems, one single sole purpose entity is  		not feasible. Wisconsin's state organizational structure seems to work well for  		two reasons. First, all the relevant senior level officials are highly  		committed to improving community care systems and therefore willingly devote  		substantial time to this issue -- reflecting a high priority sustained over  		several years. Second, for all age groups and all programs, Wisconsin uses a  		single delivery system at the local level --county government. Other states  		attempting to replicate Wisconsin's generic approach will have a much more  		difficult time if both of these factors are not present. </p>
<p>For states with structures similar to Maryland where reorganization may  		not be politically or administratively feasible, establishing an interagency  		coordinating committee is useful. In contrast to other models, this one  		requires more active involvement of the Governor's staff and the staff of the  		Budget Office in sorting out priorities. </p>
<p>The agencies in the six study states that administer the Social Services  		Block Grant (SSBG) had varying involvement in community care systems  		development. In Oregon and Illinois, state general revenues rather than SSBG  		funds support services for older people, so in those two states, the social  		services agency was not a key player. In Wisconsin and Maryland, however,  		substantial amounts of SSBG are used for in-home services for the target  		populations, and as a result, the agencies responsible for those programs  		exerted great influence. In Arkansas and Maine, SSBG is divided at the state  		level among programs for eligible populations. Planning for the use of those  		funds is undertaken by the aging system with the state SSBG agency managing  		provider payments. The SSBG agencies in these two states have a peripheral role  		in community care systems development. </p>
<p>The six states offered several pieces of advice to others:</p>
<ul><li>Assign your best staff to community care systems development.</li>
<li>Maintain the ongoing involvement of senior state officials in both  		  policy development and program management. This involvement sends a message  		  about the importance of long term care; assigning lower level staff to  		  interagency management committees can trigger lower level participation among  		  all agencies, running the risk of committee members lacking the necessary  		  status to make final decisions.</li>
<li>Involve all relevant agencies; if a system is being designed  		  exclusively for older people, at a minimum Medicaid, aging, and the budget  		  office must be included. If nursing home capacity controls are part of the  		  policy package, health planning and agencies managing state institutions have a  		  role. If substantial amounts of Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) Funds are  		  used for older people, the social services agency is also important.</li>
<li>Despite exemplary efforts to improve coordination, to strengthen  		  management control and to allocate resources wisely, a comprehensive system  		  cannot be built with federal funds alone. State funds are needed to cover  		  either clients or services that fall between the cracks of federally financed  		  programs. </li>
</ul><p>Finally, state officials offer divergent views on how ambitiously and  		comprehensively states should approach management changes. From Oregon: Get as  		much as possible under control from the start. From Wisconsin: If you get all  		participants to embrace the same philosophy, effective coordination will  		follow. Both views describe the two states' successes. </p>

<p>A major goal of state long term care initiatives is to overcome the  		fragmentation of existing programs while making better use of new resources for  		community care. In many states, this will require a reorganization of local  		human service delivery systems. Like human services agencies at the state  		level, local service delivery systems were created for a myriad of purposes;  		administering community based long term care programs for the frail elderly is  		not their sole responsibility. And those local agencies that do manage  		community care programs are frequently responsible for only one part of the  		picture. </p>
<p><i>How programs are managed at the local level is perhaps even more  		important than bow state responsibilities are organized. Older people come in  		direct contact with local agencies -- and their differing eligibility criteria,  		service packages and funding sources. If state policies are successful, older  		people will have access to appropriate care without having to contact multiple  		agencies to receive services for which they are eligible. Therefore, state long  		term care policies frequently designate a single local agency in each part of  		the state to manage all publicly financed community care programs. Usually  		these local agencies conduct client assessments, administer pre-admission  		screening programs and provide case management. </i></p>
<p><b>STATE DESIGNATION OF LOCAL AGENCIES</b>. This designation is likely  		to be one of the most hotly debated decisions made by states. Three of the  		states studied --Arkansas, Oregon, and Maine -- chose area agencies on aging.  		Wisconsin and Maryland required the lead local agency to be part of county  		government, but left the specific choice up to county elected officials.  		Illinois selected its local lead agencies through a competitive bidding  		process. In each of the six states, decisions were based on both an assessment  		of the strengths of one agency's capacities to carry out a lead agency role and  		of the weaknesses of others. </p>
<p>Although Arkansas, Oregon and Maine all chose area agencies on aging,  		they had different reasons for doing so. In Arkansas in the late 1970s, there  		were no other local agencies serving older people. Local offices of the State  		Health Department were focused mainly on maternal and child health care; local  		offices of the State Department of Human Services were primarily intake points  		for income maintenance programs; there were few private nonprofit Medicare  		certified home health agencies; and there were no proprietary home health  		agencies. The State Office on Aging and the area agencies on aging were strong  		advocates for home care services and as a result became responsible for the  		system's development. </p>
<p>In Oregon, the state and local delivery system was designed by a  		commission appointed by the Governor. Its recommendations, adopted by the  		legislature, gave area agencies two options for their administrative  		structures. If an area agency was a part of local government, it could choose  		to manage all long term care programs, including Medicaid, state funded Project  		Independence and the Older Americans Act. In addition, the area agency would be  		responsible for eligibility determination, service authorization, case  		management and pre-admission screening. If an area agency on aging was not part  		of local government, it could seek administrative attachment to a governmental  		unit or could opt to maintain its current responsibilities (OAA and Project  		Independence) without adding Medicaid, case management, pre-admission  		screening, etc. District offices of the state Senior Services Divisions would  		continue performing the functions not assumed by area agencies. The area  		agency/local government link was a compromise between the elderly  		constituencies' preference for the area agencies on aging as the lead agency  		and government's need for Medicaid accountability. Most of Oregon's area  		agencies have opted to attach to a local government unit and assume the full  		set of responsibilities. </p>
<p>The other alternative available to the state was to designate district  		offices of the state as lead local managers, leaving area agencies on aging  		with only the Older Americans Act. This alternative was not supported by older  		people, who preferred the area agency structure with its history of involving  		the elderly in advisory committees and advocacy initiatives. Since, however,  		area agencies would be managing a large and complex program (namely Medicaid),  		the state insisted on accountability through local government. </p>
<p>In Maine area agencies on aging were chosen as the lead agencies after  		heated turf battles with the Medicare certified home health agencies. Area  		agencies were given an edge due to a state requirement that mandated case  		management functions but prohibited Home Based Care funds to be used for this  		purpose. With their Older Americans Act funds, area agencies on aging had other  		resources that could be allocated to case management.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Wisconsin and Maryland have given county government lead responsibility,  		with locally elected officials choosing the specific agency. Wisconsin gives  		counties two choices. They can select either the Social Services Department,  		which administers Supportive Home Care, special supplements to SSI for persons  		requiring extensive home care services and most income maintenance programs, or  		they can choose the County "51" Boards administering programs for the  		developmentally disabled, the mentally ill, and the chemically dependent.  		Eighty percent of the counties chose the Social Services Department.  		Wisconsin's state funded grants to family caregivers of persons with  		Alzheimer's Disease are also administered by county government. One third of  		the counties use Social Services Departments; another one third use "51"  		boards; and in another one third the program is managed by county aging units.  		Wisconsin has six private non-profit area agencies on aging covering  		multi-county areas and county aging units in all 72 counties. County aging  		units are funded by both area agencies and the state Bureau on Aging with funds  		from Older Americans Act and state general revenues. </p>
<p>Maryland has three human service delivery systems. The Department of  		Human Resources has local Departments of Social Services in each county,  		staffed by state employees. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has  		local Departments of Health, staffed by county employees. And the Office on  		Aging has designated county government to be the home for area agencies on  		aging, also staffed by county employees. The Department of Social Services  		provides case management and administers the in-home aides program. The Health  		Department includes the Geriatric Assessment Service, which conducts  		assessments of older people for community care services and pre-admission  		screening. Area agencies on aging manage Older Americans Act programs. </p>
<p>County officials designate one of these three agencies to serve as the  		lead for managing Gateway II. Of Maryland's 24 counties, 17 have chosen area  		agencies on aging, 4 have chosen health departments and 3 have chosen  		departments of social services. The two local agencies not chosen as lead are  		members of the County Interagency Committee on Aging. </p>
<p>Illinois selected its local agencies, Care Coordination Units (CCUs),  		through a joint designation process with the area agencies. Operating in 63  		subdivisions of the state, the CCUs are prohibited from being direct providers  		of Community Care Program services. About one third of the CCUs are home health  		agencies; another one third are senior services agencies; and the remaining  		third are a mix of family service agencies, health clinics, mental health  		centers, etc. The CCUs are the local entry point for all older people seeking  		publicly funded community care. County government in Illinois does not have a  		role in managing human services and the area agencies have been given a program  		support role, functioning under contract on behalf of the state. </p>
<p>States seem generally satisfied with their decisions. Oregon officials  		noted that at first area agencies had a difficult time managing the state's  		Medicaid waiver program since they were accustomed to the flexibility of the  		Older Americans Act. In retrospect, they recommend that other states following  		a similar course give more attention in the early stages to intensive training  		seminars on Medicaid management. Maine experienced similar but less major  		problems since Maine's area agencies began with smaller programs. Arkansas'  		area agencies have been the state's only Medicaid personal care providers since  		the program began and therefore were able to become gradually accustomed to the  		Medicaid rules. All three states noted that area agencies had proven to be  		cost-effective managers; yet some state officials question whether it is wise  		for the area agencies to potentially jeopardize their advocacy mission by  		devoting most of their time and attention to program management. </p>
<p>Two of the three states using area agencies on aging (Oregon and Maine)  		and the two states using counties (Maryland and Wisconsin) are sometimes  		frustrated by what they perceive to be a lack of sufficient control over local  		management agencies. State officials have obviously given this issue a good  		deal of thought, and are torn in two directions. On the one hand, they believe  		localities should have substantial flexibility to shape community care services  		to respond to individual client needs. <i>On the other band, states are under  		tremendous pressure to run tightly managed, cost effective programs. Some  		commented that a state run system would be ideal while at the same time saying  		that one of their system's strengths is the latitude given to localities.</i>  		</p>
<p>The power of persuasion is identified as one of the best tools available  		to state officials in convincing local entities to comply with their policies.  		In Wisconsin state officials note that county governments have significant  		influence in the state legislature; it is, therefore, difficult to establish  		policies with tough enforcement provisions. In Maryland the perceived  		independence of local agencies makes coordination at the state level more  		difficult, since each agency questions whether their state counterparts will be  		able to get agreements carried out across the state. </p>
<p>Oregon and Maine have similar perceptions of their relationships with  		their local agencies. In those states, area agencies on aging are conducting  		some functions that have traditionally been responsibilities of state  		government such as authorizing the expenditure of Medicaid funds on behalf of  		individual clients. Oregon's long term care legislation gives the Senior  		Services Division the power to fire (but not hire) an area agency director and  		to also to withdraw all program funds. Other states may not even have those  		options; usually the only option is to de-designate the organization operating  		as the area agency and appoint a new agency -- a process that can be tied up in  		appeals for months. State officials suggest that less drastic measures need to  		be available as intermediate courses of action if state government continues to  		turn over more authority to local agencies, especially to those whose private  		non-profit status removes them from direct accountability to local publicly  		elected officials. </p>
<p><b>RESPONSIBILITIES ASSIGNED TO LOCAL AGENCIES</b>. State Officials  		agree that a local administrative structure is necessary for the management of  		long term care programs. At the very least, a local agency is needed to serve  		as an entry point to the long term care delivery system. Conducting client  		assessments, providing case management and administering pre-admission  		screening programs are the primary responsibilities of local lead agencies in  		all the study states. Beyond these basic functions, however, there is  		significant variation in the roles assigned to local agencies by state  		government. Each of the six study states began with the philosophy that older  		people would be better served if maximum flexibility was given to local  		agencies in developing community care programs. Yet over time, each state has  		gradually taken steps to tighten its control of program management. In some  		cases, significant flexibility was deliberately given to local agencies in  		order to experiment with new approaches. Most frequently this demonstration  		mentality was present when pilot programs were established with less than  		statewide coverage. But in some places local decision making was fostered  		because there was limited experience across the country that could provide  		models for operating large statewide community care systems. Now states are  		examining and re-examining how much responsibility should be delegated to local  		agencies and under what conditions. </p>
<p>At one extreme are Illinois and Oregon, which have exerted very strong  		state control over many aspects of their systems. Since these two states  		operate the largest elderly community care entitlement programs of the six  		study states, the significant level of state authority is perhaps expected.  		Equally important, however, is their tradition of centralized human services  		administration. Ironically, officials in Oregon who were not directly involved  		in program management frequently commented on the local flexibility built into  		their community care system, and wondered if the state should have more  		control. Given that most other human service functions are performed directly  		by state staff in Oregon, long term care programs appear by comparison to be  		very autonomous. </p>
<p>At the other extreme is Wisconsin, with a structure designed to give  		maximum discretion to county government in managing community care services.  		State human services officials want a system that could provide almost any  		assistance needed by an individual to remain living at home. This philosophy  		meshes well with the state legislature's desire to avoid placing any undue  		burden on counties by adopting uniform state rules.</p>
<p>Arkansas, Maine and Maryland are in between, tightening their control  		over time yet remaining committed to local flexibility. A review of selected  		functions which could be performed by either state or local agencies  		illustrates variations across states in delegating management  		responsibilities.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<p><b>Long term care planning and systems coordination</b>. The relative  		emphasis placed on reviewing local service capacity, identifying service gaps  		and planning for future needs was highly related to the authority given to  		local agencies in deciding which services should be financed with public funds.  		If those decisions are made by state government, as in Illinois and Oregon,  		less attention was given to this local planning function. Likewise, since these  		same states used a consolidation model with one or two large programs financing  		community based care, coordination among various local agencies and programs  		was less problematic. The other states, however placed a substantial emphasis  		on these functions. </p>
<p>Maryland's Gateway II program, for example, gives counties some flexible  		service funds in exchange for achieving better coordination among existing  		programs. Each year counties submit to the state a coordination plan which also  		serves as the application for Gateway II funds. The county Inter-agency  		Committee on Aging, consisting of the Area Agency on Aging, the Social Service  		Department and the Health Department identify which agency will provide case  		management, client assessment and overall fiscal management for the Gateway II  		program. In addition, the plan specifies how client referral and service  		provision are to be coordinated. </p>
<p>In Maine, in order to receive Home Based Care funds area agencies on  		aging in Maine prepare a regional plan and hold a public hearing to which a  		state specified list of agencies must be invited. A description of the case  		management process, types of services offered, provider selection process and  		methods for coordinating with other programs are components of the plan. This  		process solicits feedback on the current operation of the Home Based Care  		Program and identifies needed improvements. </p>
<p>In Arkansas, beginning in 1985, state resources are used to fund a  		planning staff position called Community Based Care Developer for each of the  		state's eight area agencies on aging. These staff determine service gaps in the  		community and stimulate new programs to fill those gaps. In contrast to  		Maryland and Wisconsin, Arkansas' concern is to create new services as opposed  		to coordinating a fairly well established infrastructure of existing providers.  		The state Division on Aging and Adult Services has prepared technical  		assistance manuals and conducted training programs to help the Community Based  		Care Developers develop plans for supportive housing, family caregiver training  		and Alzheimer's support groups. </p>
<p>Wisconsin places a great deal of importance on county plans to implement  		the Community Options Program, with the plan serving as the county's  		application for state funds. A county Long Term Support Planning Committee must  		be established with its core membership including representatives of various  		agencies and population groups specified by state policies. The plan reflects  		coordination agreements with relevant public and private agencies administering  		community care services, with particular emphasis on specifying how the client  		assessment and case management functions will be carried out. In keeping with  		its philosophy of designing individually tailored care plans, the state does  		not request a proposed annual budget from counties for specific service  		expenditures; such a requirement state officials believe would limit the  		creativity of counties to respond to specific client needs. To assure that  		services to older people are adequately addressed, the county long term care  		committee must include an older consumer and a representative of the county  		commission on aging. In addition, the state Bureau on Aging has prepared  		guidelines for area agencies on aging to use in reviewing plans from counties  		in their regions prior to state approval. </p>
<p>While many state officials continue to strongly support a required local  		planning process, they note that its usefulness decreases as programs mature.  		Soon what were once innovative program initiatives become permanent, and new  		coordination approaches become routine. </p>
<p><b>Selecting and contracting with providers</b>. States use a variety of  		processes to select service providers. In Wisconsin, counties select all  		providers. In Illinois, the state selects all providers of Community Care  		Program services through a competitive bidding process. Oregon, Arkansas, Maine  		and Maryland use a combination of processes. </p>
<p>In Oregon, area agencies have the option of managing their own  		competitive bidding process for Medicaid waiver services and Oregon Project  		Independence, or they may ask the state to include bids for their area in a  		statewide announcement handled by the state agency. In Arkansas, the state has  		designated area agencies to be the direct providers of Medicaid personal care  		services in six of the state's eight geographic districts. For the Social  		Services Block Grant, the Department of Human Services gives each division a  		planning allocation for negotiating contracts to serve certain population  		groups. The Division of Aging and Adult Services divides its allocation among  		the state's eight districts, giving area agencies on aging the responsibility  		of determining how funds will be spent in their area and selecting the  		providers. The actual service contract is written between the provider and the  		Department of Human Services. Maine follows a similar procedure for managing  		its Social Services Block Grant. The Department of Human Services negotiates  		service contracts, but allocates to aging a designated number of homemaker  		service units. Area agencies on aging select providers for both the state  		funded Home Based Care program and Medicaid Waiver services. Maryland uses  		three different processes. For Medicaid personal care services, individual  		providers are located by a nurse who is under contract with the state. For  		in-home aides, local offices of the Department of Human Resources select  		providers from a list of vendors approved by the state. For Gateway II,  		providers are selected locally. </p>
<p>In five of the six states, there is some local discretion in selecting  		service providers but there is no clear cut distinction related to funding  		source. For example in three states -- Oregon, Maine and Wisconsin -- Medicaid  		providers are chosen by localities. Again, the procedures followed at the two  		extremes, Illinois (state centralization) and Wisconsin (county management),  		are largely determined by tradition and political culture. </p>
<p><b>Service authorization</b>. Under a community care program,  		authorizing the provision of services is equivalent to spending public funds.  		As will be discussed in greater detail in <a href="strfrm.htm#access">Chapter IV</a>, all  		states have separated service authorization from most service delivery but have  		vested the local management agency with the ability to authorize service  		provision. </p>
<p><i>In summary, states have delegated significant authority to local  		management agencies, including some areas like service authorization and  		provider selection that have been traditional functions of state government. It  		should not be surprising, therefore, that developing and maintaining  		cooperative relationships between state and local agencies is a topic of some  		concern. </i></p>
<p>Advice from all six states focused on maintaining active formal and  		informal lines of communications with local agencies. State agencies in  		Arkansas and Maine hold monthly meetings with area agencies to review  		operational issues. In Maryland the local lead agencies designated under the  		Gateway II program meet with staff of the IAC every two months. Illinois and  		Wisconsin hold several training sessions a year for local management agency  		staff. </p>
<p>Oregon has the most unique approach to state/local relationships. In  		1984 serious tensions erupted throughout Oregon's state and local service  		delivery system. With such rapid and far reaching changes in the organization  		and delivery of long term care programs, the state agency, area agencies,  		providers and the advocacy groups were all engaged in major battles with each  		other. Oregon took a drastic step; a consultant was hired to mediate a  		Negotiated Investment Strategy -- a process for identifying major disagreements  		and attempting to reach some resolution. Four teams of five members each were  		formed, representing the state agency, area agencies, service providers and  		elderly advocate groups. These teams met for a full day every other week for  		more than six months. During that time, major state policies covering a range  		of topics such as reimbursement systems, monitoring, provider selection,  		financial audits, etc. were developed through the negotiations of the four  		teams. In the end, a report titled "Shared Roles and Responsibilities for  		Delivery of Services Through the Oregon Senior Services System" was prepared to  		document all policies adopted through the mediation process. </p>
<p>Although the undertaking was risky for the state agency, since in effect  		it was relinquishing significant policymaking authority to a mediation process,  		the Division of Senior Services notes that the process was a major success. It  		gave all participants a better understanding of the federal constraints placed  		on the system and a common set of goals and expectations. </p>
<p>Established as an outgrowth of that mediation process, the Program  		Management Council, composed of five Senior Service Division staff and five  		area agency directors meets every six weeks to discuss new policies and program  		requirements. While the group tries to operate on a consensus basis, all final  		policy decisions are the responsibility of the director of the Senior Services  		Division. </p>
<p>Officials from other states also emphasize the importance of actively  		soliciting the advice of local program agencies in developing operating  		policies. Maine's Medicaid director, who was formerly the state's aging  		director, suggested that this advice is especially pertinent to Medicaid  		programs. Often operating with state centralized authority, seeking out local  		input may not be the norm for Medicaid agencies. </p>
<p>Another recommendation offered to other states is -- don't try to  		control every detail of local administration. Instead of worrying about  		process, hold the local delivery system accountable for client outcomes. To be  		effective, however, this approach requires the establishment of a monitoring  		system that will measure outcomes rather than program requirements. </p>
<h2><a name="access" id="access">IV. ACCESS TO LONG TERM CARE SERVICES</a></h2>
<p>In designing community based care systems, states are of necessity  		dealing with multiple programs. In order to overcome the fragmentation of these  		existing programs as well as make better use of new resources being allocated  		to long term care, states are changing how older people enter the long term  		care system and how they become eligible for services. This chapter will  		explore four major aspects of client access to care including:</p>
<ul><li><b>Financial eligibility determination</b> -- Client financial  		  eligibility criteria are a direct function of the amount of program funds  		  available for long term care services. In all states client income is used to  		  limit the number of persons receiving fully subsidized public services, thereby  		  allocating resources to those least able to pay for care. Most states also use  		  cost-sharing policies to identify how much eligible individuals are expected to  		  contribute to the cost of their care.</li>
<li><b>Functional eligibility determination</b> -- Most of the six  		  states' long term care programs provide services to only those older persons  		  who have impairment levels equivalent to those required for nursing home  		  placement.</li>
<li><b>Case management</b> -- Developing individual care plans is  		  particularly important when there are multiple programs with differing  		  eligibility criteria and service providers. In all the states local case  		  management agencies serve as agents of state government in authorizing payment  		  for the specific type and amount of services in individual care plans.</li>
<li><b>Pre-admission screening</b> -- Increasingly states are trying to  		  make sure that only older persons who cannot be served in the community enter a  		  nursing home. One effective way to do so is to integrate access to  		  institutional and community based care creating a single entry point for both.  		  This helps older people learn about services that could defer nursing home  		  entry. </li>
</ul><p>All these functions, with the frequent exception of financial  		eligibility determination, are carried out in the six study states by the  		state-designated local management agencies. The previous chapter discussed  		state considerations in selecting case management agencies and their management  		responsibilities extending beyond their core functions. This chapter addresses  		their core functions. </p>
<p>Within the context of this analysis, eligibility determination, case  		management and pre-admission screening programs are examined as integral  		components of statewide service delivery systems. In particular, emphasis is  		placed on how states use case management agencies to translate state policies  		into service provision. Since this study is a comparative analysis, not an  		outcomes evaluation, judgments cannot be made about which state's assessment  		tool most effectively identifies persons at risk of institutionalization or  		which pre-admission screening program keeps more people out of nursing homes.  		Extensive studies have been conducted on these and other similar topics.  		Instead, this study compares and contrasts how six states have designed large  		statewide systems of care, integrating major program components such as client  		assessment, case management and pre-admission screening. Service access  		mechanisms are integral components of community based care systems. In an  		institutional setting all services are provided under one roof, and after  		entering a nursing home, older people are usually eligible for all available  		services. In a community based care system needed services are often delivered  		by a variety of different providers. By establishing care management systems, a  		package of community care services can be provided which is almost as  		comprehensive as care provided in a nursing home. </p>
<p>In addition to helping older people link up with needed community care,  		service access mechanisms serve a second important function -- controlling  		utilization of publicly financed programs. Unlike nursing home care, community  		based services are not packaged and paid for by one comprehensive fee -- unless  		capitated financing mechanisms are used. Also older people actively seek  		community based care services, while going to great lengths to avoid nursing  		home placement. The combination of these two factors -- piecemeal financing of  		community services and strong preferences of older people to remain in their  		own homes -- stimulates service demand, pointing to the need for prioritizing  		individual access to care, controlling service utilization and thereby  		containing overall public cost. </p>
<p><i>Thus, access mechanisms both help older people enter the system and  		also keep out persons not meeting the functional or financial criteria for  		program participation. Despite a significant expansion of state revenues  		devoted to community based services, public funds are still inadequate to  		address all long term care needs. Therefore states have had to make painful  		choices in selecting population groups to cover. </i></p>
<h3>Financial Eligibility Criteria</h3>
<p>Financial eligibility criteria are one policy tool used by states to  		prioritize the population to receive publicly supported long term care  		services. These criteria are a function of three variables. The first is the  		amount of state resources available. The second is a perception of the scope of  		the state's responsibility for financing long term care services. The third is  		a policy decision as to whether to create a system which can be accessed by all  		persons, with higher income persons paying a large share (or all) of their  		support costs. </p>
<p>In none of the six states was there a philosophical inclination to  		provide universal public support for community based care without regard to a  		client's income. Rather, all six states viewed their role as strengthening the  		ability of families to care for their older relatives; expanding the service  		delivery infrastructure so that moderate income persons would have improved  		access to partially subsidized care; and finally financing care for persons  		with low incomes. <i>There were no protracted debates over whether services  		should be provided on an ability to pay basis; the only question was how to  		translate this philosophy to operational policy</i>. </p>
<p>There are two ways of using financial criteria to define target  		populations. One is to establish an eligibility ceiling, with persons having  		incomes above the specified level prohibited from receiving any program  		benefits. The second is to use client cost sharing provisions to set sliding  		fee scales based on income. The six study states used a combination of the two.  		</p>
<p><b>MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA</b>. For Medicaid funded services,  		persons who are categorically eligible are subject to an income ceiling;  		persons who qualify for Medicaid as a result of medically needy provisions are,  		in principle, subject to cost sharing since they are required to spend down to  		medically needy income levels. In addition to the eligibility policies adopted  		for coverage of medical services, there is a multitude of technical provisions  		relating only to Medicaid eligibility for nursing home care. Individually these  		technicalities may not have much effect on eligibility determination; however  		their combined effect can be substantial. An in-depth review of all states'  		Medicaid eligibility policies has recently been conducted by the National  		Governors' Association.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note8">8</a></font></sup>  		Since the primary focus of this study is on building community care systems,  		only those provisions relevant to eligibility for care provided outside of a  		nursing home are examined here. </p>
<p>In addition to nursing home coverage, the Medicaid program finances some  		community based services in each of the six states. Personal care services  		provided under the Medicaid state plan are used extensively in Arkansas and  		Maryland; 2176 waivers finance some services for the elderly in Illinois,  		Oregon, Maine, and Wisconsin. (For a more detailed analysis of Medicaid  		eligibility criteria applicable to community based care in each of the six  		states, see <a href="strfrm.htm#appendII">Appendix II</a>.) Several key points are  		summarized here to illustrate how Medicaid eligibility criteria relate to  		eligibility rules established for state funded programs. General revenues are  		used in each of the six states to finance care of persons who are above  		Medicaid eligibility levels but below a specified income ceiling. State  		Medicaid policies therefore influence eligibility criteria used for other  		programs. </p>
<p>States have three options in covering SSI cash recipients under  		Medicaid. They can automatically cover all SSI recipients without requiring  		them to make a separate application for Medicaid. Arkansas, Maine, Maryland,  		and Wisconsin all use this option. The second option, used by Oregon, extends  		Medicaid eligibility to all SSI cash recipients but requires them to make a  		separate application for Medicaid. Since two application processes are  		required, this option may reduce the number of SSI recipients enrolled in  		Medicaid. The third option, used by Illinois, is to take advantage of Section  		209(b) to establish more restrictive criteria for Medicaid than for SSI. As a  		result, only 69 percent of SSI recipients in Illinois are enrolled in Medicaid.  		</p>
<p>Whether a state supplements SSI also affects Medicaid eligibility, since  		persons receiving state supplements are generally eligible for Medicaid.  		Arkansas and Maryland do not supplement SSI payments; Oregon and Maine  		supplement them only minimally ($1.70 and $10 a month, respectively). Illinois  		supplements on a case by case basis and Wisconsin's supplement is $101.70. Each  		of the six states has a medically needy program. SSI payment levels and  		medically needy income levels by state are illustrated in <a href="strfrm.htm#tableIV-1">Table IV-1</a>. </p>

</tr></table><p>The combination of these and other Medicaid eligibility policies shape  		the extent to which older persons living in the community can qualify  		financially for Medicaid. <a href="strfrm.htm#tableIV-2">Table IV-2</a> illustrates the  		proportion of low income persons living in the community who received medical  		assistance from Medicaid in 1985. This proportion is an indicator of how  		broadly the Medicaid program covers the low income elderly population in each  		state as a result of state specific Medicaid eligibility criteria. It does not  		measure the proportion of low income older persons who received Medicaid  		community based services. It does, however, indicate how effective each state's  		Medicaid program would be in reaching the elderly low income population in need  		of community based care without a waiver of any Medicaid eligibility criteria.  		It is interesting that Oregon and Illinois, with the smallest percentages of  		their low income elderly enrolled in Medicaid, make such extensive use of  		Medicaid waiver programs in comparison to other states. However, Illinois  		compensates for its stringent Medicaid eligibility criteria by investing  		significantly more state resources in their Community Care Program than in  		services under the Medicaid waiver. Oregon has extended eligibility for waiver  		services to persons with incomes up to 300% of SSI as illustrated in  		<a href="strfrm.htm#tableIV-3">Table IV-3</a>. Under this option older people can buy  		into the waiver by paying the difference between their monthly income and the  		SSI level -- as one half of Oregon's case load has done. Therefore, Oregon has  		been able to expand the number of persons which can be served due to unique  		eligibility criteria available for waiver programs. </p>
<p>Wisconsin and Maine have also adopted the 300% of SSI eligibility  		option. In addition, they have received a waiver of Medicaid deeming rules  		allowing them to count only the income and assets of the applicant in  		determining Medicaid eligibility for waivered services (rather than having to  		include those of the applicant's spouse). </p>
<p><b>ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS</b>. State Medicaid eligibility  		criteria are usually not developed with an explicit consideration of the unique  		affects on older people needing community care services. Eligibility criteria  		for state funded programs are, however. As noted earlier there are two methods  		for using financial criteria to define target populations. One is establishing  		an eligibility ceiling, with persons having incomes above the specified level  		prohibited from receiving any program benefits. The second method is using cost  		sharing provisions to set sliding fee scales based on income. State funded  		programs use cost sharing in five of the six study states. Arkansas is the  		exception, using an eligibility ceiling of 125 percent of poverty as the income  		cut off for receiving state financed personal care. <a href="strfrm.htm#tableIV-3">Table  		IV-3</a> summarizes the eligibility criteria and cost sharing scales for the  		major long term care programs in each of the six states. </p>
<p>Under cost sharing policies, clients having incomes above a certain  		threshold are required to pay a percentage of their total service costs. The  		percentage usually increases with higher income levels until the client is  		fully responsible for the entire cost. This method is used for the In-Home  		Aides Program in Maryland, Home Based Care in Maine, Oregon Project  		Independence and in Wisconsin for the Community Options Program. Usually the  		income level at which cost sharing begins is tied to a general principle (i.e.,  		80 percent of the state's median income) so that the actual income amount can  		change every year, without changing the standard. </p>
<p>Illinois uses a variation of these cost sharing principles. A portion of  		a client's income over $426 a month is applied to the cost of the approved care  		plan. The actual percentage varies with client impairment levels and service  		utilization. Persons who use substantial amounts of services in relation to  		their impairment level will have a higher percentage of their income above $426  		a month devoted to the cost of their care. </p>

</tr></table><p>Arkansas's financial criteria exemplify the interface between available  		state resources and eligibility decisions. State funds finance personal care  		services for persons with incomes above the Medicaid eligibility level  		(SSI-$336 month) and below 125 percent of poverty ($573 month). State officials  		would like to initiate cost sharing through a sliding fee for persons with  		incomes above 125 percent of poverty; however, due to the large size of  		Arkansas' low income population, state funds are currently not sufficient both  		to cover personal care for persons below 125 percent of poverty and to  		partially subsidize care for persons above that amount. </p>
<p>Interestingly, leaders of state membership organizations of older people  		in the study states affirmed their support for cost sharing policies in  		interviews with project staff. In fact advocacy groups in Arkansas volunteered  		a desire for a sliding fee home care program in order to reach older people  		with moderate incomes. </p>
<p><i>Cost sharing policies are favored by state officials over eligibility  		cut offs for several reasons</i>. First, cost sharing policies give a visible  		program priority to lower income persons by setting a floor below which  		services are fully subsidized while still permitting persons with moderate  		incomes to participate in the program and receive some partial public subsidy  		for services. Second, sliding fee scales can counter the images of "welfare"  		that are so resisted by older people; having lived through the depression they  		take pride in paying some portion of service costs themselves. Third, as in  		private insurance and Medicare, even nominal cost sharing makes the beneficiary  		more aware of the actual costs of care. Fourth, cost sharing policies are used  		in a variety of state human services programs; applying the same principles to  		programs for the elderly can promote equity across these programs, providing  		similar treatment of persons receiving publicly financed services, regardless  		of age. Finally, and most importantly, state officials have for the past 20  		years lived with Medicaid rules which make program eligibility an all or  		nothing proposition. They want to prevent older people from becoming destitute  		and thus dependent upon Medicaid for the rest of their lives. Cost sharing  		policies do not require persons to relinquish all of their resources before  		receiving services. </p>
<p><i>Each state has developed a continuum of financial eligibility  		criteria with one program's income ceiling reached as another begins</i>.  		Medicaid, of course, serves the poorest clients, with state funds reaching the  		near poor. State general revenues are essential to developing a long term care  		system that meets the needs of the elderly with low and moderate incomes;  		theoretically, the Older Americans Act can finance services for this  		population, but the program's small size limits its role as a major financing  		source. In the absence of state funds, individuals receiving publicly funded  		services in each of the study states except Wisconsin would have to be capable  		of living alone in the community on $350 a month or less while being  		sufficiently frail to need nursing home care. </p>
<p>Wisconsin is the exception in that, besides having a higher income  		threshold for Medicaid eligibility, it provides SSI recipients with an income  		supplement over the basic state SSI supplement for those persons receiving 40  		hours of home care services a month. This special supplement is not used to  		finance community care services; rather it is provided for living expenses,  		based on the assumption that these clients are likely to incur increased living  		expenses due to their extreme frailty. </p>
<p><i>State approaches to setting income eligibility criteria reflect the  		same dilemma encountered in other human services programs. States with higher  		proportions of low income persons are the least able to finance needed  		services. Therefore, financial eligibility criteria becomes a function of both  		the size of the population who meet the criteria and the amount of available  		resources to finance care. </i></p>
<h3>Functional Eligibility Criteria</h3>
<p>Most community care programs have been established with the goal of  		providing in home services to persons who would otherwise require nursing home  		care. Therefore, program participation is often limited to persons who are at  		risk of nursing home placement. This criterion may seem rather straight  		forward. However, community care demonstrations and other research have shown  		the difficulty of developing assessments -- however precisely drawn -- that can  		identify those persons whose impairment levels indicate a need for nursing home  		care in the absence of community services -- in other words, that can predict  		actual nursing home utilization. </p>
<p>Officials in the six study states acknowledge this problem, have  		repeatedly redesigned their assessment tools to sharpen their targeting  		capabilities, and now think they are targeting as tightly as possible. In the  		end though, they agree that it is, practically speaking impossible to  		accurately measure client "intent" to enter a nursing home. Some older persons  		who by any objective standard need nursing home care and lack formal services  		will remain in their own homes with the extensive assistance from families and  		friends. Therefore, the creation of community care programs, will itself  		increase the demand for care, because some older people with significant levels  		of impairment will be eligible for services in their home that were not  		previously available. </p>
<p>Access to community care programs in each of the six study states is  		based on a functional assessment of client limitations in activities of daily  		living. Since the assessment process leads to service authorization, the study  		states have consciously placed this function in agencies that do not directly  		provide publicly financed long term care services.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note9">9</a></font></sup> In four of the six states, assessments are  		performed by the same agency (and sometimes by the same staff) that provide  		ongoing case management. In Illinois, for example, these agencies are Case  		Coordination Units; in Maine and Oregon, they are area agencies on aging; in  		Wisconsin they are County Social Service Departments or (less frequently)  		Mental Health Boards. </p>
<p>In Arkansas assessments are handled by two area agencies on aging  		designated by the state through a competitive process. These projects assess  		client needs for Medicaid funded personal care services and authorize Medicaid  		payment. The two area agencies on aging serving as assessment agencies do not  		provide personal care services; the other six area agencies are the direct  		providers. </p>
<p>In Maryland the Geriatric Evaluation Service of local health departments  		usually conduct the assessments; however in a few counties, area agencies on  		aging and departments of social services may perform some assessments as well.  		Case management is usually provided by departments of social services. </p>
<p>All the study states except Wisconsin use a standard assessment tool to  		determine eligibility for most community care programs. Using a standardized  		assessment tool to determine need for community long term care services may  		seem rather straightforward. However, its development generally entails months  		of disagreement among health professionals, social workers, and various program  		administrators over the factors that are most likely to indicate need for their  		individual programs. </p>
<p>In Wisconsin the state has developed a recommended assessment form, but  		counties are free to use their own. There is a standardized screening tool,  		however, which sorts out those persons with more routine service needs who  		could be helped through information and referral services from those needing  		detailed assessments. The standardized screening tool provides some statewide  		uniformity. The screen determines eligibility; the assessment is used for  		developing individual care plans. Assessment tools primarily measure client  		functional impairments, mental health status, and informal support systems,  		while giving less emphasis to medical conditions. Consistent with that focus,  		states are placing less importance on requiring a registered nurse to  		participate in assessments. Illinois, Maryland and Oregon allow assessments to  		be performed solely by social workers. Maine's Home Based Care Program uses  		assessments performed by social workers, but the waiver component requires that  		a nurse review the assessment results; Wisconsin requires a nurse/social work  		team, but grants exceptions. In contrast, Arkansas uses registered nurses  		instead of social workers and requires physician review. Since the personal  		care program in Arkansas is financed through the Medicaid state plan rather  		than a 2176 waiver, federal rules require a more medical orientation, with  		services ordered by a physician. States with the flexibility to decide whether  		this requirement makes sense (under waiver programs and those funded with state  		general revenues) have not chosen to adopt it. </p>
<p>The results of client assessments determine whether an individual's  		impairment level meets nursing home admission criteria, thereby indicating  		eligibility for community care services. Some factors, such as the strength of  		a person's informal supports, may not explicitly be used to deny program  		eligibility; but the presence of informal supports most certainly will shape  		the type and amount of care which case managers authorize. </p>
<p>An interesting dilemma arises in considering the presence of a family  		caregiver as a factor in program eligibility. Research has definitively  		identified the lack of an informal support system as a major determinant of  		whether an older person is likely to enter a nursing home. Since many state  		community care programs attempt to serve only persons who would otherwise need  		institutional care, should they restrict participation to only those persons  		without any family caregivers? Or should services be provided to supplement the  		assistance of family caregivers in order to prevent family burn out and  		eventual nursing home placement? A further consideration is whether public  		agencies should make ethical decisions about the appropriate contribution of  		family caregivers. Should an older person without a nearby family receive  		services while someone with similar impairments having a daughter in close  		proximity be refused care? These moral judgments are often skirted by granting  		eligibility while limiting the services authorized. </p>
<p>Oregon and Illinois, the two states exerting the strongest centralized  		control over their community care systems, are the most specific in their  		measures used to determine client functional eligibility. Assessment tools in  		these two states are structured to produce a numerical score. If the score is  		below a certain cutoff individuals are not eligible. This permits the  		eligibility cutoff to be adjusted depending on availability of care. Oregon  		raised the score needed for eligibility in 1986, for example, in response to  		limited funds and growing case loads. </p>
<p>Wisconsin has explicitly rejected imposing a numerical assessment score  		out of concern that case managers would lose a measure of creativity and begin  		developing standardized care plans for certain scores. Having invested  		substantial effort in creating a very flexible program, officials did not want  		to lose the emphasis placed on individually tailored care plans. It is  		instructive to note in this context that Oregon's scoring system, although it  		has somewhat diminished the latitude given to case managers, has not prevented  		care plans from being individualized, as discussed in the next section. </p>
<p>In Arkansas assessment staff also use a standardized tool, although  		eligibility is not determined solely on the basis of a numerical score. Since  		Arkansas' community care system is built primarily on personal care services  		provided under the Medicaid state plan "medical necessity" for long term care  		services must be demonstrated in addition to limited functional capacity. </p>
<p>Arkansas' experience in conducting client assessments for persons  		seeking personal care services provided under the Medicaid state plan has great  		relevance for other states considering the same approach. One of the drawbacks  		states have perceived in going the state plan route is the entitlement nature  		of Medicaid services. Unlike waivered services, state plan services must be  		available on a statewide basis and cannot be restricted to just the elderly.  		However, by requiring recipients to participate in a formal assessment process,  		Arkansas has been able to place some controls on program utilization -- a major  		concern faced by other states in financing personal care under the state plan.  		</p>
<p>As the need for long term care services grows, states may be faced  		increasingly with the prospect of directing all community services to the care  		of the most impaired and the poorest, while lacking adequate resources to also  		maintain programs designed to keep older people healthy and living  		independently. For example, Oregon Project Independence had been providing  		services to persons with functional limitations who were not as impaired as the  		long term care population. Last year state policies were changed to require OPI  		program participants to meet the same functional criteria as Medicaid waiver  		clients. Wisconsin's Supportive Home Care Program still serves some persons  		with impairment levels lower than those required for participation in the  		Community Options Program, although Supportive Home Care is frequently used at  		the local level to supplement services to COP clients. </p>
<p><i>Using tightly drawn functional assessment tools will become  		increasingly important in containing overall costs as the need for long term  		care services expands. The continuing dilemma is balancing stringent functional  		eligibility criteria with the ability to assist older people before they become  		too impaired to continue living independently in the community. </i></p>
<h3>Case Management</h3>
<p>Case management has emerged as a critical process to effectively guide  		the use of limited public and private resources for the support of vulnerable  		older persons. Developing flexible systems of service for the elderly is the  		primary objective of state long term care initiatives. Case management is one  		vehicle for achieving this objective. Statewide service delivery systems  		coordinated through case management are in place in each of the six study  		states. </p>
<p>Although specific functions assigned by states to case management  		agencies vary, general areas of responsibility include developing cost  		effective individual care plans, authorizing needed services and following up  		to ensure that needed services are actually provided. In each state significant  		emphasis is placed on building the formal plan of care around the core supports  		provided by families and friends. Usually policies require that older persons  		and their informal caregivers be active participants in the care planning  		process, although several state officials noted that the lack of family  		supports is the primary reason clients seek formal services. </p>
<p>The scope of case management activities within each state is affected by  		1) the locus of responsibility for financial and functional eligibility  		determination; 2) the range of existing services and providers; 3) the emphasis  		placed on utilization controls through service authorization; and 4) whether  		case management is explicitly defined as a universal benefit for all older  		people with long term care needs or is limited to those persons financially  		eligible for publicly funded services. A review of each of these four factors  		serves to highlight differences and similarities in case managers'  		responsibilities across the six study states. </p>
<p><b>RESPONSIBILITIES FOR FUNCTIONAL AND FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY  		DETERMINATION</b>. Assigning these two functions to case management agencies  		creates a single service entry point for older people in need of long term  		care. Only in Oregon and Wisconsin has this been done for all long term care  		clients, irrespective of funding source. Illinois and Maine have placed  		responsibility for client functional assessments with the care management  		agency, but another agency certifies Medicaid financial eligibility. Maryland  		has a unified entry point for some clients, but multiple agencies for others.  		Arkansas has a different agency for each function except for clients receiving  		state funded services, for whom case management and financial eligibility are  		combined. <a href="strfrm.htm#tableIV-4">Table IV-4</a> shows the local agencies in each  		state that have been assigned responsibility for case management, financial  		eligibility determination and functional eligibility determination. </p>

</tr></table><p><i>Medicaid financial eligibility determination seems to be the function  		which is the most difficult to integrate with other access activities</i>. In  		state funded programs, usually the local agencies assigned to assess clients'  		functional capacities and provide case management also set client cost sharing  		amounts. Thus in state funded programs, financial and functional eligibility  		criteria are usually reviewed by the same agency. Medicaid rules, however,  		limit the agencies that can handle financial eligibility determination. Only in  		Oregon and Wisconsin, the two states with a single entry point can older people  		go to the same agency for Medicaid financial and functional eligibility. And in  		Oregon, lengthy discussions with HCFA were necessary to achieve this single  		entry point since normal Medicaid rules permit a state to either determine  		eligibility through state employees or through local governmental employees,  		but not through a combination of both. With the Medicaid program being  		administered through local offices of the state for all other populations, the  		case management agencies (part of local government) would not be permitted to  		determine financial eligibility for the elderly long term care population.  		Ultimately, Oregon was allowed to create a single entry point, but had to agree  		to a state level paper review of eligibility decisions conducted retroactively.  		</p>
<p>This dichotomy between financial eligibility determination for state  		funded programs and Medicaid complicates case managers' roles. When computing  		client cost sharing amounts for state funded services, case managers must  		request the same type of financial information needed for Medicaid  		determination. In addition, to maximize the use of state funds every effort is  		made to obtain Medicaid payment when clients appear to be Medicaid eligible. In  		states with multiple entry points this means that clients must be referred by  		the case manager to another agency for Medicaid eligibility determination. In  		making this referral, one aspect of a case manager's job is frequently seen as  		assisting older people, if necessary, to complete the required paperwork for  		Medicaid enrollment. Depending on the complexity of the eligibility process,  		significant amounts of a case manager's time can be expended on this task. </p>
<p>Other options for determining Medicaid financial eligibility need to be  		explored. Older people themselves are the most negatively affected by these  		multiple referrals in most of the study states. Elderly long term care clients  		have already been assessed as needing nursing home care and as a result have  		limited capacities to maneuver through the process. </p>
<p><b>RANGE OF SERVICES AND PROVIDERS</b>. The service options available to  		case managers in developing individual care plans can vary widely. Maine and  		Wisconsin very consciously have avoided specifying the scope of services that  		can be provided under the Home Based Care Program and the Community Options  		Program. Thus services can be combined in any number of ways, requiring and  		encouraging significant creativity by case managers. </p>
<p>Other states have tightly constrained service options. Illinois case  		managers, for example, can draw upon homemaker, chore and day care services.  		Arkansas case managers can only draw on personal care services, although the  		tasks performed by the worker are fairly broad and tailored to individual  		needs. Maryland's case managers primarily use in-home aides and personal care;  		however, under the Gateway II program, the choices are as broad as in Maine and  		Wisconsin. Oregon, like Arkansas, provides most of its community long term care  		services under the general term of home care, although adult foster care  		provided in family type settings for up to five older persons is growing in  		importance. </p>
<p>Unlike in the other five states, Oregon case managers are assigned to  		handle nursing home case loads as well as clients living in the community. As  		part of relocation planning case managers conduct a systematic review of all  		Medicaid nursing home residents within 30, 60, and 90 days of admission to  		assess whether their needs could be met in a less restrictive setting. If so, a  		plan is developed for transition to community care. In urban areas of the  		state, certain case managers' case loads may be entirely made up of nursing  		home residents. In rural areas an individual case manager may have clients in  		both institutional and community settings. Oregon state officials credit part  		of their success in reducing the size of Medicaid nursing home caseloads to  		their emphasis on relocation planning. Local program managers, however,  		sometimes see this activity as diverting staff attention from the community  		care case load. </p>
<p>In addition to the scope of services covered by a state's long term care  		program, characteristics of the service provider system affect case managers'  		roles. The most basic distinction is one of supply. Are there multiple agencies  		providing different services and therefore requiring significant coordination?  		Or are there only one or two agencies that are stretched to their capacity? Or,  		more importantly, are services delivered by independent providers rather than  		through agencies? If so, more time will be spent by case managers in locating  		individual providers, scheduling their visits and authorizing their payments.  		Maine, Oregon, Maryland and Wisconsin make extensive use of independent  		providers, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, agency providers are used  		in Illinois almost exclusively for services for the elderly, although similar  		services provided to the developmentally disabled are delivered by independent  		contractors. Arkansas case management agencies are also direct providers of  		services. <a href="strfrm.htm#service">Chapter V</a> analyzes in greater detail state  		experiences with different types of providers. This discussion merely notes the  		effects of different arrangements on case management systems. </p>
<p><b>SERVICE AUTHORIZATION</b>. All six study states have empowered local  		case management agencies to authorize the use of long term care funds for  		individual client services. In fact, the only way a person can receive services  		under the major state programs is through authorization of a case manager.  		Arkansas is an exception in that the Client Assessment Team rather than the  		case managers authorizes the provision of services, since the case managers and  		personal case workers are both employed by the area agencies on aging. Even so,  		Arkansas shares with the other five study states two important principles.  		<i>First, an agency outside of state government has been given responsibility  		for service authorization, which in long term care systems is equivalent to  		allocating public resources; and second, service authorization has almost  		always been separated from service delivery</i>. </p>
<p>As previously discussed, one responsibility of case managers in all six  		states is managing and coordinating needed services on behalf of elderly  		clients. This might be described as an advocacy function. However, case  		managers are also gatekeepers, controlling client utilization of community  		based services. Although case managers have both responsibilities, emphasis on  		the gatekeeping function is increasing as cost effectiveness concerns  		intensify. </p>
<p>The parameters of utilization control activities conducted by case  		managers vary based on other long term care policies, in particular ceilings on  		the allowable cost of individual care plans. <a href="strfrm.htm#tableIV-5">Table  		IV-5</a> illustrates state established cost limits on individual community care  		plans, which are usually tied to the monthly cost of nursing home care in each  		state. Medicaid waiver policy specifies that for the entire program clientele,  		community care services can be no more costly than nursing home care. Besides  		limiting the average cost per case, some waiver programs also place a ceiling  		on expenditures for individual care plans. Limits on the cost of individual  		care plans have also been adopted by several of the state funded programs. As  		Medicaid nursing home rates vary dramatically across the country, so do the  		cost limits applied to publicly funded individual community care plans. </p>
<p>In Maine case managers authorize service provision under both the state  		funded Home Based Care Program and the Medicaid waiver component. In both  		cases, ceilings on the cost of individual care plans are placed at the cost of  		nursing home care. State officials note that since the inception of the Home  		Based Care Program, case managers roles have increasingly focused on cost  		containment, especially with the advent of the Medicaid waiver component. In  		order to obtain approval of their waiver request, Maine was required to limit  		per case expenditures to 75 percent of nursing home costs. A year later through  		the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, Congress prohibited  		HCFA from requiring states to meet a community care cost standard more  		stringent than "equal to or less than" the costs of care provided in a nursing  		home. During the interim period, however, case managers transferred Medicaid  		clients with severe impairments (and therefore higher service costs) from the  		waiver program to the state funded case load to avoid exceeding the 75 percent  		limitation. </p>
<p>Personal care services in Arkansas are subject to a limitation of 72  		hours per month, which at $6.00 an hour now equals $432. Originally the cap was  		pegged to 80 percent of nursing home costs; however that percentage has  		declined with increased nursing home rates and stable rates for personal care.  		Since the personal care program is a state plan service and therefore a  		Medicaid entitlement, there is no ceiling on the number of persons that can be  		served (as in waiver programs) and no limit on total program expenditures (as  		in legislative appropriations for state funded programs). As a result, a  		well-managed process for client assessment and service authorization is  		especially important to control utilization. </p>

</tr></table><p>Similarly in Illinois, significant emphasis is placed on assessment and  		service authorization. Prior to the 1983 court ruling that interpreted the  		program to be an entitlement, local service providers could determine the  		amount and scope of services provided within state specified cost caps. Now,  		with the program having entitlement status, assessment and service  		authorization have been separated from providers and lodged with Case  		Coordinating Units. Medicaid waiver clients can receive a service package with  		a total monthly cost no greater than a limit related to the average cost of  		institutional care. For non-Medicaid clients, Illinois' cost sharing provisions  		explicitly encourage minimal intervention. </p>
<p>Oregon shares Illinois' concern for appropriately limiting the package  		of services authorized. For both the large Medicaid waiver program and the  		smaller state funded Oregon Project Independence, state officials have  		developed a computer program for case managers use in developing care plans and  		authorizing services. Client assessment data are entered into the computer,  		producing a numerical score and a recommended level of service. Although the  		case manager is not required to accept the recommended care plan, state  		officials believe this system balances any tendency to authorize more services  		than needed. Like the other states using Medicaid waivers, the average cost per  		case cannot exceed the cost of nursing home care. However, Oregon does not  		limit each care plan to that standard. </p>
<p>Maryland has three service authorization processes depending on which  		program is used. In-home aide services are authorized by case managers in  		County Departments of Social Services. Medicaid personal care services are  		authorized by nurses under contract with the Department of Health and Mental  		Hygiene and Gateway II services are authorized by the local lead agency chosen  		by county officials. The total public cost for services provided to Gateway II  		clients must be less than the average cost of nursing home care. In-home aides  		clients are limited to services costing up to two-thirds of average nursing  		home rates. There is no upper limit on personal care services, although low  		provider rates keep down total costs. </p>
<p>In Wisconsin almost all publicly financed community care services are  		authorized by case managers in county Departments of Social Services (DSS).  		Occasionally counties have chosen the agency managing mental health and  		developmental disabilities programs as the lead agency for the Community  		Options Program (COP) instead of DSS; however most often county DSS offices  		authorize services provided under COP, Supportive Home Care and the Medicaid  		waiver, and determine the size of individual Alzheimer's Family Caregiver  		grants. There is no official limit on the number of supportive home care hours  		that can be authorized, although these clients are usually less impaired than  		persons served under COP. Grants to Alzheimer's family caregivers are limited  		to $4,000 a year per family. </p>
<p>The Community Options Program does not limit the cost of services to an  		individual, but requires within each county that on the average, program  		expenditures per client not exceed the state share of Medicaid nursing home  		costs. When COP was created the Medicaid waivers did not exist. For this and a  		variety of programmatic and policy reasons, state funds have continued to be  		used instead of Medicaid. Connecting a limit on expenditures under the state  		funded community care program to the state share of Medicaid nursing home  		costs, along with the multi-year freeze on nursing home certificates of need  		has helped make the Community Options Program budget neutral. With Wisconsin's  		relatively generous nursing home reimbursement rates, 42 percent of nursing  		home costs (the state share) is still adequate to finance the care of most  		community clients. </p>
<p>Wisconsin's approach provides an interesting perspective on issues faced  		in service authorization under a county formula grant program in contrast to an  		individual entitlement program. When a local case management agency has been  		granted a finite amount of program funds, it may attempt to serve as many  		persons as possible by providing a lower level of care than is actually needed  		by some clients. State officials are concerned that eventually this can result  		in clients with higher impairment levels being unable to remain in the  		community. </p>
<p><i>Other study states also observed that formula allocation programs may  		create local incentives to reduce needed levels of care</i>. Illinois, for  		example, found that prior to the court case changing its program from a formula  		grant to an individual entitlement, local agencies responded to community  		pressures to serve as many persons as possible by funding very limited care  		plans, perhaps to an extent that was detrimental to older people. A study of  		in-home service programs conducted by the Maryland Department of Budget and  		Fiscal Planning also found that local Departments of Social Services have at  		times responded to excess demand by reducing the type and intensity of services  		authorized.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note10">10</a></font></sup> As that  		study noted, a fundamental policy question is whether services should be  		limited to the most impaired or whether a broader group of persons should  		receive services that only partially meet their needs.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note11">11</a></font></sup> Long term care programs in the six study  		states have usually opted for meeting the more intensive needs of the most  		impaired, recognizing that those persons not served may also have significant  		functional limitations. With a growing population in need of long term care and  		constrained program budgets, incentives to spread service funds thinly still  		remain. </p>
<p>To address this dilemma, Wisconsin state officials, after several years  		of operational experience, now require counties serving more than 25 persons to  		reserve a minimum of 20 percent of their case load for high cost cases, defined  		as persons needing a care plan costing twice the allowable average. In 1986  		this amount was $1100. For the balance of their caseloads, counties are  		required to set ceilings on the maximum cost of individual care plans at least  		as high as $800 a month. </p>
<p><i>State officials note that case managers in entitlement systems may  		have the opposite incentives, resulting in a tendency to authorize more  		services than needed</i>. State sponsored training programs can help case  		managers be more aware of cost containment concerns. Staff of Illinois' Case  		Coordinating Units report that case managers have slowly become more  		comfortable with limiting services instead of authorizing a complete package of  		all potentially available services. As they gain more experience in monitoring  		the implementation of care plans, case managers get firsthand feedback on the  		scope of services needed and can make any necessary adjustments. </p>
<p><i>Service authorization responsibilities set case managers in the study  		states apart from those in some other localities across the country where case  		managers arrange for client services without the authority to order service  		provision. In managed systems of care financed by state resources and state  		administered federal funds such as Medicaid, state government can designate  		case management agencies to act as agents of the state in authorizing needed  		services. Without an explicit delegation of this authority, case management  		agencies can help older people locate services but cannot directly allocate  		public resources to individual care plans. </i></p>
<p><b>CASE MANAGEMENT FOR PRIVATE PAY CLIENTS</b>. The study states have in  		varying degrees considered the appropriate role of public case management  		systems in arranging community care for persons not financially eligible for  		state subsidized services. Numerous issues are involved. What is government's  		responsibility for linking consumers with services purchased in the private  		market? Do state initiatives to make publicly financed systems more responsive  		to low and moderate income elderly logically extend to helping higher income  		persons gain better access to needed care? More practically, can governments  		currently afford to provide care planning services as a public entitlement to  		all persons needing long term care? </p>
<p>There are distinct advantages to expanding the role of state designated  		case management systems to assist older people in all income levels. First,  		these systems can link family caregivers to a limited set of formal services  		designed to help sustain their informal assistance and delay the need for more  		intensive care. Second, by directing the state designated case management  		system to serve as an access point for all persons needing care planning,  		states can minimize the development of two-class service systems where publicly  		assisted clients enter through one door and private pay clients enter through  		another. </p>
<p>It is, of course, true that some components of case management services  		for publicly assisted clients are not applicable for private pay clients (for  		example, financial eligibility criteria are not relevant and services are not  		formally authorized). But case managers can act as valuable counselors, helping  		older people and their families identify potential sources of assistance. </p>
<p>The six study states differ substantially in how private pay clients are  		handled. From their inception some state programs included the provision of  		case management services, supported with public funds, for persons not meeting  		the income criteria for services. In some programs resources are explicitly  		allocated to this purpose; in others care planning assistance is handled more  		informally. Some states, however, limit case managers' roles to assisting  		clients financially eligible for services. </p>
<p>Of the six states, Wisconsin has made by far the most explicit  		commitment to providing care planning assistance to private pay clients. From  		the start, the Community Options Program was designed to offer assessments and  		care planning to all functionally impaired persons as a public entitlement,  		with direct services provided on a sliding fee basis. In fact counties are  		given two separate allocations of funds, one for assessments and care planning  		and another for direct services. Asserting that all long term care clients need  		some help in sorting out the service delivery system, the original architects  		created a program with broad based appeal. </p>
<p>Two factors shaped their approach. One was a fairly widespread  		philosophy in Wisconsin that state government has a role in strengthening  		informal systems of care (the state funded Alzheimer's grants are another  		indication of that perception). Second, Wisconsin has one of the lowest  		percentages of older people with incomes below the poverty level, partly due to  		high SSI state supplements. As a result many people are able to pay for at  		least part of their service package, freeing more public funds for care  		planning. </p>
<p>One quarter of all persons receiving state funded assessments and care  		planning assistance under the Community Options Program in 1986 fully paid for  		all needed direct services. This indicates, state officials assert, that their  		publicly funded access system does not have a "welfare" image but is rather  		seen as an acceptable and appropriate way to link all impaired persons to  		services. </p>
<p>Illinois has also provided some case management services through Case  		Coordinating Units to private pay clients, although not to the same degree as  		Wisconsin. Case Coordinating Units were originally designated jointly by the  		state Department on Aging and by Area Agencies on Aging, with the rationale  		that Community Care Program funds allocated by the state would support case  		management for persons meeting program eligibility criteria, while Older  		Americans Act funds administered by the area agencies would be used for all  		other long term care clients. </p>
<p>Oregon funds risk intervention case managers who help arrange services  		for persons who due to either impairment levels or income are not eligible for  		services financed through public programs. This approach was adopted in  		response to cutbacks in state and federal programs which provided less  		intensive services. However, as the private pay clientele expands, risk  		intervention case managers are able to assist a shrinking percentage of the  		total. </p>
<p>Maryland's Gateway II program serves some "case management only"  		clients, consistent with its purpose of helping to better coordinate existing  		services while funding gap filling services as a last resort. Care planning has  		always been seen as a program component not subject to client financial  		eligibility criteria, although with limited program funds, the primary focus is  		on persons with low incomes. </p>
<p>Maine limits the percentage of Home Based Care funds which can be spent  		on case management primarily out of a concern for allocating as many resources  		as possible to direct care. The state also explicitly prohibits the use of HBC  		funds for case management assistance to persons ineligible for the program.  		Area agencies on aging have been pushing for approval to provide case  		management for a fee to persons ineligible for state supported services.  		However, the state is concerned that this would divert attention from the most  		needy populations, and since Older Americans Act funds are frequently used for  		some case management services, the prohibition on charging a fee under the OAA  		would greatly limit the ability to pool funds for case management. </p>
<p>Arkansas' case managers view themselves as a general resource to a wide  		range of older people; however state case management funds are directed to  		persons with low incomes. </p>
<p><i>The most significant factor distinguishing the state with the  		greatest emphasis on assisting private pay clients (Wisconsin) from the state  		with the least emphasis (Arkansas) is the percentage of the older population  		with incomes below poverty. Wisconsin bas the lowest percentage of older people  		with incomes below poverty and, of the states in this study, Arkansas has the  		highest. Like its effect on financial eligibility criteria, a state's income  		characteristics shape the percentage of its population's needs which can be met  		through public programs, the size of the private pay market and the available  		state resources which can be devoted to long term care programs. </i></p>
<h3>Pre-Admission Screening Programs</h3>
<p>Pre-admission screening programs, are the entry points in state long  		term care systems for persons seeking nursing home care. For the purpose of  		this analysis, pre-admission screening is defined as "an assessment used to  		determine the need or appropriateness of nursing home care that goes beyond  		financial eligibility determination and physicians' certification of need to  		include an on-site evaluation of many aspects of a client's status."<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note12">12</a></font></sup> Instead of using a rather loose  		consideration of "medical necessity" for nursing home care (as is done in the  		absence of screening programs), a comprehensive examination is made of a  		person's functional, psychological and medical status with a bias toward  		determining whether informal supports combined with formal community services  		could meet the individual's long term care needs. </p>
<p>Besides being part of an organized access point for long term care  		services, pre-admission screening programs are a logical component of state  		policies designed to curb the growth of Medicaid institutional expenditures and  		apply the cost savings to an expanded community care system. Since a  		significant proportion of older people entering a nursing home become Medicaid  		eligible within a short period, the need for cost control has stimulated  		increased attention to potential "inappropriate placements." This concern is  		heightened by the realization that once an individual enters a nursing home,  		community supports erode, a residence and other possessions may be liquidated  		and return to the community -- even for someone inappropriately placed to begin  		with -- becomes unlikely. In addition, as discussed in <a href="strfrm.htm#organization">Chapter III</a>, most of the study states have placed  		strict limits on the construction of new nursing home beds. Tightening up on  		client access to institutional care through pre-admission screening programs  		complements efforts to control bed supply. <i>Viewed as integral components of  		state community based care systems, pre-admission screening programs can link  		persons seeking nursing borne care with in-home services instead. Thus, in  		addition to having a cost containment focus, pre-admission screening programs  		are a vehicle for integrating client access to both institutional and community  		care. </i></p>
<p>In all six states, pre-admission screening programs are carried out by  		the same agencies that conduct assessments for clients initially seeking  		community care. Beyond these general parameters, state screening programs vary  		in significant ways. </p>
<p><b>STATE PROGRAM CHARACTERISTICS</b>. <a href="strfrm.htm#tableIV-6">Table  		IV-6</a> illustrates some of the major state differences. Some states include  		only Medicaid recipients in their programs; others include persons who, based  		on an assessment of their income and resources, are likely to become Medicaid  		eligible within 60, 90 or 180 days of nursing home placement. In most cases,  		participation of the target population is mandated in order to receive Medicaid  		payment for care. However, mandatory participation in the screen does not  		necessarily entail a binding decision on placement. Medicaid is the payment  		source for pre-admission screening programs in all six states. </p>

</tr></table><p>Oregon and Illinois have the most rigorous programs. Both include  		potential Medicaid clients as well as current eligibles; both mandate  		participation of the target population and result in a binding decision on  		placement. In 1986 21 percent of persons seeking nursing home entry in Oregon  		were diverted to home care and Illinois diverted 18 percent. Since screening  		programs in the other four states either are not statewide or have been only  		recently initiated, comparable figures are not available. Even if the data were  		available, however, its relevance is questionable since there are so many  		factors that affect the rate of nursing home applications. For example several  		state officials noted that demand for pre-admission screening has declined as  		physicians and hospital discharge planners become more aware of community  		options. </p>
<p>Arkansas' program was established in 1983 through pilot projects  		covering one quarter of the state. These projects conducted nursing home  		pre-admission screening and assessments for clients seeking Medicaid funded  		personal care and home health. In 1986 the projects assumed statewide  		responsibility for assessing the need for and authorizing the provision of  		personal care. Nursing home pre-admission screening and assessments for home  		health were not expanded beyond the original geographic area, however. </p>
<p>Maine, Maryland and Wisconsin have created screening programs even more  		recently -- each having less stringent provisions than those of the other three  		states. Maine began on a small scale using assessments for only Medicaid  		clients seeking nursing home entry directly from the community, based on the  		theory that persons currently living in the community have the best chance of  		remaining. Now hospitalized Medicaid clients applying for nursing home  		admission are also included. The Maryland program was started too recently for  		any information on its operations to be available. </p>
<p>Wisconsin's Community Options Program requires counties to initiate  		pre-admission screening for Medicaid clients during their first year and then  		expand screening to cover all nursing home admissions by their fifth year of  		program operation. Since new counties were added to the COP program over a four  		year period, screening requirements have become effective at different times  		throughout the state. Counties are also required in their fifth year of COP  		implementation to screen all current Medicaid nursing home residents to  		determine whether relocation to the community might be possible. Neither  		counties nor nursing home providers are very happy with this requirement,  		arguing (1) that since most counties have waiting lists for services, it would  		be undesirable to raise nursing home residents' expectations and (2) that most  		nursing home residents have lost their community supports, their home and other  		possessions, making return to the community unlikely. Oregon's experience,  		however indicates that relocation may be achieved in some instances. Case  		managers assigned to monitor nursing home clients have in the past five years  		placed over 5,000 nursing home residents in community care settings. </p>
<p><b>NURSING HOME INDUSTRY ROLE IN SHAPING STATE SCREENING POLICY</b>.  		Certain state screening program characteristics often result from political  		constraints rather than deliberate policy design; examples include the limited  		population groups covered, and the advisory nature of staff conclusions. Such  		limitations in scope and authority reflect the influence of the nursing home  		industry on state legislatures. Arkansas, Illinois, and Maine all began their  		programs by an administrative directive. Any further expansion they assert,  		would need legislative approval and would be fiercely fought by the industry.  		Interviews with nursing home representatives confirmed their strong opposition  		to any changes. </p>
<p>Arkansas state officials would like to expand their program statewide;  		Maine wants to include a broader population group; the executive branch in  		Oregon proposed to expand their program to private pay applicants, but has been  		stymied by the legislature; Maryland officials were forced to accept an  		advisory finding from screening results due to successful attempts by the  		industry to amend the authorizing legislation for pre-admission screening. </p>
<p>Various reasons are cited for nursing home opposition to program  		expansion. As one would expect, the appropriateness of state government being  		able to prohibit the entrance of private pay persons to nursing homes is  		questioned. In addition nursing home representatives maintain that decisions to  		enter a nursing home are not made lightly and usually few options remain;  		therefore the cost of administering the program would exceed the resulting  		benefit to the state Medicaid budget. State officials counter that a major  		benefit of pre-admission screening is the knowledge older people gain of other  		alternatives. </p>
<p><b>INTEGRATING ACCESS TO COMMUNITY BASED AND INSTITUTIONAL LONG TERM  		CARE</b>. One of the most important features of state pre-admission screening  		programs, at least in principle, is the links created among community care,  		nursing home care and acute care. Since all six study states have assigned  		primary responsibility for screening programs to the agencies conducting client  		assessments for community care, a central entry point for non-institutional and  		institutional long term care services has been created. In addition, most of  		the study states use the same assessment tool for both functions. While states  		would like stronger pre-admission screening programs, they note that simply  		making people aware of their community care options can go a long way in  		deferring nursing home entry. A single access point enhances the potential that  		clients will receive information on an entire range of possible alternatives.  		</p>
<p>The link between acute care and long term care has been less  		satisfactorily made. When linking community based care with nursing home care,  		states can control access to the delivery system, since long term care is  		financed mostly through state resources and the state administered Medicaid  		program. Acute care is controlled primarily by physicians and hospitals -- both  		paid by Medicare. Since states cannot mandate cooperation, they have to use  		their powers of persuasion with physicians and hospital discharge planners.  		Convincing them of the value of skilled home care is difficult; encouraging  		them to make referrals to non-medical state community care programs is even  		more challenging. </p>
<p>Pre-admission screening programs face predictable resistance from  		physicians and hospital discharge planners, who initially view the process as  		one more layer of bureaucracy. Also, doctors resent intrusions into their  		authority and discharge planners claim that some form of pre-admission  		screening is already part of their ongoing responsibilities. In order to  		solicit the cooperation of discharge planners, Maine and some Wisconsin  		counties contract with them for assessments of hospital patients seeking  		nursing home care. With the same purpose, Illinois encourages hospital  		discharge planners to work with their pre-admission screening staff and has  		adopted presumptive eligibility provisions for hospital discharges. </p>
<p><i>Local managers of pre-admission screening programs emphasize the  		importance of state leadership in providing needed public information and  		education in combating resistance from physicians and other health  		professionals</i>. In particular, they believe that strong communications from  		state government to providers underscoring the permanence of the screening  		program and its authority to determine care needs would enhance the success of  		initial program implementation. </p>
<h2><a name="service" id="service">V. SERVICES SUPPORTED BY STATE COMMUNITY CARE  		PROGRAMS</a></h2>
<p>States have designed new systems of care which have dramatically  		reorganized state and local management of long term care services to establish  		a single entry point for client services. The creation of uniform assessment  		tools, explicit financial eligibility criteria and case management services all  		make access to community care more predictable from a client's perspective and  		more standardized as viewed by program administrators. <i>In contrast, the  		approach used for the actual provision of services frequently places a high  		value on diversity and informality, giving long term care consumers a  		substantial role in directing the way in which care is provided</i>. </p>
<p>Community long term care services, which rely extensively on social  		supports to deal with chronic conditions, are vastly different from the acute  		care focus of more traditional Medicare funded skilled home health services.  		Long term care services are intended to compensate for limitations in an  		individual's ability to carry out normal activities of daily living; assistance  		is likely to be needed for an extended period of time. In contrast, skilled  		home health services address an individual's medical needs; they are frequently  		provided on a short term basis following hospital discharge, are prescribed by  		a physician, and delivered by a health care professional using a clinical  		focus. The provision of skilled home health services is triggered by a medical  		diagnosis; long term chronic care is based on functional need. </p>
<p>The primary or acute health care needs of long term care clients are  		addressed by Medicare and Medicaid funded physician services, hospital care  		and/or short term skilled home nursing. Since these services can be supported  		under existing federal and state programs, they are not usually covered by  		state long term care programs. </p>
<p>Establishing a new system of non-professional social supports to meet  		the long term care needs of the elderly demands a new way of conceptualizing  		home care. While various communities across the country have successfully  		undertaken small scale projects, building large statewide delivery systems is  		much more complicated. <i>The challenge to states is to place some parameters  		around publicly financed services to make them cost effective and manageable  		without compromising the character of flexible, non-medical services which  		respond to individualized needs</i>. </p>
<p>This chapter analyzes the scope of community based services supported by  		state systems and the developmental efforts undertaken to expand their supply.  		These efforts have focused on three types of care: in-home services, adult day  		care and services provided in alternative living arrangements. Approaches used  		by the six study states used to deliver these three types of care are explored  		in depth. Finally, new methods for assuring quality care are required to  		complement the non-medical nature of these services. State efforts to grapple  		with appropriate consumer safeguards are reviewed, and several methods having  		potential for replication by other states are discussed. </p>
<h3>Overview of State Service Options</h3>
<p>Service delivery systems for community care services respond to an array  		of client needs. In all six states these needs are addressed primarily through  		in-home services, which are considered to be the core of any community care  		program. There is, however, considerable variation among the six states in the  		extent to which they specify other allowable services that can be provided  		within the overall budget ceiling. </p>
<p>Maine and Wisconsin have deliberately avoided defining the services that  		can be supported under the Home Based Care Program and the Community Options  		Program. In these two states almost any service package is possible and  		officials in both states have their favorite anecdotes describing off-beat  		service packages uniquely designed for program participants. Wisconsin's  		program guidelines caution counties to avoid approaching care planning with the  		attitude of "what you need is what we have." They also explicitly state that  		there are no disallowed services; only disallowed settings (i.e., services  		provided in an institution). </p>
<p>The largest community care programs in Maryland and Arkansas have  		explicitly defined allowable services; yet both states have smaller, very  		flexible state funded programs which finance any service a client needs.  		Oregon's two programs delineate a half-dozen permissible services. Illinois  		represents the other end of the continuum from Maine and Wisconsin, using a  		tightly defined list of three services supported by its Community Care Program;  		however senior companion and home health are also provided on a very limited  		basis as part of demonstrations funded with state general revenue funds. </p>
<p>In spite of the fact that states vary in the extent to which they  		explicitly define permissible services, there are many similarities in the  		services actually provided. Categorizing state service options first requires  		some common definition of terms. Each state uses different names to describe  		essentially identical in-home services (such as personal care, supportive home  		care, homemaker, in-home aides). Differences in service titles in part reflect  		state traditions and in part are tied to funding streams used to finance the  		services. These services are typically defined to encompass a wide range of  		activities from heavy to light housekeeping and from minimal to substantial  		assistance with bathing, dressing, eating and other activities of daily living.  		Regardless of the service name, the focus and intensity of the service varies  		within states according to client need. It would therefore be a mistake to  		assume that a personal care worker in Arkansas performs a different range of  		activities than a homemaker in Illinois. </p>
<p>Adult day care is financed in Maryland with state general revenues and  		Medicaid, in Illinois as part of the Community Care Program, and in several  		geographic areas of Maine and Arkansas, as part of programs financed with state  		general revenues. Maryland and Maine both finance services for impaired older  		persons living in congregate housing. Through a special state supplement to  		SSI, Maine also supports the costs of board and care for low income older  		persons. </p>
<p>Oregon funds a limited amount of adult day care services through Oregon  		Project Independence, but does not include this service in its waiver program.  		However, providing care to persons in alternative living arrangements is a  		major service strategy in Oregon through the use of adult foster homes and  		residential care facilities. </p>
<p><a href="strfrm.htm#tableV-1">Table V-1</a> illustrates the major service options  		available through state community care programs. While there are substantial  		similarities among states in the primary service strategies used (home care,  		adult day care and services in alternative living arrangements) there are  		significant differences in their implementation. </p>
<h3>Home Care Services</h3>
<p>A variety of factors influence how home care services are delivered  		within each state including the supply of formal providers, the philosophy and  		goals articulated during the creation of community care programs, and  		historical traditions in delivering similar services to other populations. </p>
<p>There are three basic vehicles for delivering home care services: agency  		providers, client employed providers and family caregivers. Most of the states  		use a combination of the three options, with the exception of Illinois which  		relies exclusively on agency providers. </p>

</tr></table><p><b>AGENCY PROVIDERS</b>. Of the six study states, only Illinois uses  		agency providers exclusively to deliver services. Chosen by a competitive bid  		process, about 60 percent of the providers in Illinois are proprietary  		agencies; the other 40 percent are private non-profit organizations such as  		Catholic Charities and Lutheran Social Services. </p>
<p>The cost containment features of Illinois' competitive bid process have  		created political tensions with the large and influential private non-profit  		providers since they were increasingly being underbid by proprietary agencies.  		In addition labor unions representing service workers objected to the bidding  		process since salary increases and fringe benefits were curtailed due to  		competition based on cost. As a result, the payment system and the selection  		process have been revised with providers now selected on the basis of  		performance measures, and the rates uniformly set by the Department on Aging.  		In response to the workers' concerns, providers must document that 73 percent  		of the payment rate is devoted to worker wages and benefits. </p>
<p>Other states have a much lower reliance on agency providers than  		Illinois. This difference seems to be attributable to several factors. First,  		Illinois manages a very large state-administered program with all provider  		payments issued at the state level. The sheer magnitude of direct payments  		which would be made under an independent contractor model would be  		administratively infeasible. Second, as a result of smaller programs preceding  		Illinois' current efforts, a large pool of provider agencies had been  		developed; re-enrolling them in the new program was relatively easy. Finally,  		and probably most importantly, using agency providers is consistent with other  		Illinois community care policies which result in a tightly managed, formalized  		service delivery system. </p>
<p>The other five study states use agency providers more selectively.  		Oregon uses a mix of provider types with agency providers being the most  		frequent form in urban areas. Area agencies on aging have the option of  		managing their own competitive bid process or requesting the state agency to  		include bids for their area in a statewide announcement. Maryland and Wisconsin  		also deliver services through various types of providers including independent  		contractors. Arkansas' area agencies on aging directly provide personal care  		services, having formerly managed the program through client employed workers.  		Maine uses home health agencies to administer the Alternative Long Term Care  		Program, which packages Medicaid home health with private duty nursing services  		and Medicaid personal care. These services are provided to a specialized  		population group with intensive medical needs. </p>
<p>Medicare certified home health agencies are generally not used to  		provide long term care services. While state officials praise their excellent  		post-acute skilled nursing care, they note that home health agencies'  		philosophies generally do not mesh with community based care, even when these  		agencies have expanded their service coverage beyond the traditional package of  		Medicare reimbursed services. Specifically noted is a tendency to respond in a  		way that is more medically related than necessary, desirable, or affordable.  		Even when the response is not over-professionalized, their Medicare mandated  		administrative processes produce overhead costs that result in high unit costs,  		making their services more expensive than comparable services provided by other  		agencies. Home health agencies counter that state systems are too informal;  		they insist that a stronger health focus is required, with all home care  		provided under the direction of registered nurses. </p>
<p><b>CLIENT EMPLOYED PROVIDERS</b>. Independent contractors are the  		predominant provider type in Oregon, in the Maine Home Based Care Program and  		and in the Maryland personal care program. They are also extensively used in  		Wisconsin. They were the major provider type in Arkansas' personal care program  		until several years ago when the client employed workers were taken off  		independent contracts and put on the staff of area agencies on aging. </p>
<p>Complicated legal issues surround the definition of a client employed  		worker and the responsibilities of the employer (in this case the client) for  		handling such matters as social security taxes and coverage for workers  		compensation. The following discussion of these federally adopted legal  		provisions and resulting administrative responsibilities is drawn from an  		excellent technical assistance document prepared for county departments of  		social services by the Wisconsin Bureau of Long Term Support.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note13">13</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Client employed workers are not part of an agency but are rather  		independent contractors who work directly for individuals. Administrative  		agencies responsible for setting generic employment standards and the courts  		have both used a test of "direction and control" to determine who is the legal  		employer of a worker. The practical implications of this test are that in order  		to establish a employer/employee relationship, the employer (in this case the  		client) must have the right to hire, supervise and fire a worker and to  		substantially determine the tasks to be performed. While case managers finalize  		a client's plan of care and authorize the amount of needed services, clients  		must be given the authority to control how their care plans are implemented.  		</p>
<p>Besides directing work performance, an employer must also comply with  		various provisions of laws governing minimum wage and payment of social  		security taxes. Federal income tax withholding is not required; participation  		in workers compensation varies from state to state; and rarely must  		unemployment compensation tax be paid. States using client employed providers  		often serve as fiscal agents for clients and handle payment of the various  		required taxes. State government directly performs this role in Oregon and  		sometimes in Maryland; area agencies on aging serve as fiscal agents in Maine;  		county departments of social services assume this responsibility in Wisconsin.  		With or without a fiscal agent, clients as employers must finalize all  		paperwork and certify the hours of service provided. </p>
<p>Procedures for recruiting workers are fairly consistent from state to  		state. Usually case managers ask clients whether someone they already know  		would be able and willing to serve as a paid provider, such as a friend or a  		worker who has successfully delivered care to an acquaintance. If no such  		person is available, an employee will be selected from a screened list of  		workers recruited by case managers. Case managers are responsible for ensuring  		that the provider is able to perform the assistance needed by the client.  		Wisconsin counties often contract with independent vendors (e.g., Independent  		Living Centers) to screen potential providers; to train recipients in hiring,  		firing, and supervising attendants; and to assist the recipient in various  		other employer duties. </p>
<p>Wisconsin, Maine and Oregon encourage the use of independent providers  		for philosophical reasons. Empowering clients to direct and manage their own  		care is consistent with their explicit emphasis on enhancing the independence  		of older people. Program guidelines and technical assistance materials prepared  		by these three states emphasize these values throughout. While independent  		providers may be less expensive than agency providers, potential cost savings  		do not seem to be the primary factor influencing the choice of this provider  		type in Wisconsin and Maine. Oregon emphasizes both cost advantages and program  		philosophy in encouraging the use of independent providers. </p>
<p>In the case of Maryland's Medicaid personal care program, the use of  		independent providers seems to be based largely on cost containment concerns.  		Interviews with state staff and state program documents do not reflect the  		philosophical emphasis present in Maine, Oregon and Wisconsin. </p>
<p><i>A management structure which can routinely handle payments to  		thousands of individuals is necessary to effectively administer an independent  		provider program</i>. In particular state administrators recommend that the  		agency managing the community care program (either at the state or local level)  		assume the role of fiscal agent on behalf of the client. Under this model some  		of the administrative tasks performed by provider agencies must be handled at  		the local level by case management agencies or by state government. For  		example, the required paperwork for payment of social security taxes and  		workers compensation taxes must be filed; management information systems must  		be in place to handle payments to each individual provider rather than issuing  		one check to a provider agency; and payments must be made promptly in order to  		retain a large lower income work force. The costs of these types of management  		functions are normally part of provider agencies' overhead charges. Under an  		independent provider model the costs of these functions are assumed by state  		government or local case management agencies. Therefore a simple comparison of  		differences in unit costs for independent providers and agency providers will  		understate the expenses related to performance of fiscal agent responsibilities  		under the independent provider model. </p>
<p>Some orientation must be given to clients on how to handle their  		employer responsibilities; this task is normally assumed by case managers.  		Materials designed to assist in this orientation process have been prepared by  		state program staff. Maine has developed a clearly written consumer handbook  		titled "You and Your Personal Care Assistant" which gives clients guidance on  		managing the paperwork aspects of their employer responsibilities and offers  		advice on how to direct and supervise worker performance. </p>
<p>The use of client employed providers can be controversial. Critics  		(mainly agency providers) charge that the quality of care is lower, although  		state experiences with systems using a combination of provider types do not  		seem to support this theory. It is questionable whether a worker known to the  		client and/or screened by a case manager represents any greater risk to a  		client than a worker hired by an agency, although quality complaints may  		underestimate problems, since clients may be less likely to complain about  		someone known to them personally. Legitimate concerns are the low wages paid to  		workers and the absence of any employee benefits such as health care coverage;  		but these concerns often apply to homemakers and personal care workers employed  		by agency providers as well. </p>
<p>A mix of various agency providers and client employed providers is by  		far the most prevalent situation to be made by state community care systems.  		Thus the real decision is the relative emphasis to place on the use of each  		option. </p>
<p><b>FAMILY CAREGIVERS</b>. Family caregivers are recognized as the  		primary provider of long term care services, and as such are the target for  		increased state efforts to provide them with non-monetary support in order to  		sustain their efforts. State policies explicitly establish linkages between  		informal supports and several aspects of formal service delivery systems. For  		example, family supports are one factor-used in assessing an individual's need  		for publicly assisted community care services. They are also acknowledged in  		the frequently articulated care planning goals of "building the formal system  		of care around existing informal supports." And their views are solicited as  		part of the pre-admission screening process. All of these policies relating to  		informal supports have become universally accepted principles that are  		relatively easy to implement. </p>
<p><i>Paying family caregivers, however, is another matter. Most state  		administrators seem to agree that paying family caregivers to be formal service  		providers is at times the most practical option. They note, however, that state  		and local elected officials are frequently uncomfortable with this approach  		because of philosophical concerns over using public funds to subsidize what are  		believed to be family obligations. Where such payment is made it is unvariably  		the option of last resort. Usually payments are linked to financial hardships  		resulting from caregiver activities, such as being unable to seek paid  		employment. </i></p>
<p>Paying families as caregivers is in some ways an extension of the  		independent provider concept since client employed workers are frequently  		persons previously known to clients such as neighbors or friends. Some legal  		requirements relating to independent providers, however, do not apply for  		family members -- such as making payments for social security taxes and meeting  		minimum wage standards. </p>
<p>In four of the six study states family caregivers can be paid as  		providers under some of the major long term care programs. These programs  		include the Community Options Program in Wisconsin, the Home Based Care Program  		in Maine, Gateway II in Maryland and both Oregon Project Independence and the  		waiver program in Oregon. In all these states, officials estimate that family  		caregivers are used in these programs in less than 10 percent of all cases.  		Maine and Maryland require prior state approval of all payments made to family  		members. Wisconsin allows payment to family members subject to each county's  		policy. Most counties permit payment if it does not reduce normal caregiving  		and is more cost-effective than using other providers. Some counties limit  		payments to situations where the caregiver foregoes outside employment in order  		to care for their relative. Of the four states permitting payments to families,  		only Oregon prohibits payment to spouses under its regular community care  		programs. However, the Oregon Senior Services Division does manage a specially  		appropriated account of $125,000 for state authorized spousal payments. </p>
<p>Wisconsin also has a specially designated appropriation for grants of up  		to $4,000 per year to family caregivers of Alzheimer's victims. In 1986 this  		program was funded at a level of $1.3 million. In commenting on this program at  		a NGA conference Wisconsin's aging director noted, "The public will to directly  		pay families seems to be aroused only in regard to dramatic situations of  		tragic disabling conditions. It is hard to get the same level of support for  		victims of strokes, for example."<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note14">14</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Adult Day Care</h3>
<p>Adult day care services are expanding as increased emphasis is placed on  		supporting family caregivers. Not only does day care function as a respite  		service, particularly for families caring for an Alzheimer's victim; it also  		can offer active therapeutic treatment or simply socialization. It is not  		inexpensive, however, making state officials cautious about initiating the  		service as a regular program benefit. (They do note that with rates from  		$20-$35 a day it is less costly than eight hours of homemaker service). </p>
<p>In Maryland state general revenues are awarded to day care centers  		through an annual request for proposal process. In 1986 almost $1 million was  		allocated to 26 centers. These funds help defray initial start-up costs as well  		as subsidize sliding fee scales for persons who are not eligible for Medicaid.  		Adult day care is also a covered service under the Maryland Medicaid state plan  		with $4 million expended in 1986. State officials emphasize that without grant  		funds to cover some developmental costs, day care would not be as widely  		available since programs must, of course, be operational before any Medicaid  		support can be obtained. </p>
<p>Illinois' Community Care Program also finances adult day care delivered  		in a variety of locations including nursing homes, hospitals, senior centers  		and free standing sites. In 1986 $3.6 million was expended for day care  		services. Unlike Maryland, state funds are not available to new vendors to  		offset initial program costs. State officials identify the lack of start up  		assistance as a major deterrent to program development. </p>
<p>In Arkansas the state funded Alternative Care Program has provided the  		ability to expand the supply of adult day care by awarding small start-up  		grants. Oregon also funds limited amounts of day care under Oregon Project  		Independence and is currently examining whether day care is a cost effective  		service which should be provided across the state under its waiver program.  		</p>
<p>In Maine, as part of a general strategy to solicit nursing home support  		for community based care, a state funded demonstration project has provided  		developmental funds and some operational support for adult day care provided in  		several nursing homes. Further expansion has been stymied for several reasons,  		however, including a competitive posture by area agencies (which has limited  		client referrals) and nursing home dissatisfaction with community based  		reimbursement rates. Similar observations were made by nursing home  		representatives in other states -- unless community care rates increase, there  		will be minimal interest in service provision. Adult day care programs with a  		more social service orientation have been established across the state in  		several locations, including congregate meal sites. </p>
<p>Wisconsin takes an opposite strategy, explicitly prohibiting the use of  		Community Options Program funds for adult day care provided in nursing homes.  		This approach is consistent with the intent of COP, which is to expand  		non-institutional services in order to create more balance in the types of care  		available. In explaining this adult day care policy, state guidelines document  		the disparity between public expenditures for nursing home and community care  		and note that "COP funds were appropriated as gap-filling resources of last  		resort to be used in concert with other monies. It is neither plausible nor  		desirable that the gaps filled by COP funds should be in the relatively  		well-developed and well financed institutional sector."<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note15">15</a></font></sup></p>
<p>While most state officials support the development of adult day care as  		a component of a larger long term care system, obstacles to further expansion  		were identified fairly consistently in all states. Funding is a predictable  		problem. Beside the need for start up funds (which some of the states have  		addressed to a degree), ongoing financing sources are difficult to secure.  		While Medicaid payment is available in Maryland and the Community Care Program  		will support care for eligible clients in Illinois, economies of scale indicate  		a need for expanded participation of private pay individuals. One factor  		limiting private pay involvement is minimal community awareness of the service  		concept and its availability. Illinois notes that a major state initiative to  		expand assistance to Alzheimer's victims and their families has promoted adult  		day care as a potential source of family support; resulting publicity has led  		to an increase in the number of private pay persons seeking services. </p>
<h3>Services Provided in Alternative Living  		Arrangements</h3>
<p><i>Increasingly the lack of supportive housing options is viewed as a  		major gap in community care delivery systems. Without a place to live frail  		older people cannot remain in the community regardless of how well the long  		term care system is organized. The study states have finally bridged the  		barriers between health and social service systems in their development of  		integrated community care programs. The next frontier is to establish better  		linkages between housing policies and long term care. </i></p>
<p>In many ways this linkage will be more difficult. Not only do the two  		systems have distinct programs, administrative structures and financing  		mechanisms, they also have different vocabularies that make communication more  		problematic. In addition, the appropriate locus of coordination efforts is  		elusive since most housing programs are federally administered while long term  		care systems are managed by states. </p>
<p>The study states have each considered these problems and have had  		varying success in grappling with housing options. Maryland and Maine have made  		the strongest inroads into the housing field with the development of congregate  		housing programs. Oregon has made significant strides in the development of  		foster care homes, an approach which addresses supportive housing from the  		perspective of a social services model. Finally, some of the study states have  		supported care provided in more traditional residential care facilities and  		board and care homes. </p>
<p><b>CONGREGATE HOUSING</b>. Both Maryland and Maine have appropriated  		state funds for congregate housing programs which finance a package of services  		provided to frail residents of (usually federally assisted) housing. Both  		programs are managed by state offices on aging and are considered to be  		integral parts of state long term care systems. Maryland's program is older and  		larger, established in 1976 and serving approximately 1,000 persons, while  		Maine's program was begun in 1980 and serves approximately 170 persons. In  		contrast to board and care homes, residents in congregate housing have their  		own apartments with a kitchen and bath. Rents are federally subsidized for low  		income persons, so state outlays are only for services, which include meals,  		personal care and housekeeping. </p>
<p>In both states the target population is persons who have moderate  		impairments but are not candidates for nursing home placement. In Maryland, the  		housing manager and/or staff determine individual eligibility. In Maine a  		Professional Assessment Committee -- consisting of the project's housing  		manager, a case manager from the area agency on aging and a nurse from a home  		health agency -- select program participants. The same functional assessment  		tool used for determining eligibility for the Home Based Care Program and for  		pre-admission screening is used to determine the need for congregate housing  		services. </p>
<p>The service package in both states costs approximately $250 a month. In  		Maine the total cost is fully paid by the congregate housing program since all  		recipients must have low incomes. In Maryland both low and moderate income  		persons can participate through the use of a sliding fee scale used to  		partially finance services for moderate income elderly. In 1986, Maryland's  		program received a state appropriation of $1 million while the Maine program  		was funded at $100,000. An additional $360,000 was appropriated in Maryland to  		fund service packages for persons living in group settings of four to fifteen  		residents; in this model, as contrasted with congregate housing, an older  		resident may share a room and bath with another resident. </p>
<p>Congregate housing programs offer states a vehicle for supporting  		services within an existing supply of housing facilities. Increasingly housing  		projects that were once inhabited by a younger, mobile elderly population are  		now occupied by more frail and impaired older persons as the initial residents  		"age in place." These residents, therefore, are likely to have growing long  		term care needs. </p>
<p><b>ADULT FOSTER HOMES</b>. Oregon has actively encouraged the  		development of adult foster homes as a major service strategy under its  		Medicaid waiver program. Now serving over 1,900 waiver clients, adult foster  		homes provide personal care services in a residence of up to five clients, in  		addition to the operator's family. The development of this service option has  		been a crucial component of Oregon's strategy to relocate current nursing home  		residents to community settings. </p>
<p>Adult foster care homes are licensed locally by area agencies on aging  		and are paid directly by the client, who receives Medicaid waiver funding for  		the service aspects of foster care. As the availability of this service has  		increased for publicly assisted clients, it has also become an attractive  		option for private pay clients, 5,000 of whom now reside in adult foster homes.  		</p>
<p><b>BOARD AND CARE HOMES/RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES</b>. States have  		mixed reactions to the development of these types of facilities. While they  		offer an alternative to nursing home care, they are still "institutional" in  		nature, lacking the privacy and familiarity provided by one's own home. Maine  		is currently spending $4.5 million annually on special state SSI supplements to  		support care provided to older people in board and care facilities. The state  		approves client placements, sets a rate unique to each client and facility and  		makes payment directly to the facility after providing the client with a  		personal needs allowance. </p>
<p>Through its Medicaid waiver, Oregon finances care provided to clients  		living in residential care facilities. The state pays the facility directly for  		the cost of the service package, while the client pays for the room and board  		component. Residential care facilities are licensed by the Oregon Senior  		Services Division. State officials note that with the increase in the  		availability of adult foster homes, the use of residential care facilities has  		declined. Adult foster homes are seen as a more attractive option due to their  		smaller size and family-like environment. </p>
<p>Arkansas has 102 residential care facilities. The state provides a fixed  		supplement directly to residential care providers for recipients determined to  		be at risk of entering a nursing home. Supplemental payments were made on  		behalf of approximately 200 clients in fiscal year 1986. In an attempt to  		expand the availability of this service option, the state has proposed an  		amendment to its Medicaid state plan to add residential care facilities as a  		setting in which personal care services can be provided. To date this amendment  		has not yet been approved. In essence this proposal is similar to Oregon's  		approach, in which the Medicaid waiver pays for services in residential care  		facilities while a client's SSI check is used for room and board costs. </p>
<p>Wisconsin does not finance services provided in residential care  		facilities unless the total number of residents is less than four or six  		people, or in some exceptional circumstances less than eight. This limit  		reflects Wisconsin's program philosophy of expanding supports to help people  		remain in their own homes in order to balance its very large supply of nursing  		home beds. </p>
<h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
<p><i>Statewide community based care systems have been established with the  		goal of creating new approaches to meeting the long term care needs of older  		people. By design, these systems promote diverse and flexible community  		responses, drawing primarily upon non-medical social supports to complement  		existing health care services. Unlike the traditional physician ordered and  		nurse supervised acute care system, older consumers themselves are actively  		involved in developing their own community care plans and in supervising the  		plan's implementation. These program attributes provide the context for state  		approaches to assuring that older people receive appropriate care. </i></p>
<p>None of the six study states have applied Medicare's quality assurance  		procedures for skilled home care to their community care programs. A comparison  		of several features of community care programs with skilled nursing services  		highlights differences in program characteristics which shape state quality  		assurance initiatives. </p>
<p>First, states have created managed systems of care relying heavily on  		case managers to assess a client's needs, authorize a package of services and  		monitor, on an individual basis, the extent to which the client's needs are  		being met. With the exception of Arkansas, the study states either discourage  		or prohibit case managers from providing direct services under state community  		care programs. This policy not only separates service authorization from  		service delivery, but also establishes a point for ongoing oversight of client  		care independent of the service provider. This case management responsibility  		is applied to care provided by all types of providers, but is particularly  		important in a system using independent providers. In fact, the presence of a  		strong independent case management system makes the use of client employed  		providers possible. No similar mechanism exists outside of the provider agency  		for ongoing monitoring of individual care under the Medicare home health  		benefit. </p>
<p>A second feature distinguishing state community care programs from the  		Medicare home health benefit is the emphasis on client empowerment and consumer  		control, both in the development of individual care plans and in the design of  		overall program policies. As discussed earlier in the report, older people were  		key actors in the establishment of community care programs and the development  		of implementation policies. Their collective input and oversight continues  		through state and local committees established to give ongoing implementation  		advice. </p>
<p>Finally and most obviously, the services provided under the two programs  		are different. Medicare's home health benefit covers skilled nursing, physical,  		occupational and speech therapy, medical social work and, only in conjunction  		with one of the other services, home health aide services. Community care  		programs complement acute care services by providing generally non-medical  		services delivered by professionals and non-professionals. Medicare's services  		respond to an acute care need which can be successfully treated over three to  		four weeks; community care services respond to client functional limitations  		that are likely to be present for an extended period of time, perhaps for the  		remainder of one's life. Therefore the measures of successful client outcomes  		are different; home health focuses on restorative and rehabilitative care,  		whereas long term care services seek to maintain current levels of functioning.  		</p>
<p>Perhaps the main similarity between the two programs is that they both  		provide care in the home. As a result, states have determined that new ways of  		assuring the delivery of appropriate home care need to be applied to these  		emerging service delivery systems. Developing new quality assurance mechanisms  		has been difficult, however. </p>
<p>Some traditional mechanisms are used in all of the six states to provide  		quality assurance. These include promulgating service standards and using state  		or local staff to conduct on site reviews of provider performance. For example,  		Maryland Department of Human Resources staff conduct annual reviews of the  		county department of social services' management of the in-home aides programs.  		Other states have refined their approaches to training workers to address  		quality control concerns. For example, in order to efficiently train personal  		care workers, area agencies on aging in Arkansas have pooled their resources to  		jointly conduct a 40 hour training course. The course is offered for new staff  		every two months. In addition to assigning case management agencies ongoing  		responsibility for client based monitoring, the study states have adopted four  		different approaches to quality assurance: assessing program performance based  		on client outcome measures; quantifying quality measures for competitive  		provider selection; establishing external quality assurance committees; and  		formalizing client grievance mechanisms. Each approach, adopted by one or more  		of the study states, has potential for replication in other states. </p>
<p><b>ASSESSING PROGRAM PERFORMANCE BASED ON OUTCOME MEASURES</b>. Oregon's  		current approach to program monitoring was developed out of a process discussed  		earlier in this report called the Negotiated Investment Strategy. That process  		developed rules covering a multitude of program issues through the negotiation  		of four teams representing the Oregon Senior Services Division, the area  		agencies on aging, organizations of older people and providers. In fact  		tensions arising specifically from the previous monitoring process contributed  		to the need for negotiations. </p>
<p>Under the system that has been in place since 1985, a team of state  		staff conduct annual on site reviews of all area agency operations from fiscal  		management to client care. Although Oregon has numerous service standards,  		operational rules and fiscal requirements, the emphasis of annual reviews is on  		client outcomes not administrative process. In reviewing client care, a sample  		of clients is drawn and records on intake, eligibility determination,  		assessment, care planning, and service provision are reviewed. Then state staff  		conduct interviews with clients in their own homes to assess whether  		appropriate services were authorized and delivered in a manner that meets the  		clients' needs. State officials note that local agencies may not be managing  		programs exactly as the state would like, but if clients are well served, then  		the system is achieving its objective. </p>
<p><b>COMPETITIVE PROVIDER SELECTION BASED ON QUALITY MEASURES</b>.  		Illinois has the most formalized service delivery system of the six states and  		the most standardized assessment process. One of the most unique aspects of  		Illinois' quality assurance efforts is the effect that past performance has on  		provider selection. Beginning in 1988, providers will be competitively selected  		on the basis of quality rather than price. The results of compliance reviews  		and documented complaints filed against an agency will be compared to the same  		measures averaged for all other contractors operating across the state. A  		service history score will be assigned to each provider, either giving them an  		advantage or disadvantage in the provider selection process. This approach  		makes weeding out agencies with poor performance easier than terminating  		provider certification under Medicare and Medicaid. </p>
<p><b>EXTERNAL QUALITY ASSURANCE COMMITTEES</b>. Maine requires the area  		agencies on aging to establish a Quality Assurance Committee for the Home Based  		Care program and the Medicaid waiver component. The committees are usually  		chaired by home health agencies -- originally the major competitors with the  		area agencies for state designation as case management agencies. Other state  		mandated committee members include a physician, a nursing home representative,  		a hospital discharge planner, an adult protective services manager, and a  		representative of the state office on aging. During its monthly meetings, the  		committee conducts random reviews of client cases and also serves as an advisor  		to area agency staff in resolving difficult problems with care plans. This  		committee is also required to submit an annual report to the Bureau of Maine's  		Elderly that comments on the quality of local program efforts. </p>
<p><b>CLIENT GRIEVANCE MECHANISMS</b>. Consistent with the emphasis on  		empowering individual consumers to take an active role in directing their care,  		formalized grievance mechanisms have been established in Illinois, Maine and  		Wisconsin. In all three states clients are given information explaining the  		community care programs and describing how to place a complaint. </p>
<p>Maine and Wisconsin use a complaint resolution system that is external  		to the agencies managing community based care programs. The state long term  		care ombudsman program, which in most states handles only complaints regarding  		nursing home care and board and care, has in these states been expanded to  		address home care as well. It is usually managed by the state office on aging,  		but in Wisconsin and Maine is placed with a staffed advocacy board whose  		members are appointed by the Governor. The ombudsman programs have no  		enforcement authority, but rather attempt to mediate a resolution of complaints  		between client and providers. The Maine program just began receiving home care  		complaints in July 1986, so there is little experience to report. Wisconsin's  		program has been covering home care since 1985 and reports that the number of  		complaints average from 15-20 per month for community based care as opposed to  		75-80 per month for nursing home care. Interestingly, some home care complaints  		are not over the quality of service provided but deal with the responsibilities  		of case managers in developing and authorizing service packages. Ombusdman  		staff believe these types of complaints usually reflect an incomplete  		understanding how the community care system operates. </p>
<p>Illinois' grievance mechanism is managed internally by the Department on  		Aging. Complaints and actual violations are received through a state toll free  		line and are classified into three categories, depending upon the extent to  		which they pose an immediate threat to the client's health and safety. </p>
<p>To obtain information about the affected client's plan of care state  		staff work with the case management agency and the vendor directly providing  		services. Unlike the ombudsman model, this internal complaint mechanism  		triggers the involvement of enforcement staff who have the authority to mandate  		immediate resolution of program violations. </p>
<p>All the new approaches to quality assurance being implemented by the  		study states need to be used in combination with other strategies. Standing  		alone these mechanisms have some inherent weaknesses. For example grievance  		mechanisms, although they offer a structured vehicle for expressing complaints,  		place the burden on clients to improve the quality of their care. And the  		external quality assurance committees that rely upon staff time donated by  		various community agencies may require more staff volunteer contributions than  		are feasible as case loads grow. </p>
<p>State officials in the six study states are keenly aware of the need to  		establish consumer safeguards in the delivery of community services. Based on  		their experiences, these officials advise other states to look at quality  		concerns in the early stages of program development. <i>The challenge to states  		is to develop methods for enhancing quality care without making standards so  		inflexible and rigid that delivery systems cannot respond optimally to the  		diverse needs of individual older people</i>. Quality assurance mechanisms are  		the most underdeveloped areas of community care. Meaningful quality assurance  		is expected in many states to be a major issue as community care is expanded  		and reliance or institutions is lessened. </p>
<h2><a name="finance" id="finance">VI. FINANCING AND MANAGEMENT OF HOME AND COMMUNITY  		BASED SERVICES</a></h2>
<h3>The Federal Budget and Policy Context</h3>
<p>In the first half of the 1980s, the Federal budget and policy context  		for state long term care initiatives was shaped by:</p>
<ul><li>Federal budget deficits of unprecedented size;</li>
<li>Restraints on federal domestic program spending;</li>
<li>Reforms to allow states to develop home and community based  		  alternatives in their Medicaid programs; and</li>
<li>Increasing policy concern for evaluation of home and community based  		  care and for development of private long term care insurance financing. </li>
</ul><p><b>Federal Budget Deficit</b>. As shown in the following figure, the  		federal government's budget deficits reached unprecedented levels in the  		mid1980s. Initially, the rising deficits resulted from the worst economic  		conditions in half a century and large tax cuts. Even with a recovering  		economy, however, the deficits continued on an upward trend through 1985. (See  		<a href="strfrm.htm#figureVI-1">Figure VI-1</a>.) For state governments, these large  		deficits meant that their policies had to be shaped in the face of continuing  		national budget battles and the resulting uncertainty about federal financial  		support. </p>
<p><b>Medicaid and Other Federal Spending</b>. In both its first and second  		terms, the Reagan administration proposed to cap federal Medicaid spending and  		to limit future increases by the medical CPI or other index. Congress did not  		adopt permanent Medicaid spending limits. Temporary reductions in federal  		matching payments were enacted, however, for 1982-84.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note16">16</a></font></sup> During this restraint period, states needed  		to be particularly concerned about the use of Medicaid funds for expanded long  		term care initiatives. By 1985, however, the Medicaid program's basic  		provisions for open-ended federal matching payments had been restored and  		Congress had started adding requirements and options for expanded Medicaid  		eligibility for coverage of pregnant women and young children. As shown in the  		following figure, Medicaid's spending trends have been lower than its annual  		17% increases in the 1970s, but the federally-imposed restraints of 1982-84  		have now given way to a higher growth rate. (See <a href="strfrm.htm#figureVI-2">Figure  		VI-2</a>.) </p>

Appropriations for social services block grants grew less than 2% per year, and  		Older Americans Act social service funding rose less than 2.5% per year over  		the 1982-86 period. Such increases did not keep pace with inflation. </p>

</tr></table><p><b>Expanded State Discretion for Medicaid Home and Community Based Care  		but with Tight Budget Controls</b>. A major federal policy redirection in the  		early 1980s was to provide states greater Medicaid flexibility to develop home  		and community based alternatives to institutional care of dependent  		populations. These reforms, enacted in 1981, permitted states to receive  		Medicaid matching funds for a broad range of non-medical services, e.g.,  		personal care and adult day care for long term care populations (Section 2176  		waivers). As of mid-1986, forty-seven states had filed waiver requests (for 188  		waivers), and forty states were operating a program under such  		waivers.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note17">17</a></font></sup> About half  		of the waivers dealt with mentally retarded and mentally ill populations, and  		about half with the elderly and disabled populations. In light of the federal  		budget deficit, these waivers have been tightly administered, and states are  		required to demonstrate that no additional federal spending will result from  		such services. </p>
<p><b>Research and Policy Concerns</b>. Finally, the early 1980s saw an  		intensified federal research interest in evaluating alternatives to nursing  		home care and in private insurance financing of long term care services. During  		the first half of the 1980s, the federal government undertook its most  		extensive, carefully evaluated national effort to date on home and community  		based care in the "channelling" demonstration.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note18">18</a></font></sup> In 1985, Congress broadened previous policy  		research efforts by mandating a stud of the expansion of private insurance  		financing of long term care services.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note19">19</a></font></sup> Increased policy interest in new delivery  		and financing options for long term care services was also reflected in support  		for several studies of state Medicaid 2176 waiver initiatives, as well as in  		this study. </p>
<h3>Overview of State Financing and Management Issues</h3>
<p>States that expanded home and community based care programs in the first  		half of the 1980s needed to consider a series of financing strategy and cost  		management issues. The six states in this study were selected, in part, for  		their diversity, so they often reflect different responses to these issues.  		These experiences illustrate several successful ways to finance and manage the  		costs of home and community based care programs. Where there was common ground,  		such policies and design elements suggest a common core of proven experience.  		</p>
<p>The following sections review the financing strategy and cost management  		issues faced by these six states and the similarities and differences in how  		they dealt with them. These issues can be grouped into six areas:</p>
<ul><li>States must choose a <i>funding strategy</i> for expanding home and  		  community based services. Among the major options to be considered are whether  		  and how to make use of basic Medicaid authorities, Medicaid section 2176  		  waivers, and state-sourced funds.</li>
<li>States must design a <i>financial management system</i> for  		  implementing their funding through an administrative structure. Such efforts  		  must reconcile the differing roles of state government, local government and  		  private agencies in determining what funds will be spent; they must also  		  resolve the issues of authority, discretion and accountability in expenditure  		  decisions by these different actors. A particular concern is how to coordinate  		  state Medicaid programs, which are centrally administered and designed for  		  reimbursement of providers' bills, with local management agencies for home and  		  community based services.</li>
<li>There must be <i>cost management</i> of home and community based  		  services. States must assure that funding is targeted to those most in need,  		  that services are delivered in an efficient manner, and that program growth is  		  subject to policy control. Lessons learned in these six states demonstrate a  		  number of key elements of effective cost management.</li>
<li>States which fund major home and community based care programs need  		  <i>management information systems</i> for these efforts. Such systems should be  		  designed for program managers and reflect the state's priority objectives(s).  		  These systems need to be separate from, but coordinated with, financial  		  accounting and budgeting for home and community based care services.</li>
<li>States must consider whether or not to change their normal <i>budget  		  and evaluation processes</i> to assure sound decision-making for home and  		  community based care programs. These issues arise, in particular, where several  		  different funding sources and state agencies are involved in financing services  		  to the target population.</li>
<li>Finally, states need to consider the potential role of <i>private  		  long term care insurance</i> to reduce the financial burdens on their Medicaid  		  programs and allow affluent elderly persons to finance their own care needs.  		  The following sections discuss these issues and how each of the six states  		  deals with them. </li>
</ul><h3>Financing Strategies</h3>
<p>A broad range of federal, state and local government programs can  		provide some assistance to elderly persons in need of home and community based  		care services. Such programs include social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food  		stamps, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), social services (Title XX), Older  		Americans Act (OAA) programs, various housing programs, low income energy  		assistance, veterans benefits, general assistance and other local programs. An  		evaluation of Wisconsin's home and community based care program found that more  		than 35 different federal, state, and local program sources and private funds  		were involved in financing services to its beneficiary population. </p>
<p>This multitude of sources can make it complicated for states and local  		agencies to design and coordinate financial aid and service packages for each  		client. Nevertheless, the financial options for coming up with a substantial  		and growing sum of money for a major state-based initiative in the current  		federal fiscal and policy environment are limited. Two major funding sources  		which can pay for home and community based care services (Older Americans Act  		(OAA) and Social Services Block Grant (Title XX)), for example, are dependent  		on federal appropriations and are thus not now a source for funding growth.  		Other programs involved also have clearly limited purposes (e.g., Medicare,  		SSI, housing). Our interviews showed that a state's basic choices for  		substantially increasing funds for home and community based care services are  		few. </p>
<p>The six states in the study were selected to provide case study material  		for three basic funding strategies of home and community based care  		initiatives:</p>
<ul><li>current Medicaid authorities;</li>
<li>Medicaid Section 2176 waivers; and/or</li>
<li>state-generated funds. </li>
</ul><p>The states used these financing strategies in various combinations.  		Among the six states studied, there were two notable examples of each of the  		three strategies. General factors which entered into state considerations are  		discussed first, followed by a review of each state's major initiatives. </p>
<p><b>CURRENT MEDICAID AUTHORITIES</b>. <i>The current Medicaid statute  		provides states with the authority to include case management, personal care  		services, day care, private duty nursing, and home health services in their  		Medicaid programs</i>. Most importantly for a state's financial strategy on how  		to finance home and community based care, Medicaid spending benefits from  		open-ended federal matching funds. The federal matching percentage is higher  		the lower the per capita income of the state. Among the six states studied, the  		federal match rate for services ranged from 50% (Illinois and Maryland) to 58%  		(Wisconsin), 62% (Oregon), 68% (Maine) and 73% (Arkansas). Medicaid programs  		are also generally targeted at the lowest income elderly populations and those  		in need of nursing home financing. The matching rates and targeting potential  		mean that use of the Medicaid program is an attractive option for many states  		that want to expand home and community based services for the elderly. </p>
<p>States that did not choose to build their financing strategies on basic  		Medicaid authorities viewed this mechanism as having some liabilities. Among  		the Medicaid statute's requirements, one of the most consequential is that  		covered services must normally be provided, on a statewide basis, at least to  		the entire categorically eligible population. The potential costs and  		management difficulties of such a broad scale program can be a deterrent to  		states that have not already built the infrastructure for such a broad effort.  		There are also distinct differences among Medicaid's long term care populations  		(e.g., developmentally disabled, chronically mentally ill, adult disabled and  		elderly) which have mitigated against across-the-board service entitlements.  		Also important in some states was concern about limitations of Medicaid  		eligibility to only a fraction of the elderly poverty population and  		limitations on the types of services that could be offered. States wanting to  		launch a broad program for the elderly and disabled population found it  		necessary to consider supplemental financing sources. </p>
<p><b>MEDICAID SECTION 2176 WAIVERS</b>. Officials interviewed in the six  		states viewed financing strategies built on Medicaid 2176 waivers as offering  		states a different mix of advantages and drawbacks. <i>A state may use one (or  		more) 2176 waivers to target different Medicaid population subgroups within a  		state or to limit the number of persons who will receive home and community  		based services under the waiver. In this way, a state can have a great deal of  		flexibility to proceed at its own pace and to limit financial risks while  		learning how to manage and control the costs of a home and community based care  		program. A financing strategy using waivers can also allow a state to offer a  		much wider potential range of home and community based services than can be  		provided by the basic Medicaid options. States may also use 2176 waivers  		options to increase the number of potentially eligible persons beyond normal  		Medicaid criteria</i>, e.g., to use 300% of normal income standards and waive  		some income deeming rules in order to reach persons who are at substantial risk  		of spending down to Medicaid eligibility levels if they are forced to enter a  		nursing home. </p>
<p>From a state perspective, however, officials reported in interviews that  		there are two limitations to extensive use of the 2176 waiver. First, states  		that adopt this strategy have to demonstrate, by tightly drawn and interpreted  		"no additional cost" rules, that Medicaid expenses have not increased for the  		waivered populations. Second, the reporting and compliance requirements are a  		fairly heavy burden. States' concerns about their ability to comply with  		changing rules, reporting and documentation requirements, facing the risk of  		federal financing disallowances, were reported to be a significant factor for  		those who decided not to pursue the 2176 option. </p>
<p><b>STATE-ONLY FUNDS</b>. The third basic strategy available to states  		wanting to expand home and community based services for the elderly is to do so  		with their own funds. Such spending has the principal liability of not  		qualifying for federal matching payments and thus is much more costly for a  		state than a Medicaid-based financing strategy, for a given amount of services.  		But most states made some funding increases for such programs an integral part  		of their financing strategy, and several states gave them the primary role.  		</p>
<p><i>Three factors were involved in such choices. First, the state-only  		approach allows states flexibility to design their own programs, e.g., by  		providing "gap filling" money or starting a program without having to meet  		federal Medicaid requirements. Secondly, state funds allow use of the existing  		infrastructure of programs and institutions that provide assistance for the  		elderly outside the Medicaid program. Some expanded role for these activities,  		as part of an overall strategy, can have both practical and political  		attractions. Finally, this policy emphasis is essential for states that decide,  		as a matter of state policy, to make home and community based services  		available to the majority of elderly persons who need home and community based  		services but do not qualify for the Medicaid program or 2176 options. </i></p>
<p>The major characteristics of the financing initiative of each of the six  		study states are discussed below.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note20">20</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Two of the states -- Arkansas and Maryland -- are using their statutory  		options for Medicaid state plan design as major financing for expanding home  		and community based services for the elderly. </p>
<p>The Arkansas financing strategy emphasizes expansion of Medicaid  		personal care services for the elderly. In FY 1986, such spending came to $10  		million and was supplemented by $4.8 million in Medicaid funding for home  		health care. Medicaid funds contributed 74% of Arkansas's total spending on  		home and community based services for the elderly (see <a href="strfrm.htm#figureVI-3">Figure VI-3</a>). Arkansas also provides some state money  		($1.0 million in 1986) as secondary financing for alternative and supplemental  		personal care and day care services which can expand upon Medicaid services and  		eligibility levels. </p>

</tr></table><p>Maryland's Medicaid-based initiative also includes spending for personal  		care services and adult day care, supplemented by home health for the elderly.  		In FY 1986 such spending came to $5.3 million. At the time of our study,  		Maryland had a base of in-home aides services, funded by social services grants  		and state funds, which together were larger than its Medicaid spending ($5.7  		million in FY 1986). State-only funds are also available for "gap filling"  		grants (Gateway II, $1.1 million), for county geriatric assessment units/STEPS  		($1.7 million) and other services. Overall, Maryland's Medicaid funding  		provided 24% of total state home and community based care spending (see  		<a href="strfrm.htm#figureVI-3">Figure VI-3</a>). State officials (Department of Health  		and Mental Hygiene) described plans, however, for Maryland to make increasing  		use of Medicaid reimbursement initiatives to finance these in-home aides and  		the STEP activity. </p>
<p>Two other states, Oregon and Maine, have developed financing structures  		that exemplify statewide initiatives based on use of Medicaid 2176 waivers.  		</p>
<p>The Oregon program provides the most Medicaid spending for home and  		community based care services relative to nursing home spending of the six  		states. In FY 1986, Oregon made very broad use of Medicaid 2176 waiver  		authority (foster care, residential care, home care), plus non-waivered home  		health and personal care, to finance over $27 million of home and community  		based services. These funds are about 25% of Oregon's spending on nursing home  		care for the elderly which was reported as $79 million. Medicaid spending  		constitutes 76% of Oregon's financing for home and community based care  		services (see <a href="strfrm.htm#figureVI-3">Figure VI-3</a>). Oregon uses state-sourced  		funds as a secondary strategy to supplement Medicaid waiver funds. </p>
<p>Maine's small home and community based care initiative is based on a  		Medicaid 2176 waiver which emphasizes personal care, homemaker services and  		adult day care. Approximately $0.8 million of such services were provided to  		Maine's elderly through the waiver in 1986. Another $5.4 million of home and  		community based services were still financed under the basic Medicaid program  		and an alternative long term care program using personal duty nurses and home  		health aides. In total, Maine's Medicaid spending came to 37% of its total  		funding for home and community based care services (see <a href="strfrm.htm#figureVI-4">Figure VI-4</a>). </p>
<p>The last two states -- Illinois and Wisconsin -- have built their major  		financing initiatives for home and community based care through state-sourced  		funds. </p>
<p>Illinois's extensive home and community based care program is the  		largest of the six states studied. Spending under the Community Care Program  		has been growing rapidly, from $9.4 million in 1980 to $22.5 million in 1982,  		to $36 million in 1984, to an estimated $72 million in 1986 -- over 80% of the  		state's home and community based care spending of $87 million (see  		<a href="strfrm.htm#figureVI-4">Figure VI-4</a>). The program's size and growth rate can  		be attributed in substantial measure to judicial rulings that home and  		community based care is an entitlement for all elderly persons in Illinois.  		Approximately 30% of CCP clients are Medicaid eligible and 70% are financed  		from state only funds. Illinois's statewide. 2176 waiver thus assures Medicaid  		financing for part of this much broader state initiative but is not the central  		element in its design. Services provided include chore, homemaker, and adult  		day care. </p>
<p>The Wisconsin Community Options Program (COP) is an example of a state  		funded initiative designed to support home and community based care through  		formula grant funds to local governments. For FY 1986, the COP program provided  		$8 million for the elderly. COP has grown rapidly from a $0.2 million level for  		FY 1982, as more counties are phased in to participate. The COP initiative is  		still relatively small, however, in comparison to Wisconsin's total $42 million  		of home and community based care spending (see <a href="strfrm.htm#figureVI-4">Figure  		VI-4</a>). Wisconsin officials report that the COP program initiative has been  		developed because of the advantages of flexible administration and local  		discretion in providing the core of a system suited to Wisconsin's state/local  		traditions. Wisconsin also has a small Medicaid 2176 waiver. </p>

</tr></table><p><i>In sum, the six states adopted widely different strategy mixes for  		financing major expansions of their home and community based services. These  		strategies usually involved some initiative for use of the Medicaid program  		(basic program authorities and/or section 2176 waivers) to take advantage of  		the federal matching available for covered services to the Medicaid-eligible  		elderly. In only two states, however, did states use Medicaid funds for more  		than half of their total spending. State-only funds, as well as the large base  		of social service and Older Americans Act grants, still had (cumulatively) the  		primary role in most states. Even where Medicaid programs had more important  		roles in state's future plans, state funding also had vital roles to fill in or  		extend the financing which could be provided through the Medicaid program.  		</i></p>
<h3>Financial Management and Pooling of Funds</h3>
<p>States must establish a financial management system that will implement  		their financing strategy and resolve issues of policy control, authority for  		obligation of funds, reporting and financial accountability among the state  		government, local government, and private sector actors involved. </p>
<p>Among the six states studied, each state accomplished this coordination  		in a somewhat different fashion. In general, however, states built on existing  		financial management arrangements for similar programs. The basic financial  		management choices for the home and community services initiatives -- which  		parallel program administration options -- can be viewed as a continuum which  		includes three basic models:</p>
<ul><li>a state government operated financing system with direct  		  state-provider dealings and little autonomous role for other actors;</li>
<li>a mixed state government/local government financial management system  		  with substantial roles for each level;</li>
<li>a fully local system with state funds block-granted to localities.  		  </li>
</ul><p>The Illinois system comes closest to the unified, central financial  		management model. In Illinois, state government rather than local government  		has been the major provider of social services. This tradition has also been  		adopted for in-home and community based care for the elderly. Illinois' 63  		local case coordination units (CCUs) receive their funds through direct  		contracts with the state's Department on Aging and are paid on a  		fee-for-service basis for carrying out specified assessments, authorization and  		reauthorization, and case management under the contract's terms. Service  		vendors are also under direct contract to the state's Department on Aging. All  		service bills are sent to the Department on Aging for payment. </p>
<p>These arrangements result in a unified system in which the Community  		Care Program is a single pool of funds and determinations of service needs are  		made without distinctions between Medicaid and non-Medicaid eligibility. The  		Medicaid financial participation is handled centrally. At the end of each  		month, the Department of Aging runs a tape-to-tape match of its payments file  		against the Medicaid program's eligibility file, and federal financial  		participation is requested for the expenditures for covered services that the  		Community Care Program has made on behalf of Medicaid-eligible persons. </p>
<p>Arkansas, like Illinois, also has a primarily state-run financial  		management system for home and community based services. This reflects  		Arkansas's tradition and circumstances as a rural, relatively poor state in  		which few social services are available except those funded by the state either  		wholly or with Medicaid matching funds. The financial management of home and  		community based services is through direct arrangements. The Medicaid program  		is the primary funding source and the six area agencies on aging (AAA), plus a  		health department and CAP agency, have been the state's primary providers of  		personal care services. The AAAs are paid directly by the state Medicaid  		program for their Medicaid reimbursable claims. The AAAs also receive most of  		the state's discretionary funds for services to the elderly through budget  		allocations from the state's Division of Aging and Adult Services (in its  		Department of Human Services). This Department is also the cognizant agency for  		approving AAA cost allocation rates to their different budget activities,  		provides monthly allocations of grant funds to the agencies, and assures that  		their personal care service charges to the Medicaid program are acceptably  		cost-based. Similarly, Arkansas also has only two Client Assessment Team (CAT)  		agencies, one for northern and one for southern Arkansas. Both agencies are  		funded directly through Medicaid for their specific activities on behalf of the  		home and community based care program. </p>
<p>Maine, like Illinois and Arkansas, has a primary state government role  		because it has almost no county government. But its state-level managerial  		control is not as strong as in the two other states. In Maine, social services  		are usually provided by state funding for private, non-profit agencies which  		undertake a number of administrative tasks. Under the statewide Medicaid 2176  		waiver, Maine allocates waiver slots to local AAAs based on their projected  		caseload. The AAAs do case management, arrange for services and, for Medicaid  		waiver clients, pay providers' bills for those services. In turn, the AAAs then  		bill the state Medicaid program. For non-waiver clients, the home and community  		based care providers bill the state Medicaid program directly. </p>
<p>Oregon's financial management system combines a strong state government  		role in policy direction and funding control with a substantial and  		semi-autonomous role for local government agencies. The Senior Services  		Division (SSD) has centralized control over all major state funds for the  		elderly, including Medicaid institutional and home and community based service  		funds, social services block grant funds, Older Americans Act funds, and SSI.  		In areas with over 90% of the state's elderly population, SSD works through  		counterpart local AAAs which are part of local government (counties or councils  		of government). The AAAs also provide pre-admission nursing home screening and  		case management for home and community based care. Of the six states studied,  		Oregon thus comes closest to having organized its state and local government  		services to serve the elderly through an integrated "one stop shopping" agency.  		Medicaid spending which AAAs authorize, is projected and carefully monitored by  		the state's Senior Services Division, which pays the bills submitted by service  		providers. </p>
<p>As noted elsewhere, Oregon did not develop this state-local financial  		management system for long term care services without difficulty. In  		particular, local AAAs had been used to grant funding and considerable autonomy  		vis-a-vis the state government. The AAAs undertaking of Medicaid  		program-related tasks required sharply different operating procedures,  		standardization and reporting, cultural changes and much less autonomy than  		previously. As a result of the difficulties involved in working out these  		relations, Oregon adopted for a time a highly structured, formal negotiation  		process between SSD and the local AAAs to implement its program management  		system. </p>
<p>Of the six states studied, Maryland has the most complex state and local  		financial management, which it is still trying to rationalize. At the state  		level, three largely autonomous cabinet agencies have roles in the overall  		services system: the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (Medicaid and  		geriatric assessment grants to local governments (STEPS)), the Department of  		Human Resources (state funded in-home aides), and the Office of Aging (general  		policy coordination responsibilities, Gateway II gap-filling funds). Each of  		these three agencies also has largely independent counterparts at the county  		level in local health and social services departments and AAA agencies. Under  		Maryland's Gateway II concept, there is a designated "lead" local agency which  		is charged with coordination of the other local agencies. There were concerns  		expressed in several interviews about the coordination of state and local  		agencies; and the Maryland General Assembly had requested a study of the  		overlap, duplication and coordination among the state programs. The state's  		strategy (at least as represented by several DHMH officials), is to take  		maximum advantage of Medicaid matching funds, and use the financial management  		requirements of the Medicaid program to impose greater policy direction and  		coordination. The STEPS initiative would shift some funding of local geriatric  		evaluation units from state formula allocations to Medicaid fee-for-service  		reimbursement. This would become a vehicle for standardized assessments,  		reporting and greater state policy control. An expanded Medicaid role would  		also make the DHR/social services agencies Medicaid providers, subject to  		Medicaid's prospective rates and other requirements. Such efforts, were they to  		occur, would bring greater management and state financial accountability to  		what is now a complex and fragmented home and community based initiative. </p>
<p>The Oregon experience and Maryland policy thinking highlight a potential  		financial management issue for states with mixed state government-local  		government responsibilities: Can states allow local administrators to commit  		Medicaid funds and still assure the financial accountability, program  		standardization and budget control required of state Medicaid programs? In  		systems like Illinois, the use of Medicaid funds is subject to strong state  		management roles or oversight of local agencies. The Oregon and Maryland  		experiences demonstrate that Medicaid funds cannot be "pooled" as an  		undifferentiated source of funds to be used at the full discretion of local  		governments. The Medicaid program, even with a 2176 waiver, has precise  		eligibility rules. Medicaid-covered services must be defined with standardized  		measures recognizable for payment by the state's Medicaid computer. Payment  		rates must be established, services authorized, bills filled out completely,  		accurately and on time. Local agencies which anticipate that an expanded  		Medicaid home and community based care program will mean expanded autonomy and  		additional discretionary funds also find their responsibility for Medicaid  		spending involves expanded administrative and procedural requirements and more  		demands for standardization, regulations, paperwork and accountability. </p>
<p>These administrative requirements are not, of course, necessarily  		undesirable for states venturing into mixed state-local financial management  		roles for home and community based care. <i>As reflected in Oregon and  		Maryland, the Medicaid program's payment requirements can be a useful vehicle  		for states to establish program policies and procedures on a statewide basis,  		and result in an ability to assure cost-effective program management and  		standardization of operations. Such policies and procedures can also be  		established in state funded programs</i>. </p>
<p>The Wisconsin COP initiative comes closest to the "local government"  		financial management model. The COP funds (which are state-generated) are  		formula-granted to local units of government, which then are responsible for  		determining needs for services and spending the funds for home and community  		based services at their discretion. Thus, COP is not an entitlement program.  		The state also gives major grants to localities from its funds for other  		supportive services for the elderly. </p>
<p>In summary, two major findings stand out from the study about financial  		management arrangements for home and community based care initiatives:</p>
<ul><li>The six states -- selected for their leadership in long term care  		  initiatives -- adopted three different state, local and private agency models.  		  These were state-operated, state-local, and locally run systems for the  		  financial management of home and community based services. Financial management  		  systems logically follow and implement program administration structure and  		  roles.</li>
<li>Broader use of Medicaid funds for home and community based care can  		  break new ground in requiring coordination of this state-operated payment  		  system with a locally administered service authorization and case management  		  system. The issues involved in working out financial accountability,  		  administrative policies and procedures, and budget control involve power  		  relations and cultural differences. These can be resolved, but they are  		  potential sources of tension in implementing effective financial management  		  systems. </li>
</ul><h3>Cost Management</h3>
<p>A third basic design issue for a system of home and community based care  		services is to identify and incorporate key program elements which allow the  		programs to be managed in a cost-effective manner. </p>
<p><i>The six study states faced this issue and developed a number of ways  		for dealing with these problems. One of the most important common features of  		the six state systems is that they are all managed systems of care. They do not  		follow the traditional open-ended health insurance reimbursement model in which  		providers prescribe the need for their own services and are reimbursed for  		whatever they spend or charge (e.g., through "usual, customary, and reasonable"  		reimbursement rates). </i></p>
<p>Each of the programs differ but all of them include three basic  		elements:<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<ul><li><b>Pre-admission Screening</b>. Before a patient can be admitted to a  		  nursing home at Medicaid expense, states screen to determine if a nursing home  		  admission is necessary. If home and community based services are a viable  		  alternative, the patient is advised of these options. This preadmission process  		  helps target programs to those at risk of being placed in a nursing home and to  		  save what would otherwise be spent on nursing home care for those who are  		  appropriate for home and community based services. This certification process  		  may also be extended to non-Medicaid patients, based on the reasoning that  		  nearly all nursing home admissions could lead to Medicaid spending, and that  		  the most cost-effective time for a state to offer home and community based  		  alternatives is prior to such admissions.</li>
<li><b>Patient Assessment and Care Planning</b>. An individual receiving  		  home and community based care has a service plan developed, typically using  		  standardized, quantitative assessment instruments. Such plans specify the  		  amount of home and community based care which the person will need, how it will  		  be managed and paid for. Such assessments and plans provide a way of  		  prospectively managing case costs and service use.</li>
<li><b>A Case Management System</b>. One function of a case manager is to  		  assist clients in obtaining needed services, e.g., by providing a list of  		  potential providers from whom a person may select, and/or making arrangements  		  for the services. A case manager may also be responsible for seeing that  		  services are provided within a defined budget limit. </li>
</ul><p>For several states, the designation of a case management agency was a  		critical question because of concerns about conflicts of interest and states'  		ability to control costs. In particular, states need to resolve whether AAAs,  		which were established legislatively to be advocates for the elderly, should  		also be case managers. States also must resolve whether case managers should be  		different from service providers. In Arkansas, for example, case management and  		provision of services were both AAA functions, but the assessment of service  		needs and plans of care were restricted to CAT agencies (AAAs which had  		relinquished their direct service functions). Illinois limits AAAs to a program  		support function without a direct role in needs assessment or case management.  		On the other hand, Oregon relies on AAAs (when they are units of local  		government) for eligibility, assessment, care plans and case management for the  		home and community based care program. Maine allows AAAs to be both case  		managers and service providers for personal care assistants and home delivered  		meals only. Thus, there was no consensus on this issue or its implications for  		program costs among the six states. </p>
<p>In addition to these common cost management elements, states' home and  		community based care programs also made use of one (and usually more) of the  		following program elements: </p>
<p><b>Limited Population Eligibility</b>. Limiting the population which is  		potentially eligible for home and community based services provides a clear  		upper limit on one of the most important cost-driving factors. A state program  		limited to Medicaid eligibles automatically restricts the service population to  		the categorically eligible population, with state options for the medically  		needy. A section 2176 waiver or state-financed program can also be used to  		limit eligibility to a population defined by age or other criteria. Among the  		six states, Illinois and Wisconsin were the only two without clearly limited  		population eligibility, although both had functional eligibility criteria and  		cost-sharing requirements. </p>
<p><b>Payment Methods and Rates</b>. Establishing economical unit service  		prices is also a key element in cost control. Such measures are necessary  		because of the wide variations in potential prices for home and community based  		care services. Under open-ended Medicare cost-based reimbursement, time limited  		medical home health services provided during a recuperative period maybe paid  		for at $40-60 dollars per visit. The six states in this study established  		prospective prices for longer-term home-based support services, usually  		provided by non-medical personnel, which were far lower than these rates. The  		range for personal care services, for example was $5-$10 hour. The services  		covered under Medicare and these programs differ quite substantially;  		cost-management requires that such differences be reflected in payment rates.  		</p>
<p>States and local agencies established their rates through a combination  		of competitive bidding, fixed rates, cost audits, and prior experience. Rates  		are not directly comparable across states because of differences in service  		definitions, provider types and qualifications, and general price levels.  		Examples of several methods are discussed below. </p>
<p>In Illinois, the state government used to contract from Springfield for  		all CCP services on a competitive basis for each service area. About 60 percent  		of the home care services were contracted from for-profit home service agencies  		and four vendors had about one-half of the market. Under this system the state  		had obtained rates which had declined for five years in a row. The state's  		rates declined to the point that major non-profit, religiously affiliated  		providers complained that they were too low to adequately pay for full time,  		well qualified staff at rates which included normal fringe benefits (such as  		health insurance). As a result, Illinois ended the competitive bid process and  		replaced it with a negotiated payment rate process. In Illinois, competition  		for who will be a service provider is now determined, from among those willing  		to accept these prices, on the basis of service quality. In 1985, Illinois'  		statewide averages were $5.80 per hour for chore services, $6.51 per house for  		homemaker services, and $20 per day for adult day care. Case monitoring was  		paid at $10/client per month. Initial face-to-face assessment by CCUs (case  		coordination units) were paid at a $65 rate, and the fee for their periodic  		client reassessments was $42. Assessments which involved only phone screening  		were paid at a $10 fee. </p>
<p>In Oregon, provider payment rates are normally set (for agencies) by  		competitive Requests for Proposals (RFPs) (for agencies) or (for independent  		providers) as a flat rate. These rates were reported to range between $3.45 per  		hour and $5.53 per hour for personal care services. Foster care, the key  		out-of-nursing home service which Oregon has developed using the section 2176  		waiver, is paid on a statewide fixed fee basis, plus add-on amounts for  		specific services. The basic foster care service rate (not including room and  		board) is $150/month, which compared to state costs of about $750/month for  		nursing home care. </p>
<p>In Arkansas, the AAAs are the primary providers of Medicaid personal  		care services. The reimbursement rates are cost based and developed from  		Department of Human Services supervised cost allocation and audits of the AAAs'  		budgets. These costs now average about $6 per hour. A limited number of home  		health aide services are paid at a $22/visit rate (no minimum time), a  		differential compared to personal care services which state officials say needs  		to be examined. Chore services were reported to be paid in the range from  		$3.35/hr to $8.45/hr across the state, homemaker services from $3.55 to $6.40  		per hour, and adult day care from $6-$10 for a 1/2 day to $20 for a full day.  		The CAT agencies were reported to be paid $60 per assessment and reassessment.  		</p>
<p>Maryland has a more complex rate structure than the other states because  		of the several different departments involved in home and community based care.  		The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has revised prospective payment  		rates for its Medicaid program based on the program's experience. The personal  		care service rate under Medicaid, which had been a flat $10 per visit, was  		revised in 1986 to become a graduated system paying $10 per visit (for a visit  		of up to 3 hours), $20 per visit (for 3-4 hour visits), and $25 for two visits  		per day. Similar prospective rate reviews were reported underway for home  		health, physical and occupational therapy, and home aides, with variations by  		geographic region. Medical day care rates are derived from daily nursing homes  		rates; the $35 per day payment is now pegged to 75% of the daily nursing home  		rate. In-home aides provided by the Department of Human Resources cost $6 to  		$11 per visit depending on the cost accounting technique used. Nurse managers  		of personal care services are paid $37-40 per month per worker supervised.  		Geriatric evaluations by the different county health departments, which are not  		now standardized, were paid prior to 1987 on a cost basis reported to range  		from $60 to $180 per evaluation. At the time of this study, the state was in  		the process of trying to negotiate a more uniform rate and standardized  		geriatric assessments with the counties (the STEPS initiative). </p>
<p>Another rate-setting option for states involves leaving rate  		negotiations for personal care workers to individuals and their families.  		Client-negotiated rates (at least in some instances) are used in Wisconsin.  		Under these arrangements, clients may be able to negotiate some packages of  		care directly at costs which are below what states would have to pay. Such  		arrangements, for example, may be made when a neighbor helps out on a part-time  		basis. </p>
<p><b>Cost sharing</b>. Patient cost sharing is an effective way to reduce  		third-party payments of health care costs, and states also have some options  		for use of cost sharing for home and community based care services. Such  		measures are useful primarily in state-financed systems which expand on  		Medicaid's coverage, since cost sharing is not permitted for Medicaid services  		for the categorically eligible population. Cost sharing possibilities also  		arise in meeting Medicaid spend-down eligibility requirements. </p>
<p>In Illinois's program, cost sharing features are particularly important  		since home and community based care is an entitlement for all elderly persons.  		Illinois has designed its cost sharing system to encourage patients to use only  		what services are really needed, rather than all for which they could qualify  		on the basis of determination of need scores. In making a client's cost sharing  		calculation, the first $426 per month of income is protected. Thus if a client  		has an income of $626 per month, the total funds available for cost sharing is  		calculated to be $200 per month. The cost sharing actually required will be  		$200 times the ratio of actual service costs to the maximum amount for which  		the client is eligible, up to a cost sharing rate of 90%. In this example, if a  		client were eligible for $450 per month of services, and made arrangements with  		relatives, neighbors and informal caregivers so that only half this potential  		maximum ($225) were provided by CCP, the cost sharing for the CCP services  		would be $100 (1/2 of $200). Illinois officials believed the cost sharing did  		result in service cost reductions. Average case cost sharing was reported to be  		$28/month, compared to individual care cost limits of $750/month. </p>
<p>The Wisconsin COP program provides an example of how cost sharing can be  		used in a home and community based care program for populations near  		Medicaid-eligibility levels. There is almost no COP cost sharing for the  		Medicaid-eligible categorically or medically needy populations There is cost  		sharing, however, for the "six-month" Medicaid eligible population (i.e., those  		who are deemed to be eligible for in-home or community based services because,  		if they entered a nursing home, they would "spend down" their income and assets  		to Medicaid eligibility within 6 months), as well as for all higher income  		patients. At county option, the six-month eligible population can be charged  		cost sharing of 50% to 100% of the care costs they receive under the COP  		program. </p>
<p>Costing sharing is also used in Maryland (state funded programs), Maine  		(state home-based care) and in Oregon (state funded Project Independence). </p>
<p><b>Client Spending Limits</b>. Several of the states in the study made  		use of explicit client spending limits to control costs. Typically, such limits  		are established in setting up a plan of care. States may establish limits on  		maximum payable amounts in relation to explicit disability ratings and/or in  		relation to what would have been spent on nursing home care for a client. Per  		client spending limits can also be used in establishing local agency funding  		allocations and, by such agencies, in setting spending targets for individual  		case managers for their group of clients. </p>
<p>Maine has one of the most explicit spending limits for administration of  		its 2176 waiver program. Each AAA has a budget allocation target, which is  		calculated as a per client cap equal to the state's potential expense of  		providing ICF care for that person. In turn, each case manager has this  		financing allotment provided for his or her caseload. This maximum amount is  		also programmed into the state's Medicaid computer so that spending for a  		client may not exceed this amount. Through these spending limits, Maine is able  		to assure that its waiver spending will be less than institutional care costs  		for the covered population. Illinois is similar. Each client has a cap equal to  		group care costs for his or her level of impairment. </p>
<p>Oregon does not establish absolute limits for each area, but does use a  		sophisticated system of forecasting target nursing home spending and tracking  		expenditures. Areas which run over projections may be able to get approved  		reallocations of budget targets from other areas; but there is a strong  		emphasis on dealing with excess costs by improving local administrative  		performance in keeping individuals out of nursing homes. In Oregon, the  		determination of how many service hours each client will receive is calculated  		by formula based on ADL functional scores, and is not limited to cost per case  		for nursing home equivalent service levels. </p>
<p>Arkansas currently limits its personal care services to a maximum of 72  		hours per client per month ($442/month). Arkansas also is developing options to  		expand its ability to control per client spending through prepaid plan options.  		This approach would capitate a residential care facility or boarding home as a  		personal care provider for a defined group of individuals (Medicaid-eligible  		residents). The facility will receive a flat capitation payment of $180/month  		per client to cover all of their personal care needs (a service average of  		about 6 hours per week). In addition, the individual's SSI check, less personal  		allowance, will add about $342 per month ($367-$25) of income for the facility.  		</p>
<p>Wisconsin does not set any maximums for individuals. The state sets an  		average payment level for the counties and counties are not reimbursed if their  		average cost for all recipients exceeds the contract level. In CY 1987, the  		county average was $603 per month (actual spending was below that level). The  		county average is adjusted each year and represents the average amount of state  		Medicaid funds that would be incurred if the program participants entered  		nursing homes. Counties may set service maximums for individuals served, so  		long as those maximums are not below $800/month. About 20% of the counties  		established such maximums in CY 1986. </p>
<p><b>Limit State Appropriation</b>. All states in our sample had state  		constitutional prohibitions on overspending and all spending -- including  		Medicaid expenditures -- had to be appropriated. Statutory language,  		appropriations structure and state administrative practices, however,  		determined whether and how tightly each individual program element was  		controlled. Spending limits could apply specifically to line-item  		appropriations for home and community based care programs or (more usually) to  		broader categories, such as a department's total appropriation. When included  		in broader control totals, home and community based programs can be at risk of  		being reduced because of overruns in other spending; but they also can be  		assisted, of course, by the potential for offsetting their overruns (if any)  		through other program reductions. </p>
<p><b>Management Accountability and Performance</b>. Systems that provide  		home and community based care need to be managed care systems. Financial  		management systems (discussed previously) and management information systems  		(discussed in the next section) thus have important roles and need to be used  		for cost control. States also found that training sometimes needed to be  		provided for the key administrative and cost management functions (particularly  		related to Medicaid requirements and procedures), performance needed to be  		monitored, and administrative follow-ups were required when cost problems  		arose. </p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b>. The various mechanisms described above provide a  		potentially broad and effective set of tools for the cost effective management  		of home and community based care programs. States may face many pressures to  		expand these programs. Indeed, if these approaches for meeting long term care  		needs come to replace a majority of institutional care spending they would be  		at least two to five times larger than they are today in these six states. But  		rapid program growth seems more likely to result from policy-level funding  		decisions or from unwillingness to take cost containing measures than from  		inherent lack of technical tools for program management. </p>
<p>In the concern with such technical details of how to manage costs for  		home and community based care programs, however, it may be too easy to overlook  		the critical importance of having qualified people to start and run new home  		and community based care programs for the elderly. <i>Regardless of the system,  		the individuals working in a program are responsible for its successes</i>.  		Among these six leadership states, we found that their programs were run by an  		exceptional group of individuals, committed both to improving services for the  		elderly population and to good public administration. </p>
<h3>Management Information Systems</h3>
<p>A fourth major element needed for successful home and community based  		care programs is a management information system (MIS). Such systems --  		intended to assist program managers in daily operations -- differ from (but  		need to be related to) other data and information-based activities which states  		also require, such as budget development, financial accounting, and evaluation  		studies. </p>
<p>There were major differences among the six states in their MIS systems  		design, reflecting their varying policy objectives, funding strategies,  		financial management arrangements, and other program characteristics. Two  		generalizations applicable to all six states are discussed first. Three of the  		state MIS systems are then discussed in greater detail as representative of  		state-government run, state-local, and local-operated systems. </p>
<p><i>The first general observation is that the Medicaid program's basic  		Management Information System (MMIS) is inadequate for the day to day  		management of home and community based care programs</i>. MMIS provides a  		retrospective accounting of Medicaid bills paid which meets federal  		requirements for matching funds. Its principal drawbacks for a managed care  		system for Medicaid clients are that key management-relevant information is not  		reported (e.g., ADL scores), the data reports are generated after events have  		occurred, and MMIS files are frequently so large and cumbersome that they  		cannot be easily analyzed. Managers need systems that allow for timely tracking  		and management intervention (e.g., at a point when a person applies for a  		nursing home admission or when service costs are authorized) and analysis which  		provides key performance indicators for how well the program is operating. </p>
<p>The second general observation is that none of these states operated  		total client-based management information systems which tracked all federal,  		state and local assistance received by a recipient of home and community based  		services. Such comprehensive management and tracking systems are complex and  		expensive. Among these six states, only Wisconsin had developed such a system,  		and it had been dropped after a year. Comprehensive client information may be  		critical for local assessment and case management agencies. <i>To initiate a  		home and community based care program, however, it is not necessary to have  		comprehensive state-level reporting of all of the programs benefiting a client.  		State management information systems for home and community based care can be  		designed for what state managers need for management of their own funds and  		monitoring results for which they are accountable</i>. </p>
<p>Three of the states -- Illinois, Oregon and Wisconsin -- have management  		information systems that provide useful examples of operating systems for  		different models of home and community based care programs. </p>
<p>The Illinois MIS is designed for a system which is run almost entirely  		by a state government agency through direct contracts with assessment agencies,  		case managers and service providers. Since a court case has established that  		such services are a statewide entitlement -- and have to be provided in a  		timely manner -- the Illinois MIS tracks clients from their initial application  		for the program and reports data on the number of days before such applications  		are resolved. The key management control point in the Illinois system is prior  		authorization of services. The MIS thus emphasizes extensive reporting on  		patient assessments and care plans. Each CCU (case coordination unit) files a  		report containing patient demographic and economic data and quantified scores  		from the ADL/determination of need assessments. These reports also include a  		summary plan of care showing how many services, by which providers, have been  		authorized for each client. Actual expenditures are checked against the service  		maximums in the service authorization reports. This basic data set then becomes  		the basis of generating a number of management analyses (e.g., determination of  		need (DON) scores), authorized and actual spending and service patterns by  		different agencies in relation to client DON score, client use profiles, living  		arrangements and economic status of clients, etc. </p>
<p>The Oregon Senior Services Division oversees most state spending for  		senior citizens, including both nursing home and home and community based care.  		The primary SSD management objective is to keep elderly individuals out of  		nursing homes if they can be served in the community. Oregon's MIS emphasizes  		this objective and the information needed for 2176 waiver reports. </p>
<p>The Oregon MIS has two subsystems. One focuses on nursing home-related  		placements. Each area of the state is tracked on projected vs. actual numbers  		of nursing home admissions, discharges, and relocations. To provide timely  		monitoring of system performance, most of these statistics are gathered each  		week by telephone. This is the state's primary information tool for "real time"  		monitoring and management intervention. The second system integrates  		expenditure data from financial draws and Medicaid program data to track actual  		vs projected long term care expenditures in each area. These figures come in  		more slowly from financial and bill-paying reports. For preparing management  		analyses and 2176 waiver reports, Oregon officials also emphasize the need for  		creative programming in order to use Medicaid data as a client-based tracking  		system. For some purposes (e.g., budget), it is desirable to have data on a  		full-time equivalent or "slots" basis; for other purposes actual expenditures  		per client are needed. For some purposes, simple service counts are adequate;  		to answer other questions it is necessary to know the distribution of such  		services and how many clients are receiving several different types of  		services. Without investing in a client-based Medicaid analysis capability,  		such tracking capacity from routine MMIS reports is limited.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note22">22</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Wisconsin's management information system for its largely county-run  		system program, is based on reports the counties file each month on the type  		and number of service units received by each client. Since the state program is  		intended to provide maximum flexibility to local governments, subject to an  		overall spending constraint, most services are reported under a general  		"supportive home care" label. At the end of each year, the state sends each  		county a summary of the service units which they have reported providing to  		each client, and the county fills in the payment rates and total spending and  		returns the completed form. This becomes the state's basic expenditure record  		for how the formula grant funds were spent. Counties also file reports on  		client assessments and case plan developments. These reports are, in effect,  		payment vouchers since counties are reimbursed separately for each of these  		services. Several different management reports are then generated from these  		basic records, e.g., average client costs, trends in expenditures per case,  		characteristics of high and low cost clients. Wisconsin's reporting system thus  		provides summary spending information for state officials and recognizes county  		government's role as the day to day program managers. </p>
<p>In 1985, Wisconsin implemented a more extensive computerized Client  		Services Information System (CSIS) in which counties reported on all clients  		for state funded programs. The Community Options Program (COP) reporting was  		one of the modules in this integrated statewide information system. As noted,  		the CSIS was dropped after one year. The CSIS has now been replaced by another  		client-based, on-line information system. Under the new system, units of  		service are obtained for all persons but financial data is obtained only for  		COP funds. The new state system collects total COP funds expended for each COP  		recipient but breaks down those costs into each service component only for  		persons who are on Medicaid waiver funding. </p>
<p>Arkansas was in the process of designing a state MIS system in 1986. The  		central Medicaid role in financing and the established state fiscal management  		system vis-a-vis local AAA are precedents for such a state-operated system.  		</p>
<p>Maryland's multi-agency, multi-government level roles make an integrated  		state MIS system at best an unlikely and problematic undertaking. More limited  		efforts at state standardization, e.g., of geriatric assessments (STEPS), were  		immediate priorities. Local MIS efforts had been demonstrated in Baltimore.  		</p>
<p>Maine's delegation of responsibilities to local agencies did not have a  		comprehensive management information system as a prerequisite, although work on  		an MIS system also was underway in 1986. </p>
<p>In summary, the lesson from the study states is that an MIS system is  		necessary for states that wish to manage their home and community based care  		system. The state MIS can start as a basic reporting system designed in light  		of the state's administrative role and focus on key operating data needed by  		state program managers. </p>
<h3>Budget and Evaluation Processes</h3>
<p>States need to consider whether to develop new budget and evaluation  		processes for home and community based care programs. As discussed below, most  		(though not all) of the six states found that existing budgetary processes  		could accommodate these new efforts. However, separate evaluation studies are  		necessary for some program assessments.</p>
<p><b>BUDGET DEVELOPMENT FOR HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED CARE SERVICES</b>.  		The six states shared basic similarities in budgeting and appropriations  		processes. Executive branch departments prepared initial budget requests.  		Governors, working with their budget offices, personal advisors and department  		heads, reviewed these requests and proposed budgets to the legislative branch.  		Legislatures reviewed these requests, held hearings and enacted appropriations.  		</p>
<p>Despite these similarities, the respective role and authorities of the  		actors varied. Maryland, for example, has a strong role for the governor in  		fiscal affairs. Under Maryland's Constitution, the legislature may not increase  		any line item in the governor's budget request. In contrast, Arkansas has a  		legislature-dominated budget process and its legislative council is involved in  		many operational details of programs, including regulations, contracts, and  		personnel. The respective role of state budget offices also varied. In  		Wisconsin, for example, the state budget office analyzed and projected various  		program options, whereas in Maine such issues were mostly deliberated between  		the governor and agency head. </p>
<p>In five of the six states, the state's home and community based care  		initiative was handled within the state's normal budgetary processes. This was  		facilitated by the broad responsibilities of the agency in which the program  		was housed. Four of the states (Arkansas, Oregon, Maine, and Wisconsin) had a  		broad Department of Human Resources, Department of Human Services, or  		Department of Health and Social Services which included the major home and  		community based care program, Medicaid and other social services programs. The  		fifth, Illinois, centralized its home and community based services in the  		Department of Aging, also making for a relatively integrated budget process.  		Issues raised by a home and community based care program are similar to many  		other human resources, social service and Medicaid program issues. Developing  		funding strategies, fiscal management and controlling costs for such programs  		are normal government budget activities. </p>
<p>Maryland, with three cabinet agencies involved in home and community  		based care efforts, is the major exception. The state's Interagency Committee  		on Aging Services, chaired by the Office on Aging (a small cabinet department),  		was tasked to develop an integrated budget request for the Department of Health  		and Mental Hygiene, Department of Human Resources, and Office on Aging  		programs. Its initial effort, however, simply consolidated the agency budget  		requests and transmitted them to the the governor's office. In a similar effort  		to develop a cross-agency funding strategy, Maryland's legislature also went  		outside the budgetary process and required a separate study from the state  		budget office (the Duchez report). </p>
<p>None of the states developed unified state budgets covering all spending  		on behalf of the elderly. Most state appropriations that benefit the elderly  		are not exclusively "elderly" programs. Only Maryland had a supplementary  		budget analysis that estimated state spending on the elderly. A copy of this  		table has been published for several years as part of the governor's overall  		budget request. </p>
<p><i>A final common finding about budget-making for home and community  		based care services was the importance of developing broad consensus on the  		program's philosophy and purposes in providing elderly persons services which  		they wanted as an alternative to nursing home care. In all six states the key  		budget actors interviewed were well-versed about what the program was trying to  		do, as well as its problems</i>. In initial years of a program, when reliable  		data and formal evaluations can be difficult to provide, such understandings,  		often a result of informal discussions among program personnel,  		decision-makers, and interested state, local and private sector persons, seemed  		to provide a context in which the formal budget process occurred. </p>
<p><b>PROGRAM EVALUATION</b>. States cannot answer all important questions  		concerning home and community based care through normal financial, budgetary,  		and program management systems. Some key data can be provided by such systems,  		however. Oregon, for example, can demonstrate the decline in its nursing home  		census. As illustrated in <a href="strfrm.htm#figureVI-5">Figure VI-5</a> of the six  		study states Oregon has the highest proportion of total long term care spending  		going to community care. Illinois can track spending trends for clients with  		different characteristics on a very sophisticated basis. Arkansas can document  		that the nursing home population has remained constant since 1979. </p>
<p>A comprehensive program evaluation needs to include the effects of home  		and community based care programs on nursing home placements, on many different  		federal, state and local programs, and on individuals and their families. Such  		assessments require so many resources that they can only be done periodically;  		in addition, they do not make much sense during the first few years of a  		program until it has gone through an implementation and start-up phase and is  		operating well. </p>

</tr></table><p>Several states were in the process of initiating or undertaking broad  		studies of targeting, cost-effectiveness and other key effects of their home  		and community based care programs during the study period. Wisconsin, however,  		was the only state to have completed a comprehensive cost study.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note23">23</a></font></sup> For this study, a structured sample of about  		200 cases had been taken and, for each of these clients, a detailed record was  		developed of all the government (federal, state and local) assistance and  		non-government income which those individuals had received (approximately 35  		different sources). Each of the clients was also independently assessed as to  		whether or not they needed to be in a nursing home. Expenditures were analyzed  		for impacts on federal and state governments, counties and other government  		units, and individuals. Overall, the evaluation concluded that COP reduced  		total expenditures for all public payers. Nevertheless, state government  		expenditures rose because state funds paid 59% of community care compared to  		only 42% of nursing home care, some COP-funded services went to persons not at  		imminent risk of entering nursing homes and some COP clients would not have  		been Medicaid-eligible immediately upon entering a nursing home. Assistance by  		friends, neighbors and. relatives was not affected by the receipt of COP-funded  		services. </p>
<p>This type of extensive client-based, multiple-program,  		multiple-government level evaluation is not necessary for states to be  		well-informed about many aspects of their home and community based care  		programs. Much program information is generated by financial, MIS and other  		reporting systems; periodic budget and appropriations processes assess program  		performance measures; and ad-hoc evaluations are also made through the feedback  		from citizens, local government officials and interest groups to state program  		managers and decision-makers. If necessary, formal arrangements for ongoing  		monitoring can also be established for home and community based programs, such  		as Maine's quality assurance committees and client satisfaction survey.  		Nevertheless, if states wish to thoroughly assess impacts on clients and the  		benefits and costs of their systems, such broad evaluation studies are  		necessary. </p>
<h3>Private Long Term Care Insurance</h3>
<p>Less than 3% of the elderly's nursing home expenses are now covered by  		Medicare or by private long term care insurance. As a result, almost the full  		burden of financing services that the elderly cannot pay for themselves falls  		on state Medicaid programs, which now account for nearly one-half of national  		nursing home expenses. If a viable insurance market can be developed, such  		policies might extend to home and community based care services, allow a  		substantial number of elderly persons to finance long term care insurance needs  		from their own resources, and reduce fiscal pressures on state Medicaid  		programs. </p>
<p>The six states studied faced similar problems of trying to foster  		private insurance company interest in offering long term care insurance, while  		also protecting consumers from the potential for deception, fraud and unsound  		policies which could result from a completely uncontrolled market. </p>
<p>All of the states had some form of private long term care insurance  		initiative in 1986. These efforts can be seen as early or interim steps toward  		a private insurance financing base for long term care. Nevertheless, there is  		still a great deal of uncertainty about how effective these measures will be --  		and about how far and fast private long term care insurance can develop. As  		well, these initiatives dealt far more with coverage of institutional long term  		care services -- a leading cost concern -- than with home and community based  		alternatives. </p>
<p>The state initiatives fell into three broad categories: (1) studies; (2)  		consumer protection standards; and (3) mandated insurance benefits.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note24">24</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Three states -- Wisconsin, Oregon, and Illinois -- had formal  		government-mandated studies in 1986. In Wisconsin, a study by the legislature's  		staff was focusing on how to encourage the sale and purchase of private long  		term care insurance. In Oregon, an advisory committee to the legislature's  		health care committee had been established to report on long term care issues.  		Illinois's task force on long term care insurance, enacted in 1985, was still  		in its formative stage. None of these studies had been completed at the time of  		this survey. </p>
<p>Consumer protection appeared to be the major intent of actions by Maine  		and Arkansas. In 1986, Maine enacted legislation which expanded regulatory  		authority over nursing home policies, with a particular emphasis on such issues  		as financial disclosure, cancellation, and marketing practices. Maine had also  		participated on planning groups for LTC insurance with Blue Cross/Blue Shield  		of Maine. Arkansas had issued minimum nursing home policy standards dealing  		with concerns such as amount and duration of benefits. </p>
<p>Maryland and Wisconsin were pursuing strategies which included mandating  		private insurance benefits. In 1986, Maryland enacted legislation to require  		all health insurance (as of mid-1987) to offer nursing home and custodial care  		options, although insurance companies were allowed to include cost sharing,  		benefit limitations and other risk-management features. Wisconsin statutes have  		required nursing home coverage as part of health insurance since 1975, but  		attempts to enforce these provisions through state-established minimum  		requirements in 1981 led to most insurance companies withdrawing their  		policies. Revised regulations were issued in 1986 designed to meet private  		insurors' concerns (e.g., by allowing three-day prior hospitalization  		requirements). In addition to these requirements, Maine, Maryland and Wisconsin  		also have longstanding requirements that health insurance policies include home  		health benefits. </p>
<p>In summary, while state officials were aware of the need for private  		long term care insurance -- and searching for ways to expand such coverage --  		government actions to develop this financing base for home and community based  		care had not yet become a major policy theme. </p>
<h2><a name="appendI" id="appendI">APPENDIX I. SUMMARY OF EXPENDITURES FOR LONG TERM  		CARE SERVICES</a></h2>
<p>This Appendix contains information on services and expenditures for long  		term care in each of the six study states during the period from 1982 through  		1986. The information depicts total expenditures on long term care services for  		the elderly across all funding sources: Medicaid, Social Services Block Grants,  		Older Americans Act appropriations, and programs supported by state General  		Revenue Funds. The data were collected from a number of sources. First,  		published state documents and reports were collected and reviewed. Second, data  		were collected during the site visits to each state. Third, responsible  		officials in each state were asked to verify information and reconcile  		discrepancies between sources. These efforts were undertaken to develop a  		database for each state that was both comprehensive and accurate. In addition,  		efforts were made to collect the data according to a general framework that  		would allow intra- and inter-state comparisons.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note25">25</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The focus of the overall study is reform of state long term care systems  		emphasizing the development of home and community based services. The data in  		this Appendix reflects that emphasis. Data are presented and formatted to  		illustrate trends in state spending for noninstitutional services. It should be  		noted, however, that expenditures for long term care are dominated by Medicaid  		spending for nursing home care. As shown in the summary tables for each of the  		six study states, only Oregon spends less than eighty-four cents of every long  		term care dollar on nursing homes. </p>
<p>The Appendix presents the data in the following manner.  		<a href="strfrm.htm#tableAI-1">Table AI-1</a> provides information on Medicaid and total  		spending for long term care services and the population most at risk of long  		term care. <a href="strfrm.htm#tableAI-2">Table AI-2</a> shows the national expenditures  		for the other two significant sources of federal LTC funds to states: the  		Social Services Block Grant and the Older Americans Act. <a href="strfrm.htm#tableAI-3">Table AI-3</a> compares the rates of growth on selected  		expenditure and population variables for each of the six states, compared to  		the six states in aggregate, and, where data are available, to national trends.  		The rest of the material consists of pairs of state-specific tables, arranged  		alphabetically by state. The first of each pair of state tables lists  		expenditures by program and/or funding stream for the period 1982-1986. The  		second of each pair is a summary table that applies the same data to show  		year-to-year fluctuations and overall trends for the 1982-1986 study period.  		</p>
<h3>Long Term Care Growth</h3>
<p>The increase in expenditures for long term care over the five year  		period from 1982 to 1986 showed significant, but not exceptional, growth. The  		average compound rate of growth over the period as a whole was in the 5 percent  		to 12 percent range, depending on the state. Growth has not been steady,  		however. The highest growth rates for most states took place from 1982-1984,  		slowing by 1986. This may indicate that growth will level off in the next few  		years. </p>
<p><b>HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES (HCBS) GROWTH</b>. As could be  		expected of the states chosen for this study, the growth rate for HCBS from all  		funding sources outstripped that of total long term care (LTC) expenditures. In  		all the study states except Oregon, the difference was substantial. The lower  		rate of growth in Oregon's spending on HCBS services compared to LTC  		expenditures as a whole can be explained by its relatively high base year  		(1982) expenditures on these services. Oregon's HCBS expenditures were already  		25 percent of total LTC expenditures in 1982, whereas in the other five states  		HCBS spending ranged from about 4 percent to 10 percent of total LTC spending  		in that year. This reflects the fact that Oregon had substantially expanded  		HCBS before the study period; the other five states began significant expansion  		during the period from 1982 to 1986. As with LTC expenditures generally, the  		growth in HCBS expenditures was not steady. There was a good deal of volatility  		from year to year. In three of the study states (Illinois, Oregon, and  		Wisconsin) growth rates peaked in the middle of the period. In the other three  		states the fastest growth in HCBS expenditures occurred at the beginning of the  		period and declined relatively steadily thereafter. </p>

</tr></table><p><b>HCBS EXPENDITURES BY FUNDING SOURCE</b>. </p>
<p>Medicaid. Medicaid is the predominant public payer for long term care  		services. The overwhelming bulk of Medicaid expenditures for long term care for  		the elderly is for institutional services provided in skilled nursing  		facilities (SNFs) and intermediate care facilities (ICFs). Medicaid also covers  		HCBS through two separate mechanisms -- the state plan and Section 2176  		waivers. The state plan must cover home health services and, at state option,  		personal care. State officials indicate that most home health expenditures  		under the state plan are related to acute care rather than long term care. It  		is not possible to disaggregate expenditures for home health vis-a-vis personal  		care, but since they are such a small proportion of total Medicaid  		expenditures, this does not affect the overall Medicaid LTC expenditure trends.  		Under the Section 2176 waiver authority, states receiving approval from the  		U.S. Department of HHS may provide a range of HCBS services. </p>
<p>Of the six states, only Oregon used both the personal care option and  		Section 2176 waivers over the past five years. Arkansas and Maryland cover  		personal care, but do not have a waiver. Illinois has a waiver, but does not  		cover personal care. Wisconsin does not offer personal care, but has recently  		implemented a Medicaid waiver. Maine added personal care in 1986 and has a  		Medicaid waiver. </p>
<p>In four of the six states Medicaid HCBS spending is a relatively small  		percentage of total Medicaid LTC expenditures. Oregon, primarily due to the  		Section 2176 waiver, spent proportionately more on Medicaid HCBS in each of the  		five years than any of the other six states. The state of Arkansas spent the  		next highest proportion of its Medicaid LTC budget on HCBS, primarily through  		the personal care service option. </p>
<p>Three of the six states -- Illinois, Maine and Maryland -- had an annual  		compound rate of growth for total Medicaid LTC spending greater than the  		national average (8.6%) from 1982-1986. Two states (Arkansas and Wisconsin) had  		Medicaid LTC spending growth rates below the national average, while Oregon  		essentially matched the national average. </p>
<p>Though these six states have increased their Medicaid dollars for HCBS,  		institutional spending continues to greatly outstrip HCBS. In all the study  		states except Oregon, institutional expenditures totaled between 90 percent to  		97 percent of Medicaid long term care in 1986. In Oregon, due primarily to the  		Section 2176 waiver, institutional expenditures totaled 75 percent of Medicaid  		long term care expenditures. </p>
<p>Growth rates in Medicaid institutional spending over the study period  		differed by state. Three states had compound rates of growth lower than the  		national average of 7.2 percent during the period.. In four of the six states  		the rate of growth slowed in the last two years. For all six states annual  		changes in rates of growth showed wide fluctuations. </p>
<p><b>Other HCBS</b>. Non-Medicaid HCBS includes all other programs  		providing HCBS to the elderly. It should be noted that these programs include  		those with federal funds other than Medicaid -- such as Social Services Block  		Grant (SSBG) and Older Americans Act (OAA) -- as well as programs funded solely  		by state general funds. These federal funds are grouped with state funded  		programs for two reasons. First, states devote a substantial amount of general  		revenue funds to supplement federal SSBG and OAA dollars. Second, these funding  		streams do not have to be used for services to the elderly (except OAA) or  		devoted to HCBS. Whether they are so used is a state decision. </p>
<p>The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) provides funding for states to  		provide social services. States are not required to match federal funds, but  		many states provide supplemental funds at their own discretion. In 1983,  		according to the American Public Welfare Association, home-based services under  		SSBG accounted for about $555 million, though no data specific to the elderly  		are available. Home-based services usually include homemaker, chore, home  		health, companion, and home maintenance.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note26">26</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The Older Americans Act provides funding to states to support a number  		of services to the elderly. States are required to provide at least 15 percent  		state matching funds to receive federal funds. National or state data are not  		available to determine spending for particular services. However, in-home  		services are a priority under OAA. In-home services usually include  		housekeeping, personal care, chore, and telephone reassurance services. </p>
<p>In four of the six states non-Medicaid HCBS expenditures constitute the  		predominant proportion (between 63 percent and 97 percent) of Total HCBS  		spending. As mentioned in the previous section, Arkansas and Oregon are the  		exceptions. </p>
<p><b>Funding LTC Reform: Medicaid HCBS v. Other HCBS</b>. States trying to  		reform their LTC systems by expanding HCBS can choose to do so through  		Medicaid, other programs, or a combination. The six states in this study are  		using a combination approach, with Oregon and Arkansas placing a greater  		emphasis on Medicaid, an emphasis that could have been expected for two  		reasons. First, Medicaid's financial participation is attractive. Four of the  		six states have federal matching rates of approximately 60 percent and above.  		This means that a state investment of $4 generates an additional $6 in federal  		funds. Second, authority for Section 2176 waivers was enacted in 1981. This  		authority made it possible for states to develop Medicaid HCBS programs  		targeted to specific eligibles for different services than were available under  		the traditional Medicaid program. Four of the six states have taken advantage  		of Section 2176 waiver authority. In three of these four states, Medicaid HCBS  		expenditures grew more than forty-five percent over the study period. </p>
<p>While Medicaid IICBS have grown rapidly, as mentioned earlier, other  		HCBS expenditures have also experienced substantial increases. In four of the  		six states, other HCBS rates of growth from 1982 to 1986 were greater than that  		of total LTC expenditures and total Medicaid LTC expenditures. </p>
<p>The combination approach prevalent in these six states indicates that  		these six states are expanding their investments in HCBS for the elderly across  		funding streams. Trends in from four of the six states suggest that the  		emphasis on long term care and home- and community based services may be  		reaching a plateau where rates of increase will slow. </p>
<p><b>SUMMARY</b>. The expenditure trend data presented here illustrate how  		these six states have funded reforms in their long term care systems. Though  		the data are not directly comparable across states and across programs, some  		general summary statements can be made. First, all six study states have  		devoted substantial proportions of their total LTC expenditures to HCBS.  		Second, increases in spending on HCBS have occurred across programs and funding  		streams. Third, while expenditures on HCBS has increased greatly, long term  		care remains heavily dominated by institutional expenditures in all but one of  		the study states. Fourth, the growth in HCBS was marked by wide fluctuations  		from year to year. Even though these six states were selected for the study  		because of their early development of comprehensive statewide community based  		services programs, long term care spending in the six study states paralleled  		national trends. </p>

<p>Although the details of Medicaid eligibility policy are complex, three  		components of Medicaid eligibility policy have the greatest potential impact on  		providing elderly persons with Medicaid-funded home and community based  		services in the six case study states. These are: </p>
<ol><li>Group coverage options;
<ul><li>Treatment of SSI cash recipients for Medicaid</li>
<li>Coverage of the medically needy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Benefit levels; and
<ul><li>State Supplementation Program (SSP) benefit levels</li>
<li>Medically needy income levels</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Eligibility Provisions unique to Section 2176 waiver programs </li>
</ol><h3>Group Coverage Options</h3>
<p>Two important eligibility decisions which states make in extending  		Medicaid coverage to its elderly citizens are: 1) how the state elects to cover  		persons receiving SSI cash assistance; and 2) whether the state elects to cover  		the medically needy. States have three options regarding how they cover SSI  		recipients. First, states can elect to automatically cover all SSI cash  		recipients without requiring them to make a separate application for Medicaid.  		These states are commonly referred to as "1634 States," since this option  		relates to Section 1634 of the Social Security Act. Most states (30) have  		elected this option and four of the six case study states (Arkansas, Maine,  		Maryland and Wisconsin) are 1634 States, as shown in <a href="strfrm.htm#tableAII-1">Table AII-1</a>. </p>

Data are for 1985. The ratio of Medicaid cash recipients to SSI  			 recipients exceeds 1.0 in some States because the former includes all aged  			 persons who received Medicaid during 1985, while the latter includes only the  			 number of elderly persons who received an SSI cash payment in the month of  			 December 1985.</font></td>
</tr></table><p>Second, states can extend Medicaid eligibility to all SSI cash  		recipients, but require them to make a separate application for Medicaid  		eligibility. Nationwide, six states have elected this option, one of which is  		Oregon. States generally choose this option in order to retain total control  		over the Medicaid eligibility determination process, rather than relinquishing  		this role to the Social Security Administration. From the applicant's  		perspective, however, this option serves as an administrative barrier to  		Medicaid enrollment, since it requires an applicant to go through both the SSI  		eligibility process with the Social Security Administration and the Medicaid  		eligibility process with the state. </p>
<p>Third, states can elect the Section 209(b) option, and impose more  		restrictive eligibility criteria for Medicaid than are used in determining  		eligibility for SSI, so long as the criteria applied were part of the state's  		Medicaid plan in January 1972, prior to enactment of the federal SSI program.  		209(b) states may be more restrictive in their definition of blindness or  		disability, and/or more restrictive than SSI in their financial requirements  		for Medicaid. It is generally regarded as the most conservative SSI option.  		Fourteen states currently elect the 209(b) option, one of which is the state of  		Illinois. </p>
<p><a href="strfrm.htm#tableAII-1">Table AII-1</a> shows which option each of the six  		study states has elected, and how these options affect Medicaid enrollment of  		aged beneficiaries. This was done by calculating the ratio of aged Medicaid  		recipients receiving SSI cash assistance to the number of aged SSI recipients  		in the state in 1985. The data clearly show that Oregon and Illinois, which  		have elected the more restrictive options, have lower coverage of their SSI  		populations than the four "1634" states. Illinois' election of the Section  		209(b) option particularly appears to have had a substantial impact on limiting  		Medicaid enrollment of aged SSI beneficiaries. </p>
<p>Of all Medicaid eligibility options, a state's decision of whether or  		not to cover the "medically needy" probably has the greatest impact. In  		electing a medically needy program, states can extend eligibility to persons  		who are not eligible for SSI/SSP due to excess income or assets, but who have  		large medical expenses. Under the medically needy option, applicants may "spend  		down" to Medicaid eligibility levels by deducting their medical expenses from  		their countable income. After an applicant has met the spend-down requirement  		(i.e. the difference between the applicant's countable income and the medically  		needy income level), he/she becomes eligible for Medicaid for the remainder of  		his/her medical expenses. In effect, aged persons of all income levels are  		potentially eligible for Medicaid in states that have medically needy programs,  		if their medical bills are large enough. </p>
<p>All of the six study states have medically needy programs. However,  		Oregon's medically needy program for the aged, blind and disabled only became  		effective in 1986. Prior to 1986, the only way in which an elderly person  		outside of a nursing home could become eligible for Medicaid in Oregon was to  		be eligible for SSI cash assistance and/or a state supplementation payment, or  		fall under 300% of the SSI standard for institutional and waiver clients. </p>
<h3>Benefit Levels</h3>
<p>Benefit levels are also extremely important in determining the extent of  		Medicaid coverage for the elderly. The higher the benefit level, the more  		elderly persons who are potentially eligible for Medicaid. The first benefit  		level of importance is whether or not a state chooses to supplement the federal  		SSI benefit, since persons who receive state supplementation payments are  		generally eligible for Medicaid as well. Of course, the level at which a state  		chooses to supplement the SSI benefit level is also important. </p>
<p>Another benefit level of importance is the medically needy income level.  		As previously discussed, this is the income level which medically needy  		applicants must "spend down" to before they are eligible for Medicaid. The  		medically needy level, ironically, is not tied to the SSI/SSP level, but to  		benefit levels established for the AFDC program. States may elect to set their  		medically needy income levels anywhere between the AFDC benefit level and 133  		1/3% of that level. </p>
<p><a href="strfrm.htm#tableAII-2">Table AII-2</a> shows SSI/SSP levels and medically  		needy income levels in the six study states for a single aged person living  		independently. Two states, Arkansas and Maryland, provide no state supplements  		for aged persons living alone, although Maryland does provide supplementation  		payments to certain persons living in specially licensed board-and-care homes.  		Oregon only provides a very small state supplementation payment of $1.70 per  		month. Illinois' State Supplementation Program is unique among states in that  		it is the only state which determines the SSP benefit level on a case-by-case  		basis. Functional status is one of the factors used in determining the benefit  		level, so that Illinois' SSP program is one which is specifically oriented  		towards persons with long term care needs. Wisconsin's SSP level is by far the  		most generous of the six states, increasing the federal SSI benefit level by  		31%. </p>
<p>Medically needy levels also vary considerably across the six states,  		depending upon where each state has set its benefit levels for the AFDC  		program. In three of the states, medically needy levels and the SSI/SSP levels  		are the same or almost the same, but in two states -- Arkansas and Illinois --  		the medically needy levels are below the SSI/SSP levels (we know it is below  		the SSI/SSP level in Illinois because even though the state supplementation  		benefit varies from case to case, it cannot be below the federal SSI level of  		$336). This means that persons who do not qualify for SSI/SSP due to excess  		income must nevertheless spend down to an income level below the SSI/SSP level  		in order to become eligible for Medicaid. This phenomenon is referred to as  		"negative bands," and relates to the differences between benefit levels for the  		AFDC program and for the SSI/SSP program.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note27">27</a></font></sup> It is an inequity which has always existed  		in the Medicaid program, but one which has grown in magnitude as the difference  		between AFDC and SSI/SSP benefit levels has increased in many states. </p>

</tr></table><p>Another option which states have under their medically needy programs is  		to establish higher resource limits for medically needy applicants than are  		used in the SSI program. It is another strange twist of Medicaid eligibility  		policy that income levels for the medically needy can be below SSI/SSP levels,  		while the resource limits can be higher. However, of the six states, only  		Maryland has set higher resource limits for the medically needy ($2,500 for an  		individual), while the remaining five states use the SSI limits ($1,600). </p>
<h3>Impact of Medicaid Eligibility Options on Coverage of  		the Elderly</h3>
<p>What impact do these state eligibility options regarding group coverage  		and benefit levels have on the degree to which Medicaid covers the elderly poor  		in the six study states? Simply calculating the percentage of all elderly  		persons in a particular state who are eligible for Medicaid is a misleading  		statistic, because Medicaid enrollment is related to overall poverty trends as  		well as to the expansiveness or restrictiveness of Medicaid eligibility  		options. An alternative is to measure the ratio of elderly Medicaid recipients  		to the number of elderly persons living below the poverty line in a particular  		state. However, this statistic is also misleading because poverty data for the  		elderly do not include persons in nursing homes or other group quarters.  		Therefore, a better measure of Medicaid's coverage of the elderly is to  		calculate the ratio of non-institutionalized elderly on Medicaid to the number  		of elderly persons in poverty. </p>
<p>These data are presented in <a href="strfrm.htm#tableAII-3">Table AII-3</a> and  		<a href="strfrm.htm#figureAII-1">Figure AII-1</a>. <a href="strfrm.htm#tableAII-3">Table AII-3</a>  		shows the percentage of all elderly persons in each state who received medical  		assistance from Medicaid in 1985; the percentage of all elderly persons living  		in poverty in each state; and the ratio of non-institutionalized elderly on  		Medicaid to the number of elderly poor. <a href="strfrm.htm#figureAII-1">Figure AII-1</a>  		illustrates this last statistic in a bar graph. The table shows the wide  		variation in poverty rates across the six states -- the poverty rate among  		elderly persons in Arkansas (28.2%) was about three times the poverty rate in  		Illinois (9.9%) and Wisconsin (9.4%). Thus, a much higher proportion of elderly  		in Arkansas are potentially eligible for Medicaid. </p>
<p>Regarding Medicaid's coverage of the non-institutionalized elderly poor,  		the six states fall into three groups. Wisconsin and Maine provide the broadest  		coverage, covering between 56-57 percent of the elderly poor who are not  		institutionalized. Arkansas and Maryland fall into the middle group, covering  		between 45 percent and 47 percent. The states with the most restrictive  		eligibility provisions are Oregon and Illinois, which cover only 27-32 percent  		of the non-institutionalized elderly poor. </p>
<p>It is clear that Medicaid eligibility decisions are major factors in the  		variation in coverage across the six states. Wisconsin, with the most liberal  		eligibility policies, has the broadest coverage. Of the six states, it has the  		highest state supplementation level, the highest medically needy level, and it  		is a 1634 state. Data show that Wisconsin's SSP program increases the number of  		SSI/SSP recipients by 58% over the number who would be eligible if the state  		provided no supplement to federal SSI benefits. </p>
<p>Maine's SSP program also plays an important role in broadening Medicaid  		coverage of the elderly. Although its supplementation level for aged  		individuals living alone is by no means generous ($10 per month), Maine has a  		much broader supplementation program for elderly persons in licensed  		board-and-care facilities. Some elderly persons receive state supplements of up  		to $234 per month in these facilities. Overall, Maine's SSP program increases  		its pool of Medicaid eligibles by 33 percent over those who would be eligible  		if the state provided no state supplements to SSI. </p>

</tr></table><p>It is clear that Oregon's and Illinois' decision to not be 1634 states  		has limited their coverage of their elderly populations under Medicaid.  		Illinois' election of the Section 209(b) option is more restrictive than  		Oregon's decision to require SSI recipients to undergo a separate application  		process for Medicaid. On the other hand, Illinois has a more extensive State  		Supplementation Program than Oregon, and prior to 1986, Oregon had no medically  		needy program. Thus, prior to 1986, about the only way an elderly person not in  		a nursing home could get on Medicaid in Oregon was to be an SSI recipient. Even  		then it was necessary to go through a separate application process in order to  		get a Medicaid card.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note28">28</a></font></sup></p>
<p>It is noteworthy that in all six states, there are many elderly persons  		living in poverty who are not Medicaid eligible. Even Wisconsin, which had the  		broadest coverage, still covered only 57 percent of the non-institutionalized  		elderly poor, according to these measures. There are a number of reasons for  		this apparent low coverage. First, excluding aged Medicaid recipients who are  		nursing home recipients biases these statistics somewhat, since many nursing  		home recipients are institutionalized for only part of the year, and are  		non-institutionalized for the rest of the year.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note29">29</a></font></sup> Second, the data presented include only aged  		persons who <i>receive</i> services reimbursed by Medicaid; they do not include  		persons who were enrolled in Medicaid but received no services.<sup><font><a href="strfrm.htm#note30">30</a></font></sup> Data on the proportion of  		Medicaid recipients relative to the number of elderly poor therefore  		underestimate Medicaid's coverage of the elderly somewhat. Third, poverty data  		are based solely on income, not assets. However, SSI and Medicaid applicants  		must not only meet income requirements, but fairly restrictive asset  		requirements (in most cases, Medicaid recipients could have no more than $1,600  		in liquid assets in 1985). Thus, while many elderly poor persons may qualify  		for SSI or Medicaid on the basis of income, they may be excluded on the basis  		of excess resources. </p>
<h3>Eligibility Provisions Unique to Section 2176 Waiver  		Programs</h3>
<p>All states which had medically needy programs extended eligibility for  		waiver services to the medically needy as well. However, Oregon had also  		elected the option of extending eligibility to persons with incomes up to 300%  		of the federal SSI benefit level. Under this option, elderly persons who are  		otherwise eligible for waiver services may "buy in" to the waiver, by paying  		the difference between their monthly income and the SSI/SSP level.  		Approximately half of Oregon's caseload of 6,000 waiver recipients are not  		SSI/SSP recipients, but persons who have chosen to "buy into" eligibility for  		waiver services under this option. </p>
<p>Two states -- Maine and Wisconsin -- had received a waiver of Medicaid  		deeming rules. This waiver permits these states to only count the income and  		assets of the applicant in determining Medicaid eligibility for waiver  		services, without taking into account the income and assets of the applicant's  		spouse. Thus, some persons in these states are eligible for waiver services who  		would otherwise not be eligible for Medicaid outside a nursing home. </p>

<p>This report assesses whether and how the insurance industry could  		benefit from the extensive state experience in developing and implementing  		home-based long term care. The report summarizes a day-long symposium of  		insurance industry, state and research community experts on this topic and  		includes a case study of a Washington State initiative, under which Blue Cross  		has contracted with that state's network of local case management agencies to  		perform client assessment care planning and coordination. </p>

<p>Based on a detailed survey of 50 states' Medicaid programs, this report  		discusses the basic eligibility criteria elderly people must meet to obtain  		Medicaid coverage of nursing home care or community based care. The book  		outlines the basic eligibility factors for the general reader, includes a  		detailed appendix for the technically oriented reader, and displays state  		program standards and requirements in 30 tables. </p>
