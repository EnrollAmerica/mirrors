<h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>Women who have left TANF in three cities--Boston, Chicago, and San  		Antonio--have an average employment rate of 63 percent after leaving, a rate  		similar to figures found in studies of welfare leavers in many other states.  		But this average obscures a large amount of variation across different groups  		of women, some of whom have done much better than this and some of whom have  		done much worse. Women with lower levels of education, worse levels of health  		status, with younger children, and who are themselves young have considerably  		lower employment rates and post-welfare income levels than women with greater  		levels of education, better health status, with older children, and who are  		older. Outcomes also differ among those leavers with a history of greater  		welfare dependence, a group not examined in other studies. The employment and,  		especially, income outcomes among these leavers are considerably worse than the  		average. These large differences in outcomes for different former welfare  		recipients should be examined by policy-makers when they consider reforms to  		assist those who have difficulty attaining self-sufficiency off the welfare  		rolls. </p>
<p>The historically unprecedented wave of welfare reforms sweeping the  		country in the early 1990s, embodied in the 1996 Personal Responsibility and  		Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), has brought the most drastic and  		deep-seated reforms in the welfare system for single mothers since the  		inception of the AFDC program in 1935. An equally unprecedented decline in the  		welfare rolls has accompanied this wave of reform. Nationwide the recipient  		caseload of the AFDC-TANF program dropped by almost 50 percent from 1994 to  		1999. This caseload decline has been the result not only of the strong economy  		and low unemployment rate, but also of policy developments that expanded the  		benefits of the Earned Income Tax Credit and other programs for nonwelfare  		recipients. Welfare reform has unquestionably played a major role in the  		caseload decline as well.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The women and children who have left welfare over this period have been  		a major focus of public policy attention. The most important issue is whether  		they have been able to find employment at acceptable rates, as well as high  		enough incomes, to attain self-sufficiency after leaving the rolls. A large  		number of states have conducted studies of these welfare leavers and have  		found, overall, that employment rates after leaving the rolls are in the range  		of 50 percent to 70 percent.<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> Earnings of these welfare leavers have, on  		average, been lower than the welfare benefits they had been receiving while on  		welfare; however, less is known about total household income after leaving  		welfare because few studies have a complete inventory of other sources of  		income. </p>
<p>This policy brief goes behind these figures to chart the experiences of  		women who have done better or worse than the averages. It is to be expected  		that some women, such as those with more labor market experience and superior  		job skills, will do better than average and that women with less experience and  		fewer skills will do worse. But the magnitude of those differences,  		particularly for those of the more disadvantaged groups, is an important  		question for policy-makers that has not been adequately addressed in  		discussions thus far. We present information on three types of diversity among  		welfare leavers: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Differences in education, health, and other characteristics.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differences in whether or not an individual had been sanctioned  			 before she left the rolls. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differences in welfare dependency: the amount of time an  			 individual had spent on welfare before leaving and the amount of time spent off  			 welfare after leaving. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>All three are important sources of variation among welfare leavers that  		have been ignored in many previous studies. An examination of the diversity of  		the experiences of welfare leavers is thus the subject of this brief. </p>
<p>Our findings are based on the experiences of leavers in Boston, Chicago,  		and San Antonio, three large cities in the U.S. with differing populations and  		located in states with a range of welfare policies. The Three City Study (see  		description on back panel) is a longitudinal survey of approximately 2,500  		low-income families with children who are living in low- and moderate-income  		neighborhoods in these three cities. The first wave of the survey data took  		place between March and December 1999 and is used for this brief. The survey  		includes information on welfare and nonwelfare families, but for the purposes  		of this brief we examine data only for those women who were on the rolls  		sometime in the two years immediately prior to the interview (approximately  		1997 to 1999) and who left the rolls sometime in that period. The survey  		collected a wide range of information on employment, income, family structure,  		and characteristics of the caregiver (usually the mother) of the children in  		the family. Given that this range of information is considerably broader than  		the data sources that have been used for most other welfare leaver studies, we  		are able to document more fully how leavers have been doing. </p>
<p>The economy has improved and the welfare rolls have plummeted in all  		three states in which our cities are located, as they have  		nationally.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup> The rates  		of decline of the unemployment rate and the TANF rolls have been roughly  		similar across the three cities, and the magnitudes have been approximately  		those of the nation as a whole. Our three areas can, therefore, be regarded as  		not very different from the rest of the country in these broad dimensions. The  		populations of the three cities are somewhat different from one another, with a  		greater number of Puerto Rican Hispanics in Boston and a greater number of  		Mexican-American families in Chicago and San Antonio. Since relatively few  		low-income white families live in inner city neighborhoods in Chicago and San  		Antonio, we draw most of our families of that group from Boston. Our sample  		includes African-American families from all three cities. </p>
<p>The TANF policies in the three cities also differ (see <a href="#state">below</a>). Massachusetts has one of the shortest time limits in  		the country (two years out of every five) but, at the same time, exempts a  		large number of those families from the time limits and also has not, at this  		writing, imposed a lifetime limit. Massachusetts also has a fairly strict  		sanction policy and a family cap. Texas is a relatively low-benefit state  		compared to the nation as a whole and has one-, two-, and three-year time  		limits (four including a one-year waiting period), though the state does give  		longer limits for those with greater employment difficulties and allows the  		clock not to start ticking until the recipient has been called by  		the employment agency and offered a slot. Earnings disregards are the least  		generous of those in our three states; it is a Work First state, and it has an  		official diversion policy. Illinois is a medium benefit state that has  		maintained the federal maximum of five years of benefits but allows families to  		stop the clock indefinitely by working 30 or more hours per week. Work  		requirements are not imposed as quickly in Illinois as in the other states, and  		the state has no official diversion policy.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="average" id="average">AVERAGE OUTCOMES FOR LEAVERS</a></h2>
<p>We first report what our data say about the average outcomes of welfare  		leavers, in order to establish whether our data are showing the same results as  		past studies have shown. We go on to report our findings on averages for  		outcomes that are not often measured. After establishing that our data are  		consistent with those of past studies, we turn to a discussion of our findings  		on diversity around those averages. </p>
<p>Our survey has 1,262 women who report that they were on TANF at some  		point in the two years prior to interview (that is, from 1997 to 1999), of whom  		329 were not on TANF at the time they were interviewed or the month before. We  		define these 329 women as conventional leavers because this is  		similar to the way past studies have generally defined what it means to leave  		welfare--to have been on welfare at some point in the past and to be off  		welfare at the interview date.<sup><font><a href="#note5">5</a></font></sup> The conventional leaving rate for our families  		is 28 percent--the percent of families on the rolls in the two-year period who  		have left by this definition.<sup><font><a href="#note6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Our leavers were asked why they left welfare. The vast majority (65  		percent) said that they left because of a job or because of high earnings.  		Another 14 percent said that they left because they were sanctioned, and  		another 6 percent said that they had reached a time limit of some kind. The  		remainder cited a variety of reasons for leaving--because of the availability  		of child support income, someone else in the household obtained a job, and  		other reasons. </p>
<p>At the interview, we asked leavers about their current labor market  		outcomes. We find that: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Sixty-three percent of women are employed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual earnings are $511 per month, including the nonemployed,  			 and $910 for those employed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hourly wage rates are typically $7.50.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of those who work, 60 percent work full-time rather than part-time.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thirty-six percent of the jobs had health insurance. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>These figures are squarely in line with those reported in past studies,  		and thus our data are showing the same, relatively favorable, average outcomes  		for welfare leavers as have been found in the past.<sup><font><a href="#note7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The first column of <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> shows the poverty rate  		and incomes of these conventionally defined leavers in the month prior to the  		interview. Both the level of overall household income and its composition  		reveal important new results: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Total household income is $1,031 per month, or about $12,400  			 annually. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost three-quarters (74 percent) of leavers are in  			 poverty.<sup><font><a href="#note8">8</a></font></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The earnings of the leaver herself are only one-half of total  			 household income. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earnings and welfare income of others in the household constitute  			 one-third of household income. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The contributions of others in the household are critical, for poverty  		rates would be much higher if the women leaving welfare had to rely on their  		own earnings alone.<sup><font><a href="#note9">9</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Households with welfare leavers rely heavily on other government aid.  		Almost 70 percent of households receive Medicaid and about the same percent  		live in subsidized housing. Nearly 40 percent receive Food Stamps, 31 percent  		receive WIC benefits, but only about 12 percent or less receive energy  		assistance, emergency food assistance, SSI, or clothing and other private  		charity goods. </p>
<h2><a name="one" id="one">DIVERSITY, TYPE ONE: DIFFERENCES BY EDUCATION, HEALTH,  		AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS</a></h2>
<p>Leavers differ along a wide number of socioeconomic characteristics that  		are associated with labor market opportunity, ability to work, and barriers to  		finding work. Among the many possible dimensions, we consider four that are  		well-known to be associated with the employment rates of adult women: the level  		of education, health status, age, and presence of young children in the  		household. </p>
<p><a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> shows differences in  		percent-time-employed for leavers of different types, calculated as the percent  		of the months off welfare in the year prior to interview that the leaver was  		employed.<sup><font><a href="#note10">10</a></font></sup> Large  		differences are apparent for leavers with different levels of education and  		health: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Leavers without a high school diploma or a GED were employed 61  			 percent of the time compared to 78 percent for those with a diploma or GED.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leavers in fair or poor health were employed 60 percent of the time  			 compared to 83 percent for those in excellent or very good health. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The percent-time-employed varied less by age of the mother (66 percent  		for those 25 and under, 71 percent for those aged 26-35) and by the presence of  		young children (70 percent for those with children 0-3, 74 percent for those  		without children 0-3). </p>
<p>A better indicator of how many leavers are not successful in the labor  		market at all is the fraction of leavers who have never been employed the  		entire time they have been off TANF. In the year prior to the interview, as  		shown in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>, 28 percent of less-educated leavers  		were never employed compared to only 13 percent of more-educated leavers. A  		high 31 percent of leavers who were in fair or poor health were never employed  		after leaving, compared to only 6 percent of those in excellent or very good  		health. Younger women and women in households with young children also are more  		likely not to have worked than older women and those in households without  		young children, although the differences are not as large in magnitude. </p>
<p>Income differences between leavers of different types are large, as  		shown in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>. Among the important differences are:  		</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Leavers without a high school degree or GED have poverty rates of 91  			 percent, compared to 64 percent for those with a high school degree or GED, and  			 leavers who are young have poverty rates of 83 percent compared to 68 percent  			 for older women. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earnings of less-educated leavers are only about one-half those of  			 more educated leavers, and earnings of leavers in poor or fair health are  			 likewise only about 50 percent of those of leavers in excellent or very good  			 health. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The figures in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> confirm what was found  		earlier about the relatively small differences in labor market outcomes of  		leavers who are young rather than old, or who have young children in the  		household. However, there are marked differences in the earnings of others in  		these households, which are higher for those leavers with lower earnings, and  		by other types of welfare income, which tend to be lower for those leavers who  		have lower earnings. Family sizes differ as well, a factor that is responsible  		for the relatively large differences in poverty rates for the different types  		of families. </p>
<p>Compensation for lower earnings of less-educated leavers comes from  		higher government aid received by both themselves and other members of the  		household, rather than from earnings of other household members, which are also  		lower in households with less-educated leavers than in households with  		more-educated leavers. Earnings of others in the household matter more for the  		other groups, however. For example, leavers in fair or poor health, leavers who  		are themselves young, and leavers in households with young children all live in  		households where other members bring in significantly more earned income than  		in households containing leavers in better health, who are older, and who do  		not have young children.<sup><font><a href="#note11">11</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="two" id="two">DIVERSITY, TYPE TWO: SANCTIONED LEAVERS</a></h2>
<p>Another important subgroup of leavers includes those women who were  		sanctioned when on welfare, either in part or in full. Past leaver studies have  		indicated that employment rates for sanctioned leavers are lower than for other  		leavers, but no one has painted a more general picture.<sup><font><a href="#note12">12</a></font></sup></p>
<p>As noted previously, 14 percent of leavers in our three cities reported  		leaving welfare because they were sanctioned.<sup><font><a href="#note13">13</a></font></sup> Another 6 percent of leavers reported that  		they had been sanctioned when previously receiving welfare even though they did  		not cite it as the reason they left the rolls. Leavers who report having been  		sanctioned while on TANF have very different employment and income experiences  		after leaving welfare than those who were not sanctioned: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Previously sanctioned leavers were employed 57 percent of the time  			 they were off welfare in the 12 months prior to interview (regardless of the  			 reason they left welfare), compared to 76 percent for those not previously  			 sanctioned; 34 percent of the former group were never employed, compared to 14  			 percent of the latter group. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only 47 percent of leavers previously sanctioned were employed at  			 the interview date, compared to 68 percent of those not previously sanctioned.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eighty-nine percent of previously sanctioned leavers were poor after  			 leaving welfare, compared to 71 percent of leavers not previously sanctioned.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monthly earnings of leavers previously sanctioned were $327,  			 compared to $558 for those not previously sanctioned. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>This evidence provides strong confirmation that women who are sanctioned  		while on welfare are a more disadvantaged group than those who are not  		sanctioned, and that sanctioned women, compared to women not sanctioned, have a  		more difficult time both in the labor market and in raising their household  		incomes above poverty after leaving TANF. </p>
<h2><a name="three" id="three">DIVERSITY, TYPE THREE: DEPENDENCY LEAVERS</a></h2>
<p>The third type of diversity we examine is motivated by recent scholarly  		research on patterns of welfare receipt indicating that turnover rates on  		welfare are quite high--many women go on and off welfare fairly frequently.  		Some research has divided welfare recipients into three types: long-termers,  		who spend uninterrupted periods of time on welfare and rarely go off;  		short-termers, who only occasionally rely on welfare; and cyclers, who go on  		and off frequently and cannot develop a sustaining income off  		welfare.<sup><font><a href="#note14">14</a></font></sup> The third  		group, cyclers, may end up spending a great deal of time on welfare even though  		they are not on for long periods at any given time; they may therefore end up  		being dependent on welfare if dependency is defined as receiving  		welfare benefits for a large fraction of time, even if only in small  		increments.<sup><font><a href="#note15">15</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The implications of this research for the study of welfare leavers are  		two. First, frequent movements on and off the rolls make it difficult to  		determine when a woman actually leaves welfare. Past studies have  		included in the leaver category women who have left welfare but have come back  		on and gone off again. Moreover, women who have been off welfare for only a  		short period of time (e.g., two or three months) may not have truly freed  		themselves from welfare dependence for, given the high rates of return to  		welfare, they may be back on the rolls soon. Many of these leavers  		may only be cyclers. Second, many of the women who have left welfare may not  		have been on welfare for very long to begin with; most studies of welfare  		leavers do not restrict their samples to women who are long-term welfare  		recipients but rather include women who are on the rolls at any time.  		Consequently, many welfare leavers may actually be short-termers who were never  		heavily dependent on welfare. </p>
<p>These two issues are illustrated in <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>,  		which shows how many of the conventional leavers have really left  		welfare in the sense of having demonstrated independence from the welfare  		system, as well as showing how many were relatively dependent in the first  		place. <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a> shows that only 30 percent had been off  		TANF for the full 12 months prior to the interview. Moreover, about one-quarter  		(28 percent, the sum of 16 percent and 12 percent) were on TANF for seven or  		more months out of the last 12. Thus a substantial fraction of these  		leavers have not become independent of TANF in anything more than a  		very short-term sense. In addition, many of these leavers were not heavily  		dependent on welfare in the year prior to that (i.e., 13 to 24 months prior to  		the interview date), for a high one-quarter (28 percent) were on TANF for six  		months or less over that period (see <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>).  		Consequently, a substantial fraction of leavers according to the conventional  		definition are short-term recipients who were not heavily dependent on welfare  		prior to leaving. </p>
<h2><a name="new" id="new">A NEW DEFINITION OF LEAVERS</a></h2>
<p>To address these issues directly, we define a new type of leaver we call  		dependency leavers, who are women who have become significantly  		less dependent on welfare over time. We implement this definition with our data  		by terming a woman dependent on welfare if she receives benefits  		for more than six months in a year. Dependency leavers are then  		defined to be those women who were not dependent on TANF in the 12 months prior  		to the interview (i.e., who were on TANF for six months or less in that year)  		but who were dependent on welfare in the 12 months prior to that (i.e., who  		received TANF for more than six months in that year). By this definition, only  		one-half (48 percent) of conventional leavers are dependency leavers--that is,  		only one-half of leavers as usually defined actually moved from  		welfare dependency to relative independence from welfare.<sup><font><a href="#note16">16</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The leaving rate for dependency leavers--the fraction of those who were  		dependent on TANF but moved to relative independence--is 19 percent,  		considerably below the 28 percent leaving rate for conventional leavers. That  		fewer welfare dependent women have left TANF is not surprising, but the nearly  		10-percentage-point difference is large and serves to emphasize the importance  		of not mistaking the average experience for the experiences of all welfare  		recipients. </p>
<p>In comparison to conventional leavers, dependency leavers have slightly  		worse labor market outcomes. In the 12 months prior to the interview: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>Dependency leavers were employed for 66 percent of months off TANF,  			 whereas conventional leavers were employed 72 percent of those months.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About 24 percent of dependency leavers were never employed while off  			 TANF, compared to 18 percent of conventional leavers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About 48 percent of dependency leavers were employed the entire time  			 they were off TANF, compared to 56 percent of conventional leavers. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The hourly wage rates, percentage of people working full time rather  		than part time, and health insurance coverage of dependency leavers do not  		differ a great deal from those of conventional leavers (these are not shown in  		the tables or figures). Therefore, the primary labor market difference between  		conventional and dependency leavers is in the likelihood of being employed in  		the first place, which itself is modest in size, more than in the types of jobs  		obtained. </p>
<p>The income levels and sources of income differ much more, as shown in  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. Dependency leavers: </p>
<ul><li>Have monthly earnings that are almost 18 percent lower than  		  conventional leavers; </li>
<li>Are more heavily dependent on government aid from other welfare  		  programs; </li>
<li>Receive 23 percent less support from earnings of other members of the  		  household than conventional leavers, although this is partly offset by higher  		  welfare income of those members. </li>
</ul><p>With their lower earnings, dependency leavers receive more government  		aid from other programs. But the lower earnings support they receive from other  		members of the household is a sign that dependency leavers come from households  		with less earning power in general than the households of conventional leavers.  		</p>
<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
<p>In summary, in this brief we have gone beyond the experiences of the  		average welfare leaver to examine the diversity of outcomes of different types  		of leavers. We highlight four findings. </p>
<ul><li>
<p>We find generally large differences in employment, household  			 incomes, and poverty rates for leavers with differing social and economic  			 characteristics. Those with greater levels of education, in good health,  			 without young children, and who are not young themselves have done better than  			 average. However, those with less education, in poor health, with young  			 children, and who are young themselves have done worse than average, often  			 significantly so. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We find that the earnings of leavers are only one-half of total  			 household incomes on average. Moreover, there is significant variation across  			 households in support from sources other than leaver earnings, particularly  			 from other family members. Some leavers are in households where there is  			 significant income support from other members of the household, either from  			 earnings or welfare income of those members. Other leavers are in households  			 with very little of this type of support. Unfortunately, those leavers who  			 themselves have the most difficulty in the labor market often live in  			 households where there is relatively little other support as well. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We find that women who have been previously sanctioned have much  			 worse employment and income experiences after leaving welfare than those  			 leavers who have not been sanctioned. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we restrict our analysis to women who were heavily dependent on  			 welfare prior to leaving (the group whom policy-makers most intended welfare  			 reform to affect) and who have become relatively independent of welfare after  			 leaving, we find some of their outcomes differ from those of conventional  			 leavers. Nearly as many of these dependency leavers are employed as  			 are conventional leavers, but the dependency leavers earn less, receive less  			 earnings support from other household members, and depend more on government  			 benefits. In addition, women who were heavily dependent on welfare are  			 substantially less likely to leave welfare to begin with than are other welfare  			 recipients. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>The existence of significant numbers of women who have not done well  		after leaving welfare is a source of concern, especially in light of the strong  		economy, which makes the outcomes of these families probably the best they can  		be. These leavers deserve the attention of policy-makers who in the future will  		be considering modifications in welfare programs or who will be designing  		special programs to assist those off the rolls who are in greatest need. </p>

<h2><a name="state" id="state">STATE WELFARE POLICIES</a></h2>
<p><b><i>Boston</i></b>: Massachusetts is operating under its HHS waiver,  		which is approved through September 2005. Under its waiver plan, it has a time  		limit of two out of every five years, but relatively generous exemptions from  		those limits and fairly high cash benefits and income eligibility limits  		compared to the other two states. Massachusetts has no formal diversion policy  		but does have a family cap and provisions for both full and partial family  		sanctions. </p>
<p><b><i>Chicago</i></b>: Illinois is operating under an approved PRWORA  		plan with an official five-year lifetime time limit but pays benefits out of  		state funds for all months in which recipients work or go to school for more  		than 30 hours per week, effectively stopping the clock. The state has cash  		benefit levels and income eligibility limits between those of Massachusetts and  		Texas but has the most generous earnings disregards of the three. Its sanction  		policy is less strict than that of Massachusetts, and it does not have a  		diversion policy. Illinois has the longest time period before work requirements  		are imposed (24 months). </p>
<p><b><i>San Antonio</i></b>: Texas is also operating under HHS waiver  		authority. Texas has one-, two-, or three-year time limits (four including a  		one-year waiting period) assigned on the basis of employability, but it had no  		lifetime limit as of the time of our interviews (since then Texas has imposed  		the federal guideline of a five-year lifetime limit). The one-, two-, and  		three-year time limits do not begin until the recipient is offered an opening  		in the state employment program. The state has fairly low cash benefit levels  		and income eligibility limits as well as the least generous earnings disregards  		of our three states. Texas has less strict sanctions than the other two states  		and does not have a provision for a full family sanction, nor does it have a  		family cap. Unlike Illinois or Massachusetts, Texas has a diversion policy  		involving onetime payment and mandatory job search. </p>
<p><b><i>Welfare, Children, and Families: A Three City Study</i></b> is an  		ongoing research project in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio to evaluate the  		consequences of welfare reform for the well-being of children and families and  		to follow these families as welfare reform evolves. The study comprises three  		interrelated components: (1) a longitudinal in-person survey of approximately  		2,500 families with children in low-income neighborhoods, about 40 percent of  		whom were receiving cash welfare payments when they were interviewed in 1999.  		Seventy-seven percent of the families have incomes below the poverty line.  		Seventy-three percent are headed by single mothers, and 23 percent are headed  		by two parents. They should be thought of as a random sample in each city of  		poor and near-poor families who live in low-income neighborhoods.<sup><font><a href="#note17">17</a></font></sup> Extensive baseline information  		was obtained on one child per household and his or her caregiver (usually the  		mother). The caregivers and children will be reinterviewed at 18-month  		intervals. In addition, at the 36-month mark, a second sample of about 1,250  		families, focused primarily on young parents who are just coming of age and  		encountering the welfare system for the first time under the new rules, will be  		selected and interviewed. (2) an embedded developmental study of a subset of  		about 630 children age 2 to 4 in 1999 and their caregivers, consisting of  		videotaped assessments of childrens behaviors and caregiver-child  		interactions, observations of child-care settings, and interviews with fathers.  		(3) an ethnographic study of about 215 families residing in the same  		neighborhoods as the survey families who will be followed for 12 to 18 months,  		and periodically thereafter, using in-depth interviewing and participant  		observation. About 45 of the families in the ethnography include a child with a  		physical or mental disability. A detailed description of the research design  		can be found in <i>Welfare, Children, and Families: A Three City Study.

<li>
<p><a name="note4" id="note4">A</a> diversion policy is a policy that gives new  			 applicants a onetime payment or that requires a period of job search prior to  			 receiving benefits, and hence seeks to "divert" families from coming onto  			 welfare. Sanctions are penalties imposed by the welfare department for  			 violation of rules, particularly failure to search or find work, but also  			 failure to cooperate with paternity establishment or to comply with other  			 rules. Earnings disregards are provisions that allow recipients to work and  			 earn money without having their benefits heavily reduced because of the higher  			 income that comes from the earnings. A Work First state is a state that  			 requires new welfare recipients to begin work or some type of job search  			 activity immediately upon acceptance onto the welfare rolls, without a delay of  			 a few months or of two years, as required by federal legislation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note5" id="note5">Many</a> past studies have used welfare  			 administrative data rather than interview data so there has not been an  			 "interview date" to examine. These define leavers as those who have gone off  			 welfare at least once at some point, even if they are back on welfare at a  			 later date. Our interpretation of the conventional definition is close to that  			 used in an Urban Institute leaver study, which had two-year retrospectives from  			 a telephone interview. P.

<p><a name="note6" id="note6">This</a> 28 percent figure is not exactly equal to  			 the ratio of 329 to 1,262 because the leaving rate definition uses survey  			 weights and hence does not correspond exactly to figures obtained using the  			 number of unweighted observations.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note9" id="note9">However,</a> contributions from relatives and  			 friends outside the household (not shown in the table but included in "Other")  			 are minor in amount.

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note10" id="note10">This</a> is a better measure of employment than the  			 point-in-time employment rate at the interview date because it averages over  			 more periods of time.

</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note11" id="note11">Again,</a> <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> does not  			 include income from the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). However, for the  			 purposes of <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>, as well as the other differences  			 discussed in this report, the inclusion of the EITC would magnify the  			 differences in income after leaving welfare relative to what we show. This is  			 because the EITC is geared to the level of earnings, and therefore those with  			 lower earnings receive a smaller EITC subsidy.
