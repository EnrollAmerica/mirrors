<p>We wish to thank many people who helped us throughout the course of this  		project. Mary Harahan, who first recognized the unique opportunity offered by  		the 1982 and 1984 NLTCS to study PPS effects on disabled beneficiaries,  		catalyzed the research leading to this report. Our project officers, Floyd  		Brown and Herb Silverman, along with Tony Hausner, ensured the timely  		availability of data sets and provided helpful suggestions on technical and  		substantive issues. Paul Eggers, Jim Vertrees, Bob Clark and Judy Sangl read  		earlier drafts of this report and provided many insightful comments and  		suggestions. While we benefited from the collective knowledge of the  		individuals noted, and others, we are solely responsible for the results and  		conclusions reported.</p>
<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS) reimburses hospitals on a  		casemix adjusted, flat-rate basis. This method of payment provides incentives  		for hospitals to serve patients as efficiently as possible, possibly by  		reducing length of stay and increasing use of skilled nursing facility (SNF)  		and home health (HHA) care. While increased SNF and HHA use might be viewed as  		an intended consequence of PPS, there has been concern that PPS induced changes  		in the duration and location of care would affect quality of care received by  		Medicare beneficiaries. Moreover, a particular concern was that the frail and  		disabled elderly would be disproportionately affected by the utilization  		changes resulting from the introduction of PPS.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Several studies have examined PPS effects on the total Medicare  		population. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of PPS on the  		subgroup of Medicare beneficiaries who were functionally disabled. The specific  		aims of this study were to measure changes in Medicare service use and to  		evaluate the effects of these changes on quality of care in terms of hospital  		readmission and mortality.</p>
<p>To focus on disabled persons, Medicare service use patterns of the  		samples of disabled Medicare beneficiaries in the 1982 and 1984 National Long  		Term Care Surveys (NLTCS) were analyzed. With Medicare Part A bills for the  		NLTCS samples of approximately 6,000 persons in 1982 and 1984, this study  		compared utilization patterns in one-year periods pre-PPS (1982-83) and  		post-PPS (1984-85). Service use measures that were analyzed were hospital  		admissions, Medicare hospital length of stay (LOS), SNF and HHA use. In this  		study, hospital readmission and mortality were viewed as indicators of quality  		of care. A multivariate clustering methodology was employed to identify  		relatively homogeneous subgroups of disabled Medicare beneficiaries so that  		utilization changes could be compared for medically and functionally similar  		cases as well as for the total disabled population.</p>
<h3>Findings</h3>
<p><b>Hospital LOS</b>. The study found that expected reductions in lengths  		of hospital stays occurred under PPS, although this reduction was not uniform  		for all admissions and appeared to be concentrated in subgroups of the disabled  		population. For example, while persons who were "mildly disabled" experienced  		reductions in LOS (10.8 days to 8.2 days), persons who had "heart and lung"  		problems experienced virtually no changes in hospital LOS (10.5 days to 10.6  		days).</p>
<p><b>Post Acute SNF Use</b>. The study found virtually no changes in  		Medicare SNF use after PPS was implemented. In fact, a slight decline in  		hospital episodes resulting in SNF admissions (5.2% to 4.7%) was observed.</p>
<p><b>Post Acute HHA Use</b>. Different from PPS effects on SNF use, the  		study found an increase in hospital episodes resulting in the use of HHA  		services (12.6% to 15.6%). In addition, HHA use without prior hospital stay  		increased from 13.6% to 21.5%.</p>
<p><b>Outcomes</b>. In terms of outcomes of hospital use related to quality  		of care, no difference in overall readmissions or mortality pre- and post-PPS  		were found. For example, the proportions of hospital episodes resulting in  		readmission within the one-year observation periods were 39.3% pre-PPS and  		38.4% post-PPS. Proportions of episodes resulting in death in the observations  		periods were 12.1 % pre-PPS and 12.5% post-PPS. In a further analysis of these  		measures, the hospital cases were stratified by whether they were followed by  		post-acute SNF or HHA use. Post-acute use of SNF or HHA did not influence  		either hospital readmission or mortality rates. Analysis of subgroups of the  		disabled population also showed few differences in pre-post PPS hospital  		readmissions and mortality.</p>
<h3>Limitations and Conclusions</h3>
<p>This study on the effects of hospital PPS on Medicare beneficiaries has  		certain limitations. The available data precluded analyses of other service  		episodes such as traditional nursing home stays. At the time the study was  		conducted, data were not available to measure use of Medicare Part B services.  		Detailed service-specific, casemix information (e.g., DRGs) was unavailable for  		comparison in pre- and post-PPS observation periods. Finally, the analysis was  		not specifically designed to evaluate the effects of PPS on the need for or use  		of "aftercare" in the community.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study of the effects of hospital PPS on the  		functionally impaired subgroup of Medicare beneficiaries indicated no  		system-wide adverse outcomes. Further research on the community services,  		nursing home use and other types of care would be necessary to develop a  		complete picture of the effects of PPS on disabled Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This report describes a study to measure changes in the pattern of  		Medicare service use resulting from the implementation of the prospective  		payment system (PPS) for Medicare hospital reimbursement. Distinct from prior  		studies which addressed the general Medicare population, our analysis focused  		on PPS effects on disabled elderly Medicare beneficiaries. Our specific aims  		were to measure changes in Medicare service use and to evaluate the effects of  		these changes on quality of care in terms of hospital readmission and  		mortality. In the following sections, we first discuss the background for this  		study. Second, we describe data sources and methodology. Third, we present  		findings. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings and review the  		limitations of this study.</p>
<h2>II. BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS) for hospital inpatient care  		was implemented in October, 1983. Under this system, payment for care is made  		on a fixed price per case, based on the average cost for a patient in a given  		Diagnosis Related Group (DRG). This system of payment provides incentives for  		hospitals to use resources efficiently, but it contains incentives to avoid  		patients who are more costly than the DRG average and to discharge patients as  		early as possible (Iezzoni, 1986). These incentives suggest that nursing homes  		and home health care with lower per them costs would be employed as substitutes  		for hospital days. They may also increase the risks that hospital patients are  		discharged inappropriately and have to be readmitted. In light of the potential  		effects of Medicare PPS on the utilization, costs and quality of care for  		Medicare beneficiaries, assessments of the effects of the new reimbursement  		policy have been of interest to the Administration and Congressional policy  		makers.</p>
<p>Because the PPS system has been introduced only recently, evaluations of  		the effects of the policy on Medicare beneficiaries have been limited. In the  		following, we briefly discuss five studies that addressed various dimensions of  		the effects of PPS on hospital utilization and outcomes of patients.</p>
<p>One study recently published by researchers at the Commission on  		Professional and Hospital Activities (CPHA) employed data from the CPHA  		sponsored Professional Activity Study (PAS) to examine changes in pre- and  		post-PPS differences in utilization and outcomes (DesHarnais, et al., 1987).  		Third-quarter data from a cohort of 729 short-term acute care hospitals for  		1980-1984 were used in this analysis. A linear forecasting model to project  		1984 measures of utilization and outcomes based on trends from 1980 to 1983 was  		developed to compare the expected 1984 measures to observed 1984 measures.  		Results from this analysis included findings that total Medicare discharges and  		length of stay of Medicare hospital patients decreased in the post-PPS period.  		The analysis also found significant changes in the proportions of hospital  		patients discharged home to self care and home health care. The proportion  		discharged to self-care dropped more than 3%, while the proportion discharged  		home with home health care rose almost 2%. The analysis suggested that the  		shorter Medicare stays are being supplemented with more use of home health  		agencies for post-discharge care. Significant increases were also found for the  		proportion of Medicare discharges transferred to other facilities (e.g.,  		rehabilitation units). In-hospital mortality rates for Medicare patients  		declined slightly in 1984 although the decline was not statistically  		significant. Finally, hospital readmissions did not change significantly  		between the pre- and post-PPS periods, although the measure of hospital  		readmission that was used was very limited, i.e., readmission to the  		<b>same</b> hospital during the <b>same</b> quarter of observation.</p>
<p>The CPHA researchers concluded that, while the results of the study  		provided initial insights, further analysis on the effects of PPS was required  		because of identifiable limitations of the study (DesHarnais, et al., 1987).  		For example, use of the PAS data precluded measurement of post-discharge  		mortality figures. In addition, some discrepancies may have existed between  		disposition of patients discharged from hospital, as recorded by hospital  		records, and the actual destination after discharge. A different measure of  		hospital readmission might also yield different results. Finally, as indicated  		by the researchers, these analyses measured the short-term effects of PPS;  		utilization and outcome measures beyond 1984 could also yield different  		conclusions.</p>
<p>In a second study, Krakauer (HCFA, 1987) analyzed the effectiveness of  		care provided to Medicare beneficiaries during hospitalization and thereafter  		in 1983-85. He assessed mortality rates, rates of hospital readmission, use of  		ambulatory and supportive care and mortality rates. The data employed in this  		study were Medicare bills submitted for hospitalization and ambulatory care and  		for limited intermediate care and skilled nursing facility services, and  		mortality information. The analyses employed a random 5 percent sample of  		patients who were admitted to and discharged from short-stay hospitals in  		1983-85. Post-hospital outcomes such as readmission and mortality were indexed  		relative to the first hospital admission in a given year.</p>
<p>Krakauer found that while hospital admission rates continued to decline  		during the study period, 1983-85, there was not a significant increase in the  		incidence of readmissions. The proportion of persons with no readmissions were  		65.0%, 65.8% and 67.3% for the three years. Age-adjusted mortality rates of the  		total Medicare beneficiary population remained essentially the same in the 3  		years, 5.1 percent, although the cumulative mortality rate <b>following</b> an  		initial admission in a calendar year increased slightly between 1983-84 and  		1985. In 1983 and 1984, post-hospital mortality rates were 5.9 percent at 30  		days after the first hospital admission and 19.7 percent at one year after the  		first hospital admission. In 1985, the corresponding rates were 6.8 percent and  		21.2 percent. Analyses of the characteristics of hospital admissions suggested  		that approximately half of the increase in post-hospital mortality was  		accounted for by an increase in the proportion of admissions for conditions  		associated with higher mortality risks. Moreover, Krakauer suggested that  		another part of the difference in mortality rates could be due to an increase  		in the severity of illness of admitted patients.</p>
<p>In addition to the analysis of the total sample of Medicare hospital  		patients, Krakauer examined changes in the outcome of nine tracer conditions  		and procedures. This analysis found a heterogeneous pattern of changes in  		mortality rates with small increases for high-risk medical admissions but  		marked decreases in mortality rates following hip or knee replacement and  		marked increases in mortality following coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  		Readmissions to hospitals were likely immediately following discharge, with  		9-22 percent of the persons at risk of readmission in the tracer conditions  		being readmitted within 30 days of discharge, while the rate dropped to 4-9  		percent for persons at risk of readmission beyond the period 30 days after  		discharge. Krakauer concluded that "overall, no adverse trends in the outcomes  		of the medical care provided Medicare beneficiaries are discernible as  		yet."</p>
<p>In a third study, Conklin and Houchens (1987) assessed changes in  		mortality rates of Medicare hospital admissions between fiscal years 1984 and  		1985, while adjusting for differential case-mix severity in the two years.  		Mortality was evaluated in a fixed 30-day interval from admission. Disease  		severity was defined with the Disease Staging methodology and was used to form  		a patient classification system based on mortality risk. Severity of principal  		disease, number of high risk comorbidities, age and sex formed the basis of the  		classification system. Methods of indirect standardization were used to derive  		a 1985 expected overall mortality rate based on 1984 mortality rates per  		severity level. Comparisons were then made between the expected (severity  		adjusted) mortality rate and the observed 1985 mortality rates. This study used  		data from the 20 percent MEDPAR files for fiscal years 1984 and 1985, and  		records of deaths from Social Security entitlement files.</p>
<p>Conklin and Houchens found that while crude 30-day mortality rates  		increased by 9.3% between 1984 and 1985, all of this increase could be  		explained by the increase in case-mix severity between the two years.  		Specifically, principal disease accounted for approximately 46 percent of the  		change in mortality from 1984 to 1985, while the severity of principal diseases  		explained an additional 35 percent of the 1984-85 change. Finally, after  		controlling for the number of high risk comorbidities within each stage and  		principal disease, the results suggested a higher mortality count in 1985 than  		was actually observed. In addition, the researchers found that an observed 8.7  		percent decrease in Medicare hospital admission rates between the two years was  		primarily caused by a decline in the hospitalization of low severity patients.  		As a result, the Medicare hospital population in 1985 was, on average, more  		severely ill and at greater risk of mortality than in 1984. The collective  		results of the study led the authors to conclude that there was no evidence to  		indicate that the quality of care has declined during the first two years of  		PPS.</p>
<p>While the first three studies examined effects of PPS in multiple  		hospitals in multiple states, two other studies focused on more circumscribed  		populations. One of these studies (Sager, et al., 1987) examined the impact of  		PPS on Medicaid nursing home patients in Wisconsin. The other study  		(Fitzgerald, et al., 1987), analyzed changes in the pattern of hip fracture  		care before and after PPS.</p>
<p>Sager and his colleagues reviewed hospitalization and mortality data on  		Wisconsin's elderly Medicaid nursing home population. Hospitalization data were  		available from the Wisconsin Medicaid program for the period from 1982 through  		1984, while mortality data were obtained for the years 1980 through 1985. This  		study examined hospitalization rates and hospital lengths of stay and location  		of death of the Medicaid patients. In addition, changes in patterns of  		hospitalization were compared between the institutionalized and  		noninstitutionalized elderly patients. The authors reported that during the 12  		months following the implementation of PPS, Wisconsin's institutionalized  		elderly Medicaid population experienced a 72 percent increase in the rate of  		hospitalization and a 26 percent decline in hospital length of stay. In  		contrast to the institutionalized elderly, the noninstitutionalized elderly  		experienced a 7 percent decrease in the rate of hospitalization and a 13  		percent decrease in the mean length of stay.</p>
<p>The authors posited two possible explanations for the increased  		hospitalization of institutionalized persons: (1) physician manipulation of PPS  		by discharging nursing home residents only to have them scheduled for  		readmission at a later date and (2) shorter hospital stays representing  		premature hospital discharges that resulted in more frequent  		rehospitalizations. The authors noted that since changes in hospitalization  		were seen only in the institutionalized population, the possibility existed  		that the frail elderly may represent a unique segment of the Medicare  		population that is vulnerable to the changes in health care provision  		encouraged by PPS. "Characterized by multiple disabilities and impaired  		resilience during illness, this group of elderly is dependent on both short-  		and long-term care services and would seem potentially susceptible to health  		care policies that alter the interplay between hospital and post-hospital  		services."</p>
<p>Sager and his colleagues also found that while mortality rates for  		Wisconsin's elderly population showed minimal variation during the study period  		(51.1/1000 in 1982 to 53.0/1000 in 1980) between 1982 and 1985, there was an  		increase of 26 percent in the rate of deaths occurring in nursing homes. The  		changes in nursing home death rates, which began in 1982, were also associated  		with a 10.3 percent decline in hospital deaths during the same period. The  		authors concluded that the shift in location of death from hospitals to nursing  		homes was more pronounced after the implementation of PPS. They posited that  		the observed change in location of death could reflect both a less aggressive  		use of hospital resources by physicians caring for terminally ill patients and  		a transfer of seriously ill patients to nursing homes for terminal care. The  		authors noted that both of these explanations suggest that nursing homes may  		now be caring for a segment of the terminally ill population that had  		previously been cared for in hospitals.</p>
<p>In the fifth study, Fitzgerald and his colleagues studied the effects of  		PPS on the care received by hospitalized hip fracture patients. Their  		hypothesis was that, after PPS, elderly patients hospitalized for hip fractures  		would receive shorter, less care-intensive hospitalization and would be  		institutionalized (in nursing homes) more frequently. Data for this study were  		derived from hip fracture patients at a 430 bed, university-affiliated  		municipal hospital that primarily served indigent persons in Indianapolis,  		Indiana. PPS was implemented at this hospital on January 1, 1984. The patients  		studied were those aged 65 years or older with a new fracture. Patients  		hospitalized or institutionalized at the time of fracture, with a history of a  		previous hip fracture, or with a neoplasm as a known or suspected cause were  		excluded from the study. These screens produced study samples of 47 cases  		pre-PPS and 23 cases post-PPS. Pre-PPS years included 1981-1983, while the  		post-PPS years were 1984 and 1985.</p>
<p>The study found no significant differences before and after PPS in the  		location of the hip fracture, associated proportions or types of comorbid  		conditions. Also, both groups walked with similar abilities before the  		fracture. The mean length of stay decreased from 16.6 days to 10.3 days after  		the implementation of PPS. In addition, the authors found that the reduction in  		LOS was due primarily to reductions in the period between the initiation of  		physical therapy and the discharge date. Corresponding with the reduction in  		this segment of stay after PPS, the authors found a reduction in the mean  		number of physical therapy sessions received by the patients, which declined  		from 9.7 to 4.9. The study also found an increase in the proportion of patients  		discharged to skilled nursing facilities after hospitalizations, from 21  		percent to 48 percent. In addition, the proportion of all patients originally  		hospitalized who were receiving care in a nursing home six months after  		discharge increased from 13 percent to 39 percent. Similar results were  		obtained after the authors excluded extended hospitalization cases from the  		pre-PPS sample.</p>
<p>The authors pointed out that despite shorter stays and less  		rehabilitation, their results did not unequivocally demonstrate that patients  		were less ambulatory at hospital discharge, and that differences in the  		severity of comorbidity, for example, might have explained the differential  		referral rate to nursing homes in the two periods. In addition, they noted that  		the higher six month rate of institutionalization in the post-PPS period may  		have been due to differences in nursing home characteristics, such as physical  		therapy facilities. However, the increase in six month institutionalization  		rates suggested that the patients entering nursing homes at discharge were not  		subsequently regaining the skills needed for independent living. "This failure  		of the current rehabilitation process emphasizes the inability of the current  		system to adequately complement acute-care resource reductions with needed  		long-term care rehabilitation services in patients previously managed with  		longer hospital stays."</p>
<p>The results of the prior studies provide initial insights on the effects  		of PPS on Medicare patients. In light of the importance of the landmark policy,  		continuing research is warranted to fully assess its effects. Our study was  		designed to provide information to assess PPS effects on the functionally  		impaired subgroup of Medicare beneficiaries. Many aspects of our study are  		different from those of the other studies, although the goals are similar. The  		differences, including sources and types of data and methodological strategies,  		provide complementary results in most cases in describing the effects of PPS on  		Medicare service use and outcomes.</p>
<h2>III. METHODS</h2>
<p>In the following sections, we describe the data source, the analysis  		plan and the statistical methods employed in this study.</p>
<h3>A. The 1982 and 1984 National Long-Term Care  		Surveys</h3>
<p>The data sources for this study were the 1982 and 1984 National  		Long-Term Care Surveys (NLTCS) of disabled elderly Medicare beneficiaries, and  		their Medicare Part A bills and Medicare records on mortality. The NLTCS  		contained detailed information on the health and functional characteristics of  		nationally representative samples (about 6,000) of noninstitutionalized  		disabled Medicare beneficiaries in 1982 and in 1984. These characteristics  		included medical conditions, dependencies in activities of daily living (ADL)  		and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). For these samples, Medicare  		Part A bills on hospital, skilled nursing facility (SNF) and home health  		service (HHA) use were obtained from the Health Care Financing Administration  		(HCFA). In addition, mortality events from Medicare enrollment files were  		obtained. Hence, the research file contained detailed patient characteristics  		information for two points in time, straddling the implementation of PPS, and  		complete Medicare Part A hospital, SNF and home health utilization and  		mortality information. Because the exact dates of service were available from  		the Medicare Part A bills, it was possible to define periods of Medicare  		hospital, SNF and HHA service use as well as periods when such services were  		not used.</p>
<p>The data set that we assembled for this study provided a basis for  		addressing analytical dimensions that are not generally available on billing  		records and hospital discharge abstracts alone (Iezzoni, 1986). The NLTCS  		allowed a broad characterization of cases including multiple chronic  		complications or co-morbidities and physical and cognitive impairments.  		Continuous Medicare Part A bills permitted a tracking of persons in the NLTCS  		samples through different parts of the health care system (i.e., Medicare  		hospital, SNF and HHA) so that we could examine transitions from acute care  		hospitals to subsequent experience in Medicare SNF or HHA services. Finally,  		our use of the Medicare enrollment files allowed us to measure mortality when  		individuals were receiving Medicare Part A services and also when they were  		not.</p>
<h3>B. Analysis Plan</h3>
<p>Our analysis plan was to compare Medicare service utilization for  		12-month periods before and after the implementation of PPS. The pre-PPS period  		was the one-year window from October 1, 1982 through September 30, 1983. The  		post-PPS period was the one-year window from October 1, 1984 through September  		30, 1985. These time frames were selected because detailed patient information  		based on the NLTCS data were available only for the two years, 1982 and 1984.  		Hence, the availability of information on a multiplicity of patient  		characteristics to identify potential PPS effects on specific subgroups of the  		Medicare population required us to examine utilization patterns in fixed  		intervals before and after the implementation of PPS. Other researchers, in  		contrast, addressed the PPS assessment issues using trend analysis strategies  		(DesHarnais, et al., 1987).</p>
<p><b>Episodes of Service Use</b>. The unit of observation in this study  		was an episode of service use rather than a Medicare beneficiary. We selected  		episodes rather than Medicare beneficiaries because beneficiaries could  		experience different numbers of episodes of one type of care (e.g., hospital)  		and different patterns of multiple service use episodes (e.g., hospital, SNF,  		HHA) during a 12-month period. By analyzing episodes, we were able to compare  		differences before and after PPS in all types of Medicare services between the  		two periods. Hence, the length of stay of a third hospital admission for a  		given beneficiary, for example, would enter the calculation of average hospital  		length of stay. Because of the large number of combinations of service use  		experienced by Medicare beneficiaries in a one-year period, it would be  		practical only to analyze a very limited number of different patterns if we  		used beneficiaries as the units of observation.</p>
<p>Episodes were defined as periods of service use according to dates coded  		on the Medicare Part A bills. The complementary intervals of time when these  		Medicare services were not used were also defined. These "other" episodes refer  		to intervals when individuals in the sample were not receiving Medicare  		inpatient hospital, SNF or HHA services. However, they might have been using  		non-Medicare nursing home services, or other Medicare services such as  		outpatient care, although, at the time of the selection of the 1982 and 1984  		samples, persons in nursing homes were identified as a special subsample.  		Because of the potential heterogeneity of situations represented by the "other"  		episodes, pre-post PPS changes in this type of episode must be interpreted with  		caution.</p>
<p>An episode was based on recorded dates of service use from the Medicare  		records. Discharge disposition of any type of service episode was based on  		status immediately following the specific episode. For example, a Medicare  		hospital episode terminating in discharge to Medicare SNF care would imply that  		the SNF episode followed within a day of the hospital discharge. Hence, a  		post-hospital SNF stay, if it started several days after a hospital discharge,  		would not be recorded as the disposition of the hospital episode. This  		definition of coterminous services has the potential effect of reducing the  		rates of post-hospital utilization of SNF or HHA services. However, this  		definition was applied uniformly for both pre- and post-PPS periods, and we are  		not aware of any systematic differences in the onset of post-acute services  		between the two time periods.</p>
<p>Samples of the Medicare utilization information for the community  		disabled individuals from the 1982 and 1984 NLTCS were drawn for analysis.  		Episodes of hospital, SNF, HHA and all other episodes were drawn proportionally  		to the number of each type of service status available. For example, because of  		the relatively small number of Medicare SNF episodes, all SNF episodes were  		drawn for the analysis. On the other hand, a random sample of the much more  		frequent hospital episodes was selected.</p>
<p><b>Service Use and Outcome Analyses</b>. Events of interest to the study  		were analyzed in two ways. First, we conducted analyses to measure changes in  		the length of stay and discharge status of each type of Medicare Part A  		services. Hospital, SNF and HHA service events were analyzed as independent  		episodes. For example, all of the hospital episodes in our sample, whether they  		were the first, second or third hospitalization during the observation window,  		were included as an individual unit of observation. No inference was made about  		the relationship of one hospital episode to another. By focusing on each  		episode of service use as a unit of observation, the analysis was able to  		include all episodes of the samples without benchmarking for a specific event,  		such as the first admission during the pre and post-PPS observation windows.  		Hence, the results of this analysis provides a representative picture of  		differences in pre- and post-PPS patterns of Medicare service use, in terms of  		service types and each episode of any given service type experienced by  		Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The second analysis strategy focused on outcomes subsequent to hospital  		admission. We measured changes in hospital use, and use of post-acute SNF and  		HHA services, hospital readmissions and mortality during and after hospital  		stays. While also based on episodes rather than beneficiaries, this analysis  		keyed events to a hospital admission. Hence, unlike the first analysis,  		episodes of SNF and HHA use, for example, were included only if they were  		post-hospital events. Hospital readmissions refer to any pair of hospital stays  		(e.g., first and second, second and third, etc.). In this way, comparisons  		between 1982-83 and 1984-85 patterns would include all hospital readmissions,  		rather than, for example, a "benchmark" first readmission during the  		observation window.</p>
<p><b>Population Subgroups as Case-Mix</b>. In both the service use and the  		outcome analyses, we conducted analyses where we stratified the NLTCS samples  		by relatively homogeneous subgroups of the disabled population.</p>
<p>We refer to these subgroups as case-mix groups because they represent  		different types of patients who would likely experience different Medicare  		service use patterns and outcomes. Our case-mix groups are based on chronic  		health and functional characteristics and are independent of their state at  		admission to Medicare services. In this way they are distinct from DRGs, for  		example, which differentiate the acute care requirements of persons being  		admitted to hospitals.</p>
<p>Case-mix information on the 1982 and 1984 samples were derived through  		Grade of Membership analysis of the pooled 1982 and 1984 samples (Woodbury and  		Manton, 1982; Manton, et al., 1987). Pooling patients from the two periods to  		define the GOM groups enabled us to make case-mix-specific comparisons  		consistently across the two periods. The GOM techniques identified an optimum  		number of case-mix profiles based on maximum likelihood estimation of the set  		of health and functional status characteristics from the 1982 and 1984 NLTCS.  		Fifty-six (56) medical conditions, ADLs and IADLs were used in this analysis.  		The GOM profiles represent subgroups of the total samples which were relatively  		homogeneous in terms of these characteristics. Because the 1982 and 1984  		samples were pooled for the GOM analysis, the case-mix groups that were derived  		were representative of both the pre- and post-PPS periods. We discuss the GOM  		methodology in greater detail in the following section on statistical  		methodology.</p>
<p>With the population subgroups, we could determine whether any change in  		overall utilization changes between pre- and post-PPS periods remained after  		adjustments were made to account for case-mix effects. Hence, while hospital  		LOS has been noted to decrease with PPS, questions still remained about whether  		the observed declines were due to hospital behavior or to case-mix changes. The  		case mix controls allowed us to examine this question. Second, the GOM groups  		represent potentially vulnerable subsets of the total disabled elderly  		population according to functional and health characteristics. We examined the  		changes among vulnerable subgroups to determine which segments of the total  		population were most affected by PPS.</p>
<h3>C. Statistical Methodology</h3>
<p>We employed a combination of two methodological strategies in this  		study. First, Grade of Membership analysis was used to derive subgroups of the  		population according to patient characteristics, and to measure case-mix  		changes between the pre- and post-PPS periods. Life table methodologies were  		employed to measure utilization changes between the two periods. Various life  		table functions described risks of events and durations of expected time  		between events (e.g., hospital length of stay). Statistical comparisons were  		made, therefore, between life table patterns of events rather than between  		measures of central tendency such as mean scores. This methodology provides a  		more complete comparison of the patterns of changes between the pre- and  		post-PPS periods. In our presentation of results we indicate statistical  		significance at .05 and .10 levels.</p>
<p><b>Grade of Membership (GOM) Analysis</b>. GOM analysis is a  		multivariate technique that combines two types of analyses usually performed  		separately (Woodbury and Manton, 1982). The first component is a description of  		the relation of each case-mix dimension to each of the variables selected for  		analysis. Using the GOM procedure, a prespecified number (say <i>K</i>) of  		dimensions can be identified from the available information. The second  		component is a grade or weight for each person representing how much each  		person is described by the characteristics associated with a given case-mix  		dimension. A person can be represented by more than one case-mix dimension and  		have different degrees or grade of membership for each.</p>
<p>Several characteristics of GOM analysis recommend it as a clustering  		procedure for the analysis of case-mix in this study. First, GOM is capable of  		dealing with large numbers of correlated discrete variables and reducing them  		to a smaller, more manageable number of dimensions. Second, since the analysis  		identifies "<i>K</i>" sets of discrete profiles, each with their own  		characteristic relationships to the variables of interest, subgroup variable  		interactions are directly represented in the analysis. This allows, for  		example, for comorbidities to serve as descriptors of the stage of the natural  		history of a specific condition, as well as to describe the pattern of  		comorbidities. Finally, since the analysis generates coefficients that describe  		how each person is related to each of the basic profiles, it offers a strategy  		for generating continuous measures of severity determined by a wide range of  		interacting medical and disability conditions.</p>
<p>GOM analysis involves a simultaneous analysis of the relationships of  		both variables and cases to a set of analytically defined profiles of  		individual functional and health characteristics. Measurements on each  		individual are predicted as the product of two types of coefficients--one  		describing how closely an individual's characteristics approximate those  		described by each of the analytic profiles or subgroups and another describing  		the characteristics of the profiles. The two types of GOM coefficients can be  		associated with the two types of results. First, multivariate profiles or "pure  		types" are defined by the probability that a person in a given group or pure  		type has each of the set of characteristics or attributes. These can include,  		for example, presence or absence of specific medical conditions and activities  		of daily living. Second, for each profile defined in the analysis, weights are  		derived for each person, ranging from 0 to 1.0 (and summing to 1.0) reflecting  		the extent to which a given individual resembles each of the profiles.  		<a href="#appendA">Appendix A</a> discusses the technical details of GOM  		analyses.</p>
<p><b>Life Table Analysis</b>. In conjunction with the Grade of Membership  		analysis employed to develop the case-mix groups, we used cause elimination  		life table methodologies to analyze the duration data in service episodes. Life  		table methodologies were employed for several reasons. First, an important  		dimension of the comparisons of Medicare service use between 1982-83 and  		1984-85 was the duration of specific services (e.g., hospital length of stay).  		Life table methodology permits the derivation of duration specific schedules of  		the occurrence of events, such as the probability of a discharge to a SNF after  		a specific number of days of hospital stay.</p>
<p>Second, there were competing risks which censored the occurrence of  		specific events of interest, such as "end of study" relative to hospital  		readmission. Cause elimination life table methodology adjusts the probability  		of being readmitted to a hospital by accounting for the competing risks of "end  		of study" before readmission. Since we cannot observe a readmission after the  		study ends, our results could be biased and misleading if we did not account  		for this censoring. Life table methodology incorporates the use of the periods  		of exposure of incompleted events (e.g., a nursing home stay that ends after  		the study) in the calculation of risks of specific outcomes.</p>
<p>Finally, the life table contains functional relationships that provide  		rich descriptions of the patterns that are fundamentally important to this  		analysis. For example, while a schedule of conditional probabilities of  		hospital readmissions can be produced, these probabilities do not tell us how  		much time passed before the readmission. The life table can provide estimates  		of the expected amount of time before readmission in addition to the  		probability of readmission. For the analyses where utilization patterns were  		examined for specific case-mix groups, specialized cause elimination life table  		methodologies were developed to derive life table functions for each of the  		case-mix subgroups. Specifically, life tables were calculated for persons who  		have identically the characteristics of one of the groups. These tables  		described the service use patterns of a person with a weight of 1.0 (i.e., 100  		percent) on that group and a weight of 0.0 on all other groups. These "pure  		type" life tables can be adjusted for "competing risk" effects using the  		standard life table procedures discussed above. The life tables for the total  		population can be derived by employing the case-mix weights (i.e., the  		g<sub>ik</sub>) actually calculated for each person. Hence a person who is 0.5  		like the first profile and 0.5 like the second profile would have service use  		life tables that, likewise, are weighted combinations of the life tables for  		the first and second profiles. Since the case-mix weights must add to one,  		adding up the weighted life tables must reproduce the life table for the total  		population, i.e., the population before stratifying by the case-mix weights.  		This provides a procedure for testing whether the case-mix stratifications (or  		any other stratification such as the service use differences between 1982-83  		and 1984-85 intervals) is "significant." By "significant" we mean whether or  		not the life tables estimated for each case mix group differ from those for the  		total population by more than chance. The statistic used to test the  		significance of differences is the well known <i>X</i><sup>2</sup>  		"goodness-of-fit" statistic which is used to determine if two or more  		distributions are statistically significantly different. The computational  		details of such tests are presented in Manton et al., 1987.</p>
<h2>IV. RESULTS</h2>
<p>This section presents the results of the analyses of the pre- and  		post-PPS utilization of Medicare services experienced by the  		noninstitutionalized disabled elderly beneficiaries. The results are presented  		in five parts. The first part presents a general context of mortality and  		Medicare service use of the various subgroups of the total Medicare beneficiary  		population based on the total population screened for the NLTCS. The remaining  		four parts address different service use and outcome patterns of the subgroup  		of Medicare beneficiaries who have chronic disabilities.</p>
<h3>A. Analysis of Major Subgroups of the Total Medicare  		Beneficiary Population</h3>
<p>Although our study focused on chronically disabled persons in the total  		elderly population, it is important to view the service use and mortality of  		this subgroup in the context of all major components of the total Medicare  		population. This can be done by examining the patterns of service use in the  		three major subgroups of the population as defined by the sample design of the  		1982-1984 NLTCS. The three sample groups defined at the time of the screening  		were a.) the community disabled elderly (i.e., those who received the detailed  		questionnaire and who will be analyzed in great detail in subsequent sections),  		b.) the community non-disabled elderly, and c.) those persons who were in long  		term care institutions at the time the sample was defined. <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> presents comparative hospital utilization statistics  		of the three subgroups of Medicare beneficiaries. Detailed tables on all  		hospital, SNF and HHA patterns are included in <a href="#appendB">Appendix  		B</a>.</p>

</tr></table><p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> shows that nondisabled,  		noninstitutionalized persons had shorter hospital stays than either the  		community disabled or the institutionalized. The higher LOS of the latter  		groups is probably related to their functional disabilities. The table also  		shows that the hospital length of stay for the community nondisabled group  		declined from 10.1 to about 8.8 days--in line with the decline noted in the  		general Medicare population (Neu, 1987). While this group is relatively  		healthier in terms of chronic functional and health problems they will still  		experience, at a lower rate, serious and acute medical problems. Changes in LOS  		of the nondisabled may be compared with the decline in hospital LOS for persons  		in institutions (from 12.0 to 10.0 days) and for the community disabled elderly  		(from 11.6 to 10.4 days). Thus, an groups experienced notable declines in  		hospital LOS with the institutionalized having the largest decline (i.e., 2.0  		days). Conversely, the disabled elderly residing in the community had the  		lowest absolute and proportional decline in hospital length of stay before and  		after PPS.</p>
<p>In examining the length of time and percent of cases that terminate in a  		particular way we see that the nondisabled community elderly and the  		institutionalized elderly have slight increases in hospital episodes ending in  		death with the community disabled experiencing virtually no change. Note that  		these changes have not been adjusted for the increased severity of hospital  		case-mix which Krakauer and Conklin and Houchens found to eliminate much of the  		pre-post mortality difference. We also found that, for community dwellers (both  		disabled and non-disabled), there were compensating decreases in mortality in  		Medicare SNF and HHA service episodes suggesting that more serious cases were  		being transferred to hospitals more efficiently. Tables of these patterns are  		found in <a href="#appendB">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<p>The mortality increases that do exist are of the magnitude that could be  		caused by year to year changes in national mortality patterns found in  		<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>. For the total elderly population we see that  		the pattern is erratic with death rate "peaks" in 1983 and 1985 and with the  		lowest mortality rates for 1986. This irregular pattern suggests that there is  		no consistent elevation of mortality for the total elderly population, and that  		any pre- and post-analysis of mortality must be interpreted with these secular  		irregularities in mind. To illustrate, we conducted parallel analyses to the  		ones presented here of all experience in calendar years 1982 and 1984. 1984  		relative to 1983 was a year of low mortality. As a consequence we observed a  		general pattern of mortality declines in our analyses using that set of  		temporal windows. Thus, the 1982-83 and 1984-85 service windows here actually  		represent a type of "worst" case scenario.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"><a name="figure1" id="figure1"><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/67926/ppsfig1.gif" /></a></div>
<p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> also shows that for all three populations  		increases occurred in the use of HHA services after hospital discharge, with  		declines in the time spent in hospitals prior to HHA admission. Medicare SNF  		use increased for the nondisabled community elderly, but decreased for both  		community disabled and institutionalized elderly..</p>
<p>In subsequent sections we will analyze in greater detail, the service  		use and mortality of one of the groups, the community disabled elderly. For  		this potentially vulnerable group, because of the detailed survey information,  		we will be able to control for detailed chronic health and functional status  		characteristics. <a href="#section4B">Section B</a> describes the subgroups  		among the disabled elderly derived from the GOM analysis of pooled 1982 and  		1984 NLTCS data. <a href="#section4C">Section C</a> describes the hospital, SNF  		and home health care utilization patterns in the pre- and post-PPS periods.  		This analysis examines the changes in length of stay and termination status of  		episodes of each of these Medicare services between the two time periods  		without regard to the interrelation of events. <a href="#section4D">Section  		D</a> discusses hospital readmission patterns by examining rates of readmission  		at specific intervals after hospital admission. <a href="#section4E">Section  		E</a> addresses mortality patterns after hospital admission, including deaths  		in post-acute care settings after hospital discharge.</p>
<h3><a name="section4B" id="section4B">B. Population Subgroups</a></h3>
<p>The Grade of Membership analysis of the period 1982-83 and 1984-85 NLTCS  		data produced four relatively homogeneous subgroups. In our analyses, these  		groups were used principally to determine if overall changes in Medicare  		service utilization between the pre- and post-PPS periods were found for major  		subgroups of the disabled Medicare population, and if specific vulnerable  		subgroups were particularly affected by PPS. The GOM subgroups derived are  		based on much broader criteria involving chronic health problems than the  		diagnostic related groups (DRG's) employed in the actual PPS reimbursement  		system. These groups represent distinct subsets of medical and functional  		states of Medicare beneficiaries reflecting the multiple comorbidities of  		elderly persons which may be expected to be associated with service use  		patterns and possible negative outcomes of care such as hospital readmission  		and mortality. While a fall description of the GOM subgroup profiles are  		presented in <a href="#appendC">Appendix C</a>, Table 2 highlights the most  		significant characteristics of the four groups.</p>
<blockquote><p>Type I, which we will refer to as "Mildly Disabled," has only a  		  minimum of long-term health and functional status problems, with the most  		  prevalent conditions being rheumatism and arthritis. Relative to the entire  		  population of disabled Medicare beneficiaries, Type I individuals are young,  		  with only 10 percent being over 85 years of age. Sixty-seven percent (67%)  		  indicate that their general health is good or excellent. Only 3 percent had a  		  prior nursing home stay, and only 10 percent spent private dollars for home  		  care.</p>
<p>Type II, which we will refer to as the "Oldest-Old," has many ADL and  		  IADL problems with 72 percent being dependent in bed to chair transfers. This  		  type is also prone to hip and other fractures; the relative risks of hip  		  fracture in this group, for example, is three times greater than the average  		  disabled person. Glaucoma and cancer are also prevalent in this group.  		  Demographically, 50 percent are over 85 years of age, 70 percent are not  		  married and 70 percent are female. This group also has the highest rates of  		  prior nursing home use (22%) compared to the sample average (10%).</p>
<p>Type III, which we will refer to as "Heart and Lung Problems," has  		  mild ADL dependencies, such as bathing, and IADL dependencies. Arthritis, which  		  is prevalent in this group, is associated with a high risk of permanent  		  stiffness. Most characteristic of this group are high risks of cardiovascular  		  (e.g., 80% arteriosclerosis) and lung diseases (e.g., 44% bronchitis) which are  		  associated with high likelihood of diabetes (45%) and obesity (50%). The group  		  is not particularly old, with 95% being under 85 years of age, and is  		  predominantly female.</p>
<p>Type IV, which we will refer to as "Severely ADL Dependent," has a 60  		  percent chance of being dependent in eating and 100 percent chance of being  		  dependent in all other ADLs. A high risk of being bedfast (11 percent) or  		  chairfast (32 percent) is characteristic of this group. Moreover, membership in  		  this group is also associated with a 70 percent chance of being incontinent.  		  The high level of disability is associated with neurological diseases,  		  including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. Senility and  		  behavioral problems are also present. Demographically, 48 percent are male, 58  		  percent married and 25 percent are over 85 years of age. A high proportion  		  (19%) of members of this group had prior nursing home stays.</p>

</tr></table><p>The four case-mix groups derived in this study represent coherent  		collections of disability and medical conditions that are suggestive of service  		use differences and outcomes. Type I would appear to be the least vulnerable to  		inappropriate outcomes of hospital admissions--principally because of their  		overall good health. Type II, the Oldest-Old, with hip fractures, for example,  		would be expected to require post-acute care for rehabilitation. Type III,  		because of their acute heart and lung problems, might be expected to experience  		multiple hospital admissions within a one year period and higher than average  		mortality risks. Type IV, the severely disabled individuals with neurological  		conditions, would be expected to be users of post-acute care services and  		long-term care, and at high risk of mortality. Thus the GOM defined groups are  		distinctly different subgroups of the disabled elderly population, ranging from  		persons with mild disability to severely disabled individuals. In the following  		sections on Medicare service use, these GOM groups are used to adjust overall  		utilization differences between pre- and post-PPS periods. We also discuss  		significant changes in utilization for each of these GOM subgroup types.</p>
<p>In addition, we employed the second output of GOM analysis, the degree  		to which individual cases resemble each of the GOM profiles to determine if a  		shift occurred in the case-mix of episodes of Medicare hospital, SNF and HHA  		care between the pre- and post-PPS periods. By summing the individual case  		weights per GOM profile per case, it was possible for us to determine whether  		there was a shift in the cases that resembled each of the GOM subgroups (shift  		in the distribution of GOM scores between 1982 and 1984).</p>
<p><a href="#table3">Table 3</a> shows a shift in the proportion of cases  		by service episodes of each of the four types between 1982 and 1984. The shifts  		are generally in the expected direction. For example, for hospital episodes  		there was a large decline in the "Severely ADL Dependent" (i.e., from 20.3% to  		16.9%) but increases in the "Oldest-Old" and "Heart and Lung" suggesting an  		increase in the medical acuity of the population with a significant reduction  		in seriously impaired persons with less medical acuity. In the SNF group we  		also see declines in the severely ADL impaired population with increases in the  		"Mildly Disabled" and "Oldest-Old" populations--again suggesting a change in  		case mix representing increased acuity of a specific type. HHA services show  		moderate changes with the oldest-old and severely ADL dependent types  		increasing in prevalence and the less disabled decreasing. Thus the HHA  		population has, in contrast to the SNF population, become more chronically  		disabled and even older. This HHA pattern reflects similar changes in the  		community population which becomes older and has more severely disabled  		persons. Thus the whole distribution by case-mix type has been altered by the  		sorting out of service venues due to the impact of PPS.</p>

<p>This section discusses the service use patterns of hospital, skilled  		nursing facility (SNF) and home health agency (HHA) care experienced by the  		NLTCS chronically disabled community sample between 1982-83 and 1984-85. This  		analysis was designed to provide a description of changes between the two time  		periods in terms of rates of how different service events ended, and how these  		event termination patterns were related to episode duration. For example, we  		structured the analysis to determine if changes in hospital length of stay  		after PPS were related to changes in the proportion of hospital discharges  		followed by use of SNF and HHA care.</p>
<p><b>Hospital Use</b>. <a href="#table4">Table 4</a> presents the patterns  		of Medicare hospital events for the two time periods, after adjusting for the  		events for which the discharge outcome was not known because of end-of-study.  		There was an overall decline in LOS from 11.6 days in the pre-PPS period to  		10.2 days in the post-PPS period, after adjustments were made for end-of-study.  		<a href="#table4">Table 4</a> also shows a decline in the proportion of  		hospital admissions that resulted in a discharge to Medicare SNF services (5.2%  		versus 4.7%), although discharge to HHA care increased from 12.6 percent to  		15.6 percent. There was no change in discharges due to death which was 9.1  		percent in both pre- and post-PPS periods, although patients who died in the  		hospital had shorter stays in the post-PPS period. The LOS of hospital stays  		declined between the pre- and post-PPS periods, for all discharge terminations  		except to "other." Because the percent of hospital discharges to SNFs declined,  		there was no apparent substitution of hospital and SNF days, although some  		possibility existed for HHA care serving as a substitute for hospital days.  		Since increases in post-acute care might be viewed as intended effects of PPS,  		it is surprising that SNF use declined. in later sections we examine the  		changes in such use in relation to hospital readmission and mortality  		outcome.</p>

</tr></table><p><a href="#table4">Table 4</a> also presents the results of statistical  		analyses when adjustments are made for differences in case-mix between 1982 and  		1984. This refinement of the comparison of observed differences in patterns  		indicated that statistically significant differences (at the .05 level) were  		found for the hospital stays that ended with admission to HHA. It is apparent  		that both rates of hospital discharge to HHA and hospital LOS prior to  		discharge were different between the two time periods. <a href="#table4">Table  		4</a> indicates that, while HHA admissions from hospitals increased, the LOS in  		hospitals prior to HHA admissions decreased between pre- and post-PPS periods.  		There also appears to be a change in the hospital stays that resulted in  		admissions to SNFs, although this difference was significant at a .10 level.  		The fact that hospital LOS overall did not differ statistically between 1982  		and 1984 after case-mix adjustments suggests that minimal changes in LOS  		resulted from PPS for the disabled elderly that are the subject of this  		analysis.</p>
<p><b>SNF Use</b>. <a href="#table5">Table 5</a> presents the discharge  		patterns of individuals who experienced Medicare SNF use pre- and post-PPS and  		the length of stay in Medicare SNFs. There was a decline in average LOS for all  		SNF episodes from 69.9 days to 37.7 days. Results of declining overed days of  		SNF care are consistent with HCFA statistics (Hall and Sangl, 1987). By  		termination status of SNF episodes, there was a reduction in discharge from  		SNFs to hospitals from 30.6 percent in the pre-PPS period to 18.0 percent in  		the post-PPS period. This suggests a reduction in hospital readmission from  		SNFs since most SNF stays are preceded by hospital stays. <a href="#table5">Table 5</a> also presents the results of statistical tests on  		the SNF patterns of LOS and discharge destination when adjustments were made  		for case-mix. These results indicate that the observed differences of changes  		in SNF utilization were not statistically significant after case-mix  		adjustments. In fact, only those SNF cases that resulted in discharges to  		episodes with no further Medicare services were marginally significant (p  		=.10).</p>
<p><b>HHA Use</b>. <a href="#table6">Table 6</a> presents the patterns of  		discharge for HHA episodes. There was a decline in average LOS for all HHA  		episodes from 77.4 days to 52.5 days. However, after adjustments were made for  		case-mix, this change was not statistically significant.</p>

</tr></table><p><b>Other Episodes</b>. <a href="#table7">Table 7</a> presents the  		patterns of durations when Medicare Part A services were not used during the  		pre- and post-PPS periods. There was an overall increase in the average  		durations of these episodes, from 231 days to 237 days. This result implies  		that intervals before and after use of Medicare hospital, SNF and HHA services  		increased between the two periods. There was also a reduction in the likelihood  		that these periods ended with an admission to hospitals (80.9% to 70.7%)  		suggesting lower hospital admission rates after FPS, a result consistent with  		other studies (Conklin and Houchens, 1987). Rates of "other" episodes resulting  		in admission to HHA increased from 13.6 percent to 21.5 percent--a result  		consistent with recent findings from a University of Colorado study (1987). In  		that study, Shaughnessy and colleagues found that the proportion of Medicare  		HHA patients admitted from home increased from 23.6 percent in 1982 to 38.5  		percent in 1986. This increase in HHA use was significant even after  		adjustments were made for the chronic health and functional status differences  		between the four GOM defined subpopulations.</p>
<p><b>Subgroup Patterns of Hospital, SNF and HHA</b>. In addition to  		employing the GOM subgroups to adjust for overall utilization changes before  		and after PPS, we examined differences in the effects of PPS on the specific  		subgroups among the disabled elderly population. As discussed above, the GOM  		groups reflect differences among the total population in terms of both medical  		and functional status. The next four tables highlight the Medicare service use  		patterns of each of the four GOM subgroups. Each table presents hospital, SNF,  		HHA and other episodes by discharge destination.</p>

Statistically  		significant differences (p = .05) between 1982 and 1984 were detected in the  		hospital, length of stay for this group. A significant change (p = .05) was  		found in the subset of hospital stays that resulted in an admission for  		Medicare SNF care. The association between increases in SNF admissions and  		decreases in hospital LOS suggests the possibility of service substitution  		among the "Mildly Disabled." Moreover, SNF episodes for this group had an  		increase in the proportion that were discharged to the other settings. The two  		results suggest that for the "Mild Disability" group, there was a detectable  		change in utilization characterized by higher hospital discharge to SNFs and  		higher SNF discharges to "other" episodes with corresponding decreases in  		hospital and SNF lengths of stay. We also found a significantly (p =.10) higher  		mortality rate among the "other" i.e., non-Medicare Part A service) episodes.  		While we cannot tell from the data where and what types of non-Medicare Part A  		services were being received, it appears that the higher mortality among the  		other episodes were offsetting the lower (but not statistically significantly  		lower) mortality associated with Medicare Part A service use.</p>
<p><a href="#table9">Table 9</a> presents the patterns of Medicare Part A  		service use episodes for the "Oldest-Old" subgroup, which was characterized by  		a 50 percent likelihood of being over 85 years of age, hip fracture and cancer  		and with many ADL problems. There were no statistically significant differences  		before and after PPS in the patterns of hospital, SNF and HHA episodes.  		Significant differences were detected for this group in terms of lower rates of  		being admitted from the community directly to HHA services and higher rates of  		dying in "other" types of episodes. It should be recalled that "other" refers  		to all periods when Medicare Part A services were not received. The higher  		mortality of this subgroup may be due to higher proportions of these  		individuals dying while receiving non-Medicare nursing home care or other types  		of services. For example, given that the oldest-old case-mix group was  		characterized by a high risk of cancer, some might have received community  		based hospice care. While our data source does not enable us to investigate  		this result for the "Oldest-Old", our findings suggest needed further  		research.</p>

For this medically  		acute group, there was no change in hospital length of stay before and after  		PPS, which remained about 10.5 days. The only statistically significant (p  		=.10) difference after PPS was found for HHA episodes that decreased in the  		rate of discharge to hospitals and decreased in LOS. While differences in  		mortality were not statistically significant, they suggest an increase in  		hospital and SNF mortality and corresponding mortality decreases in HHA other  		settings.</p>
<p><a href="#table11">Table 11</a> presents the patterns of service use for  		the "Severely Disabled" group, which was characterized by heavy ADL dependency,  		neurological problems, stroke, and senility. Statistically significant  		differences were not detected in the hospital utilization patterns of this  		group. Marginally significant differences (p = .10) were detected for SNF  		episodes, which decreased in LOS. In addition, we found a slightly higher rate  		of SNF episodes resulting in discharge to hospital (23.4 versus 25.4 percent)  		suggesting the possibility of increased hospital readmission for this group.  		Home health episodes were significantly different with overall LOS decreasing  		from 108 days to 63 days. While the proportion of HHA episodes resulting in  		hospital admission was lower, the proportion of HHA episodes discharged to the  		other settings increased. Finally, there was a marginally significant (p = .10)  		decrease in community episodes resulting in deaths.</p>
<p>In summary, we found that hospital lengths of stay decreased between  		1982-83 and 1984-85 for the subgroup of disabled, non-institutionalized  		Medicare beneficiaries, but that much of this chance was attributable to  		case-mix changes. The finding that admission rates to hospitals from SNFs, HHAs  		and the community declined between the pre- and post-periods, is also  		consistent with other studies results showing declining hospital admission  		rates for all Medicare beneficiaries (Conklin and Houchens, 1987). While only  		marginal changes in the post-acute use of Medicare SNF care were found,  		significant increases were found for the use of HHA services between the pre-  		and post-PPS time periods. There were indications of service substitution  		between hospital care and SNF and HHA care.</p>

<p>This analysis focused on hospital admissions and outcomes of these  		admissions in terms of hospital readmissions. We employed cause elimination  		life table methodology to measure risks of readmission after specific periods  		of time after an initiating admission. The initiating admission could be any  		hospital admission. Hence, this analysis embodied representative samples of  		each pair of hospital admissions (e.g., first and second, second and third,  		etc.) as well as all hospital admissions that did not involve a readmission  		during the one-year observation periods. We benchmarked the analysis on  		hospital admission, rather than discharge, because we wanted to account for the  		possible effects of mortality in the hospital as a competing risk for hospital  		readmission. That is, some hospital admissions result in death in the hospital;  		these cases would not be eligible for hospital readmission. In choosing to  		benchmark our hospital readmission risks on those entering hospital, we  		effectively compared all individuals who entered hospitals in the two time  		periods.</p>
<p>We adjusted for differences in mortality as competing risks by employing  		cause elimination life table methodology. This methodology produces risks of  		hospital readmission net of mortality. Hence, the readmission rates for each  		period are not confounded by possible differences in exposure to readmission  		because of differences in mortality risks between the two periods. The  		characteristics of individuals entering hospitals differed between the pre- and  		post-PPS periods. This difference was identified in another analysis in our  		study (the comparison of case-mix by GOM g<sub>ik</sub>'s) and indicated an  		increase in the oldest-old and medical acute groups. As with the other analysis  		of episodes of Medicare service use, comparisons are made between the pre- and  		post-PPS periods using October 1 through September 30 windows for both 1982-83  		and 1984-85.</p>
<p>In comparing pre- and post-PPS period differences in hospital  		readmissions, we looked at several dimensions of the phenomenon. First, we  		examined the proportion of hospital admissions that resulted in readmissions  		during the one year windows of observation. The proportions between the two  		years remained about the same--39.3% in 1982-83 and 38.5% in 1984-85. Not  		surprisingly, the expected number of days before readmission were also  		similar--194 days versus 199 days.</p>
<p>Second, we examined the risk of readmission as a function of duration of  		time after the initiating admission. <a href="#table12">Table 12</a> presents  		the schedule of probabilities of hospital readmission for pre- and post-PPS  		periods, and the difference in probabilities between the two periods. The  		probability of a hospital readmission between the initial admission date and  		the subsequent 15 days was 3.8 percent in 1982-83 and 4.1 percent in 1984-85, a  		likelihood of hospital readmission in the post-PPS period higher by 0.3  		percent. The higher post-PPS probability of hospital readmission was also found  		for the 15-29 day interval after hospital admission. The net increase for this  		interval was 0.7 percent between 1982 and 1984. For the 30-44 days interval,  		however, there was a reduction in risk of hospital readmissions of 1.1 percent  		in the post-PPS period. Overall, the schedules of hospital readmissions in the  		two time periods were not statistically different</p>
<p>Third, we disaggregated the cases by post-acute care use to determine if  		the risks of hospital readmission differed by whether post-acute Medicare SNF  		and home health services were used, as well as for cases that involved no  		Medicare post-acute services. In comparing the proportion of hospital  		readmissions for the one-year windows between the pre-PPS and post-PPS periods,  		Table 13 shows a small decline in readmissions among the hospital episodes that  		were followed by SNF care (36% vs. 33.9%), similar proportions when HHA were  		used after hospitalization and a small decline for the cases involving no  		post-acute care. As with the total cases, we found a slightly different pattern  		of risk of readmission when we focused on time intervals shortly after  		admission (i.e., 30 days, 90 days). For initial hospitalizations followed by  		SNF use, the risks of readmission to a hospital increased from 7.3 percent to  		9.2 percent for the 0-30 days interval and from 31 percent to 33.2 percent for  		the 0-90 day interval. Hospitalizations not followed by post-acute care use  		resulted in a higher readmission risk in 30 days but a lower risk by 90 days.  		Expected number of days before readmission decreased between the pre- and  		post-PPS period, regardless of whether post-acute care were used. Only in the  		case where no Medicare SNF or HHA services was received was there a  		statistically significant difference (p = .10) in the pattern of  		readmissions.</p>

The first case involved the "Heart and Lung" GOM group of cases  		that received HHA services after hospital discharge. This group had a longer  		expected period of time before hospital readmission (176 vs. 189 days) and had  		lower risks of readmission within the first 30 and first 45 days after the  		initiating hospital stay. In a second case, the "Severely Disabled" group with  		no Medicare post-acute services, there was also a longer expected duration  		prior to hospital readmission in the post-PPS period, and generally lower risks  		of readmission at different intervals after the initiating hospital  		admission.</p>
<p>Overall, our analysis indicated no system-wide changes in hospital  		readmission risks between the pre- and post-PPS periods for hospital episodes.  		Among the hospital admissions that were followed by no Medicare A services,  		there was a marginally significant decline in hospital readmission patterns  		between 1982-84. For these cases, non-Medicare nursing home and other  		post-acute services might have been received, although we are not able to make  		that distinction. Our overall findings are consistent with the notion that PPS  		incentives result in some discharges to nursing homes being readmitted to  		hospitals, although the overall pattern of readmissions were not significantly  		different in the two time periods.</p>
<h3><a name="section4E" id="section4E">E. Post-Hospital Admission  		Mortality</a></h3>
<p>In an analysis similar to that for hospital readmissions, we examined  		the timing of death after hospital admission. Specifically, we employed cause  		elimination life table methodology to determine the duration specific  		probability of death adjusted for differential admission rates to hospital in  		the two periods. In a comparison of the pre- and post-PPS periods, the  		proportion of persons with hospital admissions who eventually died in the  		12-month period remained about the same--12.1% in 1982-83 and 12.5% in 1984-85.  		The expected number of days after hospital admission to death were identical  		for the pre- and post-PPS periods. It should be noted that, unlike the results  		of <a href="#table4">Table 4</a>, which included rates of hospital discharge  		resulting in death, the present analysis includes deaths <b>after</b> discharge  		from the hospital as well as deaths occurring in the hospital.</p>

</tr></table><p>In our analysis of the distribution of deaths at specified intervals of  		time after hospital admission, we found higher proportions of death occurring  		in a short period of time after admission. Similar to the patterns of hospital  		readmission risks found in <a href="#table12">Table 12</a>, <a href="#table14">Table 14</a> shows an increased proportion of deaths occurring  		within 30 days of hospital admission in 1984 which was offset by a decreased  		proportion of deaths in succeeding intervals of time after admission. In their  		analysis of the total Medicare population, Conklin and Houchens (1987)  		indicated that increases in 30-day mortality after PPS was due exclusively to  		increased case-mix severity of hospital admission. It is likely that this  		general finding is applicable to the subgroup of disabled beneficiaries.  		Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in mortality risks  		between the pre- and post-PPS periods.</p>
<p>We also stratified the hospital admissions by whether Medicare  		post-acute services were received to determine if differences in mortality  		experience between the pre- and post-PPS periods were associated with the use  		of post-acute care. <a href="#table15">Table 15</a> presents the mortality  		patterns of hospital episodes stratified by use of Medicare SNF, Medicare home  		health and no post-acute Medicare services. Of the hospital episodes with a  		subsequent SNF stay, there was a decline in the proportion of deaths for the  		one year observation period. In the short term, 30 days after hospital  		admission, there was an increase in mortality risks from 5.9 percent to 8.0  		percent. 90 days after hospital admission, the mortality risks of hospital  		episodes followed by SNF use decreased from 23.7 percent to 14.2 percent.  		Slight increases in mortality risks were observed for hospital episodes  		followed by HHA care, both in the short term and for the total observation  		period of one year. Virtually no differences were found for the hospital  		episodes that entailed neither SNF nor HHA care following hospitalization.</p>

</tr></table><p><a href="#table15">Table 15</a> also presents, for persons who died, the  		proportion of deaths that occurred within 30 and 90 days in the given type of  		episode. The proportion of deaths occurring in the first 30 days in the  		hospital increased from 75 percent in 1982-83 to 88 percent in 1984-85--a 17  		percent change between the two periods. Statistically significant differences  		at between the .10 and .05 levels were found for this subgroup of deaths.  		Consistent with findings by Conklin and Houchens (1987), a likely explanation  		is that the case-mix of hospital inpatients became more severe after PPS. For  		the HHA episodes slightly more of the deaths in 1984 occurred within 90 days  		while, in SNFs fewer deaths occurred within 90 days. Neither of these changes  		were significant.</p>
<p>Only one of the case mix subgroups was found to have significant  		differences in mortality patterns. The oldest-old had higher short-term  		mortality risks, but overall lower risks of post-hospital deaths. Pre-post life  		table risks of this group reflected those of the overall population in  		<a href="#table14">Table 14</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, we did not find statistically significant changes in  		mortality patterns after hospital admissions (i.e., in hospital and after  		discharge to some other location). Nor were there changes in mortality patterns  		by post-acute care use.</p>
<h2>V. DISCUSSION</h2>
<p>This report presented results from a study to examine the patterns of  		Medicare hospital, skilled nursing facility and home health agency services  		before and after the implementation of the hospital prospective payment system.  		Unlike other studies assessing PPS effects, our study population focused on  		disabled, noninstitutionalized. Medicare beneficiaries, and subgroups among  		them.</p>
<p>In general, our results indicated that while changes in utilization of  		Medicare services occurred, system-wide effects of PPS on outcomes such as  		hospital readmissions and mortality were not evident. For example, we found  		reductions in hospital length of stay after PPS and increased use of HHA  		services. These results are consistent with findings by other researchers  		(DesHarnais, et al., 1987). We found no overall changes in the risks of  		hospital readmission and eventual mortality among Medicare hospital patients.  		The results of our study were consistent with findings by other researchers and  		understandable, in part, in the context of changes in the health care service  		environment surrounding the implementation of Medicare's new payment system for  		hospitals.</p>
<p><b>Hospital Utilization</b>. We found declines in length of hospital  		stays for the disabled elderly population, and that these changes were  		concentrated in certain subgroups. For example, while LOS declined for persons  		with mild disabilities, they remained the same for those with medically acute  		conditions. This result suggests that for some Medicare cases, reductions in  		length of stay could not be achieved in spite of the financial incentives  		offered by PPS.</p>
<p>Our analysis also suggested a reduction in admissions to hospitals after  		the implementation of PPS. While consistent with findings of other researchers  		(Krakauer, 1987, DesHamais, et al., 1987), this result appears to be  		counterintuitive, in light of the incentives of PPS for higher admission rates  		and shorter lengths of stays (Stem and Epstein, 1985). A number of reasons for  		the decline in admission rates have been proposed, including the effects of  		awareness of unprofitable admissions, the increased use of second opinion and  		pre-authorization programs, changes in medical technology and the movement of  		location of services from inpatient to outpatient settings (DesHarnais, et al.,  		1987). Increases in the role of hospital outpatient care, for example, is  		illustrated by the fact that the percent of surgical charges under Medicare  		Part B incurred in hospital outpatient settings has been increasing  		dramatically. One expected result of reductions in hospital admissions, as a  		result of the "channeling effects" would be a more severe case-mix of hospital  		admissions. While we were unable to definitively identify a change in case-mix  		between the pre- and post-PPS periods, our results on shifts in proportion of  		patients across the subgroups and the increased hospital risks of mortality  		within 30 days after admissions would be consistent with this result.</p>
<p><b>Post-Acute Care</b>. Post-hospital use of Medicare skilled nursing  		facilities did not increase, as might be expected in light of PPS incentives to  		substitute post-acute nursing home days for hospital days. However, we were  		unable to determine with our data source if post-acute use of non-Medicare  		nursing home care increased after implementation of PPS. Further research with  		data on Medicare Part B services and service use paid by other sources would  		clarify these alternative scenarios. Our results indicated that the durations  		of stay in Medicare SNFs declined after PPS, although we could not explain  		these results with the data set available for this study.</p>
<p>In contrast to post-acute SNF care, there was a distinct increase in the  		use of home health services that followed hospital discharges as well as  		Medicare SNF discharges. Several reasons can be suggested for the increase in  		HHA use. First, the expected use of post-acute HHA was expected in light of PPS  		incentives to discharge patients to lower levels of care. Second, between 1982  		and 1985, there was a major increase in the availability of HHA services across  		the U.S. For example, the number of home health care agencies participating in  		Medicare increased from 3,600 to 5,900 over this time (Hall and Sangl, 1987).  		Hence, increases in the supply of HHA providers could have contributed  		substantially to the increase in the post-acute HHA services after PPS.</p>
<p><b>Hospital Readmissions</b>. Hospital readmission rates were expected  		to increase after PPS in light of the incentives of PPS for hospitals to  		discharge patients as quickly as possible. Our analysis suggested that the  		overall patterns of hospital readmission risks were not different between the  		one year pre- and post-PPS observation periods. We did find indications of  		increased hospital readmission rates in cases where initiating hospital  		discharges were followed by neither Medicare SNF or HHA use (but possibly  		non-Medicare nursing home care). In addition, a small increase in the rate of  		hospital readmission was suggested by SNF discharges to hospitals for the  		subgroup of severely ADL dependent persons.</p>
<p>The pattern of hospital readmissions that we found, for both the pre-  		and post-PPS periods, were similar to results derived by other researchers at  		other points in time, in spite of differences in methodologies applied to study  		this issue. For example, Krakauer's study found no increase in the rates of  		hospital readmissions between 1983-84 and 1985. This result is analogous to our  		comparison of the 1982-83 and 1984-85 windows. In another study (DesHarnais, et  		al., 1987), statistically significant increases in hospital readmissions were  		also not found. Further analyses would be important to determine the  		circumstances under which specific groups of individuals might have experienced  		increased risks of hospital readmissions.</p>
<p><b>Mortality</b>. We did not find overall changes in mortality among  		hospital patients between pre- and post-PPS periods, although an increased risk  		of mortality was indicated for the short-term (e.g., within 30 days of the  		initiating admission). This result was consistent with those of Krakauer (1987)  		and Conklin and Houchens (1987). Both of those studies indicated that a shift  		to higher mortality risks within 30 days after hospital admission is consistent  		with the increases in case-mix severity after PPS.</p>
<p><b>Subgroups of the Population</b>. In order to differentiate among the  		individuals comprising the disabled noninstitutionalized Medicare population,  		we identified subgroups with Grade of Membership techniques. The  		characteristics of the four subgroups suggested different needs for Medicare  		services and different risks of various outcomes such as hospital readmission  		and mortality. For example, there might have been substitution between hospital  		and SNF care for the mildly disabled, but for the heart and lung disease  		patients, no differences in hospital length of stay was observed. A higher rate  		of other episodes terminating in deaths among the oldest-old suggests that  		Medicare service use changed for this group. A clear interpretation of this  		finding requires, however, a data set that can determine what other services  		and where such individuals were receiving care.</p>
<p>Since our data set contained only Medicare Part A service use records,  		we were not able to determine the relationship between Medicare Part A service  		use and other Medicare service use, such as outpatient care, and non-Medicare  		services, such as nursing home care privately paid or paid by Medicaid. This  		limitation restricted inferences about case-mix changes of hospital admissions,  		because lighter care patients who might have been admitted to inpatient  		hospital care were treated in outpatient facilities instead. This limitation  		affected our analyses of the patterns of no Medicare A service use episodes,  		i.e., "other" episodes.</p>
<p>Our definition of termination status of Medicare hospital, SNF, and HHA  		episodes required coterminous occurrences of two states (e.g., hospital and  		home health care). Hence, post-acute care services that were initiated several  		days after hospital discharge were not measured as hospital transition events.  		Hence, our decision rule probably produced lower rates of post-acute Medicare  		SNF and HHA utilization rates. However, since our objective in this study was  		to measure pre- and post-PPS changes in utilization, the application of a  		uniform definition for both study periods produced comparable measures for the  		two periods.</p>
<h2>VI. CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p>The implementation of a prospective, fixed rate payment system for  		hospitals under Medicare created both a perception that hospital efficiency  		could be improved and concern that incentives for efficiency could result in  		adverse consequences for Medicare beneficiaries. Because of the recent  		introduction of PPS, relatively few evaluation results have been available to  		study its effects on Medicare service use and patients.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to provide empirical information on  		Medicare hospital PPS effects on an important subgroup of Medicare  		beneficiaries, the functionally disabled. Results of our study provided further  		insights on the effects of PPS on utilization patterns and mortality outcomes  		in the two periods of time. Along with other studies, some that have been  		completed while others are being developed, our results are intended to provide  		a better understanding of the changes that result from a landmark change in  		Medicare policies. As these studies are completed, policy makers will have a  		better understanding of the effects of PPS on the provision and outcomes of  		various t3rpes of Medicare as well as non-Medicare services. Of particular  		importance would be improved information on how Medicare beneficiaries might be  		experiencing different locations of services (e.g., increased outpatient care)  		and how such changes affect overall costs per episode of illness. Similarly,  		relatively little information currently exists on the status of patients  		discharged from hospitals in terms of their health status and use of community  		based recuperative and rehabilitative care.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study on the effects of hospital PPS on the  		functionally impaired subgroup of Medicare beneficiaries found expected changes  		in service utilization and no system-wide adverse outcomes. The changes in  		service utilization patterns were expected as a consequence of financial  		incentives provided by PPS. Declines in hospital LOS was expected because of  		the PPS incentive to hospitals to become more efficient. It is important to  		note that for certain subgroups of the disabled elderly, hospital LOS actually  		remained the same before and after implementation of PPS. This finding suggests  		that in spite of the financial incentives, hospitals were unable to reduce LOS  		for certain types of patients. The absence of increased SNF use was surprising,  		but the increase in HHA use was expected. Our study also suggested that quality  		of care, in terms of hospital readmissions and mortality, were not  		systematically affected by PPS. Within the constraints of the data set that was  		assembled for this study, we could find only indications of hospital  		readmission increases for the severely disabled subgroup, but this change was  		only from 23.4 percent to 25.4 percent before and after PPS implementation.  		Overall mortality differences were not found between the two periods, although  		some differences were found in the patterns of mortality by service  		settings.</p>
<p>In general, our results on the impaired elderly are consistent with  		findings from other studies that examined PPS effects on the total Medicare  		population. While PPS affected utilization of Medicare hospital, SNF And HHA  		care, systematic adverse effects of the policy on Medicare beneficiaries were  		not apparent. Further research on the community services, nursing home use and  		other periods of care would be necessary to develop a complete picture of the  		effects of PPS on impaired Medicare beneficiaries.</p>

<p>In the GOM procedure, a person may be described by more than one  		continuously varying case-mix dimension.

<p>Each of the values defined in the model can be given a substantive  		interpretation. The score  		<img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/67926/ppsfig4.gif" /> represents the  		probability predicted by the model that the <i>ith</i> person has a particular  		attribute. The values of <i>g<sub>ik</sub></i> and  		<img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/67926/ppsfig2.gif" /> are selected so that  		the <i>x<sub>ijl</sub></i>, (the observed binary indicator values) and  		<img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/67926/ppsfig4.gif" /> (the predicted  		probability of each indicator) are as close as possible for a given number of  		case-mix dimensions, i.e., for a given vale of <i>K</i>.</p>
<p>The product in (1) involves two types of coefficients. The first type  		are the scores <img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/67926/ppsfig2.gif" />. These  		are the probabilities that person on the <i>kth</i> dimension have response  		level <i>l</i> for variable <i>j</i>. The set of these coefficients describes  		the substantive nature of each of the <i>K</i> analytically defined dimensions  		just as the set of factor loadings in a factor analysis describes the nature of  		the analytically determined factors. Thus, to describe the clinical  		characteristics of each of the <i>K</i> dimensions identified by the procedure,  		we need to determine if the attribute identified by the procedures as fitting a  		dimension are reasonably associated with one another.</p>
<p>A similar criterion (i.e., that the analytically defined groups be  		clinically meaningful) was employed in the creation of the DRG categories by  		using the expert judgment of physician panels. In the GOM analysis, the health  		and functional status variables are used directly in the statistical procedure  		to identify the case-mix dimensions. Of course, the GOM results could also be  		reviewed and modified by expert panels by one of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Changing the distribution of the <i>g<sub>ik</sub></i>'s or altering  		  the <img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/67926/ppsfig2.gif" />'s.</li>
<li>Adding in additional variables to the GOM analysis to help  		  objectively redefine the case-mix dimensions by increasing the scope of  		  measures used in their definition.</li>
</ul><p>The second type of coefficient or score are the <i>g<sub>ik</sub></i>'s.  		These scores describe how close the observed attributes of individual cases are  		to the profile of attributes (i.e., the pattern of  		<img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/67926/ppsfig2.gif" />'s) for each of the  		<i>K</i> case-mix dimensions. This score has the property that it must be  		between 0 and 1.0; and it must sum to 1.0 over the <i>K</i> dimensions for each  		case. As such, they can be used as linear weights to reproduce the observed  		attributes of each person as a composite of parts of the attributes associated  		with each of the <i>K</i> analytically determined profiles.</p>
<p>An important parameter in the analysis is the number of case-mix  		dimensions (i.e., <i>K</i>). Because the coefficients are estimated using  		maximum likelihood procedure (Woodbury and Manton, 1982), the procedure  		provides a statistical criterion for selecting the best value of <i>K</i>. This  		criterion is a <i>X</i><sup>2</sup> value (calculated as twice the change in  		the log-likelihood function) describing the statistical significance of the  		<i>K + l</i> dimension, i.e., whether the  		<img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/67926/ppsfig4.gif" />'s are closer to the  		<i>x<sub>ijl</sub></i>'s than could be expected by chance when the <i>K + l</i>  		group is added. One continues to add dimensions until the <i>K + l</i>  		dimension is no longer significant according to the <i>X</i><sup>2</sup>  		criterion.</p>
