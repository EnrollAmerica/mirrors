<p>At present, there is no uniform Federal policy for financing home care  		services for elderly persons in need of long-term care. Although in 1989, the  		Federal government financed over $4 billion in home care services for the  		disabled elderly, these resources were divided between multiple funding  		sources, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Social Services Block Grant,  		Department of Veterans Affairs' programs, Older Americans Act programs, and  		other funding mechanisms. Eligibility criteria which determine who is eligible  		to receive publicly-financed home care services varies considerably from  		funding source to funding source. To a large extent, these criteria are  		established at the State level, since States have primary responsibility for  		resource allocation decisions under many of these funding mechanisms,  		particularly Medicaid. </p>
<p>In recent years, there have been numerous proposals for establishing a  		uniform Federal benefit for home care services for disabled elderly persons.  		Proposals have included financing expanded home care benefits under Medicare,  		mandating expanded home care coverage under Medicaid; and even the  		establishment of entirely new Federal programs for financing home care. For  		example, the U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, also  		known as The Pepper Commission, has recommended the establishment of a new  		social insurance program for providing home and community-based services to the  		disabled elderly, which although financed entirely with Federal dollars, would  		be administered under contracts with State governments (The Pepper Commission,  		1990). However, the Pepper Commission proposal is but one of a multitude of  		proposals that have been advanced recently for expanding the public sector's  		role in providing home care services to disabled elderly persons. </p>
<p>All of these proposals have had to address a fundamental policy issue:  		which elderly persons with disabilities are to be eligible for  		publicly-financed home care and which are not? Among the elderly population, an  		extremely wide spectrum of disability is evident, from extremely mild forms of  		impairment associated with the aging process to very severe disabilities which  		prevent individuals from living in the community without daily assistance from  		caregivers. Thus, virtually all of the proposals specify eligibility criteria  		for home care benefits based upon some standardized assessment of an  		applicant's disability status. Physical disability is always included as a  		criteria and is typically indicated by the inability of the person to perform  		daily self-maintenance activities--commonly referred to as Activities of Daily  		Living or ADLs. In addition, most proposals also specify criteria that would  		include persons who require human supervision due to cognitive impairment  		problems, most notably Alzheimer's disease, which could result in behavior  		harmful to the disabled person or to others. </p>
<p>While nearly all proposals have been specific about the number of ADL  		disabilities necessary to qualify a person as eligible for services, only a few  		go so far as to define how disability in a specific ADL--bathing, toileting,  		dressing, eating, or transferring--would be measured. For example, does  		impairment mean that the individual is totally incapable of performing the  		activity without human assistance, or does it include those who can usually  		perform the activity but need someone nearby in case help is needed? What about  		people who may be impaired in a specific ADL but who have adapted to their  		impairment by using mechanical aids, such as walkers, raised toilets, special  		shower facilities, grab bars, and so on? Should they also be eligible for  		services? </p>
<p>Without such specificity in defining disability in ADLs, it is difficult  		to make accurate estimates of the number of persons who might be eligible under  		a proposed program. Equally important, without standardized definitions, it is  		extremely difficult, if not impossible, to insure equitable access to services  		among program applicants. </p>
<p>As non-specific as some of the ADL eligibility criteria are in the  		expansion proposals, they are vastly more specific than language pertaining to  		criteria that would establish eligibility for services based on cognitive  		impairments. This lack of specificity regarding cognitive criteria is not  		simply a deficiency in policy development, but also reflects the state of the  		art in measuring, and screening for, cognitive impairment in the elderly  		population. </p>
<p>Proposals for establishing a uniform Federal benefic for home care have  		stimulated research to estimate the number of disabled elderly persons who  		would be eligible for services under alternative proposals. This research  		demonstrates that estimates of program eligibles are very sensitive to  		alternative definitions of disability. For example, Stone and Murtaugh (1990),  		using the 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey, showed that disability estimates  		vary considerably depending upon whether an ADL disability is defined as  		reliance on hands-on assistance only, or whether the definition includes  		stand-by assistance as well. They estimated that 5.9% of the elderly were  		disabled in one or more ADLs when the definition of hands-on assistance was  		invoked, but that 7.8% were disabled when stand-by criteria were included in  		the definition, thereby increasing the size of the "eligible" population by  		about a third. </p>
<p>Other research has demonstrated that estimates of disability are also  		influenced by the specific measures used to assess disability. Wiener and  		Hanley, in work conducted for the Inter-Agency Forum on Aging-Related  		Statistics, highlighted differences in estimates chat result when alternate  		wording is used in designing disability-related survey questions, Even when ADL  		items were "standardized" for comparability, estimates still differed  		considerably across the data sets. Other factors identified as possible causes  		of discrepancies in estimates were: 1) age composition of the elderly  		population in the survey year; 2) sample frame; 3) methods used to collect the  		data; and 4) chance sampling variability (Weiner &amp; Hanley, 1990). </p>
<p>Spector (forthcoming) has further contributed to this body of research  		by showing how estimates of the number of elderly persons with cognitive  		impairments are also highly sensitive to alternative definitions of impairment.  		Spector also developed estimates of the number of elderly who might require  		home care services due to disruptive behaviors such as wandering, pathological  		stealing, or frequent temper tantrums. </p>
<p>This paper extends the work of these researchers by providing a  		<b>series</b> of estimates of the long-term care population using differing  		definitions of disability, including both functional and cognitive criteria.  		Definitions of disability and cut-off points for developing estimates used, in  		this paper were selected on the basis of eligibility criteria invoked in many  		recent legislative proposals. Since nearly all of the proposed legislation has  		focused on the more severely disabled, i.e., those with ADL disabilities or  		cognitive impairments, the estimates derived for this paper focus on this same  		population. We have excluded from our working definition of the long-term care  		population persons with disabilities in the Instrumental Activities of Daily  		Living (IADL) only, such as laundry, meal preparation, grocery shopping,  		housework, chores, etc. Although such individuals may legitimately be included  		in the long-term care population, we have excluded them here since our  		estimates are intended to enumerate those with more severe limitations. </p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the variability in estimates  		of disability in the U.S. elderly population as a function of differing  		definitions of physical disability and cognitive impairment. Differing cut-off  		points along the disability continuum are employed, in conjunction with the  		varied definitions of disability, in order to demonstrate their effect on the  		number and types of persons eligible under a uniform Federal home care benefit.  		</p>
<h2><a name="methods" id="methods">METHODS</a> </h2>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Data from the 1984 National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) were used to  		generate estimates of disability. As part of the NLTCS, indepth interviews were  		conducted of a sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older on April 1,  		1984 who were found to have either an ADL or IADL limitation (Manton, 1988).  		The NLTCS was designed so that national estimates of the elderly physically  		disabled population could be developed on a number of factors, and differs from  		other surveys in that reliable estimates of relatively rare disability events,  		even among the elderly, could be obtained. Information required to develop the  		estimates in this paper draw upon ADL and IADL questions in the survey as well  		as information on sample members' performance an a cognitive impairment  		screening instrument, data on diagnoses, and information on behavior problems.  		</p>
<p>The estimates presented are based on the community resident  		(non-institutionalized) sample of the NLTCS. Estimates have been subjected to a  		weighting procedure whereby cross-sectional weights were applied in order to  		adjust for non-response and the complexities of the sampling design.  		Application of weights results in nationally representative estimates of the  		aged 65+ community-dwelling population. All estimates presented in this paper  		meet precision standards of relative standard errors of 30% or less, and are  		based on unweighted cell sizes of 400 or larger. </p>
<p>Because the estimates derived from the survey reflect the number of  		persons disabled in 1984, we have adjusted 1984 estimates to be consistent with  		1990 population estimates for the aged 65+ population. Adjustments were made by  		multiplying the percent of persons in each of five age groups (65-69: 70-74;  		75-79; 80-84; 85+) in 1984 who were found to be disabled (according to the  		differing criteria) by the estimated community population in each age group in  		1990, subtracting out the estimated 1990 nursing home population.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Functional Disability Measures</h3>
<p>Estimates of disability were developed from specific questions posed to  		NLTCS respondents or their proxies regarding the types of help the respondent  		<b>received</b> in five core ADLs: bathing, dressing, toileting,<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> transferring and eating. Receipt of services  		is used in these analyses as a proxy for disability, with the acknowledgment  		that there may well have been individuals who did not receive services but who  		were in need of them, and who, if an in-depth assessment were conducted, might  		have been determined disabled. The opposite may also be true, i.e. that some  		survey members were receiving assistance but really did not need them, although  		this seems a remote possibility with respect to the basic body maintenance  		activities associated with ADLs. </p>
<p>The NLTCS asked multiple questions about functioning in each of the five  		ADLs. From the myriad of questions asked, we classified NLTCS sample members  		into one of the following four categories: </p>
<ul><li> No Disability </li>
<li> Uses assistive device but receives no human help </li>
<li> Receives stand-by assistance, but no active hands-on help (may or  		  may not also use an assistive device) </li>
<li> Receives active hands-on assistance (may or may not also receive  		  stand-by assistance and/or use an assistive device). </li>
</ul><p>Besides persons who received active human assistance, two other groups  		of individuals were treated <b>as if</b> they received hands-on assistance: (1)  		persons not performing a given ADL at all; and (2) those who reported no  		hands-on assistance and who also did not use any assistive devices in the  		performance of a given ADL, but who said they needed help. </p>
<p>Each ADL was further classified with regard to the duration of the ADL  		problem. If the problem had lasted, or was expected to last, for at least three  		months at the time of the survey interview, we considered the ADL problem to be  		a chronic ADL problem. only chronic disabilities are considered in the  		estimates, as the purpose of the study was to estimate the elderly population  		with chronic or long-term care needs. </p>
<h3>Cognitive Impairment</h3>
<p>The NLTCS was not specifically designed to estimate the number of elders  		with cognitive problems, and thus we were only able to derive cognitive  		impairment estimates for persons who met the functional disability screen for  		the NLTCS sampling frame. However, the NLTCS sampling frame for identifying  		disabled community elders was quite liberal in its definition of disability.  		Any type of assistance, human or mechanical, for any ADL (bathing, dressing,  		toileting transferring, bladder or bowel incontinence, indoor mobility, outdoor  		mobility) or for any IADL (meal preparation, Laundry, light housework, grocery  		shopping, money management, medication management, telephoning) which had  		lasted, or was expected to last for a minimum of 90 days was included in the  		definition. Given the wide net that the NLTCS cast in its sampling frame of the  		elderly disabled, as well as the fact that most cognitively impaired elders can  		expect to have at least some limitation in functioning (IADL or ADL), we are  		fairly confident that elders with cognitive impairments are sufficiently  		represented in the estimates. We do acknowledge, however, that estimates based  		on cognitive impairment criteria in this paper run the risk of underestimating  		the numbers of all elders with cognitive impairment, specifically those who  		have such slight cognitive deficits that they do not experience any limitations  		in any ADLs or IADLs. </p>
<p>Three definitions of cognitive impairment were used to develop  		estimates. The first definition of cognitive impairment includes persons with  		an error score of 4 or more on a modified Short Portable Mental Status  		Questionnaire (SPMSQ), designated as "CI" in the tables below. The SPMSQ is a  		ten-item screening instrument designed to identify elderly persons with  		probable cognitive impairment. The instrument's content includes orientation to  		surroundings, short-term and long-term memory, and mathematical thinking  		(Pfeiffer, 1975). A score of 4 or higher was used to indicate cognitive  		impairment, rather than the customary approach of 5 or higher, because one of  		the SPMSQ questions was altered in the NLTCS, resulting in fewer errors than  		the original item typically elicits. The cut-off point indicating cognitive  		impairment was adjusted downward to accommodate this modification. </p>
<p>There are a number of community respondents in the NLTCS for whom the  		SPMSQ is missing. SPMSQ data is missing for those sample members who were not  		capable of responding to the questionnaire themselves and whose information was  		provided by a proxy respondents in order to identify sample members with  		missing SPMSQ information who were cognitively impaired, alternative criteria  		were developed as indicators of cognitive impairment. If a person with missing  		SPMSQ information was judged to be senile by the respondent's proxy, she/he was  		considered to be cognitively impaired. Also, any person without SPMSQ  		information for whom it was reported that she/he had a disability that was  		caused by disorders classified as mental retardation or senile psychotic  		conditions was also classified as cognitively impaired on the CI variable. This  		first approach for defining cognitive impairment replicates the measure used by  		Spector in his estimates of the cognitively impaired disabled elderly  		(forthcoming). </p>
<p>The second approach to defining cognitive impairment, which seeks to  		operationalize eligibility language from some legislative proposals, includes  		evidence of behavior problems, along with the CI criteria, in the definition of  		cognitive impairment. Some argue for the use of behavior problems in  		determining the need for long-term care services because behavior problems are  		considered to be conditions which require supervision and oversight to insure  		the health and safety of the afflicted person. </p>
<p>Wandering, frequent temper tantrums and compulsive stealing are the  		behavior problems on which the NLTCS collected information, and are therefore  		represented in our behavior problems measure, designated by the acronym "BP".  		Because the NLTCS did not collect information on other types of behavior  		problems besides these three, our results may underestimate the prevalence of  		behavior problems among the elderly. One behavior problem which is notably  		absent from the NLTCS is the "inability to avoid simple dangers". </p>
<p>The third cognitive impairment measure employed in our estimates is more  		stringent than the other two. Under the "CI+" measure, a person must not only  		meet the CI criteria but must also either demonstrate disability in at least  		one ADL (where ADL disability is defined as receiving active or stand-by  		assistance for three months or longer) <b>or</b> one of the  		cognitively-oriented IADLs (money management, medication management,  		telephoning) <b>or</b> exhibit a behavior problem (BP). This particular  		cognitive impairment measure requires that there be evidence of the need for  		oversight or some type of service need before the individual is determined to  		meet the definition of cognitive impairment. The CI+ criteria attempts to  		operationalize language in proposed legislation which stipulates that a person  		with Alzheimer's disease or other cognitive impairments must demonstrate needs  		similar to persons meeting ADL criteria in order to be deemed eligible. The CI+  		criteria operationalizes such criteria by requiring some evidence for the need  		for care beyond a diagnosis or a score on a cognitive impairment screen,  		neither of which may reflect an impairment severe or progressed enough to  		require home care services. </p>
<h2><a name="estimates" id="estimates">ESTIMATES</a> </h2>
<h3>Estimates of the Elderly with ADL Impairments</h3>
<p>Impairments in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) are designated  		eligibility criteria in almost all legislative proposals for expanded Federal  		support of home care. The majority of proposals require that applicants be  		disabled in two or more ADLs to qualify for home care services. The Pepper  		Commission proposal goes one step further by limiting eligibility for home care  		services to persons impaired in three or more ADLs. In doing so, the Pepper  		Commission stated its intent that new Federal resources be targeted to those  		persons with the most severe disabilities (The Pepper Commission, 1990). </p>
<p><a href="#table1">Table 1</a> presents estimates of the number of elders  		in 1990 who would be eligible for home care services if criteria were  		established at 1 or more AOL impairments (1+), two or more (2+), or three or  		more (3+). Estimates are also provided for three different options for defining  		disability in a specific ADL. The first option corresponds to the most narrow  		definition of an ADL disability, whereby a person must rely on hands-on  		(active) human assistance in the performance of an ADL for him/her to be  		considered disabled in that ADL. The second definition of ADL disability is  		somewhat broader than the first in that it includes persons who require  		stand-by assistance only. The third, the most broad definition, adds those who  		use an assistive device but require no human assistance to perform an ADL. </p>
<p>While the receipt or need for active or stand-by help in an ADL almost  		unquestionably signifies the need for assistance, the use of an assistive  		device as sufficient evidence of an ADL disability, as previously discussed, is  		debateable. On the one hand, it could be argued that using an assistive device  		implies some level of disability; without the use of the device the performance  		of the ADL would be difficult at best. On the other hand, it could be argued  		that the use of the device renders the person independent of the assistance of  		another, and therefore not in need of formal home care services. </p>
<p>As shown in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, estimates of the number of  		elderly disabled are very sensitive to the number of ADLs considered as well as  		to the relative restrictiveness of the ADL disability definitions. Under the  		broadest definition of disability (in need of active or stand-by assistance or  		use of an assistive device in at least one ADL) over 12 percent of the  		community-dwelling elderly in 1990 would be considered disabled, about 3.3  		million individuals. Using the same definition of ADL disability (active,  		stand-by or use of an assistive device), estimates of disability (or program  		eligibles) drop to 8.2 percent if 2+ ADL criteria are used, and to 5.2 percent  		if 3+ ADL criteria are invoked. In brief, each additional ADL criteria. reduces  		the estimated disabled population by about 35 percent. </p>
<p>When the most circumscribed definition of disability in a specific ADL  		is used (requires active human assistance), estimates of the disabled  		population are significantly lower, as also shown in <a href="#table1">Table  		1</a>. For example, the number of persons requiring active assistance in 1+ ADL  		is only about half of those who require assistance under the broadest  		definition. At the 2+ and 3+ cut-off points, the differences are even greater.  		The number of persons requiring active assistance in 3+ ADLs is only about 40  		percent of the number of who require assistance in 3+ ADLs under the broadest  		definition. Under the most stringent definition of disability (active human  		assistance required in 3+ ADLs) only about 630,000 elderly meet the definition,  		only about one-sixth the number who meet the broadest definition with the 1+  		cut-off presented in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. </p>
<h3>Estimates by Number of Chronic Heavier Care ADL  		Disabilities</h3>
<p>Recent legislative proposals to establish a uniform Federal home Care  		benefit show more sensitivity to the effects of alternative definitions of  		disability. For example, bills sponsored during the 101st Congress by  		Representative Roybal (H.R. 4093) and Oakar (H.R. 4253) in the House and  		Senator Kennedy (S.2163) in the Senate make the distinction between total and  		partial dependence in ADLs. Under the provisions of these bills, Medicare  		beneficiaries aged 65 and older would have to be either completely dependent in  		one ADL (out of the core five) or partially dependent in two or more ADLs in  		order to be eligible for publicly-financed benefits. In the language of these  		bills, complete dependence generally refers to an individual who does not  		participate at all in the performance of an ADL, and partial dependence to the  		inability to perform the activity without some kind of human assistance or  		supervision. </p>
<p>Even more stringent criteria appear in bills sponsored by Senator  		Rockefeller and Representative Wyden (S. 1942 &amp; H.R. 3933) in which  		Medicaid recipients aged 65 and older, to be eligible for services, would have  		to be unable to perform, without substantial assistance from  		another individual, at least two of the three ADLs of toileting, transferring  		or eating. In this case disability in bathing and/or dressing would not be  		considered at all in the eligibility process. Since research has shown that  		persons tend to lose functioning in the ADLs in an hierarchical, step-wise  		fashion with loss of functioning first occurring in bathing followed by  		dressing, toileting, transferring and eating (Katz et. al, 1963), being  		disabled in toileting, transferring or eating is approximately equivalent to  		being disabled in at least three or more of the core five ADLs. Thus,  		disability criteria which reduce the number and type of ADLs in which a person  		must be impaired usually reflects a more stringent eligibility decision rule.  		</p>
<p>Consequently, <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> presents estimates of the  		number of elderly who would meet more stringent eligibility criteria based on a  		reduced list of ADL impairments, as discussed above. Again, we also use  		alternative definitions of ADL disability, from those that include only persons  		who require active assistance to those which include individuals who use  		assistive devices. </p>
<p>The first two rows of estimates in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> require  		that an individual have at least one or two ADL disabilities of the four  		"heavier care" ADLs of dressing, toileting, transferring and eating (DTTE).  		When compared to estimates presented in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, the  		number of persons disabled in one or more of the heavier care ADLs is  		significantly reduced. This is simply due to the fact that many elderly persons  		require assistance only in the ADL of bathing, and are able to perform other  		ADLs independently. In comparison to <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, it can also  		be seen that employing a more restrictive definition of disability in specific  		ADLs has a more severe effect on reducing estimates of disability than when all  		five ADLs are included. For example, for persons with 2+ ADL limitations of  		DTTE, the number who require active assistance is only about one-third of those  		who require assistance under the broadest definition. </p>
<p>Confining estimates of the elderly disabled to those with impairments in  		toileting, transferring and eating (TTE), as presented in the third and fourth  		rows of <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>, further reduces the eligible population.  		The 2+ ADL of TTE criteria operationalizes eligibility criteria specified in  		the bills sponsored by Congressman Wyden and Senator RockefeLler described  		previously. Depending upon the definition of disability employed, only between  		472,000 and approximately 1.7 million individuals would meet the disability  		criteria specified in these bills.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The final two rows of estimates in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>  		distinguish between ADLs in which the person receives extensive human  		assistance (totally dependent) and where some help is received but the person  		participates at least somewhat in his/her care (partially dependent). We call  		the former Extensive Assistance ADLs (EXT ADL) and the latter Limited  		Assistance ADLs (LIM ADL). These definitions differ slightly from the  		definitions of active or stand-by assistance discussed previously. In general,  		an ADL is defined as an EXT ADL when the person either does not do the activity  		at all, or when it is completely done by another person. A LIM ADL is defined  		as receiving some assistance with the activity--either active or stand-by help  		(or even use of an assistive device when devices are included in the definition  		of disability), but not being totally dependent on another person for the  		performance of the activity. </p>
<p>The criteria of 1+ EXT ADL or 2+ LIM ADL operationalizes the disability  		criteria specified in recent legislation by Senator Kennedy and Representatives  		Okar and Roybal. Interestingly, this set of criteria yields slightly more  		persons eligible than does the 2+ ADL/5 criteria. Between approximately 1.7 and  		2.5 million elders are estimated to meet these criteria, compared to 1.6 to 2.4  		million under the 2+ ADL/5 criteria. If the 1+ EXT ADL or 3+ LIM  		ADL criteria were invoked, somewhat fewer persons than under the 2+ ADL/5  		criteria would meet the requirements, between about 1.5 million and 1.8 million  		persons. </p>
<h3>Estimates that Include Cognitive Impairment in  		Eligibility Criteria</h3>
<p>Eligibility rules which rely exclusively on physical disability criteria  		have been criticized for excluding persons who have the physical capacity to  		perform ADLs, but not the ability to remember when to initiate a task and/or  		those who need supervision or cuing in order to complete a task (Advisory Panel  		on Alzheimer's Disease, 1989). These are typically individuals with Alzheimer's  		disease or a related disorder who are cognitively impaired. Most legislative  		proposals for expanding Federal financing for home care now include criteria  		intended to capture the cognitively impaired in the population targeted for  		services. In <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>, we present a series of estimates  		using different indicators from the NLTCS as proxies for cognitive impairment  		criteria. </p>
<p><a href="#table3">Table 3</a> presents estimates which include cognitive  		as well as ADL criteria in eligibility decision rules. The table is divided  		into three sections (A, B &amp; C), where the definition of an ADL disability  		distinguishes the difference among sections. This format is similar to the  		previous two tables in that an ADL disability in section A is defined as  		receiving active hands-on assistance only, in section B as active or stand-by  		assistance, and in section C as either active assistance, stand-by assistance,  		or the use of an assistive device. There are three sets of estimates in each  		section which correspond to one of the three cognitive impairment measures used  		in the estimation procedure. </p>
<p>For example, in section A there are three different estimates (columns)  		corresponding to the 2+ADL/5" criteria. The first column estimates the  		number of elders who would be eligible for services if the criteria were 2+  		ADL/5 <b>or</b> CI <b>or</b> BP. This decision rule targets individuals with  		either: two or more ADL disabilities (active assistance only) <b>or</b> those  		who are cognitively impaired (according to a score of 4+ on the SPMSQ or who  		have a cognitive impairment-related diagnosis) <b>or</b> those who exhibit one  		or more behavior problems (wandering, frequent temper tantrums, compulsive  		stealing). The rationale for considering those with behavior problems within  		the cognitive impairment group is that behavior problems are considered a proxy  		for cognitive impairment, and that those with behavior problems are thought to  		need oversight and supervision in order to insure their health and safety. </p>
<p>Slightly more than 2 million elders would meet the "2+ ADL/5 (active  		only) <b>or</b> CI <b>or</b> BP" criteria in 1990. Approximately an additional  		one million persons (or 3.5 percent more of the elderly population) would be  		eligible for services if these criteria were used as compared to comparable  		criteria which exclude the cognitively impaired from consideration. Even using  		the most conservative ADL definition criteria, 2+ ADL/5 (active) <b>or</b> CI  		<b>or</b> BP, over an additional one million persons are added to the estimate  		when this particular cognitive impairment criterion is employed. </p>
<p>The CI or BP criteria is the most liberal of the three  		cognitive impairment criteria included in the estimates. Examination of  		<a href="#table3">Table 3</a> indicates that it clearly yields the highest  		estimates of the measures. However, these particular criteria may result in an  		overestimate of the cognitively impaired population because of how the behavior  		problem factor figures into the criteria. For example, under the "2+ ADL/5  		<b>or</b> CI <b>or</b> BP" rule a person without any ADL disabilities, who is  		not considered cognitively impaired by the CI criteria, but who  		compulsively steals would be deemed eligible. A person with this particular  		profile may not be an appropriate candidate for home care services, and  		including such persons in an eligibility pool may results in misspecifying the  		targeted population, even under very liberal targeting policies. </p>
<p>A more conservative approach would be to define cognitive impairment  		solely in terms of evidence of cognitive impairment, for example as  		operationalized by the "CI" criteria. Using this criteria, fewer individuals  		would fall into the eligibility pool. While using the "CI" criteria instead of  		the "CI <b>or</b> BP" criteria does lower the estimates, the decrease is only  		on the order of 0.2 to 0.5 percent, or 60,000 to 150,000 fewer eligible persons  		nationwide, depending upon the exact ADL criteria invoked and the definition of  		disability used. </p>
<p>This approach, though more conservative, is still subject to criticism.  		A score on a cognitive impairment test, or even a diagnosis of Alzheimer's  		disease, does not necessarily correspond to a need for home care. The target  		population for home care services should probably not include persons for whom  		organicity has not yet impeded independent functioning of ADLs or presents no  		threat to the safety of the individual. This criticism has led to the  		suggestion that eligibility for home care services for persons with cognitive  		impairment be linked to more specific evidence of the need for care. The "CI+"  		criteria responds to this suggestion by requiring that eligibility for services  		be evidenced by an SPMSQ score indicating cognitive impairment (or a cognitive  		impairment related diagnosis) <b>and</b> some evidence of the need for care or  		oversight as indicated by either: (1) one or more ADL disabilities; <b>or</b>  		(2) a disability in one of the three cognitively-oriented IADLs of money  		management, medication management, or telephoning; <b>or</b> display of  		behavior problems. </p>
<p>The "CI+" criteria are undoubtedly the most restrictive of the three  		cognitive impairment criteria. For example, 6.8 percent of elderly would be  		service eligible under the 2+ ADL/5 (active) <b>or</b> CI <b>or</b> BP  		criteria, 6.5 percent under 2+ ADL/5 <b>or</b> CI criteria, but only 4.8  		percent under the 2+ ADL/5 <b>or</b> CI+ criteria. Yet this 4.8 percent  		estimate is substantially higher than the same criteria without the cognitive  		impairment component added. This translates into an additional 450,000 eligible  		persons under the 2+ ADL <b>or</b> CI+ criteria who are eligible on cognitive  		impairment criteria component alone. </p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">DISCUSSION</a> </h2>
<p>If legislation were enacted at the Federal level which established  		uniform entitlement to home care services for the elderly based on standardized  		measures of disability, who would be made eligible? In this study, we have  		demonstrated how various eligibility criteria can be operationalized for  		deriving estimates of the disabled elderly population living in the community  		and how these various criteria affect the size of the population that would be  		made eligible for benefits under alternative definitions of disability. The  		objective of the study is to provide guidance to the policy process in the  		consideration of alternative Federal proposals for expanding home care services  		to the disabled elderly. </p>
<p>However, there are some limitations to using these estimates in  		projecting the number of elders who would become eligible for services if a  		home care entitlement program was enacted and implemented. First, it must be  		recognized that these estimates are derived from survey data where incentives  		for respondents to overstate their disabilities are minimal. Unlike a program  		application process, there was no potential benefit available if they did. In  		fact, there is some evidence that survey respondents may underestimate their  		disability levels (Ford et al., 1989). Thus, we would expect some increase in  		self-reported disability if persons were applying for services and knew that  		service-receipt was contingent upon a disability measure. </p>
<p>Second, these estimates are not a true representation of persons  		<b>needing</b> assistance in the various functional activities. The NLTCS did  		not conduct a clinical assessment of sample members, but rather relied on  		self-reports regarding the type of assistance <b>received</b>. In brief, the  		survey did not include efforts to measure unmet need. Even though some survey  		items did allow for measuring some unmet need, the measures were circumscribed  		in that they did not take into account the conceptualization of undermet need.  		The NLTCS does allow us to identify persons not receiving <b>any</b> help  		(human or mechanical) and who say they need help. But the questionnaire did not  		inquire or assess whether adequate assistance was being received. This bias in  		survey methods may have resulted in underestimates of disability as presented  		in this paper. </p>
<p>Third, the number of persons enumerated under the cognitive impairment  		criteria may be slightly underestimated as well. Because the NLTCS was designed  		to provide estimates of the functionally disabled elderly, we were able to  		derive estimates only of the number of cognitively impaired elderly who had  		some kind of functional disability. However, the definition of disability  		employed in the NLTCS sampling frame was inclusive of persons receiving any  		kind of assistance (human or mechanical) in seven IADL or eight ADL items. The  		chances are slim, therefore, that many cognitively impaired elders needing home  		care services were not accounted for in the estimates. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the estimates presented in this paper demonstrate how  		substantially different estimates of the disabled elderly population are  		generated by employing varying definitions of disability. Alternatively relying  		on more stringent or more liberal eligibility criteria for home care services  		will have dramatic effects on the number of elders who would qualify for  		services. The most obvious implication is that the specific eligibility  		criteria employed in legislation to expand Federally- financed home care  		services for the disabled elderly will be major factors in determining the  		ultimate costs of such an expansion. A second implication is that unless the  		eligibility criteria designated in the legislation are specific in their  		definitions of disability, the number of persons who will actually qualify for  		benefits will depend largely upon how the general language of the legislation  		is interpreted in regulatory and administrative procedures during program  		implementation. This could lead to considerable discrepancy between the intent  		of the legislation and its actual implementation. </p>
<p>Definitions of disability using measures of ADL impairment have become  		popular mechanisms for allocating home care resources under proposed Federal  		legislation. However, the need for publicly- financed home care depends upon a  		variety of factors, not just one's level of disability. Financial need is an  		obvious factor, and one that is also built into many legislative initiatives.  		However, it is also true that the elderly adjust to their disabilities through  		a multitude of adaptive behaviors, just as non-elderly persons with  		disabilities do. In addition, the elderly have access to a wide spectrum of  		social support systems which can serve to augment the formal provision of  		services. Given the variety of factors which contribute to the "need" for home  		care, should a Federal entitlement program for home care services based solely  		on standardized measures of disability be implemented? </p>
<p>In any case, it is apparent that the establishment of criteria to  		determine which elderly persons with disabilities should be eligible for  		publicly-funded home care, and which should not, is not a simple matter. In  		this context the question must be raised whether it is possible to enact  		Federal legislation which would ensure that benefits are allocated in an  		equitable manner according to true need. Unlike access to publicly-financed  		acute care services which is determined primarily by physicians, access to  		expanded Federal home care benefits will require policymakers to establish  		relatively specific decision rules about who is eligible for benefits, and who  		is not. </p>
