<hr /><h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This paper presents the Survey of Income and Program Participation  		(SIPP) data on child care for working guardians on AFDC. These guardians use  		care by relatives 58 percent of the time for their youngest children under 6.  		They are thus using informal care arrangements which are generally free or low  		cost instead of more formal arrangements, for which one generally must pay. As  		expected from this pattern of usage, the data show they pay less often for  		child care. In addition, when they do pay, they pay less money than non-AFDC  		recipients, averaging $22.50 per week. Because the sample of working guardians  		on AFDC is very similar to the SIPP's sample of non-working AFDC recipients, we  		may expect that these data can help work/welfare program planners in  		determining child care requirements for new initiatives encouraging AFDC  		recipients to work. Arguments are presented to suggest that about half of new  		program participants will choose relative care, and that the amount  		participants will need to cover their payments for care will be similar to  		current expenditures.</p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The purposes of this paper are twofold. First, we present information  		from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data base about the  		child care arrangements used by working women in the AFDC population. Second,  		we discuss the implications of the information for planning initiatives to  		involve AFDC recipients with preschool aged children in programs combining work  		and the receipt of welfare payments. Women on AFDC with children under age 6  		(in some States under 3) are currently exempt from requirements to work; new  		programs may modify this exemption and assist these women in their transition  		to employment. Work/welfare reforms are planned to serve women with young  		children who are enrolled in the AFDC program, help provide these women with  		work experience, further education and training for employment, and by  		necessity, will include provisions for child care.</p>
<p>The SIPP data can assist work/welfare program planners in predicting the  		forms of care to expect among their client population and the approximate  		amount of money that clients might expect to pay, if the child care market  		place continues to operate much like the present market. Because the SIPP  		supplies information only on current usage, it cannot answer questions about  		the kind of care that <b>should</b> be subsidized, nor will it predict the  		patterns of usage if client choice, licensing requirements, and rules and  		regulations about child care subsidies differ markedly from present State  		practices.</p>
<p>In determining the significance of SIPP information for planning  		purposes, it is important to think about the differences between the AFDC  		mothers in the sample and those who will be affected by the new work/welfare  		initiatives at some future time. First, working AFDC mothers represented in  		this sample were probably voluntarily choosing to work since they were not  		required to by law. This might not be the case under future work/welfare  		proposals. And we do not know how child care usage patterns differ for  		recipients working voluntarily and those required to work. Second, one must  		assume that the market place found in early 1985 and represented by consumer  		preference/choice, child care supply, agency regulations about type of care  		subsidized, and frequency and amount of government subsidy will be similar to  		the market place which will operate under a new work/welfare statute. Third,  		welfare reform initiatives may change the requirement for who must participate  		in school, training, or work and, therefore, who will need child care. New  		initiatives may or may not substantially change the process by which welfare  		agencies subsidize child care or the relative amount of money available to  		subsidize care for the increased number of children. These factors may cause  		future child care usage patterns to differ from present usage. Readers of this  		analysis will have to decide for themselves how well the present will predict  		the future.</p>
<h2>THE SIPP DATA BASE</h2>
<p>The SIPP is sponsored by the Federal Government in order to gather  		longitudinal data on social and demographic characteristics, labor force  		participation, earnings and income, and participation in Federal programs. Each  		sample or "panel" is selected to represent the noninstitutional population of  		the United States. Representative households participate in the study over a  		period of approximately 2½ years, being interviewed every four  		months.</p>
<p>This report concerns the fifth set of interviews of the 1984 Panel which  		began its interviews in the fall of 1983 and ended in the summer of 1986. This  		wave of interviews contained a special topical module on child care which asked  		working guardians about the care arrangements for their youngest three children  		under the age of 15. Its interviews were conducted in January through April of  		1985; for each household, the child care questions concerned the month  		immediately preceding the interview. Thus, the information on child care  		reflects care in the winter months of December 1984 through March 1985.</p>
<p>The child care questions were asked only of guardians who were employed,  		either part-time or full-time during the month preceding the survey. Of the  		total of 606 AFDC recipients who are members of the data base as a whole, only  		95 (15%) are working guardians. <b>Of these, only 50 have Preschool-aged  		children, the group of interest to planners of the work/welfare programs.  		Hence, while these 50 AFDC recipients represent a weighted sample size of  		250,104 people, the small actual sample size means that tests for significance  		are suspect and that it s difficult to subdivide the group for me analyses.  		Conclusions draw from the tables must be qualified. They may not reliably  		predict the behavior of the overall group of working AFDC recipients with  		preschool children.</b> However, they are the only recent national data on  		child care utilization patterns and are worth reporting, even with these  		caveats.</p>
<p>People familiar with AFDC data may find this percentage of working AFDC  		recipients relatively large. Over 15 percent of the SIPP AFDC recipients report  		that they work outside the home. AFDC statistics suggest that only about 6  		percent of recipients are employed. The larger percentage on SIPP may be due to  		a different purpose for its data gathering. SIPP counts anyone who earns money  		outside the home as "working"; it does not inquire about how much you declare  		for tax purposes or whether you declare an income when you talk with an AFDC  		counselor. Its answers are anonymous, so individuals may well be reporting work  		arrangements on SIPP that they do not report to the IRS or AFDC office.</p>
<h2>KIND OF CARE USED BY WORKING AFDC RECIPIENTS</h2>
<p>AFDC recipients are members of lower income groups and do not have much  		money available to pay for child care. Therefore, one would expect that they  		would use the kinds of care that are less often paid for, such as care by  		relatives, rather than care by nonrelatives in either a family day care home or  		a day care center. (Note that these hypotheses simply discuss usage patterns,  		they are not meant to predict unconstrained preferences of recipients nor to  		suggest that one kind of care is of a higher quality than another.)</p>
<p>The data seem to support these hypotheses. <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>  		displays the patterns of use of child care by three groups of SIPP families:  		those who are now receiving AFDC; those who were at one time on AFDC, but are  		no longer receiving benefits; and those who have never been on AFDC. Only data  		concerning the youngest child under the age of 6 are shown since this is the  		population of greatest concern to those planning welfare reform initiatives. It  		is already mandatory for families with older children to participate in such  		programs.</p>
<p>There are several sizeable differences in usage patterns among these  		groups. Specifically, current AFDC recipients are using much more in-home care  		by grandmothers and other relatives and less care by staff in centers or  		preschoools than non-recipients. They are also using less care by members of  		the child's own family (basically, the parents).</p>

</ol></td>
</tr></table><p>These results are intuitively reasonable. In terms of care by parents,  		we know that relatively fewer fathers are available as caregivers to AFDC  		mothers than to non-AFDC mothers since AFDC recipients are predominantly single  		female heads of households. The less frequent use of center care or preschools  		may be because AFDC mothers have more trouble paying the fees generally  		required for center care, unless it is subsidized by the welfare agency. On the  		other hand, many AFDC recipients do have parents or other relatives who can  		supply them with child care at no or modest cost. They seem to use the care  		that is available and affordable.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors that differentiate AFDC mothers from other  		mothers. These factors may contribute to differences in the kind of care used.  		We expect, for example, that AFDC mothers work part-time (under 35 hours) more  		than other mothers. Many work under 20 hours a week. Previous analyses of child  		care data show that usage patterns for part-time and full-time working  		guardians differ (Brush, 1987): part-time workers make more use of informal  		family care -- father care for all ages of preschool children and grandmother  		care for infants; full-time workers more often use nonrelative and center care.  		AFDC mothers' use of care by relatives may be at least partially related to a  		higher percentage of part-time employment among these mothers.</p>
<p><a href="#table2">Table 2</a> substantiates this expectation. It shows  		the percentages of the sample who work part-time (under 20 hours a week),  		part-time from 20 to 34 hours, and full-time or over 34 hours. Working  		guardians in the AFDC population are significantly more likely to work  		part-time (under 35 hours) than full-time, and they are more frequently working  		part-time than members of the group once on AFDC or the group who have never  		been on AFDC (X<sup>2</sup>=28.33, df=4, p&lt;.001). So, one would expect their  		usage patterns to reflect those of part-time workers, specifically, that they  		would use more care by relatives and less care by family day care providers and  		by centers.</p>

</tr></table><p>To see if the AFDC population differs from others in choice of care,  		<b>controlling for the hours the guardian works</b>, we have constructed the  		three parts of Table 3. <a href="#table3A">Part A</a> looks explicitly at  		guardians who work under 20 hours a week; <a href="#table3B">Part B</a> shows  		the results for guardians working 20 to 34 hours per week; <a href="#table3C">Part C</a> displays data for those working over 34 hours.

</tr></table><p><a href="#table3C">Part C</a> suggests that the results for care by  		other relatives hold even among full-time workers, though here the differences  		in care by parents or grandmother are less extreme. Parent care is still  		somewhat less frequent among AFDC recipients (12% versus 24% for those no  		longer on AFDC or 14% for those never on AFDC). Grandmother care is somewhat  		more frequent (18% versus 6% versus 15%). Care in centers is also somewhat less  		frequent than for the comparison groups (29% versus 41% or 37%). Therefore, we  		conclude that the use of care by relatives is <b>not</b> explained simply by  		the shorter work schedules of AFDC compared to non-AFDC working guardians.  		Regardless of their hours of work, AFDC recipients use more care by  		grandmothers and other relatives than do non-AFDC guardians.</p>
<p>The population of AFDC working guardians differs from those not on AFDC  		on a number of other variables that suggest that this population would use more  		grandmother care and less care by fathers, centers, and nonrelatives (see  		Brush, 1987 for details). The AFDC group contains a higher percentage of  		guardians who are:</p>
<ul><li>single or not currently living with a spouse (X<sup>2</sup>=283.16,  		  df=4, p&lt;.001) ;</li>
<li>under the age of 25 (X<sup>2</sup>=38.20, df=4, p&lt;.001);</li>
<li>Black (X<sup>2</sup>=76.89, df=4, p&lt;.001);</li>
<li>working in service occupations X<sup>2</sup>=71.60, df=8, p&lt;.001);  		  and</li>
<li>who have a family income under $12,000 per year  		  (X<sup>2</sup>=322.10, df=6, p&lt;.001).</li>
</ul><p>All other things being equal, members of these groups (except those in  		service occupations) were found to use more grandmother care than nonmembers,  		so it is not surprising that AFDC recipients also use more grandmother care.  		Single mothers use <b>less</b> father care; so do AFDC recipients. However, the  		patterns of results for center and nonrelative care are not as consistent.  		Black guardians use center care somewhat <b>more</b> frequently; guardians in  		service occupations and those in lower income families use center care somewhat  		<b>less</b>. Single parents use nonrelative care <b>more</b> frequently; lower  		income families use it <b>less</b>. The lower income status of the AFDC  		population may be more important in influencing type of care used than race and  		occupational group, resulting in the less frequent use of care by nonrelatives  		and centers among AFDC families.</p>
<p>Thus, whether one looks at differences in choice of child care by a  		family's AFDC status or by the specific descriptors of marital status, age,  		race or occupation of guardian, and family income, the results are similar. The  		data show that care by relatives other than the child's parents is a very  		frequent phenomenon among the AFDC population. All relatives (father, mother  		sibling, grandmother, and other relatives) care for 58 percent of the youngest  		children under 6 compared to 44 percent for guardians never on AFDC (see  		<a href="#table1">Table 1</a>).</p>
<p>For planners of work/welfare programs, this number may be meaningful in  		predicting the percentage of children needing more formal market care. However,  		data from the earlier Brush paper suggest that it may be an overestimate for  		the following reasons:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Young mothers (those under age 25) are over-represented in the AFDC  			 group. They may well have additional children in the future. As the number of  			 children in a family increases, data from the population of all working  			 guardians suggests that relatives are less likely to be used as caregivers.  			 Children may then be cared for by nonrelatives in a day care home or  			 center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The earlier paper also suggested that care by relatives is more  			 frequently used with infants and toddlers, but when children reach the ages of  			 3 and 4, many parents opt for center care, if they have a choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SIPP data on child care only discuss <b>usage</b>, not  			 unconstrained choice. It may be that some mothers who are using relatives would  			 prefer, for example, a family day care home for their toddlers or a center for  			 their older preschoolers. If a work/welfare program provides more choice, AFDC  			 recipients may choose relatives less often than presently indicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, although 58 percent of AFDC recipients use care by  			 relatives and, in general, relatives are paid for care less often than  			 nonrelatives and centers, we cannot assume that all 58 percent are unpaid or  			 that relatives do not require payment. Unfortunately, the SIPP data base does  			 not allow the relating of kind of care and cost of care, so we cannot specify  			 how many relatives are paid or how much they are paid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children aged 6 and above may need to be provided with care if the  			 AFDC mother works full-time or works a shift outside of school hours. Such care  			 is not included in the tables shown above.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Thus, we can probably rely on a frequent usage of relatives as  		caregivers by working AFDC recipients, though the prediction of percentage of  		families using relatives would perhaps be more realistic if it were viewed as  		"about half". If families are offered greater choice in child care, we should  		expect an increased use of centers for older preschoolers. If larger families  		are included, we may find fewer relatives used as caregivers and more use of  		family day care homes. (Such homes may take two or three children from the same  		family, allowing the mother to simplify child care arrangements. Her  		school-aged children could come to the home after school hours and join the  		younger children.)</p>
<p>In the next section we discuss the SIPP data on who pays for care,  		trying to clarify the degree to which the AFDC group must spend their own  		resources on child care. Please note that the information on payment only  		concerns the money that the guardian has paid for care and does not include any  		subsidies.</p>
<h2>PAYMENT FOR CHILD CARE</h2>
<p><a href="#table4">Table 4</a> summarizes information on who pays for  		care. It suggests that about half of the families in this country with children  		under 6 pay for their child care<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> and that there are significant differences in  		the percentage who pay across the variable of AFDC status (X<sup>2</sup>=7.14,  		df=2, p&lt;.05). Those currently on AFDC pay cash for care 40 percent of the  		time; those who were once on AFDC, but are not currently, pay 49 percent of the  		time; those who have never been on AFDC pay for care 53 percent of the  		time.</p>

</ol></td>
</tr></table><p>Data from the earlier Brush paper reinforce these findings. That is,  		several variables which were shown in that paper to predict who pays for care  		are also variables which differentiate AFDC recipients from other working  		guardians. For example, mothers who work part-time, those in service  		occupations and those with lower incomes pay for care less often than the  		comparison groups. AFDC recipients frequently appear in these categories. So,  		from these individual descriptors of working guardians as well as from the  		comparison of AFDC recipients versus non-recipients, we see that the population  		of interest is less likely to pay for child care.</p>
<p>In addition to differences in whether or not care is paid for, there are  		significant differences in the median amount of money paid for care. The median  		for those currently on AFDC is $22.50 per week, but it is $40 per week for both  		other groups. The highest amount paid by any family now receiving AFDC  		assistance is $45, while 25 percent of families not on AFDC pay $50 or more a  		week. So, a lower percentage of AFDC families pay for care and, when they do  		pay, they pay a smaller total amount than non-AFDC families.</p>
<p>The fact that they pay a smaller amount could well be because AFDC  		guardians work fewer hours than non-AFDC recipients and therefore pay for fewer  		hours of child care. Unfortunately, we cannot check on differences in the per  		hour cost of care because the SIPP does not connect data on care of an  		individual child with data on payment for care. Thus, if there is more than one  		child in a family, we do not know if care for all children is paid for or care  		for only one. If there are multiple kinds of care for an individual child, we  		do not know which care is paid for. So, we may assume that a part of the reason  		AFDC recipients pay less money for care is that they are working fewer hours,  		but we cannot analyze the exact difference in cost per hour of child care.</p>
<p>A second reason that AFDC recipients pay less money for care may be that  		their child care is subsidized. SIPP data only reflect the amount of money  		parents pay, not the total cost of their child care or the amount of any child  		care subsidy.</p>
<p>These caveats on costs per hour of care do not preclude making  		inferences helpful to work/welfare planners. These numbers may still assist in  		predicting families' requests for 18 money for care, if we make two  		assumptions: that newly employed AFDC guardians will reflect about the same  		percentage of part-time employees as the AFDC recipients represented currently  		in SIPP; and that about the same amount of subsidized care will be available to  		newly employed families. Assuming that about 40 percent of new program  		participants will pay for care at an average of $22.50 per week, an overall  		average of $9 per week per recipient seems to be a reasonable estimate.</p>
<h2>USING THE WORKING AFDC POPULATION TO PREDICT CARE FOR THE NON-WORKING  		AFDC POPULATION</h2>
<p>The conclusions presented above on the approximate percentage of  		work/welfare program recipients who would use care by relatives and who would  		pay for care are predicated on the assumption that the group of AFDC recipients  		currently employed is very similar to the group that would be working under new  		work/welfare programs, and, as stated earlier, that the rules of welfare and  		the market place will not change between the time this sample was taken and the  		time work/welfare initiatives take place. Such similarity would allow us to  		assume that the child care choices of the non-working AFDC group, when they are  		required to work, might have the same pattern as currently exists for AFDC  		recipients who are now working. To test that hypothesis, we have done two  		further analyses of the SIPP data. First, we have compared all working and  		non-working AFDC recipients on available descriptive variables to see how they  		differ on factors which might influence choice of child care or payment for  		care. Second, we have examined the members of the households of non-working  		AFDC recipients to see if there are other adults available to serve as child  		care providers.</p>
<p><a href="#table5">Table 5</a> shows the comparison of working and  		non-working AFDC recipients in sipp. Using X<sup>2</sup> tests of unweighted  		data, we found significant differences on only three of the descriptors: level  		of education of guardian (X<sup>2</sup>=17.01, df=4, p&lt;.001), family income  		(X<sup>2</sup>=10.88, df=3, p&lt;.05), and living in a metropolitan area  		(X<sup>2</sup>=4.95, df=l, p&lt;.05). Working AFDC recipients are more  		frequently in the higher education categories, have higher family incomes, and  		are less often living in metropolitan areas than non-working recipients.</p>
<p>The earlier paper suggested that there were some differences in choice  		of care depending on the variables of education, income and city size. Mothers  		with advanced degrees tend to use less father care than mothers with high  		school diplomas; families in the higher income groups use less grandmother care  		and more care by nonrelatives and in centers than families in lower income  		groups; families in metropolitan areas used more center care than families  		outside of cities. However, these differences for working guardians in general  		may not be relevant to the comparison of working and non-working AFDC mothers.  		The difference among AFDC recipients in guardian education is largely due to  		the difference in those who ended their educations with grade school. The  		difference is not in the percentage with advanced degrees. So, the finding  		about differences in level of education among AFDC recipients does not imply  		that their choices of care will differ.</p>

</tr></table><p>Similarly, the differences in the two groups on income are not  		sufficiently extreme to suggest differences in child care usage. The working  		AFDC group has fewer members in the lowest income category than expected, and a  		few more in each of the higher income categories. But, in general, they are not  		a "high income" group and cannot be said to use child care in the same way that  		the general population with high incomes might elect care.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the significant difference between working and  		non-working AFDC recipients with regard to residence in cities may well mean  		that non-working recipients will use a somewhat different pattern of child care  		when they are employed. The SIPP analysis showed that more city residents use  		center care; the analysis of working AFDC recipients showed that relatively few  		use center care. A work/welfare population concentrated in metropolitan areas  		might be expected to use more center care than is true of the present set of  		AFDC working guardians.</p>
<p>So the first analysis of the appropriateness of making conclusions for  		work/welfare programs from the working AFDC population suggests that the groups  		differ in only minor ways, and that observations from the working AFDC  		population may be useful in predicting the behavior of the nonworking  		population, when they are gainfully employed. The only difference in kind of  		child care elected by the AFDC group currently not working may be an increased  		choice of center care due to the higher concentration of this group in cities  		where center care may be available.</p>
<p>The addressing of one caveat is in order here. The variables which are  		measured in SIPP and considered in these analyses describe observable  		characteristics of working guardians and their families. They do not include  		measures of such potentially relevant variables as motivation to work. We do  		not know if there are critical differences in motivation which might be related  		to choice of care. Are women who choose to work more likely to recruit  		relatives as caregivers whereas women who are required to work by a  		work/welfare program are more likely to use family day care homes or centers?  		The data cannot answer these questions.</p>
<p>The second analysis of the working and non-working AFDC recipients  		sought to describe the family members who might be available to care for  		children, should the recipient become employed. Though we do not have records  		of relatives living outside the household, we do know about other adults in the  		household. So, we searched the records of all household members to locate any  		individual over 18 years of age who was not in school or training and not  		currently employed to identify adults who might provide child care.</p>

</tr></table><p><a href="#table6">Table 6</a> shows the results. There are a substantial  		number of recipients for whom another adult is available for child care. A  		total of 29 percent have some other adult in the household (a spouse, relative  		or nonrelative) who is not in school or employed. This 29 percent can be  		further specified by gender: 24 percent of non-working recipients have at least  		one other female adult in the household; 5 percent have at least one other  		adult and all are male. However, it would appear that about one of every four  		non-working AFDC recipients has at least one other adult potentially available  		for child care. This is approximately the same percentage as in those AFDC  		households where the guardian is working. Therefore, it would appear that those  		who are presently working are not doing so solely because they have greater  		availability of relatives in their households.</p>
<p>Two sets of conclusions seem to follow from these data. First, it would  		appear that the working AFDC population is not substantially different from the  		non-working population, at least on the measures reported here from SIPP. So  		there is support for concluding that the usage patterns of child care for those  		currently non-working would follow the patterns of those now working. Second,  		there is considerable support for the notion that relatives are available to  		the non-working AFDC group to serve as child care providers, should these AFDC  		recipients go to work. At least, relatives are available to the same extent as  		is true for working recipients. When non-working recipients do begin work, they  		may not use as high a percentage of relative care as those recipients who are  		currently working because those presently working may receive subsidized care  		somewhat less frequently. Recipients now voluntarily working must search out  		free care where ever it is available, and probably use more care by relatives  		than they would if they had more options. So, one might expect that non-working  		AFDC recipients, when employed through a work/welfare program, would use care  		by relatives a substantial percent of the time, but possibly less than the 58  		percent quoted for recipients currently employed. For costing purposes, working  		estimates of the percent of newly employed recipients who will use care by  		relatives can vary, depending on the degree of conservatism preferred.</p>
<h2>POLICY IMPLICATIONS</h2>
<p>The SIPP data has provided some useful information for work/welfare  		planners, although it must be accepted with caution because of the small sample  		of working AFDC recipients using child care. Under the assumptions that child  		care provided for children under 6 will be the most crucial support service  		issue, the following comments may be made:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>The kinds of child care elected by current non-working AFDC  			 recipients could well follow the pattern set by working AFDC recipients. Care  			 by relatives will predominate, used by about one-half of participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For those new program participants who will pay for care, the amount  			 paid will be modest, probably averaging about $25 per week.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>There are, of course, policy decisions which could modify the present  		pattern of child care usage. For example, if policy makers wished to set  		standards and/or promote certain types of child care, they might require that  		all subsidized care for AFDC children with working mothers be licensed. In this  		instance, it is likely that the percentage of care by relatives would decrease  		dramatically while center care and nonrelative care would increase.</p>
<p>The SIPP data concern child care currently used by families, not  		necessarily the care that would be chosen, if increased or more frequent  		subsidies for child care were provided. If families enter a work/welfare  		program, they may well choose more 26 center care for older pre-schoolers (and  		even for elementary school children after the end of the school day). In both  		of these cases (a requirement for licensed care and increased subsidy), the  		expectation would be that the unit cost of care would increase. If relatively  		more funds are made available to AFDC families under a work/welfare initiative  		than were available to this sample in 1985, then we might expect more use of  		center care.</p>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
<ol><li>
<p><a name="note1" id="note1">In</a> comparison, only 30 percent of working  			 guardians with children of <b>all</b> ages in the SIPP population pay for care  			 (Brush, 1987), a number considerably less than the percentage cited here. The  			 major reason is that the group of households shown on <a href="#table4">Table  			 4</a> contains only those families with children under 6. These families pay  			 for care much more often than families with older children.</p>
