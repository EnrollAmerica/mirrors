</blockquote>
<hr /><p>One prominent response of hospitals to the necessity of controlling  		costs under the Prospective Payment System (PPS) has been to reduce lengths of  		stay. Since the introduction of PPS, patients are now more ill on average when  		they are discharged from hospitals, and thus probably require more health and  		personal care services upon discharge.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of PPS, extensive concern has been expressed--by  		both the public and the Secretary of Health and Human Services and other senior  		officials of the Department--about the adequacy of post-hospital care for  		elderly patients discharged to the community. Moreover, Congress has mandated  		that information on the quality of post-hospital care by included in the  		Department's annual reports to Congress on PPS.</p>
<p>The current evidence on the adequacy of post-hospital community care is  		largely impressionistic. A systematic assessment is required to develop  		objective evidence on the extent of the problems associated with post-hospital  		care and whether they lead to adverse health outcomes for patients.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the methodology available up to now has not been adequate  		to support a systematic assessment of national scope. The primary limitation of  		the available methodology is that adequacy-of-care assessments have required a  		review of individual cases by physicians, which is difficult to implement in a  		national study and which has been found to be unreliable. This report describes  		a new methodology developed to overcome these limitations and to guide a  		systematic, national assessment of both the adequacy of community post-hospital  		care for elderly Medicare patients and whether inadequate care leads to adverse  		health outcomes. Central to this methodology is a series of "guidelines"which  		specify the amount of care that is minimally adequate to prevent adverse health  		outcomes for patients who exhibit a wide variety of conditions that commonly  		require post-hospital community care.</p>
<p>This methodology has been implemented in a pilot study. Based on an  		analysis of pilot study data, this report assesses the validity, effectiveness,  		and feasibility of the new methodology. The conclusion of this assessment is  		that the methodology is generally valid, feasible, and effective, although some  		refinements are required. With respect to the guidelines, conclusion is that  		(taken as a group) the guidelines provide a reasonable definition of minimally  		adequate post-hospital community care.</p>
<p>The pilot study results must be considered preliminary. The pilot study  		was limited only to nine hospitals in two States. In addition, the pilot study  		encountered a substantial amount of missing data, and some of the estimates are  		sensitive to the assumptions made about missing data.</p>
<p>Figures 1 and 2 depict the pilot study results on access to adequate  		post-hospital community care. The results indicate that most 74-80 percent with  		a midpoint of 77 percent) of the post-hospital community care needs under the  		guidelines were met, although a substantial minority, or even a majority, of  		patients (43-55 percent with a midpoint of 49 percent) experienced care that  		did not meet one or more of the guidelines applicable to them.<font size="-2"><a href="#note1">1</a></font> The great majority (87 percent) of care  		needs that were not met involved skilled care, and about half of the patients  		who experienced care that did not meet the guidelines were not seen in the two  		weeks after hospital discharge by the type of health care professional  		appropriate to their care needs.</p>
<p>Figure 3 depicts the pilot study results on adverse outcomes. A minority  		of Medicare patients (13-23 percent with a midpoint of 18 percent) suffered  		adverse outcomes that may be associated with inadequate post-hospital community  		care. Most (80 percent) of these outcomes involved morbidities rather than an  		unexpected use of health care services. While not trivial, outcomes that do not  		involve unexpected service use are generally less serious than those that do  		involve such use.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>A. THE METHODOLOGY</h2>
<p>As indicated above, the guidelines are central to the new methodology  		for measuring the adequacy of post-hospital community care for the elderly. A  		number of clinicians with extensive experience in post-hospital community care  		helped develop the guidelines. Draft guidelines developed in conjunction with  		the staff of the Geriatrics Section of Boston University Medical Center were  		reviewed by a consensus panel of distinguished clinicians. The guidelines were  		revised on the basis of the panel's comments and pretested for a sample of  		patients recently discharged from the hospital. They were again revised on the  		basis of the results of the pretest, and were reviewed by the consensus panel  		prior to their application in the pilot study.</p>
<p>Guidelines were developed for 45 distinct conditions (many of which  		encompass subconditions). Information on medical condition, procedures  		performed in the hospital, functioning, the availability of informal caregivers  		(typically family members), and instruction provided in the hospital was used  		to determine which of the conditions covered by the guidelines were applicable  		to a given patient. (Multiple guidelines may apply to the same patient.) The  		guidelines cover both skilled care (primarily nursing and therapy) and  		semi/unskilled care (primarily personal care) that are needed in the immediate  		post-discharge period (defined as the two weeks following discharge) by elderly  		Medicare patients discharged to the community. Care provided in patients' homes  		and in physicians' offices and clinics is included. The guidelines for skilled  		care specify both the minimum number of professional visits necessary in the  		two weeks after discharge to prevent adverse outcomes and the latest acceptable  		day (relative to discharge) of the initial professional visit. The guidelines  		for semi/unskilled care typically specify the frequency with which care must be  		provided (e.g., the number of times a day) to prevent adverse outcomes. The  		guidelines for each condition includes a list of adverse health outcomes that  		are clinically associated with inadequate care for that condition. (The  		guidelines appear as Appendix A to this report.)</p>
<p>In addition to the guidelines, the methodology also includes screening  		procedures to identify patients with one or more of the conditions covered by  		the guidelines, as well as risk classification procedures to identify patients  		at high risk of experiencing care that does not meet the guidelines and of  		suffering adverse outcomes. The screening procedures rely chiefly on  		information on medical condition, procedures performed in the hospital, and  		functioning. The risk classification procedures rely on information on the  		patient's living arrangements, the availability of formal and informal care,  		the exhaustion of informal caregivers, the receipt of discharge planning, the  		severity of impairment, the severity of illness, and age. High-risk patients  		are oversampled relative to their proportion in the population, so as to obtain  		a sufficient sample of patients who actually experience care that does not meet  		the guidelines and who suffer adverse outcomes to permit investigating their  		relationship.</p>
<p>An extensive data collection effort was required to obtain the data  		necessary for applying the screening and risk classification procedures and the  		guidelines. The data were derived from two primary sources: (1) hospital  		medical records; and (2) interviews with patients and their caregivers  		conducted two and six weeks after hospital discharge. Information for screening  		and risk classification was obtained from the summary sheet of medical records  		and from screening interviews conducted two weeks after discharge. The detailed  		information on the patient's condition necessary for determining which  		guidelines applied to him or her was abstracted from the full hospital medical  		record. Information on service receipt in the two weeks after discharge was  		collected in the full interview at two weeks, and information on adverse  		outcomes was collected in full interviews at two and six weeks. Services  		received were compared with the guideline specifications to determine whether  		the patient experienced care that did not meet guidelines.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>B. TESTING AND REFINING THIS METHODOLOGY</h2>
<p>The purpose of pilot study was to test the validity of the guidelines,  		the effectiveness of the screening and risk classification procedures, and the  		feasibility of the data collection strategy. The pilot study was also designed  		to identify any necessary refinements to the methodology to be implemented  		before a national study is to be undertaken.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">1. The Guidelines</h3>
<p>Three analyses were undertaken to test the validity of the guidelines  		and to identify refinements to them:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>a comparison of care ordered at the time of hospital discharge with  			 care specified under the guidelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a clinical review of 100 pilot study cases </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a statistical analysis of the likelihood of adverse outcomes when  			 care met and did not meet the guidelines.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In the remainder of this section, we summarize the results of each of  		these analyses.</p>
<p>The hypothesis underlying the analysis of the likelihood of adverse  		outcomes is that adverse outcomes will be substantially more likely when care  		does not meet the guidelines than when if does, if the guidelines (taken as a  		group) provide valid specifications of minimally adequate care. This is what we  		observed. When we corrected a measurement problem involving two outcomes, we  		estimated large differences in the likelihood of adverse outcomes when care  		meets and does not meet the guidelines. We estimated that adverse outcomes are  		four and one-half time as likely when care does not meet the semi/unskilled  		guidelines and twice as likely when care does not meet the skilled care  		guidelines (relative to the likelihood when care meets the guidelines). For all  		the guidelines combined, we estimated that adverse outcomes are about three  		times as likely when care meets the guidelines than when it does not. Figure 4  		depicts these results. The estimated differences in the likelihood of adverse  		outcomes are statistically significant for all guidelines and the skilled care  		guidelines, and approach significance for all guidelines and the skilled care  		guidelines, and approach significance for the semi/unskilled guidelines.  		Further, when we relaxed or tightened the specifications of the guidelines, we  		obtained less reasonable results: we estimated that the effect of inadequate  		care was to <b>reduce</b> adverse outcomes. This finding is encouraging, in  		that it appears to suggest that the guideline standards are neither too relaxed  		nor too tight. However, these results also indicate that changes in the  		standards for one guideline (the guideline on medication supervision) can have  		a dramatic effect on estimates of the likelihood of adverse outcomes.</p>
<p>Two hypotheses underlie the comparison of care ordered at the time of  		hospital discharge with the care specified under the guidelines. First, if the  		guidelines cover all types of care commonly provided to elderly patients in the  		community, we will observe relatively few patients with orders for care to whom  		no guidelines are applicable. Second, if the guidelines specify minimally  		adequate care, the amount of care specified under the guidelines will not  		exceed the amount ordered. Both hypotheses were confirmed. At least one skilled  		guideline was applicable to about 89 percent of the patients with orders for  		nursing or therapy, and to about 80 percent of the patients with orders for  		follow-up physician care in the two weeks following discharge. The amount of  		care specified under the guidelines never exceeded the amount ordered. A review  		of the cases in which care was ordered but no guidelines was applicable  		indicates that several existing guidelines must be defined, but major revisions  		are unnecessary.</p>
<p>Because the primary purpose of the clinical review was to identify cases  		that needed refining, the sample of cases chosen for review was selected  		deliberately to include cases in which the guidelines were most likely to be  		problematic (e.g., cases in which the patient experienced care that met the  		guidelines but suffered an adverse outcome). Despite the nature of the sample,  		the clinicians who conducted the review concluded that, in general, the  		guideline standards were clinically sound. However, they did suggest  		refinements to the guidelines and to the procedures for applying them.</p>
<p>While the analysis of the guidelines supports their validity, it also  		suggests a number of refinements to them. Many of the suggested refinements are  		relatively trivial (e.g., the inclusion of additional adverse outcomes); others  		call for subdividing the existing guidelines so that different care may be  		specified for the subdivisions. For example, one suggested refinement entails  		subdividing the guideline on diabetic care for patients with and without  		informal caregivers, with more care specified for the patients with informal  		caregivers. We recommend that the refinements be reviewed by a clinical  		consensus panel.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">2. The Effectiveness of Screening and Risk  		Classification Procedures</h3>
<p>The analysis of the effectiveness of the screening procedures compared  		the need for care according to these procedures with the need for care  		according the guidelines to determine the extent to which patients to whom at  		least one guideline applied were incorrectly screened out and, conversely, the  		extent to which patients to whom no guidelines applied were incorrectly  		screened in. The guidelines cover a broad scope of care, and at least one  		guideline was applicable to the vast majority (94 percent) of elderly Medicare  		patients discharged from the hospital to the community. The screening  		procedures correctly identified almost all of the patients (97 percent) to whom  		at least one guideline was applicable. However, the screening procedures were  		not effective at identifying patients who <b>did not</b> need care under the  		guidelines. At least one guideline was applicable to about 60 percent of a  		small sample of cases that had been screened out as not needing care under the  		guidelines. While these cases represent only a small portion (about 6 percent)  		of the patients who needed care, refinements to the screening procedures would  		be desirable. A review of the cases that were incorrectly screened out suggests  		that the effectiveness of the screening procedures could be improved  		substantially by adding items on laboratory testing, follow-up physician care,  		and specific personal care activities. With these additional items, we estimate  		that the guidelines would be applicable to fewer than a quarter of the patients  		screened out as not needing care, and that the patients who were incorrectly  		screened out as not needing care, and that the patients who were incorrectly  		screened out would comprise no more than 2 percent of the Medicare patients who  		need post-hospital community care.</p>
<p>The analysis of the risk classification procedures compared the  		incidence of care that did not meet the guidelines and adverse outcomes for  		patients at high risk and patients <b>not</b> at high risk to determine whether  		patients at high risk exhibited a higher incidence of care that did not meet  		the guidelines and of adverse outcomes relative to those not at high risk. We  		observed such a difference. About 29 percent of the patients in the high-risk  		group experienced care that did not meet the guidelines and suffered adverse  		outcomes, compared with about 12 percent of the patients not in the high-risk  		group. When we considered care and outcomes separately, we found a large and  		statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse outcomes but  		not in the incidence of care that did not meet the guidelines. However, the  		observed difference in the incidence of care that did not meet the guidelines  		for patients at high risk and not at high risk was attenuated in the pilot  		study sample due to an artifact of the sample associated with a revision to the  		risk classification procedures that was implemented after data collection had  		begun. The evidence suggests that we would have found a larger (and  		statistically significant) difference in the incidence of inadequate care in  		the two risk groups had the revised risk classification procedures been in  		place at the beginning of data collection.</p>
<h3 align="CENTER">3. The Feasibility of the Data Collection Strategy</h3>
<p>The experience of the pilot study indicates that the data collection  		strategy is generally feasible and deals successfully with a number of  		operational issues. The cooperation of hospitals was satisfactory; over 80  		percent of the hospitals that were approached agreed to participate. However,  		for-profit hospitals were the most reluctant to participate, suggesting that  		non-participating hospitals may differ systematically, and that it may be  		desirable to adjust the results of a national study for the nonresponse of  		hospitals. Patients and their caregivers were very cooperative; the completion  		rates for the interviews ranged from 88-99 percent. Selecting the sample of  		discharged patients, obtaining the information on condition and procedure codes  		for screening purposes, and processing this information in a timely way did not  		present intractable problems. However, by using hospital discharge disposition  		codes to identify patients discharged to the community, we failed to include a  		small minority of eligible patients who were coded as discharged to an  		institution, but who were actually discharged to the community.</p>
<p>The major problem with the data collection strategy is the extent of  		missing data. Missing data precluded determining whether or not a patient had a  		given condition in about 14 percent of all the <b>potential</b> observations on  		condition, and missing data precluded determining whether care met the  		guidelines or adverse outcomes were suffered in about 23 percent of the cases  		in which the condition could be determined. The <b>actual</b> number of  		observations lost to analysis due to missing data on condition, care, or  		outcomes is unknown, but lies between 23 percent and 37 percent. The major  		cause of the missing data was inconsistency between the hospital medical  		records and the interview reports. Because medical records were not available  		for abstraction until quite some time after a patient was discharged and  		because abstraction is a very time-consuming process, the patient's report of  		his or her condition was used to determine which interview questions on care  		and outcomes were applicable. If the information in the hospital medical record  		indicated that the patient had a given condition, but the patient did not  		report having that condition when interviewed, the guideline for that condition  		could have been applicable based on the medical records information, but data  		on care and adverse outcomes would not have been available from the interview.  		Another major cause of missing data was a failure to find information in the  		medical record, either because it did not exist or because it was  		overlooked.</p>
<p>While one cannot hope to eliminate missing data entirely, it is very  		important that the data collection strategy be revised in a national study to  		reduce the amount of missing data. We recommend revisions to the data  		collection strategy to reduce missing data that involve changing the interviews  		to ask as many questions as possible regardless of the condition reported by  		the patient, and expanding the "callback" procedures so that patients are  		recontacted to resolve inconsistencies between the hospital records data and  		the interview data and to provide missing data.</p>
<p>The other major problem with the data collection strategy involves the  		procedures for abstracting medical records and applying the guidelines  		automatically. The clinical reviewers felt that the guidelines had been applied  		incorrectly in a substantial number of the 100 cases that they reviewed.  		Further investigation indicates that the major factors accounting for the  		incorrect application of the guidelines were different decision rules that were  		applied under the automated procedures and in the clinical review, different  		decisions that were applied in ambiguous cases, and difficult-to-locate  		information that was overlooked during abstraction.</p>
<p>Most of the cases in which decision rules differed involved cases in  		which information on functioning in the medical record and the interview was  		inconsistent. To eliminate these inconsistencies, we recommend that the  		interview be used as the primary data source on functioning. (Presently, the  		medical record is the primary source.) We also recommend refining the medical  		records abstraction and the automated procedures for applying the guidelines to  		deal with ambiguous cases. Finally, we recommend increasing the time devoted to  		medical records abstraction.</p>
