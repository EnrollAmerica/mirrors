<p>The Omnibus Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1987, P.L 100-203, sec. 9138,  		requires the Secretary to provide information on the following:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>the total number of infants and children in the United States who  			 have been diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome and who have  			 been placed in foster care; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the problems encountered by social service agencies in placing  			 infants and children with such syndrome in foster care; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the potential increase (over the five-year period beginning on the  			 date of the enactment of this Act) in the number of infants and children with  			 such syndrome who will require foster care.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The statute defines an infant or child with acquired immune deficiency  		syndrome as including those who are infected with the virus associated with  		such syndrome. In addition, the report is to "make recommendations to the  		Congress with respect to improving the care of infants and children with  		acquired immune deficiency syndrome who lack ongoing parental involvement and  		support."</p>
<p>In response to OBRA, the Department engaged in two studies which are  		included in this report as <a href="#partI">part I</a> and <a href="#partII">part II</a>. The first is a telephone survey of all 50 states,  		the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. This survey provides information on  		the following questions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>How many infants and children tested seropositive with the Human  			 Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are there in foster care?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many HIV-seropositive boarder babies are there in hospitals  			 awaiting foster care placements?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the distribution of HIV-seropositive children in foster care  			 across the country?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What percentage of all HIV-infected children get placed in foster  			 care?</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The results of this survey provide information that addresses the first  		requirement of the OBRA, a count of HIV-infected children in foster care. For  		purposes of the survey of child welfare agencies, children who tested positive  		for the virus but who may later seroconvert are included. A description of the  		telephone survey and its findings is <a href="#partI">Part I</a> of the  		attached document.</p>
<p>The second study was conducted under contract with Macro Systems, Inc.,  		to assess policy and practice with regard to a number of issues bearing on  		pediatric AIDS and the child welfare system. The report from Macro Systems,  		Inc., is <a href="#partII">Part II</a> of the attached document. It contains  		case studies conducted in seven local jurisdictions with a high incidence of  		pediatric AIDS: New York, New York; Newark, New Jersey; Miami, Florida;  		Chicago, Illinois; Boston, Massachusetts; Los Angeles, California; State of  		Connecticut. Among the issues investigated are boarder babies, recruitment and  		retention of foster parents, enrollment of foster care children in experimental  		trials, services and training, testing for HIV. Findings from these case  		studies, contained in <a href="#partII">Part II</a> of this report, provide  		information pertinent to the second requirement of OBRA, a discussion of  		problems faced by social services agencies that are addressing the effects of  		this disease.</p>
<p>The Macro study also provides an estimate of the number of HIV-infected  		children who may be in foster care by the year 1992 (<a href="#partII">Part  		II</a>), as per the third requirement of OBRA. It should be noted that this is  		a very soft estimate, given the weak data available to make such estimates.</p>
<p><a href="#partII">Part II</a> of the report contains recommendations on  		actions which, it is believed, would improve the care of HIV-infected children  		in need of foster care.</p>
<p>[<a href="#partII">Part II</a> does not contain the appendices to the  		report submitted by Macro Systems, Inc., to the Office of the Assistant  		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE). The appendices include summary  		reports of site visits, as well as other background material. The full Macro  		Systems report is available from ASPE, Room 410E, 200 Independence Avenue,  		S.W., Washington, D.C. 20201, (202)245-1805)]</p>
<h3>Summary of Key Findings</h3>
<p>The telephone survey of 50 states and the District of Columbia, reported  		in <a href="#partI">part I</a> of this report, found that:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>At the time of the survey, there were 806 infants and children, who  			 tested positive for HIV, placed in foster care in the United States. In  			 addition, 19 HIV-seropositive children in Puerto Rico were in foster  			 care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over time, a total of 979 HIV-seropositive children had been placed  			 in foster care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pattern of placement of HIV-seropositive children in foster care  			 across the country is similar to that of pediatric AIDS cases reported to CDC.  			 There are several exceptions to this pattern, primarily in some southern  			 states, where fewer infected children than expected have been placed in foster  			 care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is estimated that between 16 and 22 percent of all HIV-infected  			 children in the country get placed in foster care. It should be noted, however,  			 that since estimates of the number of HIV-infected children in the country are  			 still very weak, these percentages are not very well based. Also, these  			 estimates may be inflated because there was no way to identify those positive  			 children in foster care who might later seroconvert.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The study by Macro Systems, reported in <a href="#partII">Part II</a> of  		this report, found that:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>It is estimated that by the year 1992, there will be approximately  			 1750 to 4500 HIV-infected infants and children placed in foster care. Given the  			 numbers already in care, it may be that the number in 1992 will be nearer to  			 the high end of this range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster care agencies need to establish written policies to formalize  			 the successful practices that have been developed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All sites visited have been able to recruit adequate numbers of  			 foster parents for HIV-infected children, but their ability to retain families  			 and recruit new families for the growing number of HIV-infected children will  			 depend on continued concentrated recruitment efforts and the provision of  			 adequate support for these families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most children who are HIV-seropositive are minority children and  			 tend to come from poor families. They and their families tend to be underserved  			 generally, a fact that is exaccerbated by this disease. With regard to foster  			 care, the recruitment of homes is complicated by the greater burdens faced by  			 the communities from which these children come.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interviewees expressed concern about how long the present foster  			 care homes can continue before becoming overwhelmed with the added care needs  			 and the emotional burden of dealing with death and dying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All foster care agencies handling HIV-infected children for  			 placement need a clearly defined training program and expanded support services  			 for foster parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extended family members will be used to a greater degree as the  			 epidemic progresses, and they need financial and ancillary support to care for  			 HIV-infected children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congregate care homes should be reserved to provide services and  			 meet needs that foster family homes cannot meet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The potential benefits to the foster care system and child's health  			 provide compelling reasons to test all at-risk children in foster  			 care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State and local child welfare agencies should develop stems to  			 manage the participation of children in foster care in special medical  			 treatment and experimental trials. Currently, few HIV-infected children in  			 foster care are enrolled in these protocols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most sites were not experiencing boarder baby problems with  			 HIV-infected children, but expressed great concern about the potential of this  			 problem to worsen as the epidemic in children increases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The problem of the HIV-infected adolescent concerns child welfare  			 agencies, but now is low in the priorities for action. There is a need to  			 determine the number of HIV-infected adolescents and examine their special  			 problems and potential solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul><h1><a name="partI" id="partI">PART I: ESTIMATES OF THE NUMBER OF  		HIV-SEROPOSITIVE INFANTS AND CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE</a></h1>
<p>The importance of foster care in responding to the pediatric AIDS  		epidemic has long been recognized. Many children who are infected can not stay  		with their families, either because they are abandoned in hospitals at birth or  		because their family has deteriorated so far -- due to illness, drugs, poverty  		-- that proper care is not possible. While a good deal has been written about  		providing foster care to these children, including difficulties in recruiting  		foster care parents and the need for services, there has not been information  		about how many HIV-seropositive children are actually placed in foster care.  		While there is ancedotal information that foster care agencies have experienced  		a good deal of stress responding to the new demands of this disease, the size  		of that burden and how it is distributed across the country has not been  		known.</p>
<p>This paper reports the findings of an informal survey of the fifty  		states and Puerto Rico designed to find out just how many identified  		HIV-seropositive children have been placed in foster care or are in hospitals  		awaiting foster care placement (i.e. boarder babies). This is the first time  		that data from an fifty states have been reported.</p>
<h2>THE DATA</h2>
<p>Estimates were obtained from each of the 50 states, the District of  		Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Staff of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, spoke  		with supervisors of state foster care programs, of county programs in states  		with county administered child welfare programs, and, in Florida, with  		supervisors in state agency district offices. In states with county  		administered systems, only selected counties were contacted based on the  		likelihood that cases of HIV infection in children would be found.</p>
<p>Data were collected mainly in March and early April of 1989. Data from  		California and Florida were collected in July 1989 to coordinate information  		collection with that undertaken by Macro Systems for the companion study (<a href="#partII">Part II</a> of this report).</p>
<p>Data were obtained from child welfare program officials with  		responsibility for HIV-seropositive children. In some cases, these officials  		drew on formal information systems that track such children but more typically,  		they relied on their own personal knowledge and that of others. Estimates of  		current cases are likely to more precise than are estimates of cumulative cases  		because the latter often depend on the memory of staff.</p>
<p>For this study, the term "HIV-seropositive children" refers to children  		who are identified as having tested positive for HIV. This includes both  		symptomatic and asymptomatic children, as well as children who may at a later  		time seroconvert to HIV negative. This is a greater number than the number of  		pediatric AIDS cases reported to CDC since those cases represent only children  		with full-blown AIDS. The degree of illness was not asked because child welfare  		agencies generally do not have such information. The key factor for child  		welfare agency operation is the positive test result. It must be stressed that  		children in foster care are not routinely tested for HIV; therefore it is  		possible that there are unidentified HIV-seropositive children in foster  		care.</p>
<p>"Foster care placement" refers to those children in placement under the  		supervision of a public children welfare agency and for whom a board and care  		rate is paid. Typically foster care means placement in a licensed home or  		facility. Numbers do include children placed with relatives who have been  		certified or licensed as foster parents and receive a foster care board and  		care payment. Not included are children placed with relatives in unlicensed  		informal care, with no board and care rate paid, and children with their own  		families but supervised by the agency.</p>
<p>"Boarder babies" are those HIV-seropositive children in hospitals  		identified by foster care officials as awaiting action by their agency.  		Children held in hospitals beyond the time of medical necessity for reasons  		other than the unavailability of a foster care placement would not be known to  		the child welfare agency and, hence, would not be counted.</p>
<p>This study asked only about boarder babies who tested sero-positive.  		Estimates of boarder babies who do not carry the antibody were not made. It is  		primarily non-HIV-seropositive children, usually drug exposed during pregnancy,  		who are the boarder babies in hospitals.</p>
<h2>FINDINGS</h2>
<h3>Number of HIV-seropositive Children in  		Foster Care, Nationally</h3>
<p>The following total number of children, tested positive for HIV, have  		been placed in foster care in the 50 states and the District of Columbia:</p>
<table><tr><td>Current</td>
<td>804</td>
</tr><tr><td>Cumulative</td>
<td>979</td>
</tr></table><p>These numbers indicate that about 80 percent of all HIV-seropositive  		children who have been in foster care were in placement at the time of the  		survey.</p>
<p>In addition, Puerto Rico reported that 19 HIV-seropositive children were  		placed currently and 25 cumulatively in foster care.</p>
<h3>Distribution by States</h3>
<p><a href="#tableI-1">Table 1</a> shows the numbers of HIV-seropositive  		children in foster care for all states. Most of the HIV-seropositive children  		in foster care are in a limited number of states, those with the highest rates  		of pediatric AIDS cases reported to CDC. Three states have 52.7 percent of HIV  		placements: New York, New Jersey, Florida. Fifty-three percent of AIDS cases  		among children are in the same three states.</p>

</tr></table><h3>Distribution Within Selected States</h3>
<p>Foster care is administered in some states by counties. In a few others,  		notably Florida, the local district offices of the state agency have a good  		deal of latitude in administering foster care. In both situations, it was  		necessary to talk to local officials to obtain placement numbers. This process  		afforded a picture of the distribution of placements within the states, a  		picture that was not obtained from state administered programs. </p>
<p>The spread of foster care placements of HIV-seropositive children within  		some states was broader than expected. <a href="#tableI-3">Table 3</a> presents  		data for the state of Florida, broken out by district offices. In Florida, only  		about 25 percent of HIV placements have been made by the Dade district office  		of the state agency. Three other districts have more than 10 placements.  		However, Miami, which is in Dade County, accounts for about 50 percent of AIDS  		cases reported from the state.</p>

<h3>Types of Foster Care Placements</h3>
<p>Child welfare officials were asked whether HIV-seropositive children  		were placed in foster family homes or in group homes. The specific numbers are  		not reported because the information was not precise. However, it appears that  		an overwhelming number of HIV-seropositive children are placed in family homes  		rather than group homes. The estimate is that nationally over 95 percent of  		these children are in family homes.</p>
<h3>Boarder Babies</h3>
<p>There are very few HIV-seropositive boarder babies in hospitals awaiting  		foster care placements, according to child welfare agencies across the country.  		Only two state foster care agencies reported that they had HIV-seropositive  		children currently in hospitals for whom placement had been requested and had  		not yet been found. New York State reported 6 HIV-seropositive children and  		Washington, D.C. reported 4 children in hospitals awaiting placement, a total  		of 10 children. No other state or local agency reported being aware of  		HIV-seropositive boarder babies for whom they had been asked to find a foster  		home. States generally do not maintain data on how many boarder babies they  		have had over time.</p>
<p>In the course of discussions with child welfare agencies, a number  		indicated that they did have drug exposed children, not identified as  		HIV-seropositive, in hospitals for whom placement had not yet been found.  		Information was not collected on how many of these children there are.</p>
<p>Many foster care agency officials believe, however, that they certainly  		could be facing a significant increase in HIV-seropositive boarder babies as  		the number of HIV-seropositive infants grows.</p>
<h3>Foster Care Placement Rates</h3>
<p>The proportion of all HIV-seropositive children placed in foster care is  		unknown. This study provides a numerator needed to make an estimate: 979  		children. It should be pointed out again that this is a very soft number. Since  		states do not know how many children will seroconvert, the figure refers to  		seropositive children, not HIV-infected. Also, the figure does not include  		children who may be seropositive but have not been tested.</p>
<p>To calculate the proportion of all HIV-seropositive children in foster  		care, a good denominator is needed. CDC staff indicates that the number of  		HIV-infected children can only be estimated. The rule of thumb that they use to  		estimate the number of HIV-infected children not meeting the CDC case  		definition for AIDS is two to three times the number of reported AIDS  		cases.<sup><font><a href="#noteI-1">1</a></font></sup> Since the  		reported number of cases through April 1989, about the time foster care data  		was collected, was about 1500 cases, the national total of HIV-infected  		children would have been estimated to be between 4500 and 6000. Using these  		figures as the denominator, the rate of foster care placement among all  		HIV-infected children is between 16.5 percent and 21.9 percent nationally.</p>
<p>Using state foster care placement data of HIV-seropositive children and  		state AIDS cases reported to CDC, placement rates for selected states have been  		calculated. These percentages are presented in <a href="#tableI-5">table  		5</a>.</p>
<p>Maryland and Connecticut have the highest rates of placement of  		HIV-seropositive children in foster care. Massachusetts and the District of  		Columbia follow. The states with the highest incidence of pediatric AIDS, and  		it follows the highest prevalence of HIV among children -- New York, New  		Jersey, Florida, California -- tend to have a foster care rate of between 15  		and 20 percent. A number of southern states have very low rates of placing  		HIV-seropositive children in foster care.</p>

<h3>Boarder Babies</h3>
<p>The data on boarder babies presented here may be problematic for some.  		Ten HIV-seropositive boarder babies for the nation would seem totally wrong to  		many hospital personnel who often indicate that they have much higher numbers  		of boarder babies. However, the fact that only two child welfare agencies, New  		York State and the District of Columbia, report awareness of any  		HIV-seropositive children boarder babies awaiting their action is a significant  		finding. HIV-seropositive children whom hospitals consider to be boarder babies  		are not always officially referred to the child welfare agency for placement,  		for a variety of reasons. This may account for the discrepancy between  		information coming from hospitals and the numbers reported here. The attached  		Macro Systems study discusses this issue.</p>
<p>In addition, there are probably fewer HIV-seropositive boarder babies  		than is commonly believed. Most of the states have made significant strides in  		reducing this problem over the last few years.</p>
<p>In the course of discussions with child welfare agency officials it was  		clear that many agencies are aware of babies in hospitals awaiting placement  		who are not HIV-seropositive. Most of these children are drug exposed and  		abandoned by mothers who are addicts. This population of boarder babies is a  		much bigger problem now for hospitals and agencies than are HIV-seropositive  		children. The issues surrounding the placement of drug exposed children in  		foster care are complex and are significantly different from those regarding  		HIV-seropositive children. These issues require a good deal of further  		investigation and policy discussion.</p>
<h3>Foster Care</h3>
<p>The figures reported here are the first Federal government estimates of  		the number of identified HIV-seropositive children in foster care. They allow a  		basis for estimating the burden for care of pediatric AIDS children that is  		being born by foster care programs across the country. The current number of  		804 HIV-seropositive children in foster care is a better estimate than is the  		cumulative one of 979 children because of the limitations of state data. The  		numbers were collected mainly in April and May, 1989. A follow-up survey would  		be needed to track the rate of growth of such placements over time.</p>
<p>The rhetoric about pediatric AIDS can sometimes make it seem that most  		infected children are in foster care or that very few of them are. The foster  		care placement rates of HIV-seropositive children calculated here provide  		estimates that suggest that, particularly in high AIDS areas, about 15 to 20  		percent of such children are in foster care. These estimated rates are very  		rough ones, only a first step in a process. A much better denominator is  		needed: the number of HIV-infected children in this country. There will be  		better estimates in the future as new epidemiological data become  		available.</p>
<p>The data on foster care placements show a pattern of wide variability in  		the numbers of estimated HIV-seropostive children in foster care. The 15 to 20  		percent rates represent only a general pattern and do not necessarily apply in  		particular localities.</p>
<p>Foster care placements of HIV-seropostive children, as one would expect,  		follow the pattern of pediatric AIDS in this country. States with the most  		cases of pediatric AIDS generally have the most cases of seropostive children  		in foster care. There are exceptions, most notably Texas and some other  		southern states. The study provides no good explanation for why  		HIV-seropositive children in those states do not find their way into foster  		care. Someone other than the state is providing care for these children.</p>
<p>The pattern of foster care placements in Florida was a surprise. It was  		expected that most of the placements would be in the Miami area. Instead, only  		25 percent o placements was in this area with the balance spread across the  		state. In California, the pattern suggests that the concentration is mainly in  		Los Angeles County. Although other sections of the state have high incidences  		of AIDS among adults, the pediatric problem for child welfare is not yet  		manifest there to a significant degree. In New York, the overwhelming number of  		placements are in New York City, as expected.</p>
<p>The numbers of HIV-seropositive children in foster care are still quite  		low, even in high incidence states. While infected children are only a very  		small share of all children in foster care, they represent a significant burden  		in terms of costs, difficulties in recruiting placements, services needed, and  		the extra time required of staff. In addition, some HIV-seropositive children  		have non-infected siblings who also are victimized by the disease and require  		foster care placements (the number is unknow). HIV infection and AIDS are  		slowly spreading across the country, doing their share to stress an already  		overburdened child welfare system.</p>

<h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in children  		has placed new demands on the already overburdened foster care systems in the  		United States. As of June 1, 1989, there were 1,632 reported cases of AIDS in  		children under the age of 13, and estimates of the total number of children  		carrying the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) range from 3,000 to 20,000. The  		HIV/AIDS epidemic is in its early stages of development, and the number of  		children with AIDS are on the initial segment of a curve which will rise  		rapidly during the next five years. In 1986, the last year for which there are  		national data on foster care, approximately 280,000 children were in foster  		care. As the number of children in foster care has increased, there has been a  		concomitant reduction in the number of licensed foster care homes and increased  		difficulty in recruiting foster families.</p>
<p>Little is known about how the areas most severely affected by the AIDS  		epidemic are dealing with the children who are HIV-infected and foster care.  		This study was designed to define the specific problems related to providing  		foster care for children with HIV infection. Its major purpose is to respond to  		the statutory requirements contained in the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987,  		requiring a report to Congress on the number of children with HIV infection in  		foster care, problems faced by the foster care system in placing these  		children, and an estimation of the number of children who will require foster  		care by 1992.</p>
<p>A major element of the project was to conduct site visits to areas with  		a high incidence of AIDS in children to learn how organizations have grappled  		with the issues of providing foster care for HIV-infected children. The study  		focus was on children in need of foster care. While some issues related to  		needs of intact families in which one or more members were HIV-infected, the  		scope of the project did not permit in-depth examination of these issues, nor  		were we able to explore thoroughly the issues related to HIV-infected  		adolescents in foster care.</p>
<p>The project methodology included conducting a literature review,  		preparing a background document to define relevant issues, conducting site  		visits to seven areas with a high incidence of pediatric AIDS and producing a  		report that included a series of issues and related recommendations. The cities  		chosen for site visits were Los Angeles, California; Hartford, Connecticut;  		Miami, Florida; Chicago Illinois; Boston, Massachusetts; Newark, New Jersey;  		and New York, New York.</p>
<p>Approximately 800 HIV-infected children nationally were in foster care  		placement as of June 1989. The seven sites visited served 545 HIV-infected  		children in foster care, or 68 percent of the total. The site discussions  		confirmed the oft-made statements that the foster care system is under severe  		stress or in crisis. As the foster care system continues to respond to such  		concerns as growing caseloads, staff shortages, fewer foster family homes,  		stationary or decreasing budgets, and a large influx of young children who are  		medically fragile or have medical complications into the system, complex issues  		will be raised and creative solutions will be required. The foster care  		delivery systems that have struggled with recruitment, placement, and care  		issues related to HIV-infected children have underlined some specific concerns  		and approaches to resolve some of these broad concerns. The key issues which  		were discussed during this study include an examination of these issues:</p>
<ul><li>To what extent are state/local agencies developing systems that can  		  be sustained over time?</li>
<li>Are states able to recruit and retain adequate numbers of foster  		  parents for HIV-infected children?</li>
<li>What role do extended family members have in providing foster care  		  and what are the implications for HIV-infected children?</li>
<li>What are the gaps in services provided to children and foster  		  parents? </li>
<li>Are congregate care living arrangements for HIV-infected children  		  used appropriately?</li>
<li>Should there be HIV antibody testing of all at-risk children in  		  foster care? </li>
<li>Are HIV-infected children in foster care enrolled in experimental  		  drug trials?</li>
<li>What is the boarder baby problem, how serious is it, and what is its  		  relationship to the HIV epidemic?</li>
<li>What are the issues surrounding HIV-infected adolescents?</li>
</ul><p>Conclusions from our site visits related to the issues outlined above  		are the following:</p>
<ul><li>Foster care agencies need to establish written policies to formalize  		  the successful practices that have been developed.</li>
<li>All sites visited have been able to recruit adequate numbers of  		  foster parents for HIV-infected children, but their ability to retain families  		  and recruit new families for the growing number of HIV-infected children will  		  depend on continued concentrated recruitment efforts and the provision of  		  adequate support for these families.</li>
<li>Interviewees expressed concern about how long the present foster care  		  homes can continue before becoming overwhelmed with the added care needs and  		  the emotional burden of dealing with death and dying;</li>
<li>All foster care agencies handling HIV-infected children for placement  		  need a clearly defined training program and expanded support services for  		  foster parents.</li>
<li>Extended family members will be used to a greater degree as the  		  epidemic progresses, and they need financial and ancillary support to care for  		  HIV-infected children.</li>
<li>Congregate care homes should be reserved to provide services and meet  		  needs that foster family homes cannot meet.</li>
<li>The potential benefits to the foster care system and the child's  		  health provide compelling reasons to test all at-risk children in foster  		  care;</li>
<li>State and local child welfare agencies should develop systems to  		  manage the participation of children in foster care in special medical  		  treatment and experimental trials. Currently, few HIV-infected children in  		  foster care are enrolled in these protocols.</li>
<li>Most sites were not experiencing boarder baby problems, but expressed  		  great concern about the potential for this problem to worsen as the epidemic in  		  children increases.</li>
<li>The problem of the HIV-infected adolescent concerns child welfare  		  agencies, but now is low in the priorities for action. There is a need to  		  determine the number of HIV-infected adolescents and examine their special  		  problems and potential solutions.</li>
</ul><p>This study revealed that as child welfare agencies continue with limited  		funding to serve even greater numbers of children and families, pressure for  		resources for recruitment, training, support services, and reimbursement for  		the placement of HIV-infected children in foster care will continue to test the  		limits of the foster care system's ability to respond and survive.</p>

<h3>Description of the Problem</h3>
<p>The epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in children  		has placed new demands on the already overburdened foster care systems within  		the United States. As of June 1, 1989, there were 1,632 reported cases of AIDS  		in children under the age of thirteen (CDC, 1989, #1) and estimates of the  		total number of children carrying the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) range  		from 3,000 to 20,000 (CDC, 1989, #2). Initially, the epidemic was felt most  		acutely by New York, New Jersey, and Florida; these three states accounted for  		64 percent of reported AIDS cases in children through 1986. By 1989 these  		states accounted for only 55 percent of reported AIDS cases, as other states  		began to experience larger caseloads of children with AIDS and began dealing  		with issues related to the delivery of health care and social services. The  		HIV/AIDS epidemic is in its early stages of development and the number of  		children with AIDS will rise rapidly during the next five years.</p>
<p>Seventy two percent of children with HIV infection acquire the virus  		through perinatal transmission related to intravenous drug abuse (CDC, 1989,  		#2). These children often come from an impoverished, disadvantaged environment,  		and many are already candidates for foster care because of parental abuse or  		neglect. Other HIV-infected children have a significant chance of entering the  		foster care system as their parents become disabled or die from the effects of  		AIDS.</p>
<p>Foster care is a state and/or county administered child welfare service  		designed to provide full-time substitute care for children outside of their  		parental homes. Foster care can be provided in foster family homes, group care  		homes, or institutions. Typically, it is intended as a temporary arrangement  		until the child can return home or until an adoptive placement is found.  		Children can enter the foster care system through voluntary placement by the  		parent who is unable to meet the needs of their offspring or by state removal  		of the child because of neglect and/or abuse.</p>
<p>Federal funding for foster care is available through Title IV-E of the  		Social Security Act, specifically for children from families eligible for Aid  		to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). States may receive matching Federal  		Title IV-E (Social Security Act) funds for the maintenance of children in  		foster care placement. Additional federal funding is available to states  		through Title IV-B (Social Security Act), which provides funds for services and  		incentives for the implementation of statewide foster care inventories,  		information systems, and case management plans which include six month  		reviews.</p>
<p>In 1986, there were approximately 280,000 children in foster care, of  		whom approximately 109,000 were in AFDC-funded foster care (Task Force, 1989).  		Since then, case loads have been increasing in part due to the increased  		incidence of reported child abuse and neglect, the rapidly rising incidence of  		drug abuse among women, and the increased number of homeless persons.  		Furthermore, as the number of children in foster care has increased, there has  		been a reduction in the number of licensed foster care homes and increased  		difficulty in recruiting foster families. Factors commonly cited as  		contributing to this shortage include low reimbursement rates, insufficient  		support services, increased number of single parent families, increased numbers  		of women in the work force, and increasing numbers of children with special  		medical or emotional needs who require specialized foster parent attention.</p>
<p>Oversight reviews in recent years from Congress and criticism from the  		national media have pointed out certain problems in the nation's child welfare  		system in general and the foster care system specifically. In 1987, the House  		Select Committee on Children identified such persistent problems as  		under-funding of programs, inadequate federal guidelines, and poor  		accountability by state and local child welfare agencies for the quality of  		their child care programs. The appearance of children with HIV infection and  		AIDS in need of foster care services has added further strains on the child  		welfare system. The Department of Health and Human Services Work Group on  		Pediatric HIV Infection and Disease released its final report June 26, 1989.  		Three of the thirteen recommendations for immediate action relate to the foster  		care system.</p>
<h3>Purpose and Scope of the Project</h3>
<p>Little is known about how the jurisdictions most severely affected by  		the AIDS epidemic are coping with HIV-infected children and foster care. To  		address this, the current study will define the specific problems related to  		providing foster care for children with HIV infection. The study will respond  		to statutory requirements contained in the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987  		(Public Law 100-203). Under this act, the Secretary of the Department of Health  		and Human Services was asked to report to Congress on the number of children  		with HIV infection in foster care and on the problems faced by the foster care  		system in placing these children and to estimate the number of children who  		will require foster care by 1992.</p>
<p>This study, conducted for the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation (ASPE), examines a number of issues related to foster care in  		general and issues related to the unique situation of children with HIV/AIDS in  		foster care specifically. The focus of this project was on site visits to areas  		with a high incidence of AIDS in children to learn about approaches to  		providing foster care for HIV-infected children. While there was some  		discussion of issues related to needs of intact families in which one or more  		members were HIV-infected, the scope of the project did not permit in-depth  		exploration of these issues nor were we able to explore extensively the issues  		related to HIV-infected adolescents in foster care.</p>
<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>The project methodology had three components: conducting a literature  		review, preparing a background document to define the relevant issues, and  		conducting site visits to seven areas with a high incidence of AIDS in  		children.</p>
<p>The literature review included abstracts of papers presented at the  		Fourth and Fifth International AIDS Conferences held in Stockholm, Sweden, and  		Montreal, Canada, respectively, and published papers in child welfare, medical,  		and public health journals. The literature review was not intended to be  		exhaustive, but rather to provide an overview of the salient cross-cutting  		issues. A bibliography of these materials is included in Appendix A.</p>
<p>The background issues document summarized important information about  		issues, barriers, and responses related to children with HIV infection within  		the child welfare system.</p>
<p>The cities chosen for site visit were Los Angeles, California; Hartford,  		Connecticut; Miami, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; Boston, Massachusetts; Newark,  		New Jersey; and New York, New York. The purpose of the site visits was to  		explore the experiences and responses of different foster care systems in  		providing services to HIV-infected infants and children. We attempted to  		arrange interviews with a cross-section of people who deal with HIV-infected  		children including state and local child welfare officials, local public foster  		care officials, staff from private foster care placement agencies, foster  		parents and/or association representatives and hospital social work staff. In  		some instances a large group introductory meeting preceded individual  		interviews. A list of the people interviewed at each site appears in Appendix  		B.</p>
<p>Based on the information gleaned from the literature review and issues  		document, we designed a discussion guide to elicit pertinent information on the  		topic. We focused on various points in the guide for discussion, and depending  		on the person's area of expertise, explored relevant tangential issues that  		surfaced during the discussions. The discussion guide appears in Appendix  		C.</p>
<p>Each site visit was summarized and reviewed by the key contacts within  		each organization visited. Site visit summaries appear in Appendix D.</p>
<p>This report compiles the information gathered during each of the site  		visits and focuses on identifying broad issues that cut across sites and have  		national relevance. We addressed the following policy questions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>To what extent is HIV infection contributing to the crisis in foster  			 care?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To what extent are state/local agencies developing systems that can  			 be sustained over time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are states able to recruit and retain adequate numbers of foster  			 parents for HIV-infected children?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What role do extended family members have in providing foster care  			 and what are the implications for HIV-infected children?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the gaps in services provided children and foster  			 parents?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are congregate care living arrangements for HIV children being used  			 appropriately?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should there be HIV antibody testing of all at risk children in  			 foster care?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the "boarder baby" problem, how serious is it, and what is  			 its relation to the HIV epidemic?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the issues surrounding HIV-infected adolescents?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the barriers to the enrollment of HIV-infected children in  			 experimental drug trials (investigational drug treatment programs)?</p>
</li>
</ul><p><a href="#sectionII-III">Section III</a> of this report presents an  		in-depth discussion of each of these issues with recommendations for further  		action.</p>
<h2><a name="sectionII-II" id="sectionII-II">II. MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM PROJECTED BY  		1992</a></h2>
<p>Two years after AIDS was recognized in the adult population, the public  		health community came to accept a diagnosis of AIDS in infants and children.  		Initially, the diagnoses of the few reported cases of AIDS in infants were  		questioned. Some cited its potential confusion with rare congenital immune  		deficiency diseases, and there was a lack of appreciation of the risk of HIV  		infection among the pregnant women. However, the phenomenon of pediatric AIDS  		cases and HIV infection is now widely known, and the numbers are increasing. As  		of June 1, 1989, AIDS had been reported in 1,632 children under the age of  		thirteen and in approximately 400 adolescents, aged thirteen to nineteen. Thus,  		approximately 2,000 cases of AIDS have been reported in infants, children, and  		adolescents since the epidemic began (CDC, 1989, #2). The risk factor for 79  		percent of the reported cases of AIDS in children is a mother who has or is at  		risk for HIV infection either through IV drug use or sexual contact with an IV  		drug user. These women are the fastest growing risk group among reported AIDS  		cases (CDC, 1989, #1). Approximately 40 percent of all of the reported cases of  		AIDS in children were reported during the one-year period June 1988 through May  		1989, attesting to the rapid growth of the epidemic in this population.</p>
<p>The number of children with AIDS represents only the tip of the iceberg.  		To assess fully the impact of this epidemic on the foster care system, the  		total number of children with HIV infection -- including those who are  		asymptomatic, symptomatic, and who have ARC or AIDS -- must be included.</p>
<p>A recent Government Accounting Office (GAO) report presents an analysis  		of the AIDS case reporting assumptions and its altered approach to estimating  		AIDS cases. This chapter uses some of those assumptions to estimate the number  		of HIV-infected children that can be expected by 1992 to describe the potential  		impact on the foster care system.</p>
<h3>Previous Projections</h3>
<p>The Public Health Service estimated that for every child with AIDS  		reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), "another two to ten are  		infected with HIV." Moreover, "by 1991, there will be at least 10,000 to 20,000  		HIV-infected children in the United States," according to reports at the Second  		Public Health Service AIDS Prevention and Control Conference (Report, 1988).  		The same report estimated a total of 270,000 AIDS cases overall by 1991, and  		365,000 cases by the end of 1992.</p>
<p>The General Accounting Office has identified and reviewed 13 national  		forecasts of total adult and pediatric AIDS cases for 1991. Overall, the ranges  		were 84,000 - 750,000 cases by 1991. When limiting the forecasts to those made  		in 1988, the "best" projections narrow from about 120,000 to 320,000. For all  		published forecasts the "best" estimate was from 120,000 to 400,000 cases of  		AIDS through the end of 1991. The GAO presents a range of 300,000 - 480,000  		cumulative cases through 1991. The primary GAO criticism of the other forecasts  		relates to the under-counting of heterosexuals. Unpublished CDC analyses show  		an increasing number of cases stemming from heterosexual contact with  		drug-using partners. Some forecasts have assumed no expansion of the epidemic  		in the heterosexual population. However, the GAO contends that "the true  		proportion of heterosexual cases may be somewhat higher than the often quoted 4  		percent, that the ability to track trends in certain heterosexual risk groups  		has been limited, and that the accuracy, of some forecasts has been affected"  		(General Accounting Office, 1989). The continual and dramatic increases in HIV  		infection rate among IV drug users guarantees the continued infection of  		heterosexuals, specifically women.</p>
<p>The projected number of HIV-infected children by the year 1992 can be  		calculated by using widely accepted assumptions and estimates for such factors  		as the number of HIV-infected cases in relation to reported AIDS cases, the  		proportion of all cases that are women, birth rates, and perinatal transmission  		rates. <a href="#tableII-1">Table 1</a> displays these estimates, sources, and  		assumptions.</p>
<p>At present, 79 percent of children with AIDS, and probably the same  		percentage of children with HIV, have a mother who is in an at-risk category.  		The remainder of the children with AIDS acquired the virus through blood  		transfusion/tissue transplant (cumulative number = 189) or via blood factor  		administered for the treatment of hemophilia (cumulative number = 94). These  		latter two groups will contribute less and less to the total number of  		HIV-infected children during the next four years. Thus, the assumption is that  		the source of most cases of HIV/AIDS in children will be mothers at-risk for  		HIV/AIDS.</p>
<h3>Number of HIV/AIDS Children in the Foster Care  		System</h3>
<p>Data to estimate accurately the projected number of HIV-infected  		children in foster care by 1992 are non-existent. However, current experiences  		of those dealing with HIV-infected children provide some base for estimating  		the future impact.</p>
<p>As of June 1989, approximately 1,000 known HIV-infected children were in  		foster care. This number -- influenced by individual states' accuracy in  		reporting, the accuracy of their information and tracking systems and the  		extent to which they have conducted case-finding efforts -- most likely is an  		underestimate. Several hospitals visited across sites reported that 25 percent  		of their pediatric HIV-infected patients are in foster care. Thus by 1992, a  		total of 1,750-4,500 HIV-infected children in foster care can be expected. This  		represents at least a doubling, and as much as a five fold increase of the  		known cases today.</p>
<p><a href="#tableII-1">Table 1</a> describes a method for calculating the  		projected magnitude of HIV-infected infants and children in foster care by  		1992. The method uses the total number of AIDS cases by 1992 (300,000-480,000)  		and the assumption that 10 percent of AIDS cases as of 1988 were in women and  		that 10 HIV infections exist for each reported AIDS case. Thus, the number of  		women of childbearing age who will have AIDS or be HIV-infected by 1992 will be  		330,000-520,000. Since the birth rate is approximately 7 percent, it is  		estimated that 22,000-35,000 deliveries of HIV-infected infants will occur by  		1992. Thirty to fifty percent will remain infected; CDC feels 30 percent is  		closer to reality. Given our assumption that approximately 25 percent will be  		in foster care, we derive a range of 1,750-4,500 HIV-infected children in  		foster care by 1992. ASPE's companion study has counted approximately 1,000  		HIV-infected children in foster care cumulatively, suggesting that the number  		of such children is likely to be near the higher end of our projected  		range.</p>
<p>A number of factors indicate that the impact of HIV-infected children on  		the foster care system will be severe. These factors include an increase in  		mothers with HIV infection/AIDS who will die and leave children without a  		parent; increasing numbers of women/mothers using crack and the concomitant  		lack of capacity to act as a responsible parent; increased poverty and  		homelessness, making it more difficult for extended families to care for their  		family members; and the use of new and experimental therapeutic agents to  		extend the lives of children with AIDS.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Through site visits to 7 state and local foster care delivery systems,  		the study team discussed the foster care system and the relationship of  		HIV-infected children to that system with approximately 90 individuals who  		provide foster or medical care to HIV-infected/AIDS children. Interviewees  		included state agency directors, foster parents, caseworkers, attorneys serving  		as guardians (or representing dependent children in court), nurses and social  		workers (within both a foster care and hospital setting), physicians, and  		private foster family agency directors and service delivery staff. All  		respondents had, at some level, confronted one of the many issues -- testing,  		participation in clinical trials, placement, recruitment, increasing caseloads  		-- surrounding HIV-infected children in foster care.</p>
<p><b>Concern about the impact of HIV-infected children on the crisis in  		foster care.</b></p>
<p>For the past several years, many individuals have expressed concern  		about the foster care system, particularly about systems serving large  		communities. The large number of children the system must serve, the potential  		for multiple foster home placements, and the need to find a permanent placment  		for foster children are only a few of the issues that have surfaced.</p>
<p>National concern about the foster care system as a whole has been  		expressed by various audience forums such as Congressional hearings,  		television, newspapers, and legal suits. The following items reveal the scope  		of concern.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>A <b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b> editorial (July 1986), entitled  			 "Official Child Neglect" uses the beating and subsequent death of a foster  			 child to discuss the low reimbursement rates for foster parents and to  			 highlight a recent gubernatorial veto of budget increases for health and social  			 service spending</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Congressional hearing of the Select Committee on Children, Youth  			 and Families, House of Representatives (April 1987) addressed "Continuing is in  			 Foster Care: Issues and Problems."</p>
<p> Representative George Miller, Chairman of this Select Committee in  			 his opening statements at the hearing summarized many of the key issues within  			 the foster care system:</p>
<ul><li> the number of children in foster care is again increasing</li>
<li> homeless families are often forced to place their children in  				foster care because shelters are rarely set up to accommodate them </li>
<li> children born to drug dependent parents have begun to enter the  				foster care system as their parents are too ill or unprepared to properly care  				for them</li>
<li> many abused and neglected children continue to be placed in  				foster homes indefinitely</li>
<li> children of drug-dependent parents too often are relegated to  				hospital wards rather than caring homes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>ABC News Closeup on August 30, 1988, broadcast a special television  			 show entitled "Crimes against children - the failure of foster care."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><i>The New York Times</i></b> on April 11, 1989, featured a story  			 on "Disabled foster-care youth kept in New York hospitals."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Congressional Hearing of the House of Representatives Ways and  			 Means Committee, Human Resources Subcommittee (June 1989), focused on proposals  			 to improve the child welfare and foster care programs. Testimony specific to  			 foster parent training and recruitment was highlighted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In June 1989 a class action suit was filed in the U.S. District  			 Court by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of District of Columbia's  			 foster care children. The suit states that the child welfare system jeopardizes  			 the health and safety of children and keeps them in foster care longer than the  			 national average</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Varied sources are beginning to express an interest and concern related  		to the impact of pediatric AIDS on the foster care delivery system:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Department of Health and Human Services, Secretary's Work Group on  			 Pediatric HIV Infection and Disease. The final report, released in 1989, made  			 13 recommendations, 3 of which were specific to foster care for HIV-infected  			 children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congressional Hearing, House of Representatives Governmental  			 Operations Committee, Human Resources and Intergovernmental Relations  			 Subcommittee, February 1989. The hearing addressed the role of government on  			 pediatric AIDS. The issue of foster care was raised throughout the 2-day  			 hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>American Academy of Pediatrics, Task Force on Pediatric AIDS. The  			 Task Force published an article in <b><i>Pediatrics</i></b> (Vol. #83, No. 4,  			 April 1989) entitled "Infants and Children with Acquired Immunodeficiency  			 Syndrome: Placement in Adoption and Foster Care."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fifth International AIDS Conference - Poster Sessions, Montreal,  			 Canada, June 1989. Several posters focused on foster care, including: "The  			 HIV-infected child in the foster family"; "Providing comprehensive services for  			 developmentally disabled children with AIDS -- services and issues"; and "Who  			 speaks for the abandoned child born with HIV? A foster parent and adoptive  			 parent respond."</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Study Findings</h3>
<p>The 90 individuals at the 7 sites articulated both the successes and  		problems within the foster care system and the impact of HIV-infected children  		on that system. A sample of comments from respondents summarizes some of these  		views.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The majority said their system had experienced an increase in the  			 number of children who require foster care placement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staff commented about the inability to fill vacant social/caseworker  			 positions as state budget offices had imposed a freeze and expressed concerns  			 about turnover in staff. One caseworker stated, "I find in the 12 months I have  			 been in this office, a large majority of the staff have left." Another made a  			 similar observation, "I have been with this organization for a year, and I am  			 the senior person in terms of length of time with the organization."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster parent recruitment and retention was another issue  			 highlighted by site respondents. All officials alluded to a decrease in the  			 number of available licensed foster homes. Respondents at one site stated they  			 had lost more than 100 foster homes in the past year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although HIV-infected children do have an impact on the foster care  			 system overall, they currently do not present a tremendous burden on the foster  			 care delivery system. One respondent stated, "Quite honestly, the placement of  			 HIV-infected children is the least of our foster care problems at the present  			 time."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complexity of needs of children requiring placement is increasing.  			 One respondent stated, "The number of medically fragile infants requiring  			 placement in foster care has skyrocketed in the past several years." Another  			 said "Our children are becoming more and more difficult to place. They require  			 specialized placements as they have a multitude of problems."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children requiring placement not only have complex needs, but also  			 may not have support from their natural families. One program respondent said,  			 "We find that fewer and fewer natural parents make any contact with the young  			 children we have in our care. The children are literally being  			 abandoned."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple priorities affect the foster care delivery systems. One  			 worker told the study team that while many cases require special attention, the  			 worker could not devote the time to those cases because departmental policies  			 and priorities dictated the worker's case priorities and functions.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>These comments reflect severe stresses and strains on the system and  		begin to highlight the multiple issues surrounding the foster care system and  		its attempt to serve HIV-infected children. The comments also parallel concerns  		of Congress, the media, and the judiciary about the foster care system.</p>
<p>Site respondents were able to discuss system improvements and -- at the  		same time -- express reservation about the continued success of their foster  		care delivery system. Several systems were handling their caseloads adequately,  		but were aware of forecasts of continued growth in infant and child foster care  		caseloads. This continued caseload growth and the complex needs of children  		that make up the increasing caseload were the primary issues highlighted by  		child welfare officials during the study team visits.</p>
<p>Although foster care placement of HIV-infected children was not  		considered the most pressing problem, study respondents recognized that the  		impact of these children on the system, as with the impact of any subgroup, has  		the potential to move the system from one that is manageable to one that is  		not.</p>
<p><b>Systems of Care for HIV-Infected Children in Foster Care.</b></p>
<p>Approximately 800 HIV-infected children nationally were in foster care  		placement as of June 1989, according to ASPE. The 7 sites visited by the study  		team represented 545 HIV-infected children in foster care, or 68 percent of the  		total number of HIV-infected children in care. Whereas many sites did consider  		HIV-infected children their most difficult-to-place population, they said that  		the influx of HIV-seropositive children provided an opportunity to develop  		systems of care and models of service delivery that could be used for other  		children with complex and special needs.</p>
<p>In developing a system of care for HIV-infected children, child welfare  		agencies were exploring and developing new policies, system linkages, and  		concepts. Some programs and policies were unique to the care of HIV-infected  		children, and others, while generalized to all foster care children, were  		developed because of the influx of HIV-seropositive children into the foster  		care system.</p>
<p>The entrance of HIV-infected children into the foster care system has  		raised some unique issues for child welfare officials. As an example, some of  		these children have been placed in foster care because they are sick and their  		parent(s) can no longer care for them. In other cases, the parent(s) may be in  		the final stages of AIDS and dying. These situations, not generally typical  		within the foster care system, have become more common with AIDS.</p>
<p>Another issue raised by the influx of HIV-infected children is that of  		access to experimental drug trials and other treatments. This is becoming a  		major concern because of the medical care requirements of HIV infection and  		AIDS. Although this particular issue is important to address for all children  		in foster care, it had not been part of the formal mechanisms or policies in  		many child welfare agencies. Furthermore, confidentiality, long a cornerstone  		of the child welfare system, has now become even more important for staff and  		prospective foster parents as they work with HIV-infected children.</p>
<p>Fiscal concerns related to HIV-infected children are also an issue. With  		the severe demands on child welfare agencies and tight state and Federal  		budgets, child welfare agencies have had to find and develop new resources to  		continue to provide needed services and to develop new ones. Particularly in  		the area of recruitment and training of new foster parents, agencies have  		increasingly relied on nontraditional funding sources to achieve program  		goals.</p>
<p>Foster care payment mechanisms have also been affected by the influx of  		HIV-infected children into the foster care delivery system. All states visited  		by the study team had established higher monthly payment rates for foster  		parents who care for HIV-infected children. Although respondents did not  		necessarily view HIV-infected children from a "cost" perspective, these  		increased payment rates have had an impact on budgetary limitations.</p>
<p>As child welfare officials continue to serve even greater numbers of  		children and families, the increase in resources required for recruitment,  		training, support services, and reimbursement for the placement of HIV-infected  		children in foster care will continue to test the limits of the foster care  		system's ability to respond and survive.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>National forums and site discussions confirm that the foster care system  		is under severe stress or in crisis. As the foster care system continues to  		respond to growing caseloads, staff shortages, fewer foster family homes, tight  		budgets, and a large influx of children with special medical needs, many  		resulting from drugs, complex issues will be raised and creative solutions will  		be required. The foster care delivery systems that have struggled with managing  		HIV-infected children have developed creative approaches to recruitment,  		placement, and care. This report will discuss several HIV-specific issues. The  		issues will be presented in the context of the opportunities they offer for  		system change and will focus on the aspects of the foster care delivery system  		that stil require attention.</p>
<p>The next section synthesizes the common concerns raised across sites.  		Within the context of each issue, or innovative practices and findings and,  		where appropriate, recommendations are described. This chapter examines the  		following issues:</p>

<h4>Importance of Issue</h4>
<p>The ability of state and local foster care systems to continue to  		respond to the growing number of HIV-infected children in need of foster care  		is a critical issue. Their ability to respond is influenced by the system's  		early response to the issues and the capability of sustaining those responses  		over time. While small caseloads of HIV-infected children may have been  		successfully treated as unique situations and handled through informal  		arrangements, the persistence of the HIV epidemic and the increasing caseloads  		speak to the need for systematic approaches to dealing with policies and issues  		of foster care placement for this population. Formalized policies help ensure  		uniformity in how cases are handled and in the quality of care provided.</p>
<p>Establishing such policies and procedures is a complex task, given the  		evolving knowledge base about HIV infection and treatment as well as the  		changing community attitudes and level of knowledge and the concomitant need to  		remain flexible and adaptable to these changes.</p>
<p>The degree to which responses and responsibility are a part of the  		broader foster care system and guided by formalized and written policies and  		procedures indicates the system's ability to be sustained over time. The HIV  		epidemic has posed some new issues and problems that span a broad array of  		health and social service needs. To meet these needs the foster care system  		must collaborate closely with health and medical service systems and other  		social service systems. The strength of the linkages between these systems  		affects the foster care system's ability to respond on a long-term basis.</p>
<p>Coordination between the various levels within the foster care system is  		also required. This challenge encompasses clear delineation of state and local  		responsibilities, as well as linkages between policy-making staff, field staff,  		caseworkers, private agencies involved in placement and other services, and  		foster parents.</p>
<h4>Study Findings</h4>
<p>Child welfare and foster care agency staff indicated that the unique  		medical and social aspects of HIV infection and AIDS and the unique needs of  		HIV-infected children have required special responses. The responses of the  		seven different sites vary and have been shaped by the foster care system  		already in place, the medical and community groups in the area, and by  		dedicated individuals who have taken on the interests of this abandoned  		population with compassion and relentless efforts to coax sometimes inflexible  		systems and policies into humane and effective responses. Following is a  		description of the systems that have been developed among the seven sites in  		response to providing foster care for HIV-infected children.</p>
<p><b>Responsibility for-HIV-Infected Children in Need of Foster  		Care</b></p>
<p>Several sites have assigned responsibility for HIV-infected children to  		units handling medically fragile or medically involved children. It is not  		uncommon for these units to have lower staff-to-child caseloads and to have  		some special provisions and reimbursement mechanisms in place. One site has  		created a separate unit dedicated to handling all HIV-infected children and  		related policy issues. Several other sites have designated one person to serve  		as the contact and coordinator of all HIV/AIDS related issues within the  		broader foster care system. In one case, a special review board has been  		established to review all foster care placements of HIV-infected children.</p>
<p><b>Policies and Procedures for Placement of HIV-infected  		Children</b></p>
<p>The seven sites are at various stages of developing and implementing  		written policies and procedures regarding HIV testing and foster care placement  		of HIV-infected children.</p>
<p>The comprehensiveness of the policies varies across sites. One site had  		broad policy provisions in place, but specific issues were handled at the  		caseworker level. These provisions are currently under revision. Most sites  		were operating under draft policies or were in the process of developing  		policies, and one site operated under very broad guidelines promulgated by the  		state but had no specific written policies nor seemed to be in the process of  		establishing policies. Sites that had draft policies or were developing  		policies relied primarily on intra-departmental staff or task forces.  		Massachusetts established a review board composed of a broad array of experts  		including public health officials, medical practitioners, field staff, foster  		parents, and lawyers. This board developed policies based on experience from  		case-by-case reviews. While all sites had some form of policies, many sites had  		not been broadly disseminating these policies; many persons from outside the  		foster care systems reported that field staff were uninformed about the  		policies.</p>
<p><b>Use of Private Foster Care Agencies</b></p>
<p>The seven sites vary in the degree to which they rely on private foster  		care agencies to place HIV-infected children into foster care homes. One area  		uses private agencies exclusively, while several others handle all placements  		within the state/local system. Other areas handle some of the placements  		themselves and contract with private agencies to provide additional  		placements.</p>
<p><b>Linkages between Organizations and Divisions within  		Organizations</b></p>
<p>Formal linkages with other agencies and community services and within  		the foster care system itself were achieved to different degrees among the  		seven sites visited. Sites that tended to rely on one person to handle all HIV  		related issues tended also to have more informal linkages. The lead individuals  		seemed to be responsible for formulating the linkages. Whereas the linkages  		were far reaching and impressive, they appeared to be dependent upon  		individuals rather than the organizations they represented.</p>
<p>Sites that had formulated task forces or review boards with broad  		representation had more formalized linkages that could be traced back to  		organizational commitments rather than the dedication or interest of a specific  		individual. While the linkage may have been initiated by one individual,  		organizational commitment was followed by a formal appointment to the task  		force or review board. These sites also drew from a broader representation of  		organizations in their policy-setting process.</p>
<p>The ability to link foster families caring for HIV-infected children  		with special services and reimbursements depends on the caseworker's knowledge  		of those services. In many cases, sites have established such specialized  		service systems that they are not widely known among all levels of the foster  		care system as a whole. A child who is identified as HIV-antibody positive  		before becoming a ward of the state can be easily linked into the specialized  		services; however, children who are not found to be HIV-antibody positive until  		after placement may not be so easily linked with needed services. Several sites  		recognized the need to broaden the base of knowledge about HIV transmission and  		the special services and systems among agency staff and private foster care  		agencies providing services.</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>The foster care system responses and practices at each of the sites  		visited exemplified different strengths. It is important that practices that  		have been put into place to deal effectively with the issues facing foster care  		for Infected children outlast the individuals who have been responsible for  		formulating the practices. Often, practices evolve through one person's ability  		to manipulate the various systems into responding to individual cases. The  		HIV/AIDS epidemic has prompted the development of unique approaches that may  		have application to the foster care system as a whole -- several persons said  		they felt their responses could serve as a model for handling medically fragile  		children -- yet, often, such practices are known to only a few persons in the  		system. As the caseloads grow and as children who are infected begin to exhibit  		symptoms, more persons within the system will face issues posed by HIV/AIDS and  		will need to be informed of the practices and services available to deal with  		the issues.</p>
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p><b>Recommendation 1.1</b></p>
<p><b>Foster care agencies should establish written policies to formalize  		the successful practices that have been developed. Some of the elements that  		should be addressed include:</b></p>

<p><b>Recommendation 1.4</b></p>
<p><b>Policies and procedures should be disseminated to all persons  		involved in providing foster care services and to agencies and organizations  		with which such services are linked.</b></p>
<h3>2. Are states able to recruit and retain adequate  		numbers of foster parents for HIV-infected children?</h3>
<h4>Importance of Issue</h4>
<p>Concern has been raised about the ability of state and local foster care  		systems to recruit and retain adequate numbers of foster parents for  		HIV-infected children. Shortages in foster parents could have unfortunate  		consequences such as an increase in the number of hospital boarders,  		overcrowding of children in a home, pressure to certify unqualified homes, and  		increased numbers of children floating among temporary placement  		situations.</p>
<p>HIV-infected children have special needs and require more care and  		commitment than most foster children. They require additional health precaution  		measures, frequent hospital visits, and additional care due to developmental  		delays. Foster families who care for these children face the possibility of  		stigmatization from family and friends and the emotional drain of watching the  		child's health deteriorate and possible death. Reported shortages of foster  		parents in general make more acute the challenge of recruiting foster parents  		for this specialized population. These shortages are attributed to increased  		numbers of single parent families, the increased participation of women in the  		work force, insufficient reimbursement rates and support services, foster  		parent dissatisfaction with the system, and the increasing numbers of children  		in need of foster care.</p>
<h4>Study Findings</h4>
<p>All sites visited have been able to recruit sufficient numbers of foster  		parents or arrange other foster placements. Most sites indicated that they are  		barely keeping ahead of the demand and rarely have families waiting for a  		child. Site visit interviewees also expressed concern that as the caseloads  		grow, the need for foster family homes for HIV-infected children may exceed the  		number of homes available. Several sites reported decreases in the number of  		available foster homes in general over the past few years. If enough homes  		cannot be recruited, areas with a high incidence of HIV-infected babies may be  		faced with a boarder baby problem or forced to turn to other alternatives such  		as group homes, which are considered a less optimal form of care.</p>
<p>All sites have undertaken concentrated efforts to recruit specialized  		foster homes. These efforts have been similar across sites and have included  		targeting special populations from outside the pool of regular foster parents,  		providing education to address fears and describe the facts of transmission,  		and providing enhanced reimbursement rates and additional support services.</p>
<p><b>Recruitment Methods</b></p>
<p>Almost all the sites visited indicated that their recruitment efforts  		have been outside of the pool of traditional foster parents. Many target people  		with a health care background -- often home health aides. Some of the first  		foster parents to take HIV-infected children were nurses from hospital units  		where HIV boarder babies were languishing.</p>
<p>Several sites identified networking and word-of-mouth as the most  		successful recruitment methods; however, this approach has been tempered by the  		need to maintain the confidentiality of a child's HIV status. Many foster  		parents who currently care for an HIV-infected child discretly shared this  		information with friends whom they feel may be potential foster parents for  		other HIV-infected children, and they have been successful in recruiting people  		in this manner. Some sites have indicated a reluctance to allow these parents  		to speak publicly about their, experiences for fear of breach of  		confidentiality and potential for discrimination.</p>
<p>Although all sites identified cultural matching and placement within a  		child's natural jurisdiction as priorities for foster care in general, it was  		clear that, for HIV-infected children, these two issues have a lower priority  		than finding a specialized home for the child. While some areas have been  		successful in matching some HIV-infected children with families of the same  		cultural/ethnic background, others have had difficulty in recruiting black and  		Hispanic families and have placed children of those racial groups in Caucasian  		families. Placement across jurisdictions and even in other states has also  		occurred.</p>
<p>Most sites limit the number of HIV-infected children to a home to one or  		two, although many exceptions to this were cited. Some sites allowed as many as  		six HIV-infected children in a home that was considered exceptionally qualified  		to care for the children.</p>
<p><b>Education</b></p>
<p>At all sites, successful recruitment included efforts to allay people's  		fears about acquiring HIV infection and correct misconceptions about how HIV  		can be transmitted. As a recruitment tool, several sites recently have  		developed videos on the facts of HIV transmission and the need for foster  		parents. Several sites also have included universal infection control  		precautions in their standard training sessions for all foster parents.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard training, all sites provide specific  		training on HIV-infection for foster parents who take HIV-infected children.  		Formats for this HIV-specific training vary from group training to one-on-one  		training specifically focused on the particular needs of one child. Some sites  		provide training in the individual's home during a home visit, and others  		require, in addition, training in the hospital before the child's  		discharge.</p>
<p><b>Enhanced Reimbursement Rates and Support Services</b></p>
<p>All sites provide enhanced reimbursement rates for families who accept  		HIV-infected children. The regular foster care rates among the seven sites  		ranged from $240-$600 per child per month and are usually based on age. Two  		sites have intermediate rate categories for special needs which range from $500  		to $900 per month. Rates for families taking HIV-infected children either fall  		into exceptional rate categories that cover all exceptional needs children or  		categories that have been created specifically for HIV-infected children. These  		rates ranged from $950 to $2,450 monthly. Only one site reimbursed at $2,450,  		and that rate included everything with no supplemental allowances. The other  		six sites averaged $1,150 to $1,200 per month, and many supplement those rates  		with clothing allowances, special equipment or supplies, and, occasionally,  		additional services such as babysitting, in-home assistance, and respite  		care.</p>
<p>Most interviewees felt that the enhanced reimbursement rates were  		necessary to compensate the families for the additional care needed by  		HIV-infected children and played a major role in attracting potential foster  		families. Several persons said that the enhanced rates allowed them to recruit  		specialized and highly qualified homes. Some maintained that the higher rates  		permit foster parents to quit their jobs and provide care as a full-time job,  		thus professionalizing the role of foster parenting.</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>Although all sites visited have been able to recruit adequate numbers of  		foster parents for HIV-infected children, their ability to retain the families  		recruited and to recruit families for the growing number of children in need of  		foster care will depend on continued concentrated recruitment efforts and  		provision of adequate support for those families.</p>
<p>The specialized and targeted recruitment efforts, enhanced reimbursement  		rates, and additional training and education provided have created a highly  		specialized group of foster care homes for HIV-infected children. Interviewees  		expressed concern about how long these homes can continue to take HIV-infected  		children before becoming overwhelmed with the added care needs and the  		emotional burden of dealing with ill and dying children. Efforts have been made  		to provide additional support services; however, there is still an expressed  		need for more services.</p>
<p>Another issue revolves around the conflicting goals of keeping sibling  		groups together and providing specialized care for children who are  		HIV-infected. An HIV-infected child may be one of several siblings, all of whom  		need foster care but not all of whom are HIV-infected. Most sites use  		specialized homes strictly for HIV-infected children, which necessitates  		splitting up the sibling group. Several site interviewees stated that  		circumstances often make it difficult or impossible to keep sibling groups  		together among the foster care population in general.</p>
<p>A related concern centers on the infant who initially tests positive, is  		placed in a specialized home, but after 18 months seroconverts to negative.  		Many sites seek permanent placement, and, in some cases, the current foster  		family decides to adopt the child. If an adoptive placement is not immediately  		available, some sites have a policy of moving the child into a regular foster  		home to free space in the specialized home for another child who is  		HIV-positive and needs the specialized care. One site indicated that the  		current foster family may keep the child and continue to receive the enhanced  		reimbursement rate for up to a year or, in some cases, up to two years after  		the child serconverts to negative.</p>
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p><b>Recommendation 2.1</b></p>
<p><b>State and local foster care placement agencies should develop  		policies for recruiting and retaining foster parents for HIV-infected children.  		Such policies should include provisions for:</b></p>
<ul><li><b>Increased payment structures to encourage the development of  		  specialized, highly skilled homes.</b></li>
<li><b>Active recruitment measures backed by staff support and  		  resources.</b></li>
<li><b>Sibling groups.</b></li>
<li><b>Children who seroconvert to negative.</b></li>
<li><b>Support services aimed at retaining families who have been  		  recruited.</b></li>
</ul><p><b>Recommendation 2.2</b></p>
<p><b>State and local foster care placement agencies should actively plan  		for and implement vigorous recruitment efforts for foster parents to care for  		HIV-infected children.</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendation 2.3</b></p>
<p><b>State and local foster care placement agencies should give  		consideration to the development of a cadre of highly skilled, well trained,  		professional foster parents.</b></p>
<h3>3. What are the gaps in services provided for children  		and foster parents?</h3>
<h4>Importance of Issue</h4>
<p>Services for foster parents and children are important to support  		families and supplement the initial training and agency staff support. Services  		should provide key elements to help recruit new foster parents and retain  		current foster parents.</p>
<p>Services provided for foster parents and children typically fall within  		two broad categories training and supportive services. Training usually occurs  		before a child is placed in a foster family home and also at various times  		afterwards, usually in the form of specialized workshops, in-service training,  		continuing education, or forums for updates on specific topics.</p>
<p>Supportive services are broad in nature and are intended as supplements  		to the basic board and care reimbursement and caseworker services. Supportive  		services range from fiscal support for such items as baby-sitting and  		transportation to support groups, respite care, counseling, and other  		services.</p>
<p>Training for foster parents has been identified as a need within the  		foster care system for several years, and the development of several training  		curricula have been supported at the Federal level. States also have developed  		and mandated both pre-service and in-service training. However, systematic  		training efforts have not been uniform, and many states still have unmet  		training needs.</p>
<p>Supportive services for foster parents and children vary widely across  		states. While some states offer several support elements, others offer only one  		or two. Several support services recently have been identified as essential  		services within the foster care system, particularly when foster parents are  		caring for a child who has HIV infection or other complex medical needs. Mary  		Lee Allen, Director of Child Welfare and Mental Health for the Children's  		Defense Fund, recently testified to this need before the Subcommittee on Human  		Resources, Committee on Ways and Means, in the U.S. House of Representatives.  		Ms. Allen stated,</p>
<blockquote><p> "We, also suggest that consideration be given to extending Federal  		  financial assistance for other critical supports to foster parents.  		  Specifically, we recommend that funds for respite care be made available to  		  foster parents caring for children with special needs.... Foster parents caring  		  for troubled children, such as youths with serious emotional problems, or drug  		  addicted infants and children with HIV-infection or AIDS, need some relief from  		  the full time responsibilities they have assumed...."</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Study Findings</h4>
<p><b>Training</b></p>
<p>Foster parents caring for HIV-infected children receive the general  		foster parent training (pre-service or other training curriculum) with  		additional training specific to HIV infection and AIDS. All study sites had  		implemented some level of a specialized training component focused on the care  		of HIV-infected children. All the agencies visited found it necessary to seek  		nontraditional funding sources to develop the needed training elements or a  		comprehensive training program. Across sites, the development of specialized  		training programs was funded through public and private grants from a variety  		of sources, including the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Health Resources and  		Services Administration (HRSA), Office of Human Development Services (OHDS),  		and private organizations, such as Aetna Life Insurance. Block grants and  		entitlement programs were not used for new training initiatives.</p>
<p>Study sites varied in their methods of providing specialized training  		for the care of HIV-infected children. Several utilized the pre-training or  		foster parent curricula both to recruit specialized foster homes and to train  		prospective families about HIV infection and AIDS. Other sites provided a  		specialized training session focused on HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>Many of the sites worked cooperatively with the local hospitals for  		training related to HIV/AIDS and medical aspects of care. Some hospitals  		provided general courses for foster parents who care for HIV-infected children;  		others provided one-on-one training specific to the medical condition(s) of the  		foster child.</p>
<p>The level of in-service training sessions for foster parents caring for  		HIV-infected children was difficult to determine across all sites. Some sites  		had requirements and forums for an update, while others used the foster parent  		support groups as the forum for in-service training. Other sites required  		in-service training but did not specify topics or sessions for parents caring  		for HIV-infected children.</p>
<p>The sites had developed some level of specialized training for foster  		parents caring for HIV-infected children, and all study sites were planning to  		expand their training efforts. Foster parents and child welfare study  		respondents indicated that additional training was still needed. When foster  		parents expressed a need for additional training, they usually felt their  		training was adequate, but thought that other families could use additional  		training, particularly on medical care aspects of HIV-infected children. The  		majority of the foster parents interviewed had previous experience in a medical  		or health care setting, which may be why they were comfortable with their  		training.</p>
<p>Training topics that the respondents plan to develop or expand include  		death and dying and aspects of medical care for HIV-infected children. Several  		sites, such as Los Angeles and Chicago, will develop expanded training programs  		within the next two years through recently implemented demonstration grants  		(HRSA and OHDS, respectively).</p>
<p><b>Support Services</b></p>
<p>The study sites varied in the number and type of support services  		provided to foster parents who care for HIV-infected children. Several sites  		provided transportation services, support groups, counseling, or 24-hour phone  		support. The services offered varied across sites, and even varied within each  		jurisdiction in cases where multiple agencies were involved with placing  		HIV-infected children in foster care. The study team observed differences in  		the support services offered within the same service delivery area,  		particularly when public and private agencies were compared. Foster families  		were eligible for the support services that were offered by the agency of  		placement.</p>
<p>The study respondents listed several types of support services needed in  		their particular area. These services included:</p>
<ul><li>respite care</li>
<li>24-hour support hotline</li>
<li>babysitting</li>
<li>transportation</li>
<li>in-home health assistance</li>
<li>psychological support (counseling)</li>
<li>additional foster parent support groups</li>
<li>need for a foster parent resource center</li>
<li>support in dealing with death and dying</li>
</ul><p>The most frequently requested need across sites was respite care.  		Respondents were almost unanimous in articulating the critical need for a  		formalized respite care system. Although one or two sites had provided some  		respite services to foster parents, officials stated that these systems were  		not formalized or, in some cases, were only available through collaborative  		efforts (and funding) with other agencies. Several sites said that the major  		reason delaying implementation was funding, either monthly payments to parents  		or actual respite care funding. Further exploration and clarification of  		funding would be required before developing a formal respite care service.</p>
<p>As sites have developed alternative funding sources for recruitment and  		training of foster parents to care for HIV-infected children, support services  		have been targeted for development. The study respondents indicated that the  		ability to recruit and retain the needed number of foster parents in the future  		would be contingent on the available support services and systems available to  		the prospective foster parents. Several sites with demonstration or research  		grants have identified one or more support services for development during the  		grant period.</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>The agencies visited generally bad some level of specialized training  		and support services for foster parents who care for HIV-infected children. In  		most cases, the services and training were developed through the assistance of  		outside funding and grants. The type of training available to parents and the  		number of support services developed within each locale was not uniform across  		or even within sites. In some cases, the support services may not have been  		available to all parents caring for an HIV-infected child if multiple agencies  		were placing children.</p>
<p>Although sites were providing training in cooperation with local  		hospitals and health care providers, a formal training curricula for foster  		parents caring for HIV-infected children often was not available. To further  		develop comprehensive training models for foster parents caring for  		HIV-infected children agencies need to develop training plans that specify the  		type of training, frequency, topic areas, agency responsible for training  		delivery, and other training-related information.</p>
<p>Study findings related to support services provides documentation that  		two key support services are essential for foster parents caring for  		HIV-infected children:</p>
<ul><li>support groups for foster parents caring for HIV-infected children,  		  and</li>
<li>respite care services.</li>
</ul><p>In communities where strong, developed support groups were established,  		foster parents indicated that these were very helpful in providing a forum for  		sharing ideas, information, and concerns and resolving problems. Additionally,  		child welfare officials and foster parents thought the support groups were  		particularly helpful because the group provided a safe forum where common  		issues could be shared without breaching the child's privacy.</p>
<p>All sites highlighted the need for respite care. With the small number  		of currently available homes for placement of HIV-infected children, many  		foster families care for more than one child. In some cases, additional  		children have been placed in a home after a child with AIDS has died. Respite  		care would allow the foster parents some time away from the child (or  		children). Respite care could also be used after a death of a child, when other  		children are in the home. Many agencies are convinced that the time away from  		care responsibilities contributes to longer term retention of these foster  		families.</p>
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p><b>Recommendation 3.1 (Training)</b></p>
<p><b>All foster care agencies involved in recruiting foster parents and  		placing HIV-infected children in those homes should have a clearly defined  		training program that specifies:</b></p>
<ul><li><b>type of training the foster parent will receive</b></li>
<li><b>intervals for training and updates</b></li>

<h3>4. What role do extended family members have in  		providing foster care and what are the implications for HIV-infected  		children?</h3>
<h4>Importance of Issue</h4>
<p>Child welfare personnel at all sites visited stated that the "tended  		family is the first choice for placement of a child in need of foster care.  		They think it is more desirable for a child to be with relatives than with  		strangers. Extended family was defined as a relation up to and including a  		first cousin; usually it is the grandmother or aunt of the child. These  		families often require financial support for the care of these children. In the  		case of an HIV-infected child, the aging grandmother generally is the family  		member who volunteers to care for the child.</p>
<p>In many cases, extended family caretakers are poor and may be unable to  		provide optimal care. The physical, financial and emotional strain on the  		grandmother managing a sick grandchild, and perhaps her own child, demands  		greater involvement and interaction on the part of child welfare agencies.</p>
<h4>Study Findings</h4>
<p>Sites took different approaches in licensing and reimbursing family  		caretakers. A significant percentage of children were placed with extended  		family members at all sites visited; however, sites varied in the extent of  		foster care reimbursement offered.</p>
<p>The study team found that the percentage of children in relative  		placements ranged from 10 percent at one site to as high as 45 percent at  		another. The licensure requirements for the relative homes varied as well. The  		requirements were minimal, with no licensing requirements (or subsequent  		reimbursement), to specified licensure criteria and reimbursement that was used  		for all other types of foster parents. One site required licensure of extended  		family members only if the family member was beyond the level of a first  		cousin. Two sites required licensure for all extended family members serving as  		a foster parent.</p>
<p>Reimbursement also varied across sites. One study site did not require  		licensure for reimbursement to extended family foster families; another locale  		had the option of reimbursement open to extended family members serving as  		foster parents.</p>
<p>Staff from the medical centers caring for HIV-infected children found  		that 20 to 40 percent of the children they served were placed with an extended  		family member. In some cases, the hospital staff had worked out the placement  		of the child with the relative. In most of these cases, the family members were  		not being reimbursed for the care they provided.</p>
<p>The desire to use extended family members to care for HIV-infected  		children has led to many informal and innovative approaches by the social  		service staffs of major medical centers with large pediatric AIDS clinics.  		These medical centers can assist the extended family caretakers, often an aging  		grandmother, with ancillary services, such as respite care, day care, and  		transportation, and can assist these relatives in obtaining the necessary  		foster care licensing and reimbursement.</p>
<p>The concept of utilizing extended family members to care for children  		who lose their parents is not a new concept and is widely accepted within many  		communities. However, for many the extended family caretakers financial  		resources may be inadequate and added support services may be necessary. It is  		also important that extended family members meet the same criteria for  		licensing that non-family members must meet. Child welfare agencies must be  		able to provide support to assist with the caretaker responsibility.</p>
<p>As the AIDS epidemic progresses, more and more children with HIV  		infection will require alternate caretakers. Their parents will die from AIDS  		or abandon them. To increase the pool of foster families able to care for  		HIV-infected children, child welfare organizations should further develop  		efforts related to licensing, reimbursement, and placement of HIV-infected  		children with extended family members.</p>
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p><b>Recommendation 4.1</b></p>
<p><b>State child welfare agencies should license and reimburse extended  		family members as caretakers of HIV-infected children.</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendation 4.2</b></p>
<p><b>State child welfare agencies should make provisions for supplying  		ancillary services such as day care, respite care, transportation, and  		homemakers to extended family caregivers.</b></p>
<h3>5. Are congregate care living arrangements for  		HIV-infected children used appropriately?</h3>
<h4>Importance of Issue</h4>
<p>Concern has been raised that, because of inadequate foster home  		recruitment efforts, group homes have been used as an alternative for  		HIV-infected children who, consequently, will not benefit from the family-like  		settings they deserve. An underlying concern is that sick and dying children  		are not afforded the same quality of care as other foster children and are  		relegated to less optimal forms of care.</p>
<p>It is a generally held value that children who are under the  		guardianship of the state deserve to live in a family-like setting.  		Institutionalized or congregate care is considered a less desirable option.  		Child welfare advocates have worked hard over the past 15 years to keep  		children out of the less nurturing environment of group care and to provide  		more foster home care, with the goal of permanent placement through adoption or  		return to the natural family. Group homes as a placement alternative have not  		been totally eliminated and are considered appropriate placements under certain  		circumstances. Children who have special medical needs that cannot always be  		provided at home may be considered better off in group home situations than in  		large institutions, and teens with severe behavior problems are sometimes  		handled better in group home situations than in individual homes. However, HIV  		infection is not considered a circumstance that requires placement in a group  		home.</p>
<h4>Study Findings</h4>
<p>Most HIV-infected children have been placed in foster family homes. Many  		sites visited also have placed children in congregate care facilities. Several  		congregate care homes have been established within the last year, which may  		indicate a trend towards wider acceptance of this option. There is no  		accounting of the number of congregate care homes in operation, but the numbers  		appear to be increasing. There are, nevertheless, strongly held attitudes  		toward congregate care and the role it should play in the continuum of  		placement options for HIV-infected children.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics of Congregate Care</b></p>
<p>The congregate care homes operating in the sites visited varied by type,  		intended function, and size. All facilities initially were opened to serve as  		temporary placements until a foster care home could be found. Many were  		established in response to the problem or potential problem of boarder  		babies.</p>
<p>Although most of the congregate care homes indicated that their intent  		was to serve children on a temporary basis (30-90 days), in practice, children  		often end up staying longer -- sometimes as long as a year.</p>
<p>Only one of the congregate care facilities considered long-term  		placement an appropriate option. This facility reported that a few of the  		children there came from "failed" foster home placements.</p>
<p>One congregate care facility was established as a respite care facility  		for biological parents who intended to bring their child home but, who, for a  		variety of reasons, found they were unequipped or unable to care for the child.  		Parents are expected to visit their children at this facility regularly and are  		encouraged to take the children home for several days a week. This facility was  		designed to meet the needs of the family. It has been used by the local foster  		care agency to place children who are medically ready for discharge but for  		whom foster families are not yet available.</p>
<p>The capacity of the congregate care homes visited ranged from 6-24 beds,  		and most had 9 or fewer. Most of the sites using congregate care as a placement  		option for HIV-infected children also use congregate care as a temporary  		placement for the general foster care population.</p>
<p>As an alternative to congregate care, some sites are using specialized  		foster home placements in which as many as six HIV-infected children are  		placed. The number of children is limited only by the size of the home in which  		they are placed. In terms of size, these homes approximate congregate care  		living situations; however, the institutionalized element is diminished by the  		presence of one or two unit "<em>parents</em>" and usually a full-time  		assistant to whom the children relate as opposed to general staff.</p>
<p><b>Attitudes Toward Congregate Care</b></p>
<p>A variety of attitudes towards the concept of congregate care for  		HIV-infected children was expressed during the site visits. Several persons  		were adamantly opposed to congregate care homes as a placement option and felt  		that option would not be necessary if adequate efforts were made to recruit  		foster care homes. According to this perspective, HIV-infected children deserve  		to have individual attention from one primary person to whom the child could  		become attached. Others viewed congregate care homes as appropriate for  		temporary placements, but acknowledged that temporary placements all too easily  		can extend to long-term placements. The pressure to find a foster home  		placement is somewhat eased if the child can at least be discharged from the  		hospital when medically ready.</p>
<p>Persons at sites with specialized foster homes for larger groups of  		children (six or more) felt that these homes were substantively and  		philosophically different than congregate care homes since the children are in  		a family setting with one primary person caring for them.</p>
<p>Some persons interviewed felt that the focus should not be on the type  		of care but rather on the quality of care provided and felt that, for some  		children, congregate care was the best option. A few hospital staff members  		reported that the children they followed who had been placed in congregate care  		were thriving and receiving excellent quality care.</p>
<p>Several people identified specialized purposes that congregate care  		homes could serve. Congregate care homes could be used as a training ground for  		potential foster parents and help ease them into their responsibilities. These  		homes also could be used as respite care facilities for foster care parents,  		although this assumes that some beds would be set aside for this purpose. It  		was also felt that because of the caliber of the staff and their training,  		congregate care homes were better equipped to handle the children who were ill  		and required more medical involvement.</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>Although respondents at almost all sites said that their congregate care  		facilities for HIV-infected children were intended for temporary or  		transitional care while foster homes are being sought, the length of stays  		reported indicate that many, in fact, are being used as longer-term placements  		instead. That more facilities are being established may indicate that  		congregate care is being considered an appropriate placement option for this  		population. Whereas these facilities may be needed to help avoid the problem of  		boarder babies in hospitals, congregate care facilities also may serve as a  		disincentive to foster care agencies to undertake more rigorous recruitment  		efforts for foster family homes.</p>
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p><b>Recommendation 5.1</b></p>
<p><b>Congregate care homes should be used only to provide services and  		meet needs that foster family homes <u>cannot</u> meet. If these facilities are  		to be used for temporary placements, limits should be set, and stringently  		followed, as to how long a child will be placed there. This approach assumes  		that sites institute rigorous efforts to recruit foster family homes to keep  		temporary placements from becoming long-term placements.</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendation 5.2</b></p>
<p><b>State/local foster care agencies should assess the need for  		intermediate care (e.g., pediatric skilled nursing facilities) for the severely  		medically involved HIV-infected child as part of the continuum of care for this  		population. This type of facility should be used as an option to in-patient  		hospital care. It should not take the place of foster family homes or be  		considered an option to placing a child with a family. Many medically involved  		children can and should be cared for in the home with adequate training and  		support.</b></p>
<h3>6. Should there be HIV antibody testing of all at-risk  		children in foster care?</h3>
<h4>Importance of Issue</h4>
<p>The importance of HIV antibody testing for foster children can be viewed  		from the perspective both of the system and of the child. From a systems  		standpoint, the testing of children ensures that the number of HIV seropositive  		children will be known, an adequate number of specialized foster parents can be  		recruited, the children can be linked with the appropriate services, and  		agencies can use the data on the HIV-infected children to plan adequately for  		services, staff, and other resources.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the child, early identification of HIV allows  		for appropriate medical treatment, placement with a family that has specialized  		training, and access to treatment regimens that may prevent or delay  		symptoms.</p>
<p>Many groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on  		Pediatric AIDS, do not recommend widespread testing of all infants and children  		awaiting adoption or foster placement. Testing of foster care children in  		"populations that have high seropositive prevalence among women of childbearing  		age" is, however, recommended.</p>
<p>For foster care officials to know the number of HIV-infected children in  		placement and in need of placement, there must be a mechanism for testing. The  		testing will determine the number of children who are identified as HIV  		seropositive and, therefore, need to be placed within a specialized foster  		family home.</p>
<h4>Study Findings</h4>
<p>All sites were working within the parameters of an HIV antibody testing  		policy for children who were entering, or were in, the foster care system.  		Policies for testing the HIV status of children in the foster care system were  		developed within the context of pertinent state and local laws. As an example,  		one site stated they were unable to test children at risk because of their  		state's restrictive HIV antibody testing policies. Conversely, a second site  		was located in a state where physicians may test for the HIV antibody without  		informed consent. In this case, the child welfare agency received reports of  		children who tested HIV-seropositive.</p>
<p>Although the specifics of the policies varied across the sites, key  		elements of the testing policies included determination of need for testing,  		consent procedures, and confidentiality provisions.</p>
<p><b>Determination of Need for HIV Antibody Testing</b></p>
<p>Medical necessity was identified by all sites as a necessary condition  		for testing. It is typically documented by a physician or other medical  		professional. In some cases, policies stated that the documentation of signs  		and symptoms could be used to indicate testing for HIV antibodies.</p>
<p>In a few sites, the frequency with which officials documented the need  		to test children influenced the "practice" of how that policy was followed. As  		officials became more comfortable with the criteria and procedures for need  		documentation, the interpretation of the criteria became more flexible. In some  		cases, additional factors relating to the testing decision were considered.</p>
<p>All sites also used some determination of "risk" as a key determinant  		for testing. Risk factors could be defined in terms of the parent or child.  		Common risk factors included the following: known HIV status of the parent;  		parental death from AIDS; sexual abuse by an HIV-seropositive individual;  		parental whereabouts unknown, but parent known to be at risk; use of  		intravenous drugs; and others.</p>
<p><b>Consent</b></p>
<p>Several sites had consent procedures related to HIV antibody testing.  		The consent for testing may require parental or court consent. At one site, the  		consent order specified the individuals who were to be informed of the test  		results. Two sites had developed consent procedures specific to adolescents.  		Additionally, several sites used a type of "review team" composed of medical  		and child welfare representatives as a minimal core group to review requests  		for HIV testing.</p>
<p><b>Confidentiality</b></p>
<p>Maintaining confidentiality as it relates to testing and test results  		was addressed by all sites as they developed and implemented testing policies.  		The sites viewed confidentiality from the perspective of the agency, community,  		and child. Disclosure policies, part of the broader concept of confidentiality,  		were documented by several of the sites. Sites developed disclosure policies  		around the concept of individuals who have "a need to know" the test results.  		Sites varied in specifying the individuals who should be informed of HIV test  		results and the mechanisms for informing them.</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>The potential benefits to the foster care system and the child's health  		provide compelling reasons to test all at-risk children in foster care. Such a  		decision would need to be guided by careful consideration of the complex issues  		it raises. The key elements to consider when developing a testing policy  		include:</p>
<ul><li>state laws related to HIV antibody testing</li>
<li>adequacy of the confidentiality laws in place -- the need for  		  additional laws/procedures for foster children</li>
<li>conditions under which a child should be tested</li>
<li>determination of who can request an HIV antibody test, eg., foster  		  parent, physician, natural parents, or adolescents (and at what age)</li>
<li>confidentiality</li>
<li>determination of who has the right to be informed of test  		  results</li>
<li>the role of pre- and post-test counseling</li>
</ul><p>As agencies explore these elements, they should consider the broad and  		long-range implications of HIV antibody testing. A policy to test foster  		children for the HIV antibody implies that there are benefits to testing, that  		certain individuals have a right to know the test results, and that support  		services, treatment linkages and specialized foster home placements or a system  		of care will be available to these children.</p>
<p>As child welfare agencies begin to implement an HIV antibody testing  		policy for children who are placed in foster care, fiscal issues become  		important. The fiscal implications of policies and procedures are critical  		aspects to the delivery of services within the foster care system. Most child  		welfare agencies have seen dramatic increases in caseloads, staff (caseworker)  		shortages, and tight budgets. HIV antibody testing of at-risk children may  		reveal that these systems are serving many more children who are  		HIV-seropositive who otherwise might not have been identified for a period of  		time. This awareness will place increased demands on staffing, funding for  		support services, and foster parent reimbursement dollars.</p>
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p><b>Recommendation 6.1</b></p>
<p><b>All child welfare agencies placing foster care children should  		develop HIV antibody testing policies for children who are currently in  		placement or entering the system for placement. The policies should include, at  		a minimum, the following elements:</b></p>
<ul><li><b>the medical necessity for testing</b></li>
<li><b>specification of at-risk criteria (child or parent  		  at-risk)</b></li>
<li><b>informed consent mechanism</b></li>
<li><b>mechanism for adolescent informed consent </b></li>
<li><b>mechanism to review all testing requests</b></li>
<li><b>specification of individuals who may receive the test  		  results</b></li>
<li><b>confidentiality provisions</b></li>
<li><b>pre- and post-test counseling requirements</b></li>
</ul><p><b>All policies should be developed with the assistance of medical care  		and/or public health providers within the context of applicable state  		laws.</b></p>
<p>Organizations that have developed HIV antibody testing policies  		encompassing the elements listed above, may wish to review their policies and  		incorporate additional procedures to strengthen it. In a recent article in  		<b><i>Pediatrics</i></b>, the American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on  		Pediatric AIDS, in their discussion of the role of testing within the foster  		care and adoption system, recommended incorporating additional procedures  		within existing testing policies. They suggested that agencies should:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>establish a process that would accomplish, with appropriate consent,  			 pre-placement HIV testing of infants or children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish a record-keeping system to contain test results with  			 access to such information strictly limited to those who need to know, but  			 specifically including the informed adoptive or foster care family and the  			 physician responsible for the infant's medical care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish a procedure for retesting infants who have positive  			 antibody results on a regular basis</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>7. Are HIV-infected children in foster care enrolled in  		experimental drug trials?</h3>
<h4>Importance of Issue</h4>
<p>Many of the children with AIDS and HIV infection are or will become  		wards or dependents of their foster care systems. Many issues have been raised  		concerning the participation of these children in pharmacologic treatment  		protocols, or experimental drug trials. The issues include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>What are "protocols," "treatments," and "experimental  			 trials?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are HIV-infected children in foster care not participating in  			 treatment protocols and experimental drug trials because they are wards of the  			 state?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the benefits and risks of participating in treatment  			 protocols and experimental drug trials?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How have different jurisdictions managed the issue of HIV-infected  			 children in foster care participating in treatment protocols and experimental  			 drug trials?</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In 1988, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases  		began funding 12 clinical centers to provide drugs to HIV-infected children  		under scientifically controlled protocols within major medical centers. The  		primary drug being administered is azidothymidine (AZT). However, this is not  		the first use of pharmacologic agents in HIV-infected children. Since 1982,  		immune-enhancing biologics, specifically gamma globulins, have been used to  		treat HIV-infected symptomatic and asymptomatic children. The National  		Institutes of Health is expanding the focus of its experimental trials from  		large medical centers to include local, community-based facilities, including  		groups of local physicians. New treatments and experimental trials soon will be  		widely available to many HIV-infected children.</p>
<p><b>Terminology</b></p>
<p>Misunderstood terminology often clouds the discussions about  		HIV-infected children in foster care who are in treatment and experimental drug  		trials. A "protocol" is an agreed-upon set of procedures and guidelines that  		defines the use of a biologic or pharmacologic agent. Protocols vary and may  		refer to a standard treatment or experimental drug.</p>
<p>A "treatment" is a biologic agent or drug which has been shown to be  		effective for the management of a specific medical problem and is an accepted  		patient management process for the general medical community. Gamma globulin  		has been shown to be effective in boosting the immune response of treated  		patients and is, for example, standard treatment after exposure to hepatitis.  		Such immune-enhancing agents are being administered to people with HIV  		infection to help combat the syndrome's underlying immune suppression.</p>
<p>"Experimental trials" are studies that follow scientifically formulated  		protocols and into which participants enter as subjects. The end point of an  		experimental trial can be the defining of the toxicity, side effects, and  		efficacy of the agent under study. All experimental trials must have the  		approval of a local institutional review board, composed of scientists,  		ethicists, clergy, and community members. Classically, participants do not know  		whether they are receiving the agent under study or the placebo. The lethal  		nature of the AIDS epidemic has led to a modification of the protocols for  		experimental trials to allow, in some studies, the elimination of the placebo  		or control group.</p>
<p>There is a level of concern and ambiguity because of the use of agents  		and drugs in children. For example, although gamma globulin is a standard  		treatment agent, the appropriate long-term dosage for children with symptomatic  		or asymptomatic HIV infection is not known, nor is the efficacy in slowing the  		progression of HIV infection known. Thus, there are "treatment" trials  		comparing the relationship of different doses of gamma globulin. Some may  		define this as a "treatment" protocol, whereas others may define this as an  		"experimental trial."</p>
<p><b>State Laws</b></p>
<p>In many states, child protection laws provide mechanisms for consent for  		standard medical treatment for children in foster care. The laws usually focus  		on standard medical treatment or practice. At this time there are no standard  		treatments for HIV-infected children, and although many drugs and agents are  		under study most state laws proscribe consent procedures for standard treatment  		and not experimental trials. A recent study by Sacks and Martin (1989)  		determined how state agencies and pediatric AIDS investigators were dealing  		with the issue of foster care and clinical trials. Thirty-five of 51 states and  		territories responded to the survey. They reported a cumulative total of  		189,326 children in foster care, approximately 753 HIV-infected children in  		foster care, and approximately 15 HIV-infected children involved in a clinical  		trial. Seven states had a policy that allowed participation of their wards or  		dependent children in clinical trials, and 28 states reported no policy. Most  		states and local jurisdictions are very sensitive to their guardianship  		responsibility for their dependents. They are also concerned about the  		liability issues related to participation in treatment and experimental  		protocols.</p>
<p><b>Benefits and Risks</b></p>
<p>There are benefits and risks to be considered in involving a child in a  		treatment or experimental protocol. The drugs and biologics administered in  		these trials are on the cutting edge of AIDS research and medical treatment,  		and participation in the protocols is required to receive the agents. In  		addition, the medical centers carrying out the treatment and experimental  		protocols are also primary AIDS resource centers, with additional funds from  		Federal, state, and private agencies. Enrollment in a protocol guarantees the  		availability of many health and social service services and benefits, e.g,  		respite care, day care, travel allowances, support groups, comprehensive  		medical care, case management, and family-focused services. A primary risk of  		involving HIV-infected children in foster care is the potential toxicity of the  		administered agent or of children receiving only placebo or non-therapeutic  		doses of the agent and, thus, receiving little or no benefit from  		participation. In addition, the schedule related to a child's participation in  		a protocol can create a significant time and logistical burden for the foster  		parent. Finally, there is a fear of racial or ethnic stigmatization, namely  		that these children, who are overwhelmingly from minority communities, will be  		enrolled in studies and protocols as "guinea pigs" and have no guardianship  		protection from abuse during the studies.</p>
<h4>Study Findings</h4>
<p>One state has created an innovative system to protect the rights of  		children in foster care. Its AIDS Review Board provides a formal forum for  		establishing linkages between key government agencies and community groups  		dealing with HIV and foster care issues. The Board composition includes broad  		representation from social service, public health, community, and nonprofit  		foster care agencies, as well as legal counsel. (See the Massachusetts site  		visit summary for a complete listing of the Review Board's constituency.) The  		appropriate use of HIV antibody testing on children in foster care was the  		primary impetus for creating the Board, but it now reviews clinical trial  		protocols to determine if HIV-infected foster children will be approved for  		participation. The AIDS Review Board has approved both AZT and gamma globulin  		clinical protocols. Once a protocol is approved,-foster children must be  		approved on a case-by-case basis to participate (see Massachusetts site visit  		summary).</p>
<p>Another state visited is typical of the majority of states: at present,  		it has no policy regarding the participation of foster children in clinical  		trials, and no foster children are enrolled in treatment or experimental  		protocols. The state has the authority to provide consent for medical treatment  		for ordinary and routine care, but a court order is necessary for extraordinary  		care. The definitions of these categories are often ambiguous.</p>
<p>Another state currently has no clinical trials in progress and has not  		developed a policy specific to foster children participating in such trials.  		However, the state has identified the need for an institutional review board  		that would review treatment and experimental trials, as well as HIV testing and  		medical resuscitation orders.</p>
<p>Overall, the lack of policies for the participation of HIV-infected  		foster care children in treatment and experimental protocols has not allowed  		many of these children access to new and innovative medical management and  		accompanying ancillary services.</p>
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p><b>Recommendation 7.1</b></p>
<p><b>State and local child welfare agencies should create systems to  		manage the participation of children in foster care in special medical  		treatment and experimental trials. These systems should address the rights of  		the biologic parent(s), methods of protocol review, ongoing evaluation of the  		protocols, privacy, methods to safeguard children from potential abuse,  		guardianship responsibilities, and reduction of liability issues. Ideally, a  		broad coalition of representatives from AIDS and child welfare organizations  		should approve protocols and create exemplary approaches for the participation  		of children in protocols and experimental trials.</b></p>
<h3>8. What is the "boarder baby" problem, how serious is it  		and what is its relationship to the HIV epidemic?</h3>
<h4>Importance of Issue</h4>
<p>"Boarder-baby" is a term that has been coined to describe the infant or  		child who remains in the hospital although determined medically ready for  		discharge. The reasons for boarder babies have included: the parent(s) have  		abandoned the child and a foster home is not available; the natural parents are  		available but not prepared to take the child home (e.g., because the parent is  		incarcerated, homeless, in drug rehabilitation program or hospitalized); and  		institutional or procedural problems or issues.</p>
<p>When the boarder baby problem was first publicized several years ago,  		the focus was on the role of HIV infection in creating the problem. The  		continuing problem of HIV-infected boarder babies has been mentioned by several  		hospital representatives in New York City. However, Child Welfare agency  		representatives report very few HIV-infected hospital boarder babies.</p>
<p>An exploratory study of pediatric AIDS issues conducted by ASPE  		attempted to describe the boarder baby problem (Margolis, 1988). The study  		determined that, in addition to HIV-infected infants, the boarder baby  		population included infants with perinatal drug addiction, chronically mentally  		or physically ill children, and other children with special needs. Further, the  		problem appeared to be concentrated in New York City. Other areas experienced  		some problems but to a much lesser degree.</p>
<h4>Study Findings</h4>
<p>During the site visits the study team concentrated on determining the  		current number of boarder babies the site had compared to two years ago, the  		number of HIV-infected boarder babies in relation to the total number, how the  		site defined "boarder baby," identified reasons for boarders, and future  		problems expected.</p>
<p><b>Number of Boarder Babies</b></p>
<p>Almost all sites visited could only provide estimates of the numbers of  		boarder babies currently and two years ago. New York has set up a tracking  		system so was able to provide more concrete numbers. At several sites,  		interviewees did not concur about the exact number of boarder babies.</p>
<p>In terms of current problems with boarder babies, New York represented  		the extreme with as many as 158 boarders at one time, 4 of whom were  		HIV-infected. Other sites reported only three or fewer HIV-infected boarders in  		the last two years.</p>
<p>Some sites indicated that HIV-infected children are the only boarder  		babies they have encountered, while other sites indicated that the problem was  		not isolated to HIV-infected children but included other special-needs  		children. In those sites, the majority of boarders were not HIV-infected.</p>
<p>All sites indicated that the boarder baby problem was more acute two  		years ago than it is now. New York, then reportedly had boarder babies  		numbering several hundred. The greatest number any other site reported was 14,  		all of whom were HIV-infected.</p>
<p><b>Definitions</b></p>
<p>All sites defined boarder babies similarly: children who are medically  		ready for discharge but remain in the hospital because of a lack of placement.  		However, interviewees did not always agree about when a specific case was  		medically ready for discharge. A few said that while the attending physician  		may determine a patient medically ready for discharge, this decision can  		sometimes be influenced by the need for beds and the need to keep the average  		length of hospital stay within the diagnosis-related-group (DRG) defined  		limits. There was some indication that the hospital caseworker and/or foster  		care agency caseworker did not always agree with the physician's decision.</p>
<p>Some hospital boarding situations were attributed to a desire to keep  		the child from entering into the foster care system while the natural parents  		made arrangements to take the child home or get an extended family member to  		take the child on an informal basis.</p>
<p>Another factor in keeping some children in the hospital longer than  		medically necessary may relate to a physician's lack of confidence in the  		ability of the foster care system to find a suitable placement for the child.  		That is, a child may be ready to leave the hospital, but is classified by the  		physician as requiring additional hospitalization. In such a case, the  		physician may think of the child as a boarder baby but does not initiate a  		request for placement.</p>
<p>Interviewees identified other procedural practices as contributing to  		the boarder baby problem, namely, initiating a home search only after the child  		is determined medically ready for discharge, which unnecessarily prolongs the  		hospital stay while placement arrangements are made.</p>
<p>Reasons cited for the lack of a boarder baby problem or the reduction in  		the problem within the last few years included the following:</p>
<ul><li>Instituting a tracking system.</li>
<li>Effective and early discharge planning that included hospital social  		  work staff and agency caseworkers.</li>
<li>Existence/creation of group homes and transitional facilities.</li>
<li>Efforts to keep children with natural families or find extended  		  family members.</li>
</ul><p><b>Future Problems</b></p>
<p>Although most sites were not experiencing problems with boarder babies,  		all expressed concern about the potential problems because of increasing  		numbers of medically fragile infants, especially drug-addicted infants, and the  		increasing numbers of HIV-infected children. Many interviewees said there was a  		need for intermediate care for HIV-infected and symptomatic children whose  		health care needs are greater than can be provided in a home environment but  		not severe enough to warrant hospitalization.</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>The HIV epidemic does not appear to be causing a boarder baby problem in  		any of the sites visited. With the exception of New York, the boarder baby  		problem in general is minimal. It is important to note that most sites did not  		have exact figures for the number of boarder babies, and there was not always  		agreement among interviewees at a particular site about what the estimated  		number was.</p>
<p>It is inappropriate for even one child to be kept in the hospital  		without medical need and to rely on the hospital environment as a sole source  		of care and nurturing. However, to concentrate legislative and financial  		responses on the boarder baby issue alone would detract from the other far more  		serious and immediate issues and needs of HIV-infected children.</p>
<p>The fact that the boarder baby problem exists in New York and that all  		jurisdictions experienced greater problems during the earlier days of the AIDS  		epidemic and fear future problems points to the role of the boarder baby  		problem as an early warning signal of foster care placement problems.</p>
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p><b>Recommendation 8.1</b></p>
<p><b>To minimize present and future boarder baby problems, state and local  		foster care systems should assure early identification of hospitalized children  		in need of placement. Such provisions should include:</b></p>
<ul><li><b>a case management function</b></li>
<li><b>tracking system</b></li>
<li><b>collaboration and cooperation with hospital staff</b></li>
</ul><h3>9. What are the issues surrounding HIV-infected  		adolescents?</h3>
<h4>Importance of Issue</h4>
<p>Little is known about the number of HIV-infected adolescents in foster  		care and their medical needs. The CDC surveillance definition for reported AIDS  		cases is divided into two categories: children under the age of 13 and  		adults/adolescents. As of July 1989, there have been 1,681 reported AIDS cases  		in children under the age of 13 and 98,255 cases in adults/adolescents.  		Identifying the number of adolescents with AIDS is based on the age range  		defined for them. If we use 13 to 19 as the age range for adolescents, there  		have been approximately 300 cumulative cases of AIDS. If we add the number of  		young adults, aged 20 to 24, who almost certainly would have acquired AIDS  		during their teen years, there are an additional 3,500 cumulative cases of  		AIDS. Finally, as more effective drugs extend the lives of HIV-infected people,  		more children will be surviving and moving into adolescence.</p>
<h4>Study Findings</h4>
<p>The numbers of adolescents with HIV infection who are dependents of the  		state are not known with precision. All of the sites visited had minimal  		knowledge of how many of their adolescents were HIV-infected. However, all  		sites saw the infected adolescent as a significant future problem for the AIDS  		epidemic. Issues related to the HIV-infected adolescent who is in foster care  		include: acting out behavior, prostitution, drug-use, teenage pregnancy,  		running away, homelessness, lack of placements, and issues of testing and  		specialized counseling.</p>
<p>The testing issue is of special significance since, in most of the  		jurisdictions where site visits took place, an adolescent aged 12-13 may  		personally consent to being tested.</p>
<p>HIV antibody test results may affect residential or vocational placement  		of an adolescent. For example, the Job Corps program is a career-focused  		placement for adolescents. However, if a Job Corps candidate is  		HIV-seropositive, or if a Job Corps participant is found to be seropositive,  		the person is separated from the Corps directly or can lose their  		Corps-provided residence, which effectively results in separation.</p>
<p>A concern expressed repeatedly by state child welfare personnel is the  		potential liability posed by acting out HIV-infected adolescent wards of the  		state who may infect others.</p>
<p>Although the site visits focused on HIV-infected infants and children,  		several initiatives for HIV-infected adolescents did emerge during discussions.  		In one site, the child welfare agency works very closely with the Department of  		Public Health in dealing with HIV-infected adolescents. For example, a  		counselor from Public Health has been assigned to counsel, on an ongoing basis,  		an infected older adolescent about risky behaviors and the need for behavior  		change. A second site used a private provider who has created two six-bed  		private homes to care for adolescents who define themselves as gay or lesbian,  		have need for intensive psychosocial services, and may be HIV-seropositive. In  		addition, this agency recruits, trains, and maintains ties with foster care  		families for placement of its adolescents.</p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>The HIV-infected adolescent can pose significant problems. Adolescence  		is a time of acting out and experimentation. For the HIV-infected adolescent,  		the acting out and experimenting can be harmful to themselves and others.</p>
<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<p><b>Recommendation 9.1</b></p>
<p><b>State and local foster care agencies should undertake efforts to  		determine the number of HIV-infected adolescents in their care and their  		special problems and issues. Such an effort should include input from other  		government agencies and community groups with expertise in adolescent  		issues.</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendation 9.2</b></p>
<p><b>More studies should be initiated at the national level to define the  		breadth and scope of the problem of HIV infection in adolescents.</b></p>
