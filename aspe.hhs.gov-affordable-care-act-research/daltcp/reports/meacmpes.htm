<p><i>The "activities of daily living," or ADLs, are the basic tasks of  		  everyday life, such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, and transferring.

As small as these differences are in absolute  		  terms, they can be large in percent differences across surveys.

<p>--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---</p>
<p>The term "activities of daily living," or ADLs, refers to the basic  		tasks of everyday life, such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, and  		transferring. When people are unable to perform these activities, they need  		help in order to cope, either from other human beings or mechanical devices or  		both. Although persons of all ages may have problems performing the ADLs,  		prevalence rates are much higher for the elderly than for the nonelderly.  		Within the elderly population, ADL prevalence rates rise steeply with advancing  		age and are especially high for persons aged 85 and over (Rivlin and Wiener,  		1988).</p>
<p>Measurement of the activities of daily living is critical because they  		have been found to be significant predictors of admission to a nursing home  		(Branch and Jette, 1982); use of paid home care (Garber, 1989; Soldo and  		Manton, 1985); use of hospital services (Branch, Jette, and Evashwick, 1981;  		Wan and Odell, 1981); living arrangements (Bishop, 1986); use of physician  		services (Wan and Odell, 1981); insurance coverage (Dunlop, Wells, and  		Wilensky, 1989); and mortality (Manton, 1988). For research on the elderly, the  		ability to perform the ADLs has become a standard variable to include in  		analyses, just like age, sex, marital status, and income.</p>
<p>Estimates of the number and characteristics of people with problems  		performing ADLs are also important because of the increasing number of private  		long-term care insurance policies and proposed public long-term care insurance  		programs that rely on ADL measures to determine whether an individual qualifies  		for benefits. For example, private insurance policies sold by John Hancock,  		Aetna, Travelers, Metropolitan Life, and CNA rely on ADL measures as a trigger  		for benefits (Van Gelder and Johnson, 1989). All of the proposed public  		insurance plans, including those introduced by Senators George Mitchell and  		Edward Kennedy and by Representatives Henry Waxman, Fortney "Pete" Stark, and  		Claude Pepper, do the same. Obviously, the amount of long-term care benefits  		paid out by such private and public plans will largely depend on the number of  		persons who meet the various ADL eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>A number of national surveys which measure the ability of elderly people  		to perform the ADLs have been conducted. A legitimate question is whether these  		diverse surveys produce consistent estimates. A cursory glance at some recent  		studies suggests that this is not the case. For example, one analysis using the  		1984 National Long-Term Care Survey reported that there were 3.0 million  		elderly with impairments in one or more ADLs (Manton, 1988); while another  		study using the Supplement on Aging found 6.0 million impaired elderly (Kasper,  		1988). Yet another study using the 1984 Survey of Income and Program  		Participation identified only 1.5 million elderly with "personal care needs," a  		concept roughly comparable to requiring help with the ADLs (U.S. Bureau of the  		Census, 1986). The very wide differences in the cost estimates for Rep. Claude  		Pepper's long-term home care bill, H.R.3436, between the U.S. Congressional  		Budget Office and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, served to  		focus attention on the inconsistency of the ADL estimates across surveys.</p>
<p>In May 1988, the federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics  		decided to systematically examine the surveys measuring ADLs and to try to  		discover the reasons for the varying estimates. A Committee on Estimates of  		Activities of Daily Living in National Surveys, including government and  		nongovernment experts familiar with the different surveys, was formed to study  		the issue. This article is based on the report of that committee.</p>
<h2>DEFINITION AND HISTORY</h2>
<p>General measures of health status, such as diagnoses or medical  		conditions, are limited indicators of the independence and functional  		capabilities of an individual (Fillenbaum, 1984; Kane and Kane, 1981).  		Therefore, researchers have devoted considerable attention to developing  		measures that tap practical dimensions of everyday life as a way of measuring a  		persons functional status. The ADLs are increasingly being used to  		measure disability. They are key elements in efforts to measure quality of life  		and functional status (Spitzer, 1987).</p>
<p>The term activities of daily living refers to a set of  		common, everyday tasks, performance of which is required for personal self-care  		and independent living. The most often used measure of functional ability is  		the Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale (Katz et al., 1963; Katx, 1983). In  		this scale, the set of tasks assessed are bathing, dressing, transferring,  		using the toilet, continence, and eating. A theoretical basis for selecting  		these functions is that they represent milestones in the sociobiological  		development of self-care independence in children (Katz and Akpom, 1976). Its  		original purpose was to differentiate physical functional abilities among  		rehabilitation and recuperating patients.</p>
<p>Over the years, a number of other measures of physical dysfunction which  		cover tasks similar to the Katz ADL Scale have been introduced (Kane and Kane,  		1981; McDowell and Newell, 1987). There are more than 43 different published  		indexes that assess ADLs in both patients and populations (Feinstein, Josephy,  		and Wells, 1986). Most of these other measures of ADLs add some measure of  		mobility, such as walking, getting around inside, and getting around outside  		(Fillenbaum, 1987). In general, these indexes of functional disability have not  		been well evaluated for their validity or reliability (Feinstein, Josephy, and  		Wells, 1986; McDowell and Newell, 1987).</p>
<p>Measures of the ability to perform the ADLs have become routine in  		surveys of older people, partly displacing the National Health Interview Survey  		disability classification of being unable to perform your major (or  		usual) activity (National Center for Health Statistics, 1979). ADLs are  		more specific and concrete than an inability to perform a major  		activity, thus avoiding situational or contextual differences among  		survey respondents. This is particularly an issue among those elderly persons  		for whom their major activity is ill-defined (Branch and Meyers,  		1987). Another advantage of ADLs is that they can be used to provide general  		information on the basic service needs of the disabled. A person unable to feed  		himself needs help eating; if is not clear what, if any, services a person  		needs who is unable to perform his major activity. Finally, as  		discussed above, ADL status is a good predictor of a wide range of  		health-related behavior.</p>
<p>As useful as they are, ADLs do not measure the full range of activities  		necessary for independent living in the community. To partly fill this gap in  		disability classification, the instrumental activities of daily  		living, or IADLs, were developed (Lawson and Brody, 1969). The IADLs  		capture a range of activities that are more complex than those needed for the  		ADLs, including handling personal finances, meal preparation, shopping,  		traveling, doing housework, using the telephone, and taking medications  		(Fillenbaum et al., 1978). Recent research suggests that there is a  		hierarchical relationship between some IADL items and ADL items, with IADL  		disabilities representing less severe dysfunction (Spector, Katz, and Fullton,  		1987).</p>
<p>Another domain, related to ADLs and IADLs, is cognitive ability. Persons  		with Alzheimers disease and related dementias are prime examples of  		individuals with cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment and ADL status are  		correlated but are separate dimensions of functioning (Fillenbaum et al.,  		1978). Not all persons with substantial cognitive impairment have ADL  		dysfunctions.</p>
<p>Because ADLs do not cover all domains of disability, estimates of the  		need for long-term care services that rely solely on ADL measures will miss a  		substantial proportion of the disabled population. Nonetheless, there is a  		great deal more uniformity and consensus on measurement of ADLs than on IADLs  		or on cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>NATIONAL DATA BASES MEASURING ADLS</h2>
<p>In recent years, 11 national surveys, designed for a variety of  		purposes, have collected information on the ADL status of elderly persons.  		<a href="meacmpes.htm#chart1">Chart 1</a> summarizes pertinent information about the  		surveys.</p>
<p><b><i>1982 National Long-Term Care Survey</i></b>. -- The 1982 National  		Long-Term Care Survey (1982 NLTCS) is a nationally representative survey of  		6,393 noninstitutionalized Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and over with  		health-related ADL or IADL functional limitations that have or would endure for  		three months or longer. The survey was designed to provide data on the number  		and type of physical limitations affecting the elderly; the kind, amount, and  		costs of services they receive; and their ability to pay for that care. This  		survey was sponsored by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation/U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Health Care  		Financing Administration.</p>
<p><b><i>1982 New Beneficiary Survey</i></b>. -- The 1982 New Beneficiary  		Survey (NBS) is a nationally representative household survey of new Social  		Security beneficiaries. Personal interviews were conducted with 18,599 persons  		who started receiving benefits between mid-1980 and mid-1981 as retired  		workers, disabled workers age 18 and older, or auxiliary benefits for wives and  		aged widows, and workers age 65 and older who lost benefits because of the  		earnings test. This survey was sponsored by the Social Security  		Administration.</p>
<p><b><i>1982-84 NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study</i></b>. -- The  		1982-84 NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study (NHEFS) is a longitudinal study  		of those persons age 25-74 at baseline who participated in NHANES I, which was  		conducted between 1971-1975. The Epidemiologic Followup Study was designed to  		investigate the relationship between risk factors measured at baseline and  		subsequent morbidity and mortality. Of approximately 5,700 NHANES I  		participants aged 55 and older at baseline, 5,500 were successfully traced. Of  		these, 3,500 were alive at followup and were age 65 or older. This survey was  		sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>
<p><b><i>1984 National Long-Term Care Survey</i></b>. -- The 1984 National  		Long-Term Care Survey (1984 NLTCS) is primarily a followup survey of the sample  		of 36,000 elderly Medicare beneficiaries initially screened for the 1982 NLTCS  		to determine if they were disabled. In addition, approximately 5,000 persons  		who turned age 65 after 1982 were added to the 1984 sample screened for  		impairments, and those reporting a disability were then given a detailed  		interview. This survey was sponsored by the Health Care Financing  		Administration and the National Center for Health Services Research.</p>
<p><b><i>1984 National Health Interview Survey, Supplement on  		Aging</i></b>. -- The 1984 National Health Interview Survey, Supplement on  		Aging (SOA) is an in-person, household survey of 16,148 persons age 55 and  		older. Designed to provide national estimates on middle-aged and older  		non-institutionalized persons, the SOA collected information on various  		health-related topics such as family structure, disability, and health service  		use. About 11,500 interviews were obtained for persons age 65 and over. This  		survey was sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>
<p><b><i>1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation</i></b>. -- The  		1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is designed to collect  		data on changes in income and participation in federal programs such as Social  		Security, Supplemental Security Income, and Medicaid. The third wave supplement  		to the 1984 panel of SIPP contained a set of questions on disability status.  		Approximately 20,900 households were interviewed; about 5,900 respondents were  		age 65 and older. This survey was sponsored by the Bureau of the Census.</p>
<p><b><i>1984-86 Longitudinal Study of Aging</i></b>. -- The 1984-1986  		Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA) is a prospective survey of 5,151 persons  		aged 70 and older who were initially interviewed in the 1984 SOA. The LSOA is  		designed to measure change in functional status, living arrangements, and  		health service use. Data were collected primarily by telephone and mailouts.  		This survey was sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics and the  		National Institute on Aging.</p>
<p><b><i>1985 National Nursing Home Survey</i></b>. -- The 1985 National  		Nursing Home Survey (NNHS) provides information on current residents and  		discharges from nursing homes. The Current Resident component is a nationally  		representative sample of nursing home residents collected from 1,079 nursing  		and related care homes; there are 4,650 elderly persons in this sample. The  		Discharge component of the NNHS contains a sample of 5,329 elderly nursing home  		discharges over a 12-month period. This survey was sponsored by the National  		Center for Health Statistics.</p>
<p><b><i>1986 National Mortality Followback Survey</i></b>. -- The 1986  		National Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS) provides nationally representative  		estimates of all decedents in 1986 aged 25 and older. Data were collected by  		mailout, telephone, and personal interviews with next-of-kin for 18,500 persons  		who died in that year; 10,154 decedents were age 65 and older. This survey was  		sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>
<p><b><i>1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey</i></b>. -- The 1987  		National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) provides nationally representative  		data on health services use and expenditures among both noninstitutionalized  		and institutionalized individuals. The NMES Household Component consists of a  		longitudinal sample of 14,000 households. About 5,750 sample members were aged  		65 and older. The NMES Institutional Component is a longitudinal survey of  		2,800 current residents and 2,800 new admissions from 815 nursing homes and  		personal care facilities. This survey was sponsored by the National Center for  		Health Services Research.</p>
<h2>COMPARING ESTIMATES FROM DIFFERENT SURVEYS</h2>
<p>Public policymakers and insurance actuaries typically want to know the  		answer to what seem to be simple questions: How many persons age 65 and older  		have ADL problems? How many have ADL problems by each type of activity? How  		many elderly have more than a threshold number of ADL problems? Unfortunately,  		researchers designing and analyzing surveys quickly find that answering those  		questions are complicated tasks requiring decisions about which there is not an  		obvious choice. Differences in lists of ADLs, what constitutes an ADL problem  		or limitation, and varying survey techniques account for many, but not all, of  		the differences in ADL estimates across surveys.</p>
<p><b><i>Lists of ADLs</i></b>. -- Not all surveys or analysts use the same  		list of ADLs. Most surveys include a list of eating, toileting, transferring,  		dressing, and bathing activities. However, because of considerations of time  		and respondent burden, sometimes not all of these are asked about or may not be  		asked about separately. For example, SIPP asks one combined question about  		dressing, eating, and personal hygiene. Other surveys and analysts  		may or may not include as ADLs such additional activities as walking/getting  		around inside, getting around outside, and controlling bowels or urine.</p>
<p>Which and how many activities are included can make a major difference  		in the number of people included as having disabilities, especially if the  		analyst is counting the number of ADL problems. Obviously, the more  		ADLs that are included, the larger will be the number of people with ADL  		disabilities.</p>
<p>Recently, public policy has focused on five ADLs -- eating, toileting,  		transferring, dressing, and bathing. These are also the ADL items that have  		been proposed for use in determining eligibility for benefits in several  		proposed public insurance programs. Private insurance plans vary more in which  		ADLs they use to determine eligibility for benefits (Van Gelder and Johnson,  		1989).</p>
<p><b><i>How ADLs are measured</i></b>. -- Although there is some consensus  		across surveys as to which activities of daily living should be included, there  		is a great deal of variation in the way surveys ask about ADL functioning.  		Since self-report instruments do not incorporate strict definitions for the  		activity being assessed or the possible response categories, estimates may vary  		simply because respondents interpret the questions differently (Guralnik et  		al., 1989). Culture, language, and education can also affect how individuals  		assess disability (Linn, Hunter, and Linn, 1980). The surveys differ in whether  		they assess the degree of difficulty in performing each ADL, what type of  		assistance was received, and the duration of the disability.</p>
<p>A critical definitional issue concerns whether to count as disabled only  		persons receiving active human assistance or whether to include  		persons who rely on special equipment or mechanical aids and  		persons requiring only supervision or stand-by assistance. Persons  		requiring active human assistance are persons who are clearly dependent on  		others. Mechanical assistance can include such devices as grab bars or special  		beds to facilitate transferring. Persons who can function with aids are more  		independent than those requiring active human assistance (Feinstein, Josephy,  		and Wells, 1986). Arguably, some people would need human assistance if the  		special equipment were not available. Stand-by assistance is often needed by  		persons with cognitive impairment whose motor abilities may actually be quite  		good, but who are not always sure what they are supposed to do or when they are  		supposed to do it.</p>
<p>Whether or not to limit ADL dependent to persons receiving active human  		assistance can have a major impact on the estimates. One analysis using the  		1982 NLTCS found that if only people receiving active human assistance were  		classified as having a disability, there were 1.0 million people with problems  		performing two of five ADLs; when a more inclusive definition was used, 1.7  		million people were identified with two of five ADLs (tabulations by the  		authors).</p>
<p>Some surveys, such as the SOA and the LSOA, asked each respondent to  		classify their ADL limitation by the level of difficulty in performing them --  		some, a lot, or unable. For example, among the 2.0 million persons age 70 and  		older who reported a bathing difficulty in the LSOA, 40 percent had  		some difficulty, 22 percent had a lot of difficulty,  		and 38 percent were unable to bathe (tabulations by the authors).  		Without precise guidelines by which to assess level of disability, it may be  		problematic for subjects to report whether they have a little, some, or a lot  		of difficulty with a particular activity (Guralnik et al., 1989). Moreover,  		where level of difficulty measures exist on the survey, the analyst has the  		option of only considering the respondent to be disabled if she has  		a lot of difficulty or is unable to perform the  		activity.</p>
<p>A third definitional issue relates to the duration of the disability.  		When screening persons for inclusion in the detailed surveys, the 1982 and 1984  		NLTCS asked whether respondents had at least one ADL or health-related IADL  		problem which had lasted, or was expected to last, 90 days or  		longer. In contrast, most other surveys asked about disability on the day  		of the survey. Thus, compared to the 1982 and 1984 NLTCS, other surveys may  		include more short-term disability.</p>
<p>Differences in how questions are asked and who is counted as being  		disabled are often the result of trying to answer different research questions.  		For example, an epidemiologist studying the relationship between a disease and  		its symptoms may be most interested in whether there is any physical problem  		and the exact nature of that dysfunction (e.g., does the bathing problem  		reflect difficulty controlling the faucet or does it reflect getting in and out  		of the tub?). The epidemiologist may be less interested in knowing whether a  		person receives human assistance in performing their ADLs. In contrast, an  		actuary estimating the potential demand for a new home care insurance benefit  		is probably less interested in the underlying biological problems than in  		whether the person could, for example, bathe independently with grab bars or  		whether she needs human help.</p>
<p><b><i>Other factors</i></b>. -- Differences in ADL estimates may also  		derive from a combination of technical factors, although the effect of these  		factors is often not clear in terms of direction and magnitude. These  		differences include the year the survey was conducted, sample frame, use of  		proxy respondents, and survey instrument design.</p>
<p>One clear difference among surveys is in the year the interviews were  		conducted. Given the strong association between age and ADL status, a change in  		the age composition of the elderly population could result in different  		prevalence estimates. For example, between 1982 and 1987, the number of people  		age 65-74 increased 9.1 percent, while the number age 75-84 increased 13.7  		percent and that number age 85 and older grew by 17.3 percent (U.S. Bureau of  		the Census, 1988).</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for varying estimates involves differences  		in sampling frame. To estimate ADL status in the community, the 1982 and 1984  		NLTCS sampled elderly individuals, not households, and only Medicare-enrolled  		individuals -- a very close approximation but still an incomplete set of all  		U.S. elderly. Estimates from the SOA, SIPP, and NMES were based on a  		subsampling of all household members aged 65 and over from a representative  		sample of all U.S. households.</p>
<p>Still another source of variation among surveys was the way in which  		data were collected. The SOA obtained face-to-face information from elderly  		sample persons, but close to 30 percent of disabled respondent data came from  		proxy respondents (National Center for Health Statistics, 1987). The LSOA  		interviews were conducted by telephone and mail. In many cases, SIPP and NMES  		interviewed only one person in each household who was asked about all other  		household members. Proxy respondents may answer questions differently than the  		sample person would if asked in person (Branch and Meyers, 1987). More  		information is needed on the potential biases created by proxy respondents.  		Even more fundamentally, none of the surveys verified answers by actually  		asking elderly respondents to perform the indicated ADLs (Branch and Meyers,  		1987; Guralnik et al., 1989).</p>
<p>Yet another potential explanation of divergence in ADL estimates is that  		similar ADL information may be contained in more than one place on the same  		survey. For example, the 1982 NLTCS screened about 36,000 elderly Medicare  		beneficiaries to develop the sample used to collect detailed information from  		6,393 disabled elderly. When surveyors came to conduct the detailed survey,  		nearly 9 percent reported that they were no longer disabled (Liu, Manton, and  		Liu, 1985; Macken, 1986). This two-step process resulted in at least two  		separate sets of ADL prevalence estimates from the NLTCS -- one from the screen  		interview, and one from the detailed survey.</p>
<p><b><i>Estimates after standardization</i></b>. -- Given the apparent  		variability of estimates based upon differences in lists of ADLs and in  		definitions, the only meaningful way to compare ADL estimates across surveys is  		to try to control for these differences. In order to develop more comparable  		estimates, a closely specified set of ADL data on the elderly population was  		collected from each survey. Weighted and unweighted data were developed for all  		persons age 65 and older, with separate estimates for persons receiving help  		with bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting, and eating, along with an  		overall estimate of the elderly receiving help in at least one of these  		activities. Of course, differences in wording, lead-in items, format, and other  		factors remain and could not be eliminated.</p>
<p>Fairly comparable estimates of the prevalence of functional limitations  		for the elderly were assembled for 8 of the 11 national surveys identified as  		collecting information on ADLs. Estimates for the five comparable surveys  		covering the noninstitutionalized elderly are shown in <a href="meacmpes.htm#table1">Table  		1</a>. The 1982 and 1984 NLTCS are weighted so that the total sample (including  		the nondisabled) represents the noninstitutionalized elderly Medicare-eligible  		population. The SOA, SIPP, and NMES are weighted so that the total sample  		represents U.S. Bureau of Census estimates of the total noninstitutionalized  		elderly population.</p>
<p>Standardizing reduces but does not eliminate the differences across  		surveys. The estimates in <a href="meacmpes.htm#table1">Table 1</a> show that the  		proportion of all elderly in the community receiving help with at least one ADL  		limitation ranges from a low of 5.0 percent in the SOA to 8.1 percent in the  		NMES Household Survey -- a difference of about 750,000 to 850,000 elderly  		depending on the year of the survey. For each ADL item asked, the SOA  		consistently produced the lowest estimate of elderly functional limitations. No  		one survey was consistently high over the range of ADLs. Taken together, the  		five surveys suggest that between 4.6 and 6.9 percent of the  		noninstitutionalized persons age 65 and older require personal help bathing,  		between 2.9 and 4.4 percent need similar help dressing, between 2.6 and 4.2  		percent need help transferring, between 2.4 and 3.4 percent need help with  		toileting, and between 0.7 and 2.5 percent need help eating.</p>
<p><a href="meacmpes.htm#table2">Table 2</a> compares the surveys for the  		noninstitutionalized elderly age 65-74, adding the NHEFS (which lacks data on  		the age 85 and older population). The pattern of results is very similar to  		<a href="meacmpes.htm#table1">Table 1</a>. The main difference is that the percentage point  		spread between the highest and lowest estimates for each ADL narrows,  		reflecting the overall lower prevalence rate for this age group. In addition,  		the SOA no longer consistently produces the lowest estimates.</p>
<p>Two of the eleven surveys can be used to compare functional limitations  		among the institutionalized elderly population. <a href="meacmpes.htm#table3">Table 3</a>  		presents these estimates for the resident population. The NNHS and the NMES  		Institutional Component found just over 91 percent of the institutionalized  		elderly received help with at least one of the five ADLs and both found just  		over 90 percent of residents received help with bathing. Estimates for  		dressing, transferring, and eating were slightly higher for NMES than for the  		NNHS. The largest difference between the two surveys of the institutionalized  		elderly was for toileting, which ranged from 51 percent in the NNHS to 67  		percent in the NMES. However, as only about 5 percent of the elderly are  		institutionalized on a given day, the absolute difference of this discrepancy  		is only about 200,000 individuals.</p>
<p>Because the estimates obtained from each of these surveys are based on a  		sample, the data for any survey will differ somewhat from what would be  		obtained if a complete census were taken. Variations that could occur by  		chance, because only a sample of the population is surveyed, are measured by  		the relative standard error of the estimate. Sample size and the number of  		observations of a particular trait greatly affect the size of the standard  		error. When sample size is increased, the standard error declines. As shown in  		<a href="meacmpes.htm#table1">Table 1</a>, there is great variability across surveys in the  		number of actual observations for each ADL. At the extreme, for eating  		disability, the range in the actual number of cases varies from 650 for the  		1984 NLTCS to 76 for the SOA.</p>
<p>If the confidence interval of the ADL limitations resulted in  		overlapping estimates between these surveys, then chance variation could  		account for the observed differences. To illustrate the potential range in  		estimates, we calculated confidence intervals for the number of elderly  		receiving help with one or more ADLs and for those receiving help eating, which  		is the least frequent ADL problem. <a href="meacmpes.htm#table4">Table 4</a> presents the  		68 percent, 95 percent, and 99 percent confidence ranges for the SOA, the 1984  		NLTCS, and NMES.</p>
<p>Calculating confidence intervals also reduces but does not eliminate  		differences across surveys. The estimates for eating disabilities between the  		1984 SOA and the 1984 NLTCS are still 314,000 apart even at the upper and lower  		ranges of the 99 percent confidence interval. Sampling variability among  		estimates of elderly receiving help with one or more ADLs shows substantial  		overlap between the 1984 NLTCS and the 1987 NMES at the 95 percent confidence  		interval. However, like estimates for eating limitations, the SOA estimate is  		still over 500,000 lower than either of the other two surveys even at the high  		and low end of the 99 percent confidence interval.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p>To the casual observer, estimates of the prevalence of ADL disabilities  		for the elderly population differ substantially across national surveys.  		Sources of the variation in national survey-based estimates of the elderly with  		ADL problems include potential differences in:</p>
<ul><li>Which ADLs are included (especially when counting the number of  		  ADLs);</li>
<li>How ADLs are classified by:
<ul><li>level of difficulty</li>
<li>type of assistance</li>
<li>duration of problem;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Age composition of the elderly population in the survey year;</li>
<li>Sample frame used to select respondents;</li>
<li>Methods used to collect data;</li>
<li>Chance sampling variability.</li>
</ul><p>When essentially equivalent ADL measures are compared, estimates for the  		community-based population vary by up to 3.1 percentage points for the  		noninstitutionalized population; and for the institutionalized population, with  		the exception of toileting, by no more than 3.2 percentage points. As small as  		these differences are in absolute terms, they can be large in percent  		differences across surveys. For example, NMES estimates that there are 60  		percent more elderly with ADL problems than does the SOA.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these differences, from a statistical perspective, the  		estimates are reasonably alike. This is especially true if we focus on the  		percentage of persons without an ADL limitation. At one extreme, the SOA  		estimates that 95 percent of the elderly do not receive help with any of five  		ADLs. At the other extreme, NMES puts the number of comparably nondisabled  		elderly at 92 percent. If the policy interest was on the nondisabled rather  		than the disabled, few observers would find these differences worth noting. The  		fact is that, even among the elderly, ADL limitations are relatively rare, and  		some variation in the estimates is inevitable.</p>
<p>Researchers and policy analysts alike need to be aware that ADL  		disability rates are simply much softer measures than mortality  		rates. From wording decisions made by persons who design the survey  		questionnaire, to the analysts who choose a particular ADL question or set of  		questions to analyze and report, to the programmers who handle multiple  		question recodes and deal with missing or inconsistent data, each step will  		influence the results. Given a lack of consensus on exactly how to measure  		ADLs, even an extremely large sample could not provide a definitive estimate.  		This lack of consensus is a major impediment to standardization of ADL  		measures.</p>
<p>What should policymakers and others make of these differences across  		surveys? Cost estimates for home care programs or insurance benefits based on  		one survey will be substantially different from cost estimates based on a  		different survey. Obviously, this inconsistency is very unsettling to those who  		must pay the bills.</p>
<p>It should be remembered, however, that conducting survey research is  		different from running a public or private program that pays for long-term care  		services. Actual participation rates for benefits which use ADL status as an  		eligibility trigger may be quite different from what is estimated by even the  		best survey. Even aside from the technical design and analysis issues, the  		respondent incentives are very different when applying for Medicare or private  		insurance benefits than when answering a research survey. Policy analysts and  		actuaries will need to make their cost estimates consistent with how tightly  		the program will be administered, how they believe elderly people will respond  		to the availability of financing, and how important it is that costs not be  		under- or overestimated.</p>
<p>In sum, when choosing which survey to examine and which items to use,  		policy analysts and researchers need to think carefully about what questions  		they are trying to answer. In addition, to avoid confusion in reporting their  		results, they need to specify in greater detail than they have previously how  		they defined ADL disabilities and which data elements they used.</p>
