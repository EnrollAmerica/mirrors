</dl><h2><a name="abstract" id="abstract">ABSTRACT</a> </h2>
<p>The repeal of many provisions of the 1988 Medicare Catastrophic Coverage  		Act was due to subjective impressions about the usefulness to many elderly  		persons of the services covered by the law and to the omission of long-term  		care services. In the wake of the repeal of the Act, many legislators have  		promised that the issue of catastrophic health care costs would be revisited  		and that long-term care costs as well as acute-care costs would be considered  		in their deliberations. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the extent  		to which acute and long-term care cause disabled elderly persons to incur  		catastrophic costs. We found that the proportion of these people whose out-  		of-pocket costs exceed 20 percent of income rises from 20 percent when only  		acute care costs are measured to 30 percent when long-term care costs are  		included. </p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">I. INTRODUCTION</a> </h2>
<p>The repeal of many provisions of the 1988 Medicare Catastrophic Coverage  		Act (MCCA) was due, in part, to subjective impressions about the benefits and  		costs of services that were covered or omitted by the provisions of the law.  		Many of the provisions were designed to limit beneficiary cost sharing for  		Medicare covered services. For example, the MCCA proposed the implementation of  		a single yearly deductible for hospital care. Another important feature of the  		MCCA was the proposed cap on outpatient drugs, which could have reduced the  		out-of-pocket costs of many elderly persons because Medicare had not previously  		paid for any of these costs. While significant, the benefits provided by the  		MCCA did not outweigh the costs for all persons. This was particularly the case  		for the more affluent elderly, who were asked to finance a disproportional part  		of the costs of the new benefits through income-related premiums. Because these  		people already had Medicare supplemental insurance policies that reduced their  		risk of incurring catastrophic costs, the MCCA provisions seemed to entail  		additional costs with no additional benefits. </p>
<p>The most notable omission of the MCCA provisions was a distinct  		long-term care benefit. Because few of the elderly had purchased private  		long-term care insurance, many felt that they needed protection from the  		potentially catastrophic costs of nursing home care. Many of the more affluent  		elderly already had policies to cover Medicare coinsurance, but did not have  		private long-term care insurance. Although the inclusion of a distinct  		long-term care benefit in the MCCA would not have guaranteed its survival, it  		would have allowed the MCCA to address the concerns of those who would be  		responsible for financing a large part of the program. </p>
<p>In the wake of the repeal of the MCCA, many legislators have promised  		that the issue of catastrophic health care costs would be revisited in the  		future and that long-term care costs as well as acute-care costs would be  		considered in their deliberations. For this reason, empirical information on  		the distribution of the population affected by various acute and long-term care  		costs is essential to inform policymakers about who is at risk of incurring  		catastrophic costs as a result of various types of services used. </p>
<p>Several important studies have already shed light on the magnitude of  		the problem. Rice and Gabel (1989) found that individuals with high overall  		health care costs were also those most heavily burdened by high out-of-pocket  		costs for nursing home care. Other studies related the costs of health care to  		income to obtain a perspective on the extent to which such costs are  		financially burdensome. Wyszewianski (1986) found, for example, that the  		elderly are at risk of incurring high acute-care costs relative to their  		income. Among households of all ages that spent more than 20 percent of income  		on acute health care, 32 percent were headed by persons over 65 years of age.  		In a study of elderly persons only, Feder, Moon and Scanlon (1987) found that  		10 percent had out-of-pocket acute-care costs that exceeded 20 percent of their  		income. </p>
<p>The last two above-mentioned studies highlight the fact that acute-care  		costs can be, literally, catastrophic for a substantial proportion of the  		elderly. However, the full extent of the financial burden faced by the elderly  		is understated if long-term care costs are not included. To address this issue,  		we used data from surveys of chronically disabled elderly to estimate their  		out-of-pocket costs for both acute and long-term care services. Although the  		chronically disabled elderly compose only about 20 percent of the 65+  		population, they are precisely the subgroup of elderly persons at risk of  		incurring long-term care costs. We examined the distribution of costs for  		specific services and identified subgroups of the population that were most  		vulnerable to out-of-pocket costs for those services. In addition, we used our  		results to assess the effects of various policies, such as those contained in  		the MCCA. </p>
<h2><a name="data" id="data">II. DATA SOURCES AND VARIABLES</a> </h2>
<p>Our analysis used data from the 1982-1984 National Long-Term Care  		Surveys (NLTCS). The NLTCS allowed us to estimate several types of acute and  		long-term care expenses. For example, the survey collected information on  		nursing home use, out-of-pocket prescription drug costs, and out-of- pocket  		home care costs for the entire survey sample in 1982 and 1984. To approximate  		most of the acute-care expenses, we supplemented the cost data in the NLTCS  		with data from Medicare Part A and Part B files. </p>
<p>We estimated the health care costs of the 5,795 persons in the NLTCS  		sample for whom detailed survey information was available in both 1982 and  		1984. All were residents in the community at the time of the 1982 survey.  		Although most persons in the sample still resided in the community at the time  		of the 1984 survey, some had died and others were residents of nursing homes.  		</p>
<p>The 1982 survey also contained information important for estimating  		private expenses for acute and long-term care. In particular, information was  		elicited about Medicaid eligibility and private insurance policies for hospital  		or physician services (MediGap). In addition, the NLTCS collected extensive  		information on the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the sample.  		Information was collected on income, home-ownership, age, sex, race, marital  		status, dependency in activities of daily living (ADLS), cognitive impairment,  		living arrangement, and geographic location. </p>
<h3>Expected Expenses</h3>
<p>In this analysis, expected expenses per month were estimated based on  		the experience over the two year period covered by the 1982-84 NLTCS. Because  		the 1982 NLTCS sample consisted exclusively of noninstitutionalized elderly  		persons, our estimates represent the prospective expenses of a cohort of  		disabled persons who originally resided in the community. This is distinct from  		a cross-sectional analysis of all elderly Medicare enrollees, of whom  		approximately 5 percent are nursing home patients. </p>
<p>The expected expenses reflect the estimated cumulative costs of services  		over the two-year period for those who survived and over the remaining lifetime  		for those who died between 1982 and 1984. Out-of-pocket costs, by type of  		service, were related to periods when it was possible to incur such costs. For  		example, home care costs refer only to periods when individuals were not  		institutionalized. Results are presented as one-month expected costs, based on  		the number of dollars estimated relative to months of exposure. The following  		sections elaborate on how we estimated all of the cost components. </p>
<h3>Medicare-related Expenses</h3>
<p>Beneficiary expenses for Medicare related services, including hospital,  		Medicare skilled nursing facility (SNF), and physician services were based on  		recorded amounts of beneficiary cost sharing or inferred private expenses based  		on Medicare rules. The actual amount assigned also depended on other factors,  		such as whether the respondent owned a MediGap policy or was a Medicaid  		recipient. </p>
<p>For Medicare Part A services (hospital, skilled nursing facility),  		Medicare deductibles and copayments were available directly from bill records.  		For Medicare Part B services, private expenses were estimated to be 20 percent  		of covered charges. Medicare Part B premiums were assigned on a monthly basis  		as long as the individual was alive. </p>
<p>Information was available from the NLTCS to determine if an individual  		owned a MediGap policy, but details of the benefits and costs of the policy  		were unavailable. If the individual owned a MediGap policy, the beneficiary  		costs associated with Medicare Part A and Part B services were not assigned.  		This assumption tends to underestimate the actual out-of-pocket costs of our  		sample because MediGap policies are not necessarily as comprehensive as this  		assumption implies (e.g., there is frequently a deductible). In general, where  		there was uncertainty because of limitations in the NLTCS data, we opted to  		minimize out-of-pocket costs in order to obtain lower bound estimates of the  		proportions of persons likely to experience catastrophic costs. </p>
<p>Because data were not available on physician expenses above Medicare  		allowable charges, an amount was estimated based on beneficiary expenses for  		Part B services. The estimated amount of "balanced bill" charges was estimated  		to be equal to the recorded beneficiary Part B expenses, but was applied only  		to individuals with higher incomes, because they were more likely to be subject  		to balanced billing than lower income persons.<sup><font><a href="catacues.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Other Expenses</h3>
<p>Other expenses were estimated from the 1982 and 1984 NLTCS data. Because  		the survey recorded some expenses only for short intervals, such as a month,  		caution must be exercised in drawing conclusions for longer periods (i.e., one  		must assume that the cross-sectional estimate of costs were stable over the  		period). In the absence of a source of continuous information over the two-year  		interval between the surveys, we used the available information to estimate  		out-of-pocket costs for home care and outpatient drugs. For persons in the 1984  		community sample, we estimated expenses to be the average of the recorded  		amounts -from the 1982 and 1984 surveys; that average amount was estimated to  		be the expected monthly amount over the two years. If the individual was  		deceased or institutionalized at the time of the 1984 survey, we assumed that  		the expense recorded in the 1982 survey persisted up to the date of death or  		institutionalization.<sup><font><a href="catacues.htm#note2">2</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Data on nursing home length of stay between 1982 and 1984 were available  		directly from the NLTCS. However, the survey did not always contain accurate  		information on who paid for the nursing home care. when directly available,  		payment source information from the survey was used. Otherwise, payment sources  		for nursing home care were imputed using the characteristics of the individuals  		(i.e., 1982 income and marital status).<sup><font><a href="catacues.htm#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>As noted above, the NLTCS recorded whether or not an individual was  		covered by a MediGap policy. Because premium payment information was not  		available, we assigned an average monthly premium of $36 to each MediGap  		policyholder.<sup><font><a href="catacues.htm#note4">4</a></font></sup> That  		amount overstates the actual liability in some cases and understates it in  		others. </p>
<h3>Financial Status</h3>
<p>To examine catastrophic costs, we explored the information available in  		the NLTCS that would reflect financial status. Asset information was very  		limited; the survey did not measure certain resources, such as savings, that  		might be available to cover health care costs. However, various measures of  		income were recorded. we selected the combined income of the sample person and  		spouse as the standard against which to compare health care costs.<sup><font><a href="catacues.htm#note5">5</a></font></sup> We constructed three income  		groups for our analysis: (1) less than $500 per month; (2) $500-$1,000 per  		month; and (3) more than $1,000 per month. </p>
<p>If the person was an SSI recipient in 1982, we assumed that he or she  		was categorically eligible for Medicaid and that this status was maintained  		over the subsequent two year period. Hence, we assumed that Medicaid would  		cover most of the acute and long-term care costs for SSI recipients. In fact,  		the only costs assigned to these individuals were out-of-pocket drug costs and  		home care costs recorded in the NLTCS. </p>
<p>The NLTCS also asked questions about the Medicaid eligibility status of  		the respondent in both 1982 and 1984. Because Medicaid status data were often  		inconsistent over the two year period, we could not assume that an individual  		who indicated Medicaid eligibility in 1982 would still be eligible for Medicaid  		n 1984. Therefore, we assigned acute-care costs to sample persons regardless of  		reported Medicaid eligibility status.<sup><font><a href="catacues.htm#note6">6</a></font></sup> However, if individuals indicated that they  		were eligible for Medicaid support in 1982, we assigned nursing home costs  		based on the assumption that they would become eligible for Medicaid  		immediately upon admission to a nursing home. </p>
<h2><a name="results" id="results">III. RESULTS</a> </h2>
<p>The expected expenses for four different categories of services are  		presented in <a href="catacues.htm#table1">Table 1</a>. Out-of-pocket acute-care costs are  		defined as the sum of beneficiary hospital, SNF, physician, other outpatient  		costs, balanced bills, Medicare premiums, and MediGap premiums. Other health  		care costs include estimates of out-of-pocket drug expenses, home health care  		expenses and nursing home expenses. <a href="catacues.htm#table1">Table 1</a> presents the  		mean of all health care cost components by monthly income status. </p>
<p>Overall, we estimated that chronically disabled elderly persons spent  		about $130 per month on acute and long-term care services. The expense per  		month increased with income. Those in the highest income group (greater than  		$1,000 per month) spent about 70 percent more for health care than those with  		monthly incomes of less than $500. Among the categories of services, acute care  		was most expensive at $55 per month. This was followed by expected nursing home  		expenses of approximately $33 per month. </p>
<p>We estimated that both of the higher income groups spent more in  		absolute terms for acute-care services than persons in the lowest income group.  		For example, persons with incomes of less than $500 per month paid about $40  		per month for acute-care services, whereas persons with monthly incomes of more  		than $1,000 spent approximately $72 per month on acute-care services. </p>
<p><a href="catacues.htm#table1">Table 1</a> also shows that the largest difference in  		expenses among income groups involved the amount spent for home care. Because  		very few private insurance plans covered home care, income played a large role  		in determining home-care costs. For example, the lowest income group spent $8-  		9 per month, while those with monthly incomes greater than $1,000 spent almost  		$3S per month.<sup><font><a href="catacues.htm#note7">7</a></font></sup> Smaller  		differences were found in outpatient drug and nursing home care costs across  		the income categories. </p>
<p>It is interesting to note that persons with incomes greater than $1,000  		per month spent more for home care than for nursing home care. This result  		reflects, in part, the broader risk of incurring home care costs, relative to  		nursing home costs. It also indicates, however, the ability and willingness of  		many people in this income group to incur out-of-pocket costs for home care.  		</p>
<h3>Expenses Relative to Income</h3>
<p>As noted by other researchers (Feder, Moon, Scanlon 1988; Wyszewianski  		1986), the financial burden of health care costs cannot be determined without  		regard to the financial status of the individual. Clearly, a dollar amount that  		is catastrophic to a low income person may impose little financial strain on a  		more affluent individual. In this analysis, we define catastrophic costs as  		those costs that consume more than 20 percent of the sample person's income.  		For reference, we also provide the percentage of persons whose costs exceed 15  		percent of their income. These levels are often used as thresholds for  		consideration of catastrophic costs (Wyszewianski 1986). </p>
<p><a href="catacues.htm#table2">Table 2</a> presents the proportion of individuals  		whose out-of-pocket costs exceeded 15 percent and 20 percent of income for each  		of the cost categories in <a href="catacues.htm#table1">Table 1</a>. Expenditure patterns  		for different income subgroups are also presented. </p>
<p>In general, it appears that no single service, by itself, creates  		financial burdens for large proportions of the disabled elderly. About 7  		percent of the population had acute-care expenses that amounted to more than 20  		percent of income. Similarly, 7 percent of the population had nursing home  		costs exceeding 20 percent of income. Relatively high acute-care costs were the  		main cause of expenditures above 20 percent of income among people in the low  		income category. For the higher income groups, the greatest risk of  		catastrophic expenses was associated with nursing home costs. </p>
<p>Acute-care expenses comprise a higher proportion of income for people in  		the poorest subgroup partly because these people pay out-of-pocket for Medicare  		premiums, deductibles and coinsurance. Although these costs are not always high  		enough to qualify for Medicaid, they still can cause serious financial burdens  		for persons with low incomes. on the other hand, the combination of low incomes  		and rules governing Medicaid eligibility for nursing home patients render  		low-income persons more likely to receive assistance from Medicaid if they  		entered nursing homes. For the higher income groups, the same Medicare premiums  		and expenses related to private insurance policies are relatively less  		financially burdensome. However, higher income persons would have to incur  		substantial private expenses before they became eligible for Medicaid support  		for nursing home care. </p>
<h3>Cumulative Expenses to Income</h3>
<p>Although <a href="catacues.htm#table2">Table 2</a> indicates that no single service  		presented a major financial burden for many persons, in reality individuals are  		faced with out-of-pocket expenses for multiple services. <a href="catacues.htm#table3">Table 3</a> presents the ratio of costs to income, first for  		acute-care expenses only, then for the other cost components added one at a  		time. This allows us to examine the incremental changes in the cost to income  		ratio. </p>
<p><a href="catacues.htm#table3">Table 3</a> shows that only 7 percent of the sample  		spent more than 20 percent of monthly income on acute-care expenses alone.  		However, after out-of-pocket expenses for drugs were included, one-fifth of  		disabled elderly persons had catastrophic expenses. As expected, the lowest  		income group spent the most in proportion to its income. In fact, more than 30  		percent of the poorest subgroup spent more than 20 percent of their income on  		acute care and prescription drugs combined. </p>
<p>The inclusion of home care expenses did not significantly increase the  		proportion of persons with catastrophic costs. However, it is interesting to  		note that the addition of home care expenses did have a substantial impact on  		the high-income subgroup. In particular, the proportion facing catastrophic  		costs doubled after the inclusion of home care costs (from 3 percent to 6  		percent). The proportion of the middle income group that incurred catastrophic  		expenses increased about 43 percent after home care expenses were added (from  		14 percent to 20 percent). In contrast, the poorest subgroup experienced only a  		9 percent increase in the proportion who incurred catastrophic costs due to the  		addition of the home care expenses. </p>
<p>Nursing home expenses are similar to home care expenses in that they  		cause relatively greater proportions of higher income groups to incur  		catastrophic expenses. As <a href="catacues.htm#table3">Table 3</a> shows, the proportion  		of the high income group experiencing catastrophic health care costs nearly  		doubled after the addition of nursing home costs. In contrast, the distribution  		of cost-to-income ratios for the lowest income group (10-20 percent) was much  		less affected by the inclusion of nursing home costs. Specifically, among  		low-income elderly, 42 percent incurred catastrophic costs after including  		nursing home expenses, as compared with the 35 percent who incurred  		catastrophic costs from all other health care expenses. </p>
<p>In summary, the combined impact of acute-care expenses and prescription  		drug expenses caused one-fifth of the disabled elderly to incur catastrophic  		health care costs. With the inclusion of long- term care costs, close to  		one-third of the total disabled elderly population encountered health care  		costs that consumed over 20 percent of their total income. </p>
<h3>Vulnerable Subgroups: Age and Disability Levels</h3>
<p>To develop insights into the risks of catastrophic health care costs  		associated with income and other characteristics, we calculated, by age and ADL  		level, the proportion of persons in each income subgroup whose costs exceeded  		20 percent of income. The top panel of <a href="catacues.htm#table4">Table 4</a> presents  		the results of this analysis for subgroups by age. Within each income category,  		the proportion of persons who had catastrophic costs for acute-care and drug  		expenses did not vary much across age groups. However, the addition of  		long-term care costs notably increased the proportion of persons exceeding  		catastrophic levels at older ages. This increase occurred across all income  		groups. For example, the proportion of those aged 85 and older who had  		catastrophic costs was consistently 11 to 14 percentage points higher than it  		was for the 65-74 year old subgroup. </p>
<p>The effects of functional status on catastrophic health care costs were  		more striking. The lower panel of <a href="catacues.htm#table4">Table 4</a> shows that  		persons with 3 or more ADLs were more likely to incur catastrophic health care  		costs due to acute care and drugs than those with fewer ADLs. This relationship  		was observed for all income subgroups. The addition of long-term care costs  		increased the differences between ADL levels. For example, in the middle income  		group, 7 percentage points (20 percent vs. 13 percent) separated those with  		high and low ADL levels in the proportion of people with costs exceeding 20  		percent of income. In contrast, the addition of long-term care costs increased  		the difference to 16 percentage points (41 percent vs. 25 percent). The impact  		of long-term care costs was particularly notable for persons in the highest  		income group. Whereas only 8 percent of this income group incurred catastrophic  		health care costs if they have less than 3 ADLs, 24 percent with 3 or more ADLs  		experienced catastrophic costs. This result indicates that even high income  		elderly have a significant risk of incurring catastrophic health care costs if  		they become severely disabled. </p>
<h2><a name="impact" id="impact">IV. IMPACT OF SPECIFIC POLICIES</a> </h2>
<p>In this section, we present simulations of the potential impact of  		changes in Medicare policies on the proportion of disabled elderly persons who  		experience catastrophic costs. We selected features that resemble various  		provisions of the 1988 MCCA. Christensen and Kasten (1988) have conducted  		comprehensive simulations of the effects of the MCCA on the acute-care costs of  		all disabled and aged Medicare beneficiaries; our simulations examine the  		effectiveness of particular policies in reducing the risk of catastrophic costs  		of the chronically disabled elderly who are faced with both acute-care and  		long-term care costs. </p>
<p>The specific policies that we simulated were a cap on Medicare Part A  		and Part B cost sharing, a drug cap, and a policy in which Medicaid paid the  		premiums and coinsurance for low income persons (such as the Medicaid buy-in  		provision in the MCCA). In these simulations, we estimated the 1983 equivalent  		dollar amount of the caps or income levels that would correspond to amounts  		specified in the MCCA. Specifically, the Part A hospital deductible was set at  		$260 per year and the Part B physician cap was set at $700 per year. The Part A  		cap also limits spending for Medicare SNF beneficiary costs. If a person had  		any Medicare SNF covered days, we assigned costs of 20 percent of the average  		daily SNF cost for the first 8 days; no beneficiary costs were assigned  		thereafter. We established a drug cap of $272 per year to approximate the level  		in 1983 that would correspond to the $600 cap specified for 1991 under the  		MCCA. Although the MCCA stipulated that the beneficiary would eventually pay 20  		percent of drug costs after they reach the cap, we did not assign, in this  		simulation, additional drug costs to the sample person beyond the cap. </p>
<p><a href="catacues.htm#table5">Table 5</a> presents the simulation results for the  		total disabled elderly population and for specific subgroups by income. For  		comparison, the top rows present the estimated proportions (from  		<a href="catacues.htm#table3">Table 3</a>) of the disabled elderly whose costs exceeded 20  		percent of their income (1) when only acute-care and drug costs were included,  		and (2) when long-term care costs were also included. </p>
<p>The first simulation is the application of the Medicare Part A and Part  		B caps, in which beneficiaries were not liable for Medicare allowable costs  		beyond the caps. The results indicate that this provision of the MCCA would  		have had a negligible impact on the proportion of the disabled elderly whose  		overall acute-care costs exceeded 20 percent of their income. For the total  		population, the proportion reaching catastrophic levels was reduced from 20  		percent to 19 percent in the case where only acute care and drugs are included.  		Similarly, this option did not have a notable impact when long-term care costs  		were also included. This simulation demonstrates that the acute-care cap would  		be ineffective at the level stipulated by the MCCA. For example, persons who  		were too poor to afford MediGap insurance would probably incur catastrophic  		costs before they hit the acute-care cap. For wealthier individuals, whom we  		assumed retained their MediGap insurance, few received benefits from the  		acute-care cap. </p>
<p>In this simulation, the costs and benefits of MediGap policies were  		retained for the individuals who reported owning such policies. We did not  		assume any changes in the costs of the MediGap premiums. In reality, it is  		unlikely that many individuals who possessed MediGap policies would drop them  		because the acute-care caps of the MCCA did not provide the first dollar  		protection of the MediGap policies. </p>
<p>In a second simulation, we examined the effect of the prescription drug  		cap. In this case, the proportion of the disabled elderly whose overall acute  		care and drug costs exceeded 20 percent of income dropped noticeably from 20 to  		13 percent. The impact of this cap was particularly strong for persons with  		incomes of less than $1,000 per month. For persons with less than $500 income  		per month, the proportion with catastrophic costs declined from 32 percent to  		22 percent. For those with incomes between $500 and $1,000, the proportion with  		catastrophic costs was halved, from 15 percent to 7 percent. This policy option  		resulted in similar percentage point decreases in the proportion of people  		exceeding catastrophic cost levels when long-term care costs were included.  		</p>
<p>The results of the second simulation reflect the fact that most elderly  		persons pay out-of-pocket for prescription drugs. These out-of-pocket expenses  		are unavoidable because Medicare does not cover outpatient drugs and many  		MediGap insurance policies provide little or no coverage for drugs. Although  		the actual amounts paid for prescription drugs may not be catastrophic by  		themselves, the simulation shows that the incremental burden of paying for most  		drug costs out-of-pocket presents a serious problem for low income disabled  		elderly persons. </p>
<p>The third simulation in <a href="catacues.htm#table5">Table 5</a> reflects a  		scenario in which Medicaid pays Medicare premiums and coinsurance for persons  		with incomes below the poverty line. This exercise provides insight into the  		impact of the Medicaid buy-in provisions of the MCCA. This provision was among  		the few not repealed and is now being phased in by the States. As expected, the  		results of the simulation show that low income persons (e.g., less than $500)  		benefit from this option. The proportion of persons with acute-care and drug  		costs exceeding 20 percent of income declined from 32 percent to 11 percent  		because of the buy-in provision.<sup><font><a href="catacues.htm#note8">8</a></font></sup> This large impact reflects the fact that the  		costs of Medicare premiums and coinsurance, as well as prescription drugs, are  		a major financial burden for disabled elderly persons with low incomes. </p>
<p>The results of this simulation are consistent with the conclusions of  		Feder, Moon and Scanlon (1987). They pointed out that many of the out-of-pocket  		costs paid by low-income elderly are for services not covered by Medicare.  		Moreover, these relatively small expenses often constitute a large proportion  		of their low income. </p>
<p>The final simulation in <a href="catacues.htm#table5">Table 5</a> presents the  		proportion of disabled elderly persons who would be subject to catastrophic  		costs if all of the Policies were in effect. The combination of these benefits  		resulted in a large decline--from 20 percent to 4 percent--in the proportion of  		the disabled elderly who experienced catastrophic costs when only acute-care  		costs were considered. </p>
<p>The principal beneficiaries of the combined policies, reflecting the  		MCCA revisions, were elderly persons with incomes of less than $1,000 per  		month. Persons with high incomes did not benefit notably, but these persons had  		a small risk of incurring catastrophic costs in the first place (3 percent in  		the base case). This result helps to explain why the MCCA was unpopular among  		the more affluent elderly. </p>
<p><a href="catacues.htm#table5">Table 5</a> also highlights the fact that the  		provisions of the MCCA were directed toward the risks of catastrophic costs  		from acute-care services. Although the combined provisions in the MCCA could be  		effective in shielding many disabled elderly persons from catastrophic level  		costs from acute care, these people would still be left with the risk of  		long-term care costs. Although only 4 percent of the disabled elderly incurring  		catastrophic costs if all MCCA provisions were in effect and only acute- care  		costs were measured, 15 percent of the disabled elderly would incur  		catastrophic costs if long- term care costs are included. </p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</a> </h2>
<p>Our analysis of out-of-pocket costs shows that the disabled elderly are  		vulnerable to catastrophic health care costs. Estimates of their acute-care and  		outpatient drug costs indicate that, even before long-term care expenses are  		included, the disabled elderly have higher-than-average private expenses for  		health care. We found that 20 percent of the disabled elderly had acute-care  		and drug costs that exceeded 20 percent of their income. In contrast, Feder,  		Moon and Scanlon (1988) found that 10 percent of the total elderly population  		incurred private expenses of more than 20 percent of income. Moreover, the  		differences are probably understated because we compared costs to family income  		whereas Feder, Moon and Scanlon compared estimated costs to per capita income.  		</p>
<p>Because of their functional status, disabled persons are at risk of  		using long-term care services. The inclusion of long-term care costs greatly  		increased the proportions of people whose private expenses exceed 15 or 20  		percent of their incomes. Whereas 20 percent of the disabled elderly had  		acute-care and drug costs exceeding 20 percent of income, 30 percent incurred  		such costs after long-term care was included in the analysis. </p>
<p>Our results indicate that different income groups tend to incur  		catastrophic health care costs for different reasons. Any public policy option  		that attempts to address the problems of catastrophic health care costs should  		consider these differences. </p>
<p>We estimated that for the lowest income (less than $500 per month)  		group, private cost sharing for basic Medicare covered services is sufficient  		to cause .catastrophic levels of expense. One out of five incurred costs  		exceeding 15 percent of income and one in ten incurred costs exceeding 20  		percent of income for acute care alone. Moreover, the addition of drug costs  		greatly increased the proportion exceeding catastrophic cost levels. This group  		appeared to have two problems: ineligibility for Medicaid until they spent down  		and inability to afford Medicare supplemental insurance. An expansion of  		Medicaid eligibility (or other similarly targeted approaches) to cover this  		group appears to be the most efficient way to reduce their risks. In our  		simulations, the Medicaid buy-in provision in the MCCA had the potential to  		significantly reduce the burden caused by acute-care costs for this group. </p>
<p>For persons in the middle income category, $500-$1,000 per month, the  		highest risks of incurring catastrophic costs were associated with incremental  		drug costs. The additional costs of outpatient drugs greatly increased the  		proportion of persons who experienced costs exceeding more than 20 percent of  		their income. Although repealed, the drug cap provision of the MCCA would have  		provided some relief for people in this income group. </p>
<p>For the highest income category, acute-care costs and drugs caused only  		a small proportion to incur costs exceeding 20 percent of income. Moreover,  		many of these people (20 percent) had policies for which part or all of the  		premium costs were paid by current or former employers (Christensen and Kasten  		1988). However, long-term, care costs increased notably the proportion  		exceeding catastrophic cost levels, although the proportion of such persons was  		still only 10-15 percent. </p>
<p>Finally, our simulations showed that, despite the effects of the MCCA  		provisions, a high proportion of disabled elderly persons remained subject to  		catastrophic health care costs because of long-term care services. This type of  		service was not addressed by the MCCA and was one reason for its repeal. This  		appears the major need of the more affluent elderly. If income-related  		financing is to be a feature of future policies, it seems important that  		long-term care benefits be included. </p>
<p>In conclusion, the Congress has indicated that it will address both  		acute and long-term care costs in future deliberations concerning the issue of  		catastrophic health care costs. Results from this study corroborate the  		importance of that decision. </p>

<p><a name="note1" id="note1">Data</a> were unavailable on the amount of charges  			 for Part B physician services above Medicare allowable charges, "balanced  			 bills". We based our estimate an a ratio of balanced bills to copayment for  			 physician services of approximately 1 to 1. We based this estimate on findings  			 from an empirical analysis of physician charges to Medicare allowable charges  			 conducted by Holahan and Zuckerman (1989), which estimated average balanced  			 bill amounts in 1985 to be $168. This amount is approximately the coinsurance  			 amount for persons receiving physician services. That study also found that  			 two-thirds of users of physician services received some balanced bills. other  			 studies found balanced bills to be more common among individuals who were more  			 affluent (HIBAC 1973). In our analysis we adjusted for the higher risk of  			 balanced bills among the more affluent by assigning the balanced bills to  			 individuals with incomes above the 40th percentile of the income distribution  			 of the elderly. </p>
<p>In an additional analysis not presented here we estimated the  			 proportion of persons exceeding catastrophic cost levels when balanced bills  			 were excluded. we found that the proportion exceeding catastrophic levels  			 because of acute-care expenses alone decreased slightly (from 7 percent to 6  			 percent) when the balanced bills were dropped from the analysis. The middle  			 income group was most dramatically affected by subtracting out the balanced  			 bills; the proportion facing catastrophic costs dropped from 5 percent to 3  			 percent. </p>

<p><a name="note2" id="note2">Because</a> of data limitations, we were unable to  			 measure continuous drug expenses over the two year period between 1982 and  			 1984. We reasoned that, for individuals found in the community in 1982 and in  			 1984, the average of the one-month windows elicited from the surveys would  			 provide the best available estimate. For persons who were institutionalized in  			 1984 or had died between 1982 and 1984, only one estimate of outpatient drug  			 costs, elicited in the 1982 survey, was available. We reasoned that because  			 these individuals were likely to experience declining health leading to nursing  			 home admission or death, their drug costs were not likely to decrease; if this  			 were the case, our assumption that the 1982 drug cost estimate was constant may  			 have resulted in an underestimate of average drug costs for these individuals.  			 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note3" id="note3">Payment</a> source information for the nursing home  			 stays recorded in the NLTCS was very uneven. For some cases, dates of Medicaid  			 eligibility were available, whereas for others no payment source information  			 was available at all. In estimating payment source distributions for the stays,  			 we first deducted number of Medicare SNF days (from the Medicare records) from  			 nursing home stays. Then we employed recorded information, when available, to  			 separate segments of use which were Medicaid from those which were privately  			 financed. when this information was unavailable, we estimated the number of  			 months when individuals could afford private payments through liquid assets  			 based on their income in 1982. Specifically, individuals under 100 percent of  			 the poverty level and individuals who indicated that they were Medicaid  			 eligible in 1982 were not assigned any months of private payments; in other  			 words they were Medicaid eligible immediately after admission or after Medicare  			 days were expended. Individuals between 100-150 percent poverty were assigned 1  			 month private pay; those between 150-200 percent poverty were assigned 5 months  			 private pay; those between 200-300 percent poverty were assigned 12 months  			 private pay; individuals at greater than 300 percent poverty were assigned all  			 private pay nursing home days. </p>
<p>When individuals were estimated to be on Medicaid, they still  			 contributed private dollars to nursing home care. If they were not married, all  			 of their monthly income minus $25 (for personal needs) was assigned to the  			 costs of nursing home care. If they were married, their total monthly income  			 minus $325 (for personal needs and subsistence support for spouse) was  			 allocated to pay for nursing home care. </p>

<p><a name="note4" id="note4">Premiums</a> on MediGap policies are known to vary  			 widely. For example, Consumer Reports (June 1989) estimated that policies  			 ranged from $500-$1,300 per year in 1989. Most recently, Shikles (1990) of the  			 GAO reported that, based on a survey of 20 insurance companies, the average  			 premium for MediGap policies was $70.00 per month. For our estimate of MediGap  			 premiums in 1982-84, we deflated the $70 per month estimate by the Medical  			 Consumer Price Index (MCPI). </p>

<li>
<p><a name="note5" id="note5">We</a> established income as a continuous variable.  			 When income was missing, it was imputed based on an equation derived with data  			 from the Survey of Income and Program Participation. when income was reported  			 only as a categorical variable in the NLTCS, we imputed the expected amount  			 within the category. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note6" id="note6">This</a> assumption overstates the expected  			 out-of-pocket costs of the lowest income persons, because some of them would  			 receive Medicaid assistance over the course of the two-year observation period.  			 In order to estimate the effect of this bias, we conducted a sensitivity  			 analysis in which we assumed that anyone with a history of Medicaid eligibility  			 was also SSI eligible (i.e., they incurred no out-of-pocket costs except those  			 reported in the NLTCS for drugs and home care). The effect of this assumption  			 was to decrease to proportion of persons in the less than $500 per month  			 category with catastrophic costs from 32 percent to 27 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note7" id="note7">The</a> results in Table 1 refer to out-of-pocket  			 costs, and not necessarily to the level of service use.
