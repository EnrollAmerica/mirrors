<hr /><h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>
<p>The conference on successful families research and the preparation of  		this report were made possible by contract HHS-100-898-041 from the Office of  		the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, U.S. Department of Health  		and Human Services, to SysteMetrics/McGraw-Hill and Child Trends, Inc. The  		opinions expressed in the report are not necessarily those of the Department of  		Health and Human Services.</p>
<h3>What is research on successful families?</h3>
<p>This is a body of research on families that are enduring, cohesive,  		affectionate, and mutually-appreciative, and in which family members  		communicate with one another frequently and fruitfully. They are families that  		raise children who go on to form successful families themselves. They are not  		necessarily families that are trouble-free. Some have experienced health  		problems, financial difficulties, and other problems. But they are adaptable  		and able to deal with crises in a constructive manner.</p>
<p>The goal of research on these families is to discover the conditions and  		behavior patterns that make for family success.</p>
<h3>Who is doing research on successful families?</h3>
<p>The study of family strengths has been pursued by researchers from a  		variety of disciplines, including psychology, psychiatry, sociology, social  		work, and marriage and family counseling. Many of the individuals involved work  		to assist troubled families, as well as doing research on families that  		function well.</p>
<p>Thirteen of the leading researchers in this field came together recently  		to describe their work in a two-day conference in Washington. This document  		provides a report on that conference. (Names and biographical sketches of  		conference participants may be found at the end of the report.)</p>
<h3>How is research on successful families different from other research on  		families?</h3>
<p>A great deal of family research focuses on families that experience  		problems like spouse abuse, adolescent pregnancy, divorce, alcoholism or drug  		abuse, welfare dependency, and child maltreatment. Research on these  		family-related problems is essential if society is to develop better methods of  		dealing with them. Studies of successful families complement problem-focused  		research by teaching us how negative behavior patterns may be prevented in the  		first place or dealt with by families themselves. Research on strong families  		can also teach us how families transmit positive values and encourage  		beneficial behavior patterns like hard work, prudent risk-taking, responsible  		childbearing, and community involvement. Just as good health at the individual  		level is more than the absence of disease, so healthy family functioning is  		more than a lack of obvious problems. A review of the successful families  		research literature, "<a href="idsucfam.htm">Identifying Successful Families:  		An Overview of Constructs and Selected Measures</a>," was prepared prior to the  		conference and is available from the Office for Social Services Policy, Office  		of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, U.S. Department of  		Health and Human Services, or from Child Trends, Inc.</p>
<h3>What are the policy implications of research on strong families?</h3>
<p>Society relies on families to perform a number of essential functions  		such as providing for the economic needs of dependents, rearing and nurturing  		the next generation, and caring for the frail and disabled. When families break  		down or malfunction, everyone pays a price. Some of the critical functions of  		families may be taken over by public agencies or private charities that cannot  		carry out these duties as efficiently as family members could, or the needs of  		family members may go unmet.</p>
<p><b>Problem prevention</b>. The prevention of problems within the family  		tends to be less costly in every sense of the word than dealing with problems  		after they have developed. If the key attributes of successful families can be  		identified, and ways can be found to develop these characteristics among  		troubled families, then the costs of public health and welfare programs might  		be reduced. A stronger labor force and fewer social problems might also  		result.</p>
<p><b>Social indicators and policy appraisal</b>. Knowing what makes  		families work makes it possible to develop a broader range of statistical  		indicators of the condition of family life in the United States. Current  		statistics count the number of families in the country and describe their  		composition but tell little about how they are functioning. We need indicators  		that gauge the quantity and quality of communication between family members,  		the depth of commitment to each other, the frequency of shared activities, the  		satisfaction or dissatisfaction that members feel about how the family is  		operating, the division of labor within the family, and the extent of  		cooperation with respect to ends and means. Such measures could be used in  		evaluation studies that appraise the effects of specific policies on the  		behavior and well-being of affected groups. Research findings on strong  		families may also give policymakers and citizens a better basis for judging  		whether proposed policies will be helpful or harmful to families.</p>
<p><b>Public information and encouragement of private initiatives</b>.  		Research on successful families is relevant to government efforts to inform the  		public and encourage individual actions and organizational policies that  		promote family health. Some of the findings are clearly applicable to specific  		areas of individual choice and business policy, whereas the practical  		implications of other findings will become clearer as theory and empirical  		evidence are further developed. Dissemination of the findings may help families  		to identify and develop behaviors and interaction patterns that enhance family  		functioning and may help foster a climate of public opinion that is more  		favorable to families.</p>
<h3>What are the characteristics of strong, healthy families?</h3>
<p>Based on various assumptions about what a strong family does,  		researchers have developed lists of structural and behavioral attributes that  		characterize successful families. In spite of differences in discipline and  		perspective, there seems to be a consensus about the basic dimensions of a  		strong, healthy family. The following constructs, which are often interrelated  		and complex, will be identified, defined, and described briefly as they exist  		in strong, healthy families:</p>
<ul><li>communication</li>
<li>encouragement of individuals</li>
<li>expressing appreciation</li>
<li>commitment to family</li>
<li>religious/spiritual orientation</li>
<li>social connectedness</li>
<li>ability to adapt</li>
<li>clear roles</li>
<li>time together</li>
</ul><p>The presence of effective <b><i>communication</i></b> patterns is one of  		the most frequently mentioned characteristics of strong families. Researchers  		characterize the communication patterns of strong families as clear, open, and  		frequent. Family members talk to each other often, and when they do, they are  		honest and open with each other (Stinnett and DeFrain, 1985; Lewis, 1979;  		Epstein, 1983; Olson, 1986).</p>
<p>The <b><i>encouragement of individual members</i></b> encompasses a  		range of affective dimensions related to mutual support, recognition, and  		respect. Strong families cultivate a sense of belonging to a family unit, but  		also nurture the development of individual strengths and interests. Members  		enjoy the family framework, which provides structure but does not confine  		them.</p>
<p>Stinnett describes <b><i>commitment to the family</i></b> as follows:  		"Commitment goes in two directions. Each family member is valued; each is  		supported and sustained. At the same time they are committed to the family as a  		unit. They have a sense of being a team; they have a family identity and unity.  		When outside pressures (work, for example) threaten to remove family from its  		top priority, members of strong families take action and make sacrifices if  		necessary to preserve family well-being" (Stinnett, prepared statement to the  		Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families, 1986, pg. 48).</p>
<p>"Delivering a high level of positive reinforcement to family members,  		day in and day out, doing things that are positive from the other person's  		perspective, just for their sake, not merely as a strategy for 'buying their  		love,' etc." is Schumm's (1986) description of <i><b>appreciation</b></i> as an  		important characteristic of strong families. Related to this, W. Robert Beavers  		and others stated that a sense of "delight" with the child is important to his  		or her successful development. Similarly, Olson summed up that it is important,  		when studying a family, to emphasize the delight, liking, warmth, and humor  		that family members share, which are all aspects of this construct and which  		distinguish some families from others.</p>
<p><i><b>A religious or spiritual orientation</b></i> is identified by many  		researchers as an important component of strong families. Indeed, Beavers noted  		that all studies have found some aspect of religiosity or spirituality as a  		component of strong families. However, as described below, there is  		disagreement over which aspects of religion are most critical to family  		functioning.</p>
<p>A family's <b><i>ability to adapt</i></b> to stressful and potentially  		damaging events as well as to predictable life cycle changes, has also been  		identified as an important characteristic of strong families. Beavers noted  		that strong families are those with an ability to absorb stress and cope. The  		more rigid a family system, the more disturbed. Olson equates adaptability with  		flexibility, which he describes as the capacity of a family system to change  		the power structure, roles, and rules within the family. Healthy families  		change; unhealthy families remain stuck. Researchers note that ability to adapt  		is contingent upon a number of other characteristics common to strong families  		such as effective communication, affective involvement, external resources,  		etc. In addition, two of the other characteristics of strong families (social  		connectedness and clear definition of roles) are linked closely to this  		adaptability dimension.</p>
<p>Successful families are not isolated; they are connected to the wider  		society. One effect of <b><i>social connectedness</i></b> is the availability  		of external resources, identified by researchers as important to effective  		coping by families. A family's social connectedness can be measured in terms of  		the availability of external resources in the form of friends, family, and  		neighbors, as well as participation in community organizations.</p>
<p>Many researchers identify <i><b>clear role definition</b></i> as an  		important characteristic of family functioning, and as essential for a family's  		ability to adapt to changing situations. With a clear, yet flexible structure  		in place, family members are aware of their responsibilities in and to the  		family. Consequently, in the face of crises and problems, members know their  		roles. The nature of this aspect of family functioning is described as follows:  		"[it] focuses on whether the family has established patterns of behavior for  		handling a set of family functions... In addition, assessment of the roles  		dimension includes consideration of whether tasks are clearly and equitably  		assigned to family members and whether tasks are carried out responsibly by  		family members" (Epstein, et al, 1983).</p>
<p>Successful families spend <i><b>time together</b></i>, and the shared  		time is high in both quality and quantity. Self-report instruments assessing  		family functioning address this topic in terms of the number of activities done  		as a family and the extent to which family members enjoy spending time  		together. For example, questions are asked about whether "family members like  		to spend their free time with each other" (Olson's FACES), and about "spending  		time together and doing things with each other" (Stinnett and DeFrain, Family  		Strengths Inventory).</p>
<h3>What methods are used to identify strong families?</h3>
<p>Researchers have devised a number of methods to measure the  		characteristics of family life, and to identify the attributes of strong  		families. Methods include both self-report instruments, such as questionnaires  		and check-lists, and observational procedures in which rating scales are filled  		out by trained observers who are present with the family in their household or  		a laboratory, or who view and code from a videotape made of the family  		interacting. Observed activities include both structured tasks, such as  		discussing what each member would like to change about the family, and everyday  		pursuits, such as family meals. Assessments range in scope from measures of  		overall family functioning to measures of the individual constructs discussed  		above. In general, the family strengths measures employed to date are rather  		global and do not provide information on family behavior patterns. For example,  		the observer may judge how well family members communicate without specifying  		what is entailed in "good" communication.</p>
<h3>What are some of the major substantive issues surrounding the area of  		successful families research?</h3>
<p>Among the major substantive issues discussed at the conference were the  		social and economic contexts in which families operate, the implications of  		changing roles and behavior patterns for our notions of family health and  		normality, the diversity of family life and whether current research findings  		are applicable to minority and low-income families, the precise role that  		religion and religiosity play in helping to make for strong families, and  		whether this research can inform the debate over "family policy."</p>
<p><i><b>Does successful families research pay enough attention to the  		social and economic contexts in which families operate?</b></i></p>
<p>Several conference participants felt that successful families research  		needs to pay more attention to the social and economic conditions in which  		families operate. They argued that an appreciation of the environmental context  		was critical to any appraisal of family functioning. For example, child  		development expert Urie Bronfenbrenner noted that although the focus of  		research on successful families is on family processes, there are certain  		conditions under which these processes can and cannot occur. Some of these  		conditions are not wholly in the power of the family to create or eliminate.  		The availability of steady and adequately-paid employment is an example. While  		families can do things that increase the chances of gainful employment, there  		are larger economic forces at work shaping the job market. The effects of these  		external conditions must be considered when assessing family strengths.</p>
<p><b>Job demands and family functioning</b>. Therapist Froma Walsh also  		emphasized that many family problems are contextually bound. For instance, in  		families that are trying to raise young children while both parents have  		full-time jobs, the lack of flexible and supportive work environments can  		create stresses and challenges that interfere with harmonious family  		functioning. Dual careers may also make it harder for family members to spend  		as much time together as they would like.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the work environment can be supportive of family  		functioning. Walter Schumm gave the example of a Major General in the U.S. Army  		who was the Commander of Fort Reilly. The Commander made it a policy that every  		Thursday afternoon after 3 P.M. was a time for soldiers to go home and spend  		time with their families.</p>
<p><b>Stresses and coping resources</b>. A number of participants pointed  		out that in their research they did try to measure the stresses that families  		experienced and the resources available to them for coping with these problems.  		Researcher David Olson asserted that any appraisal of family strengths must  		incorporate an indicator of the level of stress experienced by the family.  		Margaret Owen said she found it worthwhile to measure both the "daily hassles"  		and the "daily uplifts" that parents experience. Lawrence Gary added that it  		was important to include a measure of racial discrimination when assessing the  		level of stress experienced by minority families.</p>
<p>It was noted that <b>social connectedness</b> was one of the attributes  		that had been repeatedly found to characterize successful families, and that  		better-connected families tended to have more resources available to them for  		coping with crises, as well as with the problems of daily living. Some families  		may even develop special mechanisms for bringing resources to bear on a  		problem. In a study of stable, black families, Lawrence Gary found that many of  		these families had one member who acted as a "cultural broker." The broker was  		a family member who had the know-how and ability to deal with social agencies,  		businesses, schools, and other institutions with which the family had to  		interact. Although relatives, friends, and colleagues often provide assistance  		to families, especially in times of crisis, Urie Bronfenbrenner observed that,  		paradoxically, social networks can sometimes be a source of stress; they are  		not always the social support they appear to be.</p>
<p>There was general agreement that future research on successful families  		should devote more attention to the interaction between family characteristics  		and community conditions, including such factors as: employment and  		unemployment patterns in the area; job-related demands and benefits; level and  		stability of family income; availability of quality child care and schooling;  		crime and drug problems; and community supports and resources. There was also  		interest in exploring the effects on families of broader social conditions,  		such as the intended and unintended impacts of government policies and issues  		of whether media influences help or hinder successful family functioning.</p>
<p><b>Definitions of family health and normality</b>. In his comments on  		the conference proceedings, philosopher Robert George addressed the issue of  		whether changing patterns of family living, employment, sexual behavior, child  		care, and division of labor by gender should cause us to alter our definitions  		of what is normal and healthy in families. George argued that it would be a  		mistake to do so. He said that a thing is functioning well if it does what it  		is supposed to do. Thus, we should ask ourselves: What are families supposed to  		do? George noted that there were value questions involved here that social  		science alone could not resolve.</p>
<p>It is not a neutral, scientific position to say that ideals should shift  		in response to changing realities of social behavior. Non-shifting values  		permit a cultural critique of changing realities. To treat norms as shifting is  		to take a controversial, relativist view. One can argue that the prevailing  		value systems are corrupt or defective. But that would be moral argumentation,  		not social science.</p>
<p>George noted that after seeking alternatives to the family during the  		1960s and 1970s, liberal elites have now endorsed the family as necessary for  		society. But they have also recognized significant deviations from traditional  		norms as acceptable behavior patterns. He wondered whether this was not  		contradictory. Are we "pushing the limits" in trying to function as a society  		without a commonly agreed upon set of values for families?</p>
<p><i><b>How well do existing research findings apply to racial and ethnic  		minorities and to low-income families?</b></i></p>
<p>A review of the successful families literature reveals that much of the  		research has focused on white, middle-class, two-parent families. Thus, there  		are questions regarding the extent to which the findings may be generalized to  		the population as a whole, and especially to subgroups such as racial and  		ethnic minorities and low-income families. Those researchers who have studied  		minority families have provided some important insights, and have raised issues  		and constructs that are not always identified by researchers studying white,  		middle-class families. For example, in studying strong black families, Lawrence  		Gary found that a sense of <b>racial pride or consciousness</b> was a frequent  		characteristic of these families. They focused on developing strong positive  		feelings toward their heritage, as well as talking openly about racism and  		teaching their children how to protect themselves against it. Of course, this  		construct can be extended to non-minority families as well. An understanding  		and appreciation of family history and cultural heritage, and the transmission  		of these traditions to children are probably characteristic of strong families  		in all racial, ethnic, and religious groups.</p>
<p>Gary also found a <b>secure economic base</b> to be important for black  		families, involving income that was not necessarily high but steady, and a  		<b>strong work orientation</b>. Family members showed a great deal of  		<b>resourcefulness</b>, often possessing skills and talents that could help  		them to produce or barter for needed goods and services. Other characteristics  		that Gary identified in stable black families were parallel to those recognized  		in research on non-minority families: a sense of family unity and cohesion;  		frequent displays of mutual appreciation, love, and acceptance; flexibility and  		adaptability in carrying out family roles; a high degree of religious or  		spiritual orientation; strong kinship bonds; and community involvement and  		concern about the climate of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Research by sociologist William Vega has pointed to the unique  		experiences and needs of immigrant families, particularly in terms of  		adaptation, as well as the importance of assessing family strengths in light of  		a family's level of acculturation. In terms of measurement issues, Harriette  		McAdoo pointed to the overall need to develop scales and measures relevant to  		racial and ethnic minority populations, which would presumably include measures  		of the above constructs. Indeed, most of the instruments used to measure family  		strengths have been developed based on white, middle-class families.</p>
<p>While existing research suggests that many of the basic constructs are  		applicable across different racial/ethnic minority groups and income levels,  		the extent to which measurement instruments and cross-cultural results are  		valid for these populations is unclear. Further work must be done to address  		these concerns, as well as to identify additional constructs which may be  		unique to minority and low-income families.</p>
<h4>What is the role that religion plays in helping to make for strong  		families?</h4>
<p>There was extended discussion at the conference about the definition of  		religiosity or spirituality, and the precise role that this attribute plays in  		making for strong families. It was generally agreed that a religious or  		spiritual orientation as it manifests itself in strong families is not  		necessarily synonymous with frequency of church attendance. Spirituality can  		consist of a variety of things, such as: membership in an organized religious  		body, joint participation in worship or charitable activities, a shared sense  		of a greater purpose in life, and adherence to an explicit values system or  		moral code. Further research is needed on how these aspects of religion  		interrelate and which are most critical to successful family functioning.</p>
<p><b>Lessons from the Jewish American experience</b>. As part of a  		presentation on the role of family in American Jewish culture, historian Steven  		Bayme noted that the divorce rate for Jewish couples is lower than that for the  		U.S. population at large. Among those who are affiliated with a synagogue,  		one-in-eight marriages end in divorce. For those not affiliated, the divorce  		rate is one-in-three. More orthodox congregations have lower divorce rates than  		less orthodox ones. However, according to Bayme, the synagogues that do best at  		supporting families are those that are more than just houses of worship. The  		successful synagogues are total communities that provide an array of services,  		activities, and peer-group supports to member families. "Strong communities  		build strong families," said Bayme.</p>
<p>Bayme attributed the strength of Jewish families to the central role  		that the family occupies in Jewish life. The family and the community are seen  		as closely intertwined. Marital success is important to the self-esteem of  		Jewish adults. Marriage provides companionship and fosters one's development as  		an adult. But a strong family also allows one to transcend the self and forge  		links with the larger Jewish culture and heritage. The family is, of course, a  		mechanism for reproduction and procreation. It is also the primary vehicle for  		the transmittal of values and the sense of Jewish identity. Judaism has a  		number of family-centered rituals and explicitly calls for family members to  		spend "quality time" together on a regular basis.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that the Jewish-American community has an  		over-representation of upper middle-class families, Bayme felt that their  		strength derived more from non-economic aspects of Jewish religion and culture.  		He felt that all groups could benefit by placing more emphasis on  		<b><i>communication between parent and child, individual sacrifice for the sake  		of the family unit, a sense of family that comes from the "bottom up"</i></b>,  		rather than being preached from the "top down", and the regular <i><b>setting  		aside of time for shared observance</b></i> of religious and cultural  		rituals.</p>
<p><i><b>Can successful families research inform the debate over "family  		policy"?</b></i></p>
<p>Patrick Fagan observed that the field of successful families research  		had to be developed further before it could be used as a basis for government  		policy. Nonetheless, there was discussion at the conference about possible  		policy implications of current findings. Steven Bayme noted that much of the  		conflict over "family policy" consisted of debate between those who advocated  		government policies that would provide resources and services to families in  		need, and those who saw the government's role as primarily one of "cultural  		education." Bayme felt that both groups could learn from one another.</p>
<p>Bayme suggested that there was a need to pay attention to the "cultural  		climate", and whether it was supportive of positive family functioning. It was  		also desirable, he felt, to strengthen communities in which families flourish,  		and to strive for well-integrated social policies. He defined these as ones  		which sought to provide assistance to dysfunctional families, but also  		considered the possible effects of the assistance on families that are  		functioning well.</p>
<p>Nick Stinnett presented a view of current social conditions and trends  		that captured the concerns of many conference participants. He asserted that  		current societal values emphasize the importance of work and career and  		de-emphasize the importance of family. There has been a loss of primary  		relationships and an increase in secondary relationships. More people lead  		hectic lives with chronically high levels of stress. In addition, there are  		generally no clear avenues for the transmission of values to young people, such  		as those which exist within the Jewish culture.</p>
<p>All of this leads, according to Stinnett, to families that are often too  		busy and fragmented to provide the warm, repetitive interactions, the  		irrational commitment of parent to child, and the mutual delight in one another  		that all humans must have. The lack of these developmental supports can lead,  		in turn, to social problems such as drug abuse, violence, domestic abuse, teen  		suicide" and runaways. The challenge for successful families research, noted  		Patrick Fagan, is to provide information that can help develop programs and  		policies that might reverse the negative trends described by Stinnett and help  		to strengthen families that are now in jeopardy.</p>
<h3>What are some of the important methodological concerns?</h3>
<p>Many issues related to measurement technique were raised during the  		conference. Among these were the advantages and disadvantages associated with  		self-report and observational techniques. The lower financial and time  		investment for self-report measures is a major advantage for this technique.  		There was consensus among the researchers that if observation techniques were  		impossible for reasons of time and/or cost, self-report measures were  		preferable to dropping a given construct. Owen identified conflict,  		adaptability, cohesion, and communication as constructs best measured through  		observation. John DeFrain noted that time together, community involvement, and  		values/religion are best assessed with questionnaires.</p>
<p>Several participants noted the importance of measuring family  		characteristics and processes using information from more than one family  		member. Doing so, however, creates a variety of analysis problems. For example,  		multiple perspectives from several members of the same family are rarely highly  		correlated. Schumm noted that he has developed some statistical techniques for  		handling problems caused by score discrepancy among family members. Also, Olson  		cautioned that researchers cannot assume that results obtained using  		self-report measures will correlate with results based on observation  		techniques. Indeed, in some of her research, Owen found that the predictive  		power of interaction observations could be reduced by the inclusion of  		self-report data into the analysis.</p>
<p>One of the most salient methodological issues to surface during the  		conference was the problem of small and unrepresentative samples that  		characterizes much of the existing research on successful families. The review  		of the literature prepared prior to the conference reveals that much of the  		work in this field has focused on white and/or middle class families. Often,  		the samples used are self-selected. This has obvious implications for the  		ability to generalize the findings to the population as a whole, as well as to  		subgroups such as minorities and low-income families. An informal survey of  		conference participants identified the following populations as research  		priorities: black families, dual-worker families, and single parent families.  		Applying family strengths measures to a national probability sample of families  		is critical at this stage of successful families research in order to test the  		generality of the findings obtained to date.</p>
<h3>What are the next steps for successful families research?</h3>
<p>Throughout the course of the two-day conference, numerous suggestions  		for future research were proposed which would move the field of successful  		family research forward, as well as provide useful information to policymakers,  		practitioners, and individuals interested in helping families. The following  		suggestions were offered:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Research on more varied populations. In addition to assessing family  			 strengths in a national probability sample of families, there is a need to  			 conduct studies about other populations such as racial/ethnic minorities,  			 dual-worker families, rural families, families with a member who has a chronic  			 disease, single-parent families, blended families, and families with low or no  			 religious involvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A need to conduct longitudinal studies across the life cycle of the  			 family, with particular attention to families with aging parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development of a survey module comprised of measures derived  			 from the successful families literature that could be used in other surveys.  			 This would allow incorporation of items to assess family strengths in large  			 sample surveys that can address questions such as the number of strong families  			 in the total society and their demographic and economic  			 characteristics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The study of successful families from a process perspective.  			 Conference participants identified the following processes as research  			 priorities: role of the father in the process; process of racial, cultural,  			 and/or family of origin identification; the process by which family strengths  			 are developed; and identifying the community characteristics which help nurture  			 family strengths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development of measures to assess the effect of the family on  			 the development, functioning, and well-being of its adult members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The integration of the findings of successful families research into  			 intervention and prevention strategies, as well as public policy. This could be  			 facilitated by the creation of a clearinghouse of studies on family strengths,  			 making the findings more readily available to counselors, teachers, and  			 policymakers as well as other researchers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The integration and comparison of the family strengths literature  			 with other sociological and psychological theories of the family, such as  			 social capital theory, and with theories of deviance and delinquency that focus  			 on negative behaviors, such as drug use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development of prevention and intervention programs based on the  			 findings of successful families research, and rigorous evaluations of these  			 programs. In order to develop such programs, the family strengths constructs,  			 which are now stated in rather general terms, need to be developed more fully.  			 This will make it possible to identify specific skills that can be transmitted  			 to families who are experiencing problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The study of the relationship between individual strengths and  			 family strengths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The study of the relative importance of different family strengths  			 and the interrelationships among them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The incorporation of measures of family stress levels into studies  			 of successful families, with attention to racial discrimination as a stressor  			 for minority families.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>The conference and literature review made it clear that a substantial  		body of theory and research exists on the topic of successful families. With  		encouragement to further develop the methods and constructs employed to study  		successful families, a mature literature could be developed. This would be of  		great use in understanding what makes families work well and how to help more  		families become strong.</p>
