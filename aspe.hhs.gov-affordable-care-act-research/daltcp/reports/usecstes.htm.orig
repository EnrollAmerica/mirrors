<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Much of the debate that took place during last year's passage of the  		"Medicare catastrophic" bills centered on the costs of long-term care. Although  		the legislation that ultimately was enacted focused on increasing acute care  		benefits to program beneficiaries, the discussion brought to light many of the  		difficulties faced by the elderly in financing nursing home care.</p>
<p>There are variety of legislative proposals now before Congress that are  		designed, at least partly, to deal with the financial consequences resulting  		from extended nursing home stays. Curiously, two of the proposals that have  		received the most publicity -- the Mitchell and Kennedy bills -- use vastly  		different approaches to deal with the problem. The Mitchell bill (S.2305)  		provides public coverage for nursing home stays (with a 30% copayment)  		<b>after</b> a person has been institutionalized for two years. During the  		first two years of the stay, the resident would be responsible for payment  		through out-of-pocket expenditures, or private long-term care insurance. The  		Kennedy bill (S.2681), on the other hand, would provide public coverage for the  		front-end rather than the back-end of the stay. It would pay all costs for the  		first six months of a nursing home stay, but the patient would be responsible  		for everything thereafter. (The legislation calls for public subsidization for  		one-third of premium costs if a person purchases insurance that covers nursing  		home stays that last beyond the six months.)</p>
<p>In making assessments of the merits of these bills and other proposals  		to reform long-term care coverage, it is necessary to have accurate information  		on the extent to which individuals incur high out-of-pocket costs when they are  		residing in nursing homes. However, a major problem facing policy-makers is  		that they know little about costs incurred in the nursing home. This study  		attempts to provide useful information on this critical issue.</p>
<p>In particular, the purpose of the study is to analyze the use, cost, and  		economic burden of nursing home care among the elderly population in the United  		States. Data were drawn primarily from the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey  		(NNHS) to address a number of important policy questions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>How many persons over age 65 use nursing homes in a given  			 year?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long do they stay, and what are their annual charges?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How often, and to what extent, does Medicare pay for nursing home  			 stays?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How often do patients in nursing homes "spend down" to  			 Medicaid?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much of annual nursing home charges are paid by various payers;  			 in particular, what are annual out-of-pocket costs?</p>
</li>
</ul><h2><a name="research" id="research">PREVIOUS RESEARCH</a></h2>
<p>Given the high degree of interest in health care costs in the United  		States, it is surprising to discover that relatively little is known about the  		burden of out-of-pocket costs incurred by the elderly -- particularly those  		costs associated with nursing home care. At first glance, it may appear that  		our knowledge is greater than it really is. For example, the Health Care  		Financing Administration (HCFA) collects annual data on health care  		expenditures, and occasionally publishes figures that apply to the elderly  		population. The most recently available figures are from 1984 (Waldo and  		Lazenby, 1984). These findings, replicated as <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> and  		<a href="#table2">Table 2</a> here, indicate that the average elderly person  		spent just over $1,000 out-of-pocket in 1984, and that nursing home care  		comprised about 42% ($441) of this. Furthermore, almost exactly half of all  		nursing home expenditures were paid for out-of-pocket.</p>
<p>The problem with these data is that they tell us nothing about the  		distribution of out-of-pocket costs. Obviously, each elderly person does not  		spend $1,000 out-of-pocket on health care, nor does he or she spend $441 on  		nursing home care. Some pay much more, and others less. In the nursing home  		area, although 50% may be the average out-of-pocket liability, we know that  		some people pay 100% out-of-pocket, others begin their stay with support from  		Medicaid, while others "spend-down" their income and assets, at which time they  		begin to receive Medicaid coverage. Aggregate data such as those provided by  		HCFA do not tell us the frequency with which these alternative scenarios  		occur.</p>
<p>To obtain this "person-level" information, it is necessary to track the  		expenditures of a cohort of individuals. This allows one to compute the  		distributions that are missing from the aggregates. The United States has some  		excellent data sources that examine individual health care expenditures. Two  		studies, of particular import are the National Medicare Care Expenditure Survey  		(NMCES) and the National Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey  		(NMCUES). Both studies have been used to make projections concerning  		out-of-pocket costs for the elderly (Wyszewianski, 1986; Kovar, 1986).</p>
<p>The problem with these studies is that their estimates are based on  		surveys of people living in the commmunity, which means that they severely  		underestimate the costs of nursing home care. For example, using NMCUES, Kovar  		(1986) found average out-of-pocket costs to be $293 in 1980, less than half of  		HCFA's aggregate estimate. Wyszewianski's (1986) 1977 estimate from NMCES was  		$412 <b>per family</b>.</p>
<p>Although these authors make it clear that their estimates do not include  		nursing home costs, previous research by the present author shows that ignoring  		these costs severely underestimates the out-of-pocket burden faced by the  		elderly.</p>
<p>In a study similar to the current one, but using 1977 data (Rice and  		Gabel, 1986), it was found that out-of-pocket costs actually rise as a  		percentage of total costs, when total costs become very high. The reason for  		this finding was that when total health care costs for the elderly reach very  		high levels, they are more often the result of extended nursing home stays. The  		study found that those individuals with relatively low out-of-pocket costs were  		spending this money largely on acute care services. However, once out-of-pocket  		expenditures reached over $2,000 annually, the vast majority of these expenses  		(81%) were for nursing home care. The study quantified a fact that was largely  		known to the long-term care research community, but missed by surveys like  		NMCES and NMCUES: nursing home care, <b>not</b> hospital, physician, or  		prescription drug costs, constitute the bulk of out-of-pocket costs for those  		elderly persons who incur high out-of-pocket liabilities.</p>
<p>The current study makes improvements in the previous one in a number of  		ways. First, it uses data that are eight years more recent, from the 1985 NNHS.  		Second, it offers improved estimates because the 1985 survey contained several  		improvements over the previous one. The most important is that it obtained  		information on the payers of nursing home services during both the initial part  		of the stay, as well as the latter part. This information is critical for the  		formulation of cost estimates by payer, since Medicare and Medigap coverage for  		stays only occur close to the date of admission, and because, as noted earlier,  		many people will have spent-down to Medicaid by the end of their stay. Another  		important improvement over the previous survey is that the two primary  		components -- the discharge and resident files -- can be combined in a much  		easier fashion that was possible before.</p>
<h2><a name="method" id="method">METHODOLOGY</a></h2>
<p>In this study, we attempt to calculate how much each payer expends on a  		nursing home stay. This cannot be done directly because no survey provides this  		information. Consequently, to arrive an the estimates it is necessary to employ  		"synthetic" estimation techniques -- that is, to use other data sources to  		arrive at estimates of particular characteristics of the elderly population,  		and then to randomly apply these estimates to our sample. Although synthetic  		estimation involves imbuing individual sample members with characteristics that  		they may not share, we have made every effort to be sure that, on average, the  		characteristics that we impute to our sample make them representative of the  		elderly population at large.</p>
<p>There are three primary steps involved in our methodology: (1) creating  		a data file that represents the all elderly users of nursing home services in  		the United States during 1985; (2) estimating their nursing home costs costs as  		well as how much was paid by each payer source; and (3) combining the cost  		information derived with data on non-nursing home costs from NMCUES. Before  		discussing each of these steps, it is useful to provide some background on the  		NNHS.</p>
<h3>The 1985 National Nursing Home Survey</h3>
<p>The 1985 NNHS is the third survey of its type: the first was conducted  		in 1973, and the second in 1977. The 1985 survey, which was conducted form  		August 1985 to January 1986, contains data from a nationally representative  		sample of 1,079 nursing homes (from a universe of 20,479), as well as  		information on their patients and staff (Hing, 1987). The universe of homes  		included in the study,</p>
<blockquote><p>were nursing and related-care homes in the conterminous United States  		  that had three beds or more set up and staffed for use by residents and that  		  routinely provided nursing and personal care services. A facility could be free  		  standing or could be a nursing care unit of a hospital, retirement center, or  		  similar institution as long as the unit maintained financial and employee  		  records separate from the parent institution. Facilities providing only room  		  and board were excluded, as were those serving only persons with specific  		  health problems (for example, mental retardation or alcoholism) [Hing,  		  1987].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The present study uses three parts of the 1985 NNHS: the Facility File  		(FF), the Discharge File (DF), and the Resident File (RF). The FF contains  		information on each of the sampled nursing homes, including facility  		certifications and patient charges. The DF includes information on a sample of  		up to six individuals who were discharged from that nursing home within one  		year of the survey date. It contains records from 6,023 interviews. The RF  		contains data on a sample of up to five people who were residents in the  		nursing home at the date of survey. The sample size of the RF is 5,243. Some of  		the elements of the DF and RF include patient demographics, functional  		limitations, prior residence, the number of previous nursing home stays, and  		sources of payment during the initial month of care as well as the month of  		discharge (DF) or the survey month (RF).</p>
<h3>Creating the File of Nursing Home Users</h3>
<p>The first task was to create a nationally representative data file of  		nursing home users age 65 and over during 1985.<sup><font><a href="#note1">1</a></font></sup> As is well known to most researchers in the  		long-term care area, surveys of nursing home residents taken on a single day  		are not representative of all users because they oversample those who have long  		stays. Surveys of discharges, on the other hand, tend to oversample those  		having short stays. To obtain a representative sample of all users, it is  		necessary to include both discharges and residents (Liu and Palesch, 1981).</p>
<p>We restricted DF and RF records to those who were 65 years old as of the  		survey date. We also dropped a handful of duplicate records from the Discharge  		File (DF): those stays that were also picked up by the Resident File (RF).  		Unlike the 1977 survey, the 1985 NNHS has indicators of such duplications.  		Finally, we dropped a few records with incomplete cost and admission  		information.</p>
<p>After removing the records just noted, we obtained our sample of 1985  		nursing home users by combining all remaining DF and RF records.  		<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>, borrowed from the Liu and Palesch (1981) study  		that used the 1977 NNHS, shows how this provides a representative sample and  		accurate count of <b>stays</b> (not persons) during the year.</p>
<p>In the figure, DF<sub>L</sub> and DF<sub>S</sub> represent long and  		short stays from the discharge file, and RF<sub>L</sub> and RF<sub>S</sub> do  		the same for the resident file. DF stays always end within one year of the  		survey date, where RF stays last until the survey date (and beyond).<sup><font><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup> Because DF stays end before the  		survey date, while RF stays continue through the survey date, they must be  		representative of different stays (although, as discussed below, they could  		represent two different stays by the same person).</p>
<p>Combining the DF and RF is much easier with the 1985 survey than it was  		previously. In the 1977 survey, for example, the DF sample included discharges  		occurring during calendar 1976, whereas the RF included nursing home residents  		from May - December, 1977. To make the files comparable, it was necessary to  		"move back" the RF stays to make the time periods comparable (Liu and Palesch,  		1981). In the 1985 survey, the dates of the two files coincided, so this  		procedure was not necessary.</p>
<p>At this point, our methodology diverges from that used by Liu and  		Palesch. Although combining the two files gives an accurate count of nursing  		home stays that occur during 1985, it overcounts the number of <b>people</b>  		who stayed in nursing homes, because one person could be responsible for more  		than one stays. This possibility is illlustrated in <a href="#figure2">Figure  		2</a>. As drawn this time (in contrast to <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>), it  		is possible that one person, who had two stays, is represented both by  		RF<sub>S</sub> and DF<sub>S</sub>, since these two stays do not overlap.  		Because the present study examines the distribution of different out-of-pocket  		cost levels among the elderly, it is necessary to convert "stays" into  		"people".</p>
<p>To understand how this was accomplished, some background on how previous  		stays are recorded on the NNHS is necessary. The DF lists the dates of previous  		stays (as well as subsequent ones that occurred after the surveyed stay), along  		with the dates of these stays. Such stays are captured not only for the  		surveyed nursing home, but for any others in which the patient may have  		resided. The RF lists previous stays and their dates in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>We combine stays into people in the following manner. We first define  		two groups of stays: "assigners" and "assignees". Assigners are defined as DF  		or RF stays which had a previous stay recorded that occurred, at least partly,  		within one year of the survey date. They are so named because they will be  		assigned another stay, and the costs of the two will be summed. Assignees were  		defined as DF records which did not have any previous stays recorded within one  		year of the survey date.</p>
<p>For simplicity, one assignee was then randomly combined with an assigner  		-- in other words, we combine a maximum of two stays into one person, although  		it is possible that a person had more than two stays during a year. There were  		three criteria that had to be met before an assignment was made: (1) the  		assignee's stay had to end before the assigner's stay began (if they  		overlapped, they could not represent the same person); (2) they had to have the  		same initial primary payer (either Medicare, Medicaid SNF, Medicaid ICF, or  		other); and (3) the assigner's previous stay had to have the same general LOS  		as the assignee's current (surveyed) stay (either less than 90 days, or more  		than 90 days). Approximately ten percent of records were designated as  		assigners; these were then combined with randomly chosen assignees. Although  		other variables such as demographic charteristics could have been used in the  		matching process, sample sizes did not permit us to go beyond those listed  		above.</p>
<p>Once these stays were combined into persons and costs were summed,  		weights were averaged in order to obtain national estimates of the number of  		persons who were in a nursing home at some point during 1985.</p>
<p>Like much of the methodology, the assignment procedure relies on a  		synthetic estimation technique. We know that some people were in a nursing home  		more than once a year; although the NNHS allows us to identify the lengths of  		these stays, it does not contain any information needed for this study on  		payers and costs of care. As a result, we have used data from the survey to  		make our best estimate of how often a person has more than one stay, and then  		somewhat arbitrarily assigned two stays as being attributable to the same  		person. Although we are combining different people's stays and associating them  		with one person, the technique should be accurate in the aggregate, and will  		therefore give us a better estimate of individual out-of-pocket costs, since it  		explicitly allows for the possibility that a person could be a nursing home  		user more than once during a year.</p>
<h3>Estimating the Costs of Nursing Home Care by Payer  		Source</h3>
<p>The easiest way to think about the output for the study is to envision a  		matrix with approximately 8,700 rows and 12 columns. Each row is a person age  		65 or over who had one or more stays occuring at least partly within 1985  		represented on the NNHS. The first column indicates how much was paid in total  		for the days of care that occurred during 1985, and the remaining ones show how  		much was paid by each of 11 different payers: own income, Medicare, Medicaid  		Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF), Medicaid Intermediate Care Facility (ICF),  		state funded indigent care, other government or welfare, religious  		organizations, VA contract, initial payment for life-care funds, Medigap  		policies, and "other". We have assumed that no-one had yet purchased long-term  		care insurance; in fact, very few people had done so by 1985.</p>
<p>The total cost of care during 1985 was calculated by multiplying the  		daily cost by the part of the length-of-stay (LOS) occurring during the year.  		LOS data are available for all residents, so total costs can be obtained once  		we have a figure for daily costs. This figure is given on the RF for the month  		in which the survey took place. However, it is not directly available on the  		DF, and cannot be relied on for RF records if there was a change in the primary  		payer for care over the course of the stay.</p>
<p>To obtain the daily cost figure, we relied on information from the  		Facility File (FF). The FF indicates the private pay charge for skilled and  		intermediate care patients, the Medicaid reimbursement rate for both types of  		patients, as well as the Medicare skilled reimbursement rate. These were used  		when we were otherwise unable to obtain the daily charge.</p>
<p>The primary methodological issue concerned calculating the charges paid  		by each of the 11 payer categories. The situation was straightforward when  		there was no change in the primary payer over the course of the stay, and when  		Medicare did not pay anything towards the stay. In most of these cases, total  		costs were entirely attributed to the primary payer. One exception to this rule  		was when the primary payer was Medicaid. In these instances, the NNHS shows  		that about two-thirds of the time, there was also a contribution paid by the  		individual, typically on the order of 20% of total costs. Consequently, we  		included these private-pay costs in about two-thirds of the cases where  		Medicaid was the primary payer.</p>
<p>If there was a change in primary payers, the estimates are less accurate  		because we do not know when the change occurred. It will be recalled that the  		NNHS contains information on the primary payer only during the first month of  		the stay and the last (DF) or survey (RF) month. If there was a change in  		primary payer, we made the arbitrary assumption that the change occurred  		exactly half-way through the stay.</p>
<p>When Medicare was a payer, our methodology was more complex, and relied  		on various synthetic estimators. We first had to estimate how long the Medicare  		coverage lasted. This was done by using data compiled by the Health Care  		Financing Administration (1985) on the length of Medicare coverage for nursing  		home stays. The data show what proportion of the time Medicare coverage lasted  		0-10 days, what proportion it lasted 11-20 days, and so on up to 91-100 days.  		Lengths of Medicare coverage were then randomly assigned to individuals whose  		record indicated that Medicare initially was a payer for their stay. It turns  		out that only six percent of all Medicare stays last the full 91-100 days --  		for many reasons, documented elsewhere, Medicare coverage tends to cut-off long  		before patients are discharged (Smits, Feder, and Holahan, 1982; Feder and  		Scanlon, 1982). This is important, in turn, because Medigap policies will cover  		up to a full 365 days only if Medicare coverage lasts the full 100 days.</p>
<p>Our next task was to subdivide "own expenses" into two components: true  		out-of-pocket costs, and costs paid for by Medigap policies. Unfortunately, the  		NNHS contains no information on Medigap policies, so ownership was also  		assigned. To do this, we calculated ownership rates by age, race, and marital  		status using NMCUES, and randomly assigned these proportions to like members of  		the NNHS sample. This is likely to overestimate Medigap benefits since it is  		possible that many individuals in nursing homes would have been unable to  		purchase Medigap policies.</p>
<h3>Obtaining Costs Information for Other Types of  		Services</h3>
<p>Although compiling information on nursing home costs is the primary  		objective of the study, it is useful to compare this information with  		information on the costs incurred by the non-instiutionalized population. We  		obtained the latter from NMCUES, which has detailed information on health care  		expenditures by payer source for a large sample of individuals in 1980.</p>
<p>To make thes estimates comparable with the NNHS, NMCUES costs were  		inflated to adjust for the increase in medical care costs from 1980 to 1985,  		using the Consumer Price Index. (Although it would have been desirable to also  		adjust for changes in per capita utilization, such data were not available for  		the elderly during this five-year interval.) Prices increases markedly over  		this period: 48.1% for physician services, 67.8% for hospital services, 44.8%  		for dental services, and 65.7% for prescription drugs (Department of Health and  		Human Services, 1987).</p>
<h2><a name="finding" id="finding">FINDINGS</a></h2>
<h3>Number of Persons Using Nursing Homes During 1985</h3>
<p>In 1985 there were approximately 2.1 million persons age 65 and over in  		the United States who spent some time in nursing homes. This represents 7.5% of  		the elderly population. <a href="#table3">Table 3</a> subdivides them by age,  		sex, and marital status. Perhaps the most noteworthy finding on the table is  		the degree to which older, unmarried females dominate nursing home users. Two  		of the twelve cells -- unmarried females and 75-84 and age 85 and over --  		comprise over 55% of all users. Another disparity that can be seen from the  		table is that whereas about 40% of males were married at the time of admission,  		this was true of only 12% of females.</p>
<p>Published figures from the NNHS indicate that there were approximately  		2.4 million stays during 1985 among those age 65 and over: 1.3 million from the  		Discharge File, and 1.1 million from the Resident file (Hing, 1987; Sekscenski,  		1987). Our figure of 2.1 million is smaller because we have attempted to count  		the number of people rather than nursing home stays. (We also dropped records  		with missing cost and admission information, and included only those users who  		had reached the age of 65 at the date of admission.)</p>
<p>It is perhaps surprising how <b>slowly</b> nursing home use has grown  		among the elderly. According to the 1977 survey, in 1977 there were about 1  		million discharges and 1.1 million residents, for a total of 2.1 million stays  		(National Center for Health Statistics, 1979). Thus, over an eight-year period  		the number of stays grew by only about 14%, or by only about 1.5% per year.  		This is considerably less than the six percent annual growth rate reported  		between 1965 and 1977 (Manton, Woodbury, and Liu, 1984), but is consistent with  		recent estimates by Harrington, Swan, and Grant (1988), who report a 16%  		increase in SNF and ICF beds between 1978 and 1986.</p>
<h3>Lengths of Nursing Home Stays During 1985</h3>
<p>The lengths-of-stays calculated for this study should be used cautiously  		for three reasons. First, and most importantly, we have calculated the length  		of stay (LOS) occuring <b>during 1985</b>. This figure therefore has a maximum  		of 365 days, and does not directly serve any particular policy purpose, even  		though it was instrumental in allowing us to calculate costs during the year.  		Second, the LOS estimates are for a cohort of <b>users</b>, not entrants into  		the nursing homes. It has been shown that average LOS for users is much longer  		than for entrants, because the former group also includes people who have  		already been in the nursing home for some time. Oddly enough, the average  		<b>remaining</b> LOS is much longer among individuals who have already been in  		a nursing home for a long time than for new entrants (Liu and Manton, 1983).  		Finally, the LOS is for the stay in a particular home, not total contiguous  		stays in any homes. In other words, if a person came from another nursing home,  		or was discharged to one, the stays in these other homes have not been  		included.</p>
<p><a href="#table4">Table 4</a> shows the mean and median LOS for the  		sample. We have divided the sample into its two original components -- records  		from the Discharge File and those from the Resident File -- to reiterate how  		different these files really are. Average LOS during calendary year 1985 was  		216 days, but for discharges it was only half of that (113), and for residents  		it was much longer (299). Perhaps most telling, however, is the median. The  		median LOS for discharges was only 75 days, whereas for residents it was a full  		365 days. <a href="#table4">Table 4</a> also reports LOS by age, sex, and  		marital status. The main pattern that emerges is that females, those who are  		not married, and older individuals had the longest stays.</p>
<h3>Total Costs of Nursing Home Care During 1985</h3>
<p><a href="#table5">Table 5</a> shows the mean and median costs of nursing  		home care for the 2.1 million users during 1985. Before going over these  		figures, it is important to point out that the costs of care during 1985 do not  		reflect individuals' total expenditures for nursing home care. There are two  		reasons that these costs are underestimates. First, many stays last much longer  		than one year, yet here we are computing annual costs. Secondly, individuals  		who had low costs during 1985 may have had a long stay, only a few days of  		which occurred during this year.</p>
<p>With these caveats in mind, the table shows that the mean charge during  		1985 was over $9,600, and the median, over $8,200. Those who were discharged  		during the year had much lower costs than residents, indicating, once again,  		the differences between the two populations. As in <a href="#table4">Table  		4</a>, when we examine differences by age, sex, and marital status, we find  		that females, unmarried individuals, and those who are oldest tended to have  		the highest costs, largely reflecting their somewhat longer LOS.</p>
<p>As discussed in the paper's introduction, one gets a distorted picture  		of nursing home expenditures by looking at averages -- it is essential to  		examine the distribution of expenditures, as well. This is shown in  		<a href="#table6">Table 6</a>. What is perhaps most noteworthy is that a very  		large number (and percentage) of users experienced high costs during the year.  		Nearly one-fourth (22.5%) had total costs that exceeded $15,000, and well over  		two-fifths (42.3%) had costs in excess of $10,000. Almost two-thirds (64.9%)  		had costs in excess of $5,000. In the next section, we examine who paid for  		these costs.</p>
<h3>Who Pays for Nursing Home Costs?</h3>
<p><a href="#table7">Table 7</a> subdivides costs according to both source  		of payment and the individual's total nursing home charges during the year.  		Several interesting patterns emerge. The percentage of costs paid out-of-pocket  		are relatively constant at around the 50% up to the $15,000 level; after that,  		they actually rise. The reason for this is that total costs usually reach these  		very high levels when the person is a private-pay patient, because their  		charges tend to be higher than those to Medicaid patients. This is also  		reflected in the sharp drop in the Medicaid contribution once costs reach these  		levels.</p>
<p>The data also show that Medicare contributed to total payments for 11.5%  		of users. It is not surprising that in <a href="#table7">Table 7</a>, Medicare  		contributions fall as total nursing home costs rise, since Medicare usually  		pays only for acute care patients who are often discharged soon after entering  		the home.<sup><font><a href="#note3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>How Do Out-of-Pocket Nursing Home Costs Compare With  		Those for Other Types of Services?</h3>
<p>In previous work by the author (Rice and Gabel, 1985), it was shown that  		in 1977 nursing home costs comprised, by far, the largest share of  		out-of-pocket costs for those elderly who incurred relatively high out-of-cost  		liabilities. <a href="#table8">Table 8</a>, which updates these findings, shows  		that the pattern has, if anything, become even more pronounced.</p>
<p>The table divides the elderly population into four groups: those with  		out-of-pocket costs less than $750 per year, between $751 and $1,500; between  		$1,501 and $3,000; and over $3,000. (These categories were chosen to match  		those used in the earlier study, but taking into account the nearly 50% rise in  		health care costs between 1980 and 1985.) Within each group, we examine the  		proportion of total out-of-pocket costs attributable to hospital, physician,  		dental, prescription drugs, and nursing home services.</p>
<p>The table shows that when a person's out-of-pocket costs are low, what  		costs there are are largely attributable to physician, prescription drug, and  		dental costs. For example, among those spending less than $750 during 1985, all  		but four percent of these expenditures were due to these three types of  		services. The pattern doesn't change very much as out-of-pocket expenditures  		rise, except that hospital and nursing home care take on a somewhat larger  		(although not dominant) role.</p>
<p>However, among the 1.3 million elderly persons whose out-of-pocket costs  		exceeded $3,000 during 1985, a totally different pattern emerges. Nursing home  		costs are dominant: over 82% of these costs were attributable to the nursing  		home, leaving less than 18% for hospital, physician, prescription drug, and  		dentistry services.</p>
<h3>"Spend-Down"</h3>
<p>The NNHS can be used to obtain information on the incidence of  		"spend-down" to Medicaid, although the information is imperfect. The major  		limitation is that many individuals on the Resident File who may have  		spent-down by discharge had not done so by the time of interview. Nevertheless,  		the file does allows us to see the extent to which users spend-down to Medicaid  		over particular lengths of time.</p>
<p>To define spend-down, we first specify three mutually exclusive payers  		for both the first and last (or survey) months of the stay. The first payer,  		which we will refer to as "private pay," includes stays that had <b>only</b>  		private or Medicare payments during that month. The second payer, "Medicaid,"  		includes all stays that had <b>any</b> Medicaid payments during the month. The  		final category, "other," represents all other stays (i.e., those with no  		Medicaid payments, and which had at least some payment made by state funded  		indigent care, government assistance or welfare, religious or voluntary  		agencies, the Veteran's Administration, or any other sources besides Medicare,  		Medicaid, or private pay).</p>
<p><a href="#table9">Table 9</a> shows the proportion of 1985 stays with  		these payers during the first and last months of the stay. Looking first at the  		row totals, about 44% of stays began as private-pay, 36% began as Medicaid and  		20% started as "other". It is particularly noteworthy that such a large  		percentage of stays began as Medicaid-eligible. This indicates that many  		elderly either spend-down when they are still in the community, or during  		previous nursing home stays. The major change that occurs during the last month  		(shown at the "total" figure at the bottom of the columns) is that the "other"  		share decreases substantially, to 8%, whereas the Medicaid share rises to 47%.  		The primary reason for the decline in the "other" category is that stays that  		begin with Medicare coverage often end as either private-pay or Medicaid.</p>
<p>For purposes of the analysis, we define "spending-down" as moving from  		private-pay to Medicaid. Defined this way, 18.2% of all initial private-pay  		patients spent-down by the date of discharge or survey date. It should be  		recalled once again that this underestimates total spend-down rates because  		people whose records were from the Resident File may have spend-down after the  		survey date. <a href="#table10">Table 10</a> subdivides spend-down rates by  		marital status and LOS. Not surprisingly, the incidence of spend-down is much  		higher as length-of-stay increases, since total costs of care rise  		proportionally with LOS. It <b>is</b> surprising, however, that spend-down  		rates are only slightly higher for the non-married than for those who are  		married.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most curious feature of these results is that they indicate  		a much lower incidence, and slower rate of spend-down than some other studies  		have found. I particular, the size of figures presented here are only a  		fraction of those reported by the House Select Committee on Aging (House of  		Representatives, 1987). That study, which was national in scope, indicates that  		48% of those living alone would spend-down after only a 13 week nursing home  		stay (compared to our figure of 4.5% for the non-married), and that two-thirds  		would spend-down after a year's stay (compared to our figures of 22% for stays  		lasting from 1/2 to one year, and 29% for stays lasting from one to two years).  		Although the figures for spend-down among couples are a little closer to each  		other, there are still large differences. For example, the House study  		indicates that 22% of couples would spend-down in 13 weeks, and that 46% would  		after a year's stay in a nursing home. The corresponding figures from our study  		are 6% and 15-18%, respectively. Although the two studies define spend-down  		somewhat differently, the tremendous differences in spend-down rates are still  		noteworthy.</p>
<p><a href="#table11">Table 11</a> is identical to the <a href="#table9">Table 9</a>, except that it examines the initial and final  		payers for stays separately for three groups: those stays where the user did  		not have any previous nursing home stays; those where there was one previous  		nursing home stay (during any time in the past); and those with two or more  		previous nursing home stays. Of particular interest are the totals for initial  		payers. Whereas 32% of stays that were not preceded by any other stays began on  		Medicaid, this rises to 41% when there was one previous nursing home stay, and  		47% when there was two or more previous stays. Thus, practically half of the  		people with two or more previous nursing home stays began on Medicaid. This  		indicates that one of the reason that spend-down rates seem low is that many  		people had apparently spent-down during or between their previous stays.</p>
<p><a href="#table12">Table 12</a> is identical to <a href="#table10">Table  		10</a>, except that it examines spend-down rates according to the number of  		previous stays. What is most curious about this table is that spend-down rates  		are not much higher for those with previous nursing home stays. For example, if  		we look at those who were in a nursing home for 1-2 years during their current  		stays, the proportion who spent-down is always around 20%, regardless of the  		number of previous stays.</p>
<p>Putting the findings from Tables 9-12 together, a few patterns emerge.  		First, spend-down rates are much lower than others have reported. Second, a  		large percentage of persons begin their nursing home stays on Medicaid -- in  		other words, they "spend-down" before coming to the nursing home. This is  		substantiated in <a href="#table11">Table 11</a>, where we see that almost half  		of those with two or more previous stays begin their current stay on Medicaid.  		However, <a href="#table12">Table 12</a> shows that once they are in the  		nursing home, those with previous stays are no more likely to spend-down during  		the current stay. This indicates a third finding: given the low spend-down  		rates even after multiple previous stays, the private resources of the  		wealthier half, of the elderly and their families may have been underestimated  		by previous researchers.</p>
<h2><a name="conclude" id="conclude">CONCLUSION</a></h2>
<p>Although the findings provide much information on the extent of  		out-of-pocket costs for nursing home care and the likelihood that nursing home  		stays will result in the spending down of assets, there is much that is still  		unknown. One of the major shortcomings of the National Nursing Home Survey in  		this regard is that it contains no information on patient income and assets.  		Although we were able to estimate out-of-pocket costs for each sample member,  		we have no way of assessing how great of a burden such costs pose.</p>
<p>Even with income and asset data, one would have to interpret the  		out-of-pocket results cautiously. Although it appears that nursing home  		liabilities are extremely high, they are overstated in one respect. Whereas  		out-of-pocket payments for acute care services (hospitals, physicians, dental  		services, and prescription drugs) generally cannot be offset because the  		patient typically returns to the community, in many cases nursing home  		liabilities are partly offset because the patient will have lower community  		living expenses while confined in the nursing home. It could be argued, then,  		that out-of-pocket nursing home costs should be calculated as the marginal  		costs of nursing home care over and above what the person would have spent  		living in the community.<sup><font><a href="#note4">4</a></font></sup> However, we did not have the necessary  		information on whether the person was still incurring community living expenses  		to make such a calculation.</p>
<p>A focus of future research should be determining exactly what is  		contained in the "out-of-pocket" cost figures calculated in this study. How are  		these costs paid by individuals and families? What do they deplete; Social  		Security income? savings? inheritances? If private or public insurance pays for  		some of these costs that are currently out-of-pocket, exactly who will benefit?  		Answers to questions like these are essential in devising a sensible solution  		to the problem of the burden posed by nursing home costs incurred by the  		elderly.</p>

<ol><li>
<p><a name="note1" id="note1">This</a> file was used for all analyses except  			 Medicaid spend-down, where the unit of analysis was the stay rather than the  			 person. Furthermore, as discussed below, in the spend-down analysis we employ  			 the entire length-of-stay since the date of admission, rather than  			 length-of-stay during 1985.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note2" id="note2">For</a> purposes of illustration, we have assumed  			 that each nursing home was surveyed on the last day of 1985, and therefore,  			 that the costs calculated apply to calendar year 1985. In fact, homes were  			 surveyed between August 1985 and January 1986. Throughout the paper, when we  			 speak of costs incurred during 1985, strictly speaking this refers to costs  			 incurred in the 365 days prior to the date each nursing home was  			 surveyed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a name="note3" id="note3">As</a> part of the cost calculations, when in doubt  			 we made an effort to err on the side of giving Medicare credit for payment.  			 Consequently, the Medicare percentages shown in <a href="#table7">Table 7</a>  			 may be overestimates.</p>
