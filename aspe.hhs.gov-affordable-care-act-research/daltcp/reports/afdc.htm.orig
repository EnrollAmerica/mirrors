<hr /><h2>A. OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>The Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) population is made up  		almost entirely of young mothers and their children. Disability is not a common  		concern among those studying AFDC recipients, nor are AFDC recipients a common  		concern among those who study disability. This is because AFDC recipients are  		young and because, programmatically, there is another cash welfare  		program--Supplemental Security Income (SSI)--specifically targeted to the  		disabled.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, surprising to learn that women on AFDC are  		significantly more likely to be disabled than other women their age. According  		to the 1983/84 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), nearly one in  		four women on AFDC under the age of 45 (22 percent) report themselves as  		disabled compared to one in eleven (9 percent) such women not on AFDC. In fact,  		women on AFDC have disability rates nearly as high as women old enough to be  		their mothers (or grandmothers). For example, the age-specific disability rate  		for women on AFDC aged 35-44 is 45.9 per hundred--only slightly below the 52.4  		per hundred rate for women aged 65-74.</p>
<p>AFDC mothers may not be the only disabled members of the family. Twelve  		percent of women on AFDC under the age of 45 report that they have at least one  		disabled child compared to only 3 percent not receiving AFDC.</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to examine the health and disability status  		of AFDC families using information gathered in the SIPP and to assess the  		implications for welfare work programs. No such analysis has been performed  		before, because SIPP was the first survey to collect extensive data on income,  		participation in AFDC and health and disability. This analysis primarily  		concerns the disability of women in AFDC families, as SIPP data on disabled  		children are, as yet, incomplete.</p>
<h2>B. SOURCE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE DATA</h2>
<p>Information from this paper came from the SIPP, a nationally  		representative survey of the noninstitutionalized American population. The SIPP  		is a longitudinal survey of adults (persons aged 15 years or older) obtained  		from a multi-stage stratified sample. Initial interviews began in October 1983  		and were conducted in over 19,000 households (nearly 600 of which were on  		AFDC). Nine interviews or waves were conducted at four-month intervals.</p>
<p>Data in this paper are derived from the Wave 3 core questionnaire, the  		Wave 3 Topical Module on Education, Work History and Health and Disability, and  		the Wave 5 Topical Module on Welfare History.</p>
<p>The SIPP is an especially rich source of information on disability,  		because the questions were designed so that disability can be defined in  		several ways: in a variety of functional ways or as the receipt of disability  		benefits. Typically, disability is defined simply as the receipt of benefits  		from programs targeted on the disabled, such as Social Security Disability  		Insurance (SSDI) or SSI. Therefore, past analyses on disability have not  		included the AFDC population, as few AFDC family members receive SSDI or SSI.  		However, an analysis based on the 1957 Health Interview Survey indicated a high  		proportion of work disability among young, female heads of households (Morgan,  		et al.). For this analysis, disability is functionally defined as moderate or  		severe. Moderately disabled persons were those who reported difficulty with,  		but who could perform, one of the physical or sensory activities (i.e.,  		walking, seeing, lifting). Severely disabled people were identified either as  		those who had difficulty with more than one physical or sensory activity or  		those who were unable to perform physical activities, such as lifting, walking,  		or climbing stairs, or who could not take care of their physical needs or get  		around without the help of another person.</p>
<h2>C. THE AFDC AND SSI PROGRAMS</h2>
<p>The AFDC program is targeted on low-income families, primarily headed by  		single women. The AFDC program is administered by the individual States, but  		jointly funded by both the Federal and State governments. In order to qualify  		for AFDC, a child must be deprived of parental care and support due to the  		death, incapacity, continued absence from the home, or, in some states,  		unemployment of a parent. AFDC families are typically composed of a single  		mother and her children. AFDC recipients are automatically enrolled in  		Medicaid, which pays for their health care.</p>
<p>The SSI program is targeted on poor persons who are aged, blind, or  		disabled. In order to qualify for the disabled component of SSI, a person must  		be, by reason of disability, unable to engage in any substantial gainful  		activity, because of a medically determined physical or mental impairment  		expected to last for at least 12 months or to result in death.</p>
<p>Benefits from both AFDC and SSI can be received in low-income families,  		but not by the same person. For example, disabled parents can receive SSI while  		also obtaining benefits from AFDC on behalf of their dependent children. In the  		case where the child is disabled, that child could receive SSI while his or her  		mother and siblings receive AFDC. A 1979 study (Rymer, et al.) found that 42  		percent of disabled children on SSI lived in households which had received AFDC  		or State or local general assistance during the previous year.</p>
<p>Disabled women may be on the AFDC program, rather than SSI (only 7  		percent of disabled women in AFDC families receive SSI), because the  		eligibility rules for SSI are so strict. SSI eligibility for the disabled is  		established only after medical review. In general, the younger a person is the  		harder it is to be determined as disabled through medical reviews. The amount  		of the monthly AFDC check varies by State, family size, and other  		circumstances. SSI benefits are generally greater than those from AFDC, so  		there is usually an incentive for AFDC families with disabled members to apply  		for SSI.</p>
<h2>D. COMPARISONS OF DISABILITY</h2>
<h3>1. Percent Disabled</h3>
<p>Young women aged 18-44 who receive AFDC are significantly more likely to  		be disabled than women of the same age who do not receive AFDC: 21.6 percent  		compared to 9.0 percent, respectively. In the general population, blacks are  		more likely to be disabled than whites, but these differences disappear among  		the AFDC population. The percentage of disabled white women on AFDC (22.0  		percent) is virtually the same as for black women on AFDC (20.7 percent).  		However, very real differences exist between the races for women not on AFDC:  		8.4 percent of whites and 13.1 percent of blacks are disabled. (See  		<a href="#TABLE1">Table 1</a>.)</p>
<h3>2. Severity of the Disability</h3>
<p>Disabled women on AFDC are also unlike their non-AFDC counterparts in  		another important respect: their disability is more likely to be severe than  		moderate. The exact opposite is true for the rest of the population.  		Fifty-eight (58) percent of disabled women on AFDC have a severe disability  		compared to 37 percent of disabled women not on AFDC. For both black women and  		white, the pattern is consistent. Severely disabled women outnumber those who  		are moderately disabled in the AFDC population and in the non-AFDC population,  		the moderately disabled outnumber those who are severely disabled.</p>
<h3>3. Disability Rates</h3>
<p>Disability depends principally on age, but income is also important. In  		general, disability rates are higher for older persons and for the poor.  		However, women on AFDC are still more likely to be disabled than other women  		even after income and age are taken into account.</p>
<p>Disability rates are nearly twice as high for poor (less than 200  		percent of the poverty) women on AFDC as for poor women not on AFDC. The  		disability rate for women aged 25-34 is 19.5 per hundred for women on AFDC and  		10.8 per hundred for women not on AFDC and the rate for women aged 35-44 for  		women on AFDC (46.1 per hundred) is significantly higher than for women not on  		AFDC (23.1 per hundred).</p>
<h3>4. Conditions</h3>
<p>Self-reported health conditions mainly responsible for disability are  		very much the same for women on AFDC as for other women. Back or spine problems  		are the single most common cause of work disability for women under age 45,  		regardless of whether or not they receive AFDC. The prevalence of this  		condition is virtually the same for both groups: 24.7 percent of disabled women  		on AFDC and 26.9 percent of disabled women not on AFDC reported problems with  		their back or spine as the main reason they were unable to work. The second  		most frequent reason (again the same for both groups) was "other" conditions:  		23.7 percent for women who received AFDC and 19.1 percent for those who did  		not. Lung or respiratory trouble, at 11.1 percent, was the third most common  		cause of disability among AFDC recipients and the fifth (at 7.2 percent) for  		those not receiving AFDC.</p>
<h2>E. COMPARISONS OF DISABLED AND NON-DISABLED WOMEN ON AFDC</h2>
<h3>1. Age</h3>
<p>Disabled women on AFDC tend to be significantly older than their  		non-disabled counterparts. Disabled women are, on the average, 5.5 years older  		than non-disabled women: 32.3 years compared to 26.8 years. Similarly, severely  		disabled women tend to be significantly older--their average age is 33.8  		years--than moderately disabled women, whose average age is 30 years.</p>
<p>Racial differences are small, with disabled black women tending to be  		slightly older than whites. The average age for disabled blacks is 33 compared  		to 32.4 for disabled whites. The average age for non-disabled blacks and whites  		on AFDC is almost identical: 26.3 years and 26.8 years, respectively.</p>
<p>Much of the overall youth associated with the AFDC population can be  		attributed to non-disabled women. Significant differences are found when  		looking at the percentage of AFDC women aged 35 or older: only 14.4 percent of  		non-disabled women are aged 35 or over compared to 44.6 percent of the  		disabled, 30.9 percent of the moderately disabled and 54.5 percent of the  		severely disabled.</p>
<h3>2. Marital Status</h3>
<p>Overall, women on AFDC who have never married (44 percent) outnumber  		those who are separated or divorced (41 percent), those who are still married  		(13 percent), and widows (1 percent). Nearly one-half (48.8 percent) of  		non-disabled women have never been married compared to one-third of moderately  		disabled (33.2 percent) and one-fourth (24.7 percent) of severely disabled  		women. There are racial differences, with blacks far more likely than whites to  		have never been married. However, disabled women are more likely to have been  		married, that is separated or divorced, regardless of race: 66.5 percent of  		disabled whites and 57.1 percent of disabled blacks are separated or  		divorced.</p>
<h3>3. Children</h3>
<p>The average number of children (2.5) is the same for disabled and  		non-disabled women on AFDC. However, disabled women are significantly more  		likely to have older children, reflecting their average older age. The youngest  		child is at least 6 year old for one-quarter (24 percent) of non-disabled women  		compared to nearly one-half (47.3 percent) of disabled women.</p>
<p>Disabled women not only have older children, but they also have a  		significantly greater chance of having a disabled child than non-disabled women  		on AFDC. Race is not a factor. Nearly one-fourth (23.3 percent) of disabled  		women on AFDC have a disabled child compared to 9.3 percent of non-disabled  		AFDC women. Furthermore, the more severely disabled an AFDC women is, the  		greater her chance of having a disabled child: 25.2 percent of severely  		disabled and 20.6 percent of moderately disabled women on AFDC have a disabled  		child. (See <a href="#TABLE2">Table 2</a>.)</p>
<h3>4. Education</h3>
<p>The educational attainment of AFDC recipients is low, but non-disabled  		AFDC recipients are slightly better educated than their disabled counterparts.  		(However, none of these differences are statistically significant.) Overall,  		one-half (49 percent) of non-disabled and 57.2 percent of disabled women on  		AFDC have not finished high school. Those who are severely disabled are even  		more likely not to have graduated from high school: 61.6 percent of severely  		and 51 percent of moderately disabled women do not have a high school diploma.  		Although whites are more likely to have graduated from high school than blacks,  		the same pattern for disabled and non-disabled occurs: 42.7 percent of  		non-disabled whites and 52.54 percent of disabled whites have not finished high  		school. Similarly, 52.2 percent of non-disabled and blacks and 56.2 percent of  		disabled blacks also have not graduated.</p>
<h3>5. Welfare</h3>
<p>Moderately disabled women have been on the AFDC rolls for roughly the  		same number of years as the non-disabled: 3.9 years and 3.8, respectively.  		However, the severely disabled (at 6.9 years) have been on AFDC significantly  		longer (about 3 years) than the non-disabled or the moderately disabled.</p>
<p>Blacks tend to report longer welfare stays than whites. However,  		regardless of race, the disabled report a greater length of time on welfare  		than the non-disabled. For whites, the difference is small: only one year  		separates the average length of time on AFDC for the disabled (4.3 years) and  		non-disabled (3.3 years). However, disabled blacks reported an average of 8.5  		years on AFDC: nearly 4.5 years longer than non-disabled blacks (4.1  		years).</p>
<p>Although most AFDC recipients also receive Food Stamps, the disabled are  		slightly more likely to get Food Stamps than the non-disabled: 73.4 percent of  		disabled and 84.5 percent of non-disabled AFDC recipients get Food Stamps. (See  		<a href="#TABLE3">Table 3</a>.)</p>
<h3>6. Work Experience</h3>
<p>Although severely disabled women tend to have been on the welfare rolls  		the longest and to be the most poorly educated, they are also, curiously  		enough, the most likely to have had some work experience. (However, none of  		these differences are statistically significant). Eighty-six (86) percent of  		severely disabled women reported work experience. Little difference exists  		between the proportion of moderately disabled and non-disabled women: 79.4  		percent of the moderately disabled, and 78.7 percent of the non-disabled  		reported some work experience. More whites reported work experience than  		blacks, but the same pattern persisted, with the disabled tending to have  		slightly more experience than the non-disabled. Overall, disabled whites (at  		91.6 percent) were the most likely to have work experience and non-disabled  		blacks (at 75.4 percent) the least.</p>
<h3>7. Health Status and Medical Utilization</h3>
<p>Self-reported health status is a good indicator of overall health and is  		highly correlated with disability. When asked how to rate their health status  		(excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor), women on AFDC are far more likely  		to report themselves as being in fair or poor health than the rest of the  		population. In turn, disabled women on AFDC are significantly more likely to  		report themselves in fair or poor health than those who are non-disabled.  		However, 13.7 percent of the non-disabled women and 59.6 percent of disabled  		women on AFDC report themselves in fair or poor health. Health status is worse  		for the severely, rather than for the moderately disabled: 72 percent of  		severely disabled and 42 percent of moderately disabled women are in fair or  		poor health.</p>
<p>Among the general population, the proportion of blacks in fair or poor  		health is slightly greater than that for whites. However, the proportion of  		disabled women with fair or poor health is virtually identical for both blacks  		and whites: 61.5 percent compared to 60.5 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>The average number of doctor visits (4.2) for non-disabled women on AFDC  		is slight;y fewer than the national average of 4.7. However, disabled women on  		AFDC reported a significantly higher average doctor visits (9.5). Severely  		disabled women had more (11 visits) and moderately disabled fewer (7.5 visits).  		Indeed, severely disabled women on AFDC average more doctor visits per year  		than the elderly--whose average is 8.3 visits.</p>
<h2>F. WELFARE WORK PROGRAMS</h2>
<p>Welfare work programs are seen by many as attempt to lessen dependency  		on AFDC. Federal law requires certain able-bodied AFDC recipients aged 16 years  		or older to register for work or job training. Exemptions are allowed if the  		individual is unable to participate due to illness or incapacity, advanced age,  		full-time student status, remoteness from a work registration facility, the  		need to care for an ill or incapacitated household member, or if that  		individual is in the last trimester of pregnancy or is already working 30 or  		more hours per week. State AFDC programs may require work registrants to  		participate in one of several work programs: the Work Incentive Program, the  		Community Work Experience Program, Work Supplementation, or Job Search.</p>
<p>In addition, States may obtain demonstrations from the Federal  		government to develop and establish work programs designed to decrease welfare  		dependency. Under these waivers, States can be more flexible in developing  		welfare work programs. For example, recipients are exempted from registering  		for work programs if their youngest child is under age six. However, States  		have the option of lowering the age to under three or maybe even younger.</p>
<p>The high level of disability among AFDC women has implications for how  		many women can realistically register for welfare work programs. Although there  		are provisions for exempting incapacitated persons from work program  		registration, the number of such individuals may be higher than previously  		believed. Nationwide, only 3 percent of AFDC parents are eligible for AFDC on  		the basis of incapacitation. The number of incapacitated persons is obtained by  		counting how many adults become eligible for AFDC on this basis. However,  		individuals are placed in this category only because when they do not come in  		under any other criteria. For example, a woman is both unmarried and  		incapacitated, she would be judged as eligible for AFDC because she is  		unmarried, not because she is incapacitated. AFDC program counts of the  		incapacitated are, therefore, artificially low.</p>
<p>The following figure gives a breakdown of the percentage of AFDC women  		who would be eligible for welfare work programs if the prevalence of  		disability, as indicated in SIPP, is considered. However, it is important to  		note that disability which is self-reported in a survey, such as SIPP, may not  		entirely coincide with the process which welfare offices use to exempt persons  		on the basis of illness or incapacitation from work registration requirements.  		(See <a href="#figure1">FIGURE 1</a>.)</p>
<p>The percent of women eligible to register for work programs is arrived  		at after three steps. First, women who are disabled are exempted. Secondly,  		non-disabled women with disabled children are exempted. Finally, the age of the  		youngest child is considered (i.e. under one, under three, or under six years  		of age).</p>
<table><tr><td><b>Step 1</b></td>
<td>21.5 percent of women are exempt from registration because they are  			 disabled.</td>
</tr><tr><td><b>Step 2</b></td>
<td>Another 7.3 percent are exempt, because although they are not  			 disabled, they have a disabled child.</td>
</tr><tr><td><b>Step 3</b></td>
<td>States which require registration for mothers whose youngest child  			 is under six would have only 15.2 percent eligible for work programs. States  			 setting the age limit as under three would have 36.9 percent and States which  			 would require all mothers whose youngest child is under age one would have 54.8  			 percent of the mothers available for registration.</td>
</tr></table><p>One reason for these somewhat low percentages is that the non-disabled  		AFDC mothers are younger and are actually more likely to have very young  		children (and thus be exempt from work registration requirements) than older,  		disabled mothers.</p>
<h2>G. CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p>According to SIPP, women receiving AFDC are much more apt to be disabled  		than those not on welfare. The numbers are much higher than expected even after  		the usual predictors of disability (age, race, and income) have been  		considered. The number of disabled children living in AFDC families is also  		high.</p>
<p>Very little is known about why these women and their children are  		disabled. Disabilities can occur for many reasons, such as infectious diseases  		(AIDS), non-infectious diseases (hypertension), accidents, injuries, congenital  		abnormalities, or as the result of mental illness or drug or alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>Disabled and non-disabled women on AFDC differ in so many respects that  		it is easy to think of them as two separate populations, who may very well have  		entered and stayed on welfare for entirely different reasons. The non-disabled  		are younger, have younger and healthier children, have spent less time on  		welfare, and are more likely to be unmarried. The disabled, on the other hand,  		are older, more apt to have a disabled child, have longer stays on welfare, and  		are more likely to have separated from or divorced their husbands.</p>
<p>Disability should be considered in work welfare programs. These programs  		may have to be modified for the disabled or for those who have disabled  		children. At first glance, it appears far fewer women would be eligible for  		work programs if disability status is considered.</p>
<p>However, there are hopeful notes. More disabled than non-disabled women  		have a work history so they may be willing to work if their health improves. It  		may very well be premature to recommend specific ways to lessen the welfare  		dependency of disabled women until more is known about why they are disabled.
