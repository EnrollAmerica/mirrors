</dl><h2><a name="background" id="background">BACKGROUND</a></h2>
<p>In the mid 1990s, both insurers and nursing home providers enjoyed a  		relatively stable market for professional liability insurance.<sup><font><a href="#ref1">1</a></font></sup> Liability claims against nursing  		home were few, the cost of insurance was stable and affordable, and  		underwriting practices among insurers were relatively lax. Insurers did little  		to differentiate liability risks within the nursing home industry. </p>
<p>Today, it is a different story.<sup><font><a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a></font></sup> Litigation activity  		against nursing home providers for negligent care and abuse increased  		dramatically in the late 1990s, particularly in certain states. Many of the  		insurance carriers participating in the nursing home market incurred huge  		financial losses, and decided to leave the market altogether.<sup><font><a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a></font></sup>  		Correspondingly, many of the national nursing home chains, which are largely  		self-insured, incurred significant operating losses related to liability  		claims, putting additional financial pressures on an industry that was already  		in severe financial difficulty. As regulated insurance carriers left the  		market, the void was filled by surplus line carriers which are  		subject to less regulation by state insurance departments. The price of  		liability insurance for providers increased dramatically, while the terms and  		conditions of coverage became more constricted. Insurers took on less risk at  		higher prices. Moreover, those insurers that remained in the market tightened  		their underwriting practices to differentiate high risk and  		low risk providers. Providers with a history of liability claims or  		quality of care citations found themselves unable to purchase liability  		coverage at any price. In addition, new forms of risk pooling for liability  		exposure, such as captives, also emerged as alternatives to traditional  		insurance coverage.</p>
<p>This period of volatility in the nursing home liability insurance market  		also put increased focus on potential public policy responses in the form of  		tort reform. The nursing home industry contended that much of the increase in  		litigation activity was due to frivolous claims not related to  		negligent care or patient abuse. Consequently, a number of states enacted tort  		reforms that changed the legal framework under which residents and/or family  		members could seek damages for negligent or abusive care practices. States also  		placed limits on the amount of damages that could be awarded to plaintiffs  		and/or their family members, particularly non-economic damages for pain and  		suffering. The issue of whether tort reform is the appropriate policy response  		to the recent trends in the nursing home liability market is a matter of  		considerable policy debate among stakeholders, who hold widely divergent views  		on both the underlying causes of the insurance crisis, and its  		solution.<sup><font><a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="description" id="description">STUDY DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p>To help inform the public policy debate, the Department of Health and  		Human Services (HHS), Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation  		contracted with Thomson Medstat to conduct a study on recent trends in the  		nursing home liability insurance market and their effect on the costs and  		availability of nursing home liability insurance. Medstat was directed to  		conduct this analysis through both qualitative and quantitative methods. Trends  		and issues related to nursing home liability insurance were examined through a  		review and synthesis of the available literature, and through discussions with  		key stakeholders. More detailed analysis of current trends in the nursing home  		liability insurance market was conducted through case studies of selected  		states. In addition, Medstat was directed to conduct a feasibility analysis of  		collecting detailed information on liability claims filed against nursing home  		providers, as well as to assess the feasibility of linking liability claims  		data with nursing home quality measures.</p>
<p>Medstat conducted interviews with key stakeholders with differing  		perspectives on the nursing home liability insurance market. Stakeholders  		included both for-profit and not-for-profit nursing home providers and assisted  		living providers, insurance industry representatives, insurance brokers, state  		insurance regulators, representatives from provider trade associations at the  		state and federal levels, plaintiff attorneys, defense attorneys, consumer  		advocates, state licensing and certification agency personnel, state Medicaid  		agency personnel, medical directors of nursing homes, geriatricians with large  		nursing home practices, and long-term care policy researchers. In addition,  		Medstat conducted case studies of five states: California, Florida, Georgia,  		Ohio and Texas. These states were selected because they were known to represent  		a range of trends in the liability insurance market: Texas and Florida were  		identified as states where there was particular uncertainty in the nursing home  		liability insurance market ; California was selected as a state with a fairly  		unique tort environment; Ohio was selected as a relatively stable market in  		comparison to most states; and Georgia was selected as a state that had not yet  		experienced the severe volatility of other states, but was considered to be  		potentially on the verge of a significant crisis, given its geographic  		proximity to Florida.</p>
<p>A concerted effort was made to collect facility-level information on  		liability claims from the nursing home industry. Provider-level data on  		liability claims are considered highly sensitive information by the industry,  		since the vast majority of claims are settled out of court and considered  		confidential. Understandably, providers do not want information about their  		liability claims history made available to the plaintiffs bar or to the  		general public. Consequently, in soliciting the nursing home industry to submit  		liability claims data for this study, the HHS established special precautions  		to protect the confidentiality of data submissions. Through an inter-agency  		agreement, the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) was  		designated as the recipient and holder of liability claims information  		submitted by nursing home providers. The data were maintained in a secure  		environment within AHRQ, and access to the data was limited exclusively to  		staff authorized to work on the project. No provider-level data was released  		from the AHRQ secured environment.</p>
<p>Although the nursing home industry cooperated with the HHS in providing  		liability claims data for the study, the quantitative analysis had multiple  		limitations. First, although attempts were made to elicit data from a broad  		representation of providers, virtually all data submissions came from large  		national for-profit chains. Second, although providers were asked to submit a  		specific and common set of data items, providers generally submitted whatever  		data they maintained internally to manage their liability claims and operate  		internal risk management programs. Further, the data submitted usually included  		all <i>general </i>and professional liability claims, which are usually covered  		under the same insurance policy. For example, if a visitor to a nursing home  		slipped and fell on ice in the parking lot, this event (and any associated  		claim) was usually included in the data submission. Employee-related incidents  		(e.g. traffic accidents) and reported thefts in the facility were also  		generally included. Third, data submissions by providers generally included all  		internally-reported incidents and events that occurred in the facility,  		regardless of whether the incident or event in question eventually led to a  		professional liability claim. Providers generally collect information on all  		incidents and events as part of their overall risk management programs and then  		investigate all reported incidents and events quickly and thoroughly in order  		to ensure that adequate documentation of the event is available should a  		liability claim eventually be filed. Fourth, while the data submissions  		generally included information on <i>estimated </i>liability costs associated  		with the incident or event, the actual settlement cost, if there was one, was  		often not available in the database. Medstat was informed that providers are  		often themselves unaware of the eventual settlement cost of a professional  		liability claim, which is held confidential between the insurance carrier, the  		defense attorney and the plaintiff attorney. Due to these limitations, the  		conclusions that could be drawn from the quantitative component of the study  		were extremely limited. This report is based primarily on the qualitative  		components of the study.</p>
<p>This report first presents a summary of the liability insurance and tort  		reform environment in each of the five states that were selected for case study  		analysis. Next, the report describes national trends in litigation and claims  		against the nursing home industry. The report then presents trends in the  		nursing home liability insurance market across the country, in response to the  		rise in liability claims and costs. Last, the report discusses how various  		states have responded to the nursing home liability insurance crisis through  		the enactment of tort reform legislation.</p>
<h2><a name="findings" id="findings">CASE STUDY FINDINGS</a></h2>
<p>The five case studies confirmed that changes in the nursing home  		liability insurance market have played out quite differently across state  		markets. Moreover, the public policy response was also highly diverse,  		depending upon the severity of the situation. Texas and Florida experienced  		more severe situations. The Medstat study began in the fall of 2002,  		approximately one year after the enactment of Senate Bill 1202 (S.B. 1202) in  		Florida, a major tort reform initiative intended to bring stability back to the  		liability insurance market in that state. Thus, our case study focused on the  		impact of S.B. 1202 several years after its enactment. Although there was some  		evidence of a decline in litigation activity in Florida since the enactment of  		the legislation, regulated insurance carriers had still not re-entered the  		market there, and many nursing home providers were still operating without any  		liability insurance coverage at all.<sup><font><a href="#ref8">8</a></font></sup> Another trend was that many of the national  		nursing home chains which had operations in Florida had completely divested  		themselves of all their facilities in that state, in order to minimize their  		liability exposure.</p>
<p>The Texas case study was conducted coincidentally with the legislative  		debate in that state regarding the enactment of House Bill 4 (H.B. 4), a major  		liability reform initiative that was not limited to the nursing home market, or  		even the health care market.<sup><font><a href="#ref9">9</a></font></sup> The State of Texas had been experiencing a  		liability insurance crisis across a broad swath of industries, including health  		care, long-term care, trucking, housing, and manufacturing. H.B. 4, which was  		debated fiercely in the state legislature in 2003, placed hard caps  		on economic and non-economic damages awarded in tort cases. The major lesson  		from the Texas case study was that the impact of tort reform depends on the  		detailed provisions of the legislation. As in Florida, the impacts of tort  		reform in Texas were not immediate. Nursing home insurers were cautious about  		re-entering the market until they saw solid evidence of reduced liability  		exposure.</p>
<p>The legal environment in California was unique. Nursing home cases were  		litigated under two related statutes that were enacted with somewhat  		contradictory policy intentions. First, the Medical Injury Compensation Reform  		Act, enacted in 1975, was intended to specifically limit legal actions against  		medical care providers, and is considered model legislation for medical  		malpractice reform initiatives across the country.<sup><font><a href="#ref10">10</a></font></sup> The second statute, the Elderly Abuse and  		Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (EADACPA) was, on the other hand, enacted  		specifically to increase financial incentives to plaintiffs and plaintiff  		attorneys to bring civil actions against providers who abuse or are otherwise  		negligent to nursing home residents or other elders. Consequently, litigation  		against nursing home providers plays out in the intersection of these two  		statutes in a manner that adds considerable complexity to individual cases. The  		amount of legal resources invested in litigating individual cases in  		California, as reported by both plaintiffs and defendants, was considerable.  		Further, legal ambiguities created by the intersection of these statutes in  		California were still seeking clarification in various appellate courts around  		the state.</p>
<p>Georgia did indeed appear to be on the verge of a major increase in  		litigation activity. The concern of nursing home providers in Georgia was that  		plaintiff attorneys who had developed specialized expertise in nursing home  		litigation in Florida had saturated that market and were looking northward to  		Georgia to expand their practices.<sup><font><a href="#ref11">11</a></font></sup> Although the frequency of litigation in  		Georgia was clearly not on the scale of Florida or Texas, insurance carriers  		indicated anticipation of a significant growth in litigation activity, and had  		raised prices on their insurance products accordingly. Georgia has also seen  		significant growth in the use of captives as an alternative insurance  		arrangement.</p>
<p>Another key issue that was most evident in Georgia was the importance of  		venue. Juries in urban counties were perceived as considerably more sympathetic  		to plaintiffs, and more likely to award significantly higher damages, than  		juries in rural counties. This perception had in fact borne out in the few  		nursing home cases that had gone to jury trial in Georgia. Thus, there was  		reportedly considerable maneuvering by plaintiff attorneys to have cases  		litigated in venues considered to be more favorable to the plaintiff side.  		Indeed, when the Georgia state legislature eventually enacted tort reform  		legislation in February 2005, the establishment of venue was a central  		provision of the legislation.</p>
<p>In comparison to the other case study states, the nursing home liability  		insurance market in Ohio was far less volatile.<sup><font><a href="#ref12">12</a></font></sup> Although regulated carriers had left Ohio as  		they had in other states, leaving only surplus line carriers to serve the  		industry, litigation activity in Ohio, according to stakeholders, was less than  		observed in other states. A unique characteristic of Ohio was the higher regard  		with which the public viewed the nursing home industry. The higher public  		persona of the nursing home industry in Ohio may be related to the fact that  		the industry in Ohio is dominated by small privately-owned companies, many of  		which are family owned and operated. The owners of these facilities are  		generally viewed as an integral part of their local communities, and in rural  		areas, often one of the larger and more stable employers. Stakeholders  		repeatedly mentioned that it was difficult to bring lawsuits against nursing  		home owners who were regarded so highly by the communities in which they  		resided. As one Ohio defense attorney succinctly put it: its all  		about the audience.</p>
<h2><a name="litigation" id="litigation">NURSING HOME LITIGATION TRENDS</a></h2>
<p>A major factor contributing to the recent volatility in the nursing home  		liability insurance market has been increased litigation.<sup><font><a href="#ref13">13</a></font></sup> Losses in the nursing home  		market rose dramatically in the late 1990s. There were significant increases in  		both the frequency of liability claims and in the size of damages awarded,  		primarily through negotiated settlements. However, reliable empirical data on  		the increase in frequency and size of liability claims are lacking, and the  		five case studies made it clear that litigation activity varied dramatically  		across states. Consequently, considerable disagreement remains among  		stakeholders regarding both the magnitude of litigation activity, as well as  		the relationship between increases in liability claims and the cost and  		availability of liability insurance.</p>
<p>A primary source of information about litigation trends is a series of  		studies conducted by Aon Risk Consultants for the American Health Care  		Association (AHCA), a nursing home trade association representing primarily  		for-profit nursing homes, including the large national chains.<sup><font><a href="#ref14">14</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a></font></sup> Sponsored by AHCA, Aon conducted five annual  		studies from 2001 through 2005 on general and professional liability losses  		incurred by nursing home operators. The data for the Aon studies came from  		nursing home providers that voluntarily responded to a data call from AHCA to  		participate in the study resulting in a limited convenience sampling of  		providers. Over the five years that the studies were conducted, between 60 and  		108 separate nursing home operators, provided claims data. While this  		represents only a small percentage of all nursing home operators, the operators  		that participated in the study included many of the large for-profit nursing  		home chains. For example, in the 2004 study, just eight operators accounted for  		77% of the total liability losses reported. The nursing homes participating in  		the Aon studies represented about 23-25% of all nursing home beds in the  		country.</p>
<p>Although the Aon studies have served as a primary data source on nursing  		home liability trends in recent years, they have also been criticized for  		having a number of limitations that compromise the generalizability of the  		study findings to the entire nursing home industry. These limitations  		include:</p>
<ul><li>The providers which contributed data to the Aon studies were  		  dominated by large for-profit, self-insured chains that were known to have  		  incurred the highest rate of liability claims, and thus did not represent the  		  liability experience of the nursing home industry as a whole.</li>
<li>The providers in the Aon studies operated facilities that were  		  disproportionately located in states with the highest rate of liability claims.  		  For example, while the data contributors represented about 25% of all nursing  		  home beds nationwide, they represented 54% of all beds in the state of Florida,  		  38% of all beds in Mississippi, and 75% of all beds in Alabama. The national  		  average liability loss data reported by Aon did not adjust for these geographic  		  imbalances.</li>
<li>Since it generally takes an average of three to four years for a  		  liability claim to be resolved, estimated loss costs for the more recent years  		  were highly dependent upon actuarial assumptions made by Aon about the ultimate  		  resolution of outstanding claims. These assumptions were generally based upon  		  historical trends, which may or may not continue in the same direction.</li>
<li>Loss costs reported by providers participating in the Aon studies  		  included <i>general </i>liability losses as well as professional liability  		  losses. Thus, liability claims unrelated to the direct care of nursing home  		  patients (e.g., lawsuits brought by employees) were included in Aons  		  estimates. Aon did not disaggregate what proportion of total loss costs was  		  related to general liability claims and what proportion was attributable to  		  professional liability claims.</li>
<li>Given sponsorship of the Aon studies by AHCA, the studies have been  		  criticized as having a political agenda behind them (i.e., that AHCA wished to  		  demonstrate a need for state tort reform to address the problem of  		  runaway lawsuits against nursing home providers).</li>
</ul><p>Despite these limitations, the Aon studies are the most cited reference  		on nursing home liability trends in recent years. However, any conclusions from  		these data should be interpreted with appropriate caution. <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> presents average national loss costs estimated by  		Aon in the four studies conducted from 2002 through 2005. The studies showed a  		very rapid increase in loss costs in the four-year interval from 1996 through  		2000, averaging about 26% annually over this period. Over the following four  		years, loss costs continued to increase, although at a far reduced rate. In its  		most recent study, released in March 2005, Aon estimated that annual loss costs  		increased on average by about 3% annually between 2000 and 2004 for the  		providers represented in the study. However, over the eight-year period from  		1996 to 2004, according to the Aon study, liability losses still increased by  		over 180% for these providers.</p>
<p>A second study on this topic was conducted by the Insurance Services  		Office (ISO) in 2002.<sup><font><a href="#ref19">19</a></font></sup>  		The ISO is a research organization that provides statistical and research  		support to state Departments of Insurance. To conduct these studies, states  		mandate regulated insurance carriers to provide various data to the ISO for  		analysis. In 2002, the ISO of New Jersey conducted a study of liability claim  		costs in the nursing home industry for those nursing home providers covered by  		commercial insurers.</p>
<p>The ISO study differs from the Aon studies in a number of important  		respects:</p>
<ul><li> Nursing home providers represented in the ISO study were providers  		  that purchased liability insurance from commercial insurance companies  		  regulated by state Departments of Insurance. Thus, it excludes providers who  		  are either: (a) self-insured, or (b) covered by non-regulated insurers. As  		  previously discussed, these excluded providers are more likely to have incurred  		  higher liability losses than the providers included in the ISO study.</li>
<li> The ISO database was predominantly comprised of policies with limits  		  of $1 million on coverage. Thus, in its analysis, ISO assumed no settlements or  		  awards in excess of $1 million, since, in theory, those excess payments were  		  the responsibility of the provider, not the insurer.</li>
<li> The geographic distribution of providers represented in the ISO  		  study differed markedly from the geographic distribution represented in the Aon  		  studies. While the total number of beds in the ISO study represented about 26%  		  of all beds in the United States--similar to the Aon studies--the ISO sample  		  was more highly skewed to states with lower litigation activity. For example,  		  only 15% of all nursing home beds in Florida were represented (compared to 55%  		  in the Aon study) and only about 5% of all beds in Texas (compared to 19% in  		  the Aon study).</li>
</ul><p>Despite marked differences in the samples of nursing home providers  		represented in the Aon and ISO studies, it is interesting to compare their  		results, as shown in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>. Estimated loss costs per  		occupied bed, claim frequency, and claim severity were all significantly lower  		in the ISO study than in the Aon studies. For example, during 1998-2000, as  		shown in <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>, ISO estimated average loss costs of  		$209 per occupied bed. During the same time period, Aon estimated average loss  		costs of approximately $1,800 per occupied bed, almost nine times higher.</p>
<p>Whether the differing results in the Aon and ISO studies primarily  		reflect differences in the underlying liability experience of the nursing home  		providers represented in the respective studies, or whether there are  		additional reasons for the differing study results, such as actuarial  		assumptions used in estimating loss costs, is hard to tell. Given the marked  		differences in the composition of providers included in the two respective  		studies, it is reasonable to conclude that a large amount of the difference in  		study results reflects the underlying litigation experience of the provider  		samples represented in each study. </p>
<p>A third study on nursing home litigation conducted by researchers at the  		Harvard School of Public Health used a survey approach to measure litigation  		activity. Using a publicly-available legal directory, the researchers  		identified 464 plaintiff and defense attorneys nationwide who listed their  		practices as including nursing home or long-term care  		law. The researchers surveyed these 464 attorneys in the year 2001 using a  		web-based survey instrument, achieving a response rate of 60%. </p>
<p>The results of the study showed a relatively high rate of nursing home  		litigation. Based upon the survey results, the researchers estimated a total of  		8,253 claims and total compensation payments (excluding defense costs) of $2.3  		billion in the 12 months prior to the survey, as well as an average payment  		amount of $406,000 per compensated claim. The latter estimate of claim severity  		is significantly higher than reported in either the Aon study or the ISO study,  		and may be attributable to the fact that attorneys tend to recall only those  		cases with higher settlement amounts. If the total number of estimated claims  		is divided by the number of total occupied nursing home beds in the United  		States (about 1,620,000) then claim frequency nationwide would equal about 5.1  		per 1,000 beds, which is higher than the ISO estimates but considerably lower  		than the Aon estimates.<sup><font><a href="#notea">a</a></font></sup>  		If the same assumptions are applied to total compensation payments, then the  		average loss cost per bed (again excluding defense costs) would be in the range  		of $1,419 per bed, considerably closer to the Aon estimates than the ISO  		estimates. The Harvard study is the only study that attempted to measure the  		full scope of litigation activity across the nursing home industry. As in the  		Aon studies, a very high percentage of litigation activity, as well as total  		loss costs incurred by the entire industry, were attributable to litigation  		activity in just two states: Florida and Texas. </p>
<p>A fourth study attempting to measure the magnitude of nursing home  		litigation activity was conducted by the California Advocates for Nursing Home  		Reform (CANHR) in 2003.<sup><font><a href="#ref20">20</a></font></sup> The study methodology employed by CANHR was a  		comprehensive review of California Supreme Court civil indexes in counties that  		represented approximately half of all nursing home beds in the state. The  		review identified all general jurisdiction lawsuits that included a claim for  		elder abuse. This is because liability claims against nursing homes in  		California are almost always brought under the EADACPA elder abuse statute  		discussed earlier in this report.</p>
<p>The CANHR study found a much lower level of litigation activity in  		California than reported in the Aon studies. Over the three-year period from  		2000 to 2002, CANHR identified an average of 166 lawsuits per year in the  		sample counties, equal to a claim frequency rate of 2.8 claims per 1,000 beds.  		For the same time period, Aon estimated a claim frequency rate of about 11.5  		claims per 1,000 beds in California. Furthermore, CANHR found no evidence of  		increasing frequency--the number of lawsuits filed in 2002 was less than the  		number filed in 2001. CANHR also found a strong correlation between the  		probability of a nursing home being sued with public records of poorer quality  		care. The facilities with the highest number of lawsuits filed against them had  		been more frequently cited for deficiencies, and received more consumer  		complaints, than facilities that were not sued. Based upon its findings, CANHR  		titled its study <i>Much Ado About Nothing: Debunking the Myth of Frequent and  		Frivolous Elder Abuse Lawsuits Against Californias Nursing Homes.</i></p>
<p>One potential criticism of the methodology employed by CANHR is that it  		only identified liability claims that had progressed to the point of the  		plaintiff filing a lawsuit in the county courts. Industry representatives  		stated that many liability claims are settled before ever progressing to the  		stage of the actual filing of a lawsuit. Expressing a contrary view, one  		plaintiff attorney interviewed during the California site visit argued  		emphatically that defendants <i>never</i> settled an EADACPA claim unless an  		actual lawsuit had been filed.</p>
<p>What conclusions can be drawn from these highly disparate studies, and  		their highly disparate results? We believe that based on these study results,  		the findings of the case study site visits, interviews with key stakeholders,  		and a review of the literature on nursing home liability, that the following  		general observations are reasonable:</p>
<ul><li>There has been a significant increase in litigation activity against  		  nursing homes over the last decade. This increase in litigation was  		  particularly pronounced during the period from 1995 to 2000, but since the year  		  2000, has leveled off considerably.</li>
<li>There is significant geographic variation in the rate of litigation  		  activity against nursing home across the country. Florida had (and probably  		  still has) the highest rate of litigation, followed by Texas. For whatever  		  reason, the level of litigation activity against nursing homes has been higher  		  in southern states than in northern states.</li>
<li>Large, for-profit, multi-regional nursing home chains have been sued  		  at a higher rate than smaller independent operators, either for-profit or  		  not-for-profit. However, all types of nursing home operators have seen  		  increases in their liability exposure.</li>
<li>Lawsuits against nursing homes are rarely defended in a jury trial.  		  Most liability claims are settled out of court, with the vast majority settled  		  with some compensatory payments to the plaintiff. Defendants believe that  		  juries in nursing home litigation cases are extremely unpredictable, and  		  generally prefer to settle the case than risk the chance of a large damage  		  award in a jury trial.</li>
<li>With the enactment of nursing home residents rights statutes as  		  well as elder abuse statutes in many states, the statutory basis for bringing  		  lawsuits against nursing homes has broadened in recent years.<sup><font><a href="#ref21">21</a></font></sup></li>
</ul><h2><a name="liability" id="liability">NURSING HOME LIABILITY INSURANCE MARKET  		TRENDS</a></h2>
<p>Concurrent with the increase in litigation activity, the market for  		nursing home liability insurance has undergone major changes over the last  		decade. In 2005, the market bears little resemblance to 1995, even in states  		where there has been little litigation activity. The market is still changing  		rapidly, and it is difficult to predict what it will look like in another five  		or ten years. Looking retrospectively, the market has undergone the following  		changes over the last decade:</p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b><font>Most carriers that were in the nursing home liability insurance  			 product-line in the mid 1990s have left the market.</font></b></font></div>
<p>Insurers, most of which were commercial admitted carriers that had large  		market shares in the nursing home liability insurance market, incurred large  		financial losses in the late 1990s.<sup><font><a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a></font></sup> Both providers and  		insurers reported that liability insurance premiums were generally priced at  		about $50/bed for a $1 million occurrence-based policy in the mid  		1990s, with insurers doing very little underwriting or risk management. These  		insurers, particularly those with a large market presence in Florida and Texas,  		were hit hard by the rise in liability costs in these states, and elsewhere.  		St. Paul Insurance Company, one of the largest national carriers in the market,  		decided to get out of the market altogether in 1999. Other major carriers  		exiting the market included Guaranty Insurance Company, Employers Reinsurance  		Corporation, Reliance National Insurance Company, the Doctors Company, USF  		Insurance Company, Agricultural Excess and Surplus Insurance Company, Admiral  		Insurance Company, and the Hartford Life Insurance Company, which for many  		years had an association with the American Association of Homes and Services  		for the Aged. Most of these companies left the market, or stopped issuing new  		policies, in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
<p>In most cases, these companies decision to leave the market was an  		easy one. The nursing home liability insurance market is not a large one, and  		for the larger liability insurers, nursing home insurance was usually a side  		product-line, for which the insurers had built little if any infrastructure.  		When liability losses began to exceed premium revenue, many companies simply  		decided to leave the market altogether rather than risk additional financial  		losses.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b><font>Limited access to the reinsurance market was another factor in  			 the exit of commercial carriers from the market.</font></b></font></div>
<p>Most commercial insurers retain only limited risk for their  		product-lines, and sell off the remaining risk to the reinsurance market.  		Rather than assessing the risk of individual policyholders, reinsurers tend to  		assess risk on a product-line and/or geographical basis. When the nursing home  		liability insurance market began to incur losses in the late 1990s, most  		reinsurers decided to stop assuming any risk in the nursing home product-line.  		In turn, the lack of access to the reinsurance market influenced the decisions  		of commercial carriers to get out of the market.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b><font>As admitted carriers left the market, surplus line carriers  			 entered.</font></b></font></div>
<p>Policyholders may purchase insurance in either the admitted  		or non-admitted insurance markets. Insurance companies that operate  		in the non-admitted market are also called surplus line  		carriers.<sup><font><a href="#ref24">24</a>, <a href="#ref25">25</a></font></sup> Admitted carriers are commercial insurers  		that must comply with state Departments of Insurance review and regulation of  		policies, forms, and rates. One advantage of admitted coverage is that admitted  		carriers can participate in the protection of the states guarantee fund  		in the event of a financial insolvency. There is also some marketing advantage  		for an insurer to write on an admitted basis, because some brokers, facility  		providers and lenders perceive value in state oversight and participation in  		the guarantee fund.</p>
<p>In the surplus market, because rates and forms are not subject to state  		regulation, the insurer has greater flexibility in how coverage is designed and  		priced. Surplus carriers are also able to respond more rapidly to changes in  		the marketplace. Changes in coverage forms and application protocols, when  		needed, can be put into place more quickly when coverage is not subject to a  		lengthy compliance review by the state. However, surplus line carriers have no  		protection from the states guarantee fund (which actually benefits  		providers insured by an insolvent insurer more than it benefits the insurer  		itself). In addition, surplus carriers must pay an excess and surplus  		lines tax that is not levied on admitted carriers.</p>
<p>Virtually every nursing home provider we interviewed during the study,  		in both the case study states and elsewhere, indicated that they had been  		forced to switch insurance carriers within the last few years. Most were forced  		to switch because their former carrier had stopped renewing policies. These  		providers (generally through their insurance brokers) were then forced to shop  		for new carriers in the surplus market. It was at this time that many providers  		experienced the shock of a major increase in premium costs for liability  		insurance, along with significant reductions in coverage. During the course of  		our study, stakeholders identified only two companies (AIG and CNA) that were  		still writing policies on an admitted basis. These two companies had stayed in  		the business by drastically changing their underwriting practices in order to  		differentiate liability risk among applicant policyholders.<sup><font><a href="#ref26">26</a></font></sup> Thus, in some cases, current  		policyholders of AIG and CNA were not allowed to renew their policies due to  		the fact that they did not meet the new underwriting criteria.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b><font>Terms and conditions of liability insurance coverage changed  			 dramatically.</font></b></font></div>
<p>In addition to charging higher prices, most surplus line carriers  		shifted a greater percentage of the risk back onto providers. Deductibles,  		which could be anywhere from $10,000 to $1,000,000, were imposed before  		insurance coverage began. Deductibles were sometimes imposed on a <i>per  		claim</i> basis, rather than a total policy basis. Policies often had new  		limits on the amount of coverage provided, so that insurers only provided risk  		protection within narrowly defined risk corridors.</p>
<p>Another important change in coverage was a switch from policies written  		on a claims occurrence basis to policies written on a claims  		made basis. Claims occurrence policies provide coverage for  		all incidents and events that occur during the term of the policy, regardless  		of when a liability claim is made, or when a lawsuit is settled. Policies  		written on a claims made basis only provide coverage for insured  		events that both occur and <i>for which a claim is made</i> during the term of  		the policy. Thus, if an incident occurs, but the policy is terminated before a  		claim is made, liability for the incident is not insured. This switch in  		coverage from an occurrence basis to a claims made  		basis allows insurers to limit their risk if a specific policyholder  		demonstrates increased liability risk--for example, an increase in deficiency  		citations.</p>
<p>Coverage has also changed in terms of exclusions for specific types of  		losses. Some of the newer policies impose specific and additional coverage  		limits for losses based on sexual or physical abuse, and thus might exclude  		paying a claim if abuse was found to be an underlying cause for the  		claim. Insurers also can rely on fraudulent statements on the  		application as the basis for denying a claim in certain instances. For example,  		insurers may offer policy provisions that would limit their obligation to cover  		a loss if the provider did not adequately represent its risk (e.g., provided  		false or misleading information on the application, such as misrepresenting the  		acuity of residents typically cared for or qualifications of staff) or if the  		provider failed to carry out a risk management protocol that it  		indicated on the application was a routine element (e.g., a fall prevention  		protocol). An insurer might deny a claim for a loss based on actions of a  		specific employee with a criminal background if it was revealed that the  		provider failed to do a background check before hiring the employee. Many  		policies also exclude or limit claims related to punitive damages.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b><font>Data on the current costs of liability insurance are  			 sporadic.</font></b></font></div>
<p>While the costs of liability insurance coverage have increased for all  		providers, reliable data on current prices in the marketplace are not  		available. The switch from admitted to surplus line carriers has made the  		collection of data more problematic, because surplus line carriers are not  		required to report their rates to state Departments of Insurance.<sup><font><a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a></font></sup>  		Further, whereas in the past, rates were fairly comparable within the same  		geographical area, rates can now vary significantly from provider to provider  		based upon the carriers assessment of each providers individual  		liability exposure. Changes in the terms and conditions of coverage also make  		it difficult to fairly compare rates across policies.</p>
<p>In its latest study, Aon provided limited data on the insurance  		experience of the subset of providers in its study sample that had  		commercially-provided insurance. This included 53 of the 76 participants in the  		study that represented about 45% of the nursing home beds in the study. These  		providers reported some attenuation in premium increases over the 2002-2004  		time period, in comparison to the previous two years. However, providers  		reported continued reductions in liability limits, as well as increased  		deductibles. Smaller providers reported the greatest increases in premium  		prices.</p>
<p>Without reliable data on the actual costs of liability insurance for  		nursing home providers, it is difficult for policymakers to assess the  		magnitude of the crisis in the liability insurance market, and  		whether the market is returning to a more stable environment.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b><font>Improved underwriting has become increasingly important to  			 profitability.</font></b></font></div>
<p>For those insurers that remain in the nursing home liability insurance  		market, improved underwriting practices have become increasingly critical to  		financial performance. Insurers have invested significant resources in  		improving their ability to assess liability risk for both individual providers  		and for groups of providers.<sup><font><a href="#ref29">29</a></font></sup> The market has become increasingly  		competitive in this regard, meaning that the expertise that an insurer is able  		to bring to the market in terms of its underwriting capacity has increasingly  		become a competitive factor in the marketplace. Those insurers that demonstrate  		superior performance in both evaluating risk and pricing risk appropriately are  		those that are able to achieve higher profitability. This was generally not the  		case ten years ago.</p>
<p>Applications for insurance coverage now request an extensive amount of  		information from providers. Insurers are also more prone to purchase additional  		information from third-party vendors such as CareScout and HealthGrade, which  		grade facilities based upon their own research about quality performance and  		claims histories. Underwriting criteria have become increasingly proprietary to  		the point where many insurers prefer not to discuss their methodologies for  		rating insurance applicants.</p>
<p>One outcome of this increased emphasis on insurance underwriting is that  		providers with poor claims histories and/or a record of providing lower quality  		care find it increasingly difficult to purchase insurance coverage.<sup><font><a href="#ref30">30</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a></font></sup> These  		providers can be denied coverage altogether, or the price and terms of purchase  		can be financially prohibitive. Other providers complained that with the new  		underwriting criteria, even one liability claim, regardless of its merits,  		could spell disaster in terms of that providers ability to access or  		afford insurance in the future.<sup><font><a href="#ref32">32</a></font></sup></p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b><font>Risk management programs are increasingly utilized as a  			 management tool for reducing liability risk.</font></b></font></div>
<p>Risk management programs are structured approaches to purposefully limit  		liability risk. They include systematic efforts to improve and maintain high  		standards for care quality, but can also include additional management  		techniques to minimize liability exposure, such as improving written  		documentation. They are often formalized within the management structure of  		nursing home providers in the form of Risk Management Committees, and/or a  		designated Director of Risk Management, along with formal Risk Management plans  		that are implemented and monitored by senior management.<sup><font><a href="#ref33">33</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Risk management programs were usually designed and implemented by  		providers, but there were also instances of liability insurers developing their  		own programs, which they then mandated on their policyholders as a condition of  		coverage. This latter practice was often controversial, since providers  		sometimes complained that insurers were not knowledgeable about sound care  		practices, and had designed risk management programs simply from reviewing the  		literature on the subject. </p>
<p>Risk management programs can have a variety of difference approaches and  		components. Examples include:</p>
<ul><li>Profiling prior cases that led to liability claims and limiting  		  exposure to similar types of cases going forward, including changing admission  		  practices to reduce admissions of cases that have a higher probability of  		  leading to lawsuits.</li>
<li>Intensified quality improvement programs specifically targeted to  		  reduce incidents that most frequently lead to litigation (e.g.,  		  elopements).</li>
<li>Structured initiatives to actively engage family members in the care  		  management process in order to educate families about nursing home care  		  management processes, and the realities of maintaining functionality among  		  nursing home residents, as well as to develop informal relationships with  		  family members that may lessen the likelihood that the family will pursue a  		  legal claim should an adverse event occur.</li>
<li>Improved documentation initiatives to ensure that the care and  		  interventions provided to residents are always adequately documented in the  		  patient record, and to ensure that physician orders are followed effectively.  		  Lack of adequate documentation was frequently cited as a contributing factor to  		  the settlement of liability claims.</li>
</ul><p>A key issue for providers was finding financial resources to support  		risk management programs over and above their usual quality assurance and  		regulatory compliance activities. Risk management programs were more frequent  		among large companies with the resources to design and implement programs at  		the corporate level. Small independent providers were more limited in their  		ability to undertake risk management programs that added costs to daily  		operations.</p>
<div class="bordered-text"> <font><b><font>Volatility in the nursing home liability insurance market has  			 led to the creation of alternative markets for reducing liability  			 risk.</font></b></font></div>
<p>Reduced accessibility and increased costs of commercial liability  		insurance for nursing home providers has opened the door for the alternative  		market. The alternative insurance market consists of various forms of  		self-insurance that retain risk instead of transferring it: self-insurance,  		risk retention and risk purchasing groups, captives, rent-a-captives, and  		sponsored captives (Joint Underwriting Associations).</p>
<p>Captives are essentially self-formed risk pools of providers that share  		risk among the members of the captive.<sup><font><a href="#ref35">35</a></font></sup> They can also be characterized as  		new insurance companies. Some captives are written on insurance  		paper to satisfy bond requirements to have insurance and while  		others are simply self-insured across the members of the captive. The  		traditional captive has joint liability as well as shared administrative costs  		among its members. One obvious advantage of this alternative insurance approach  		is that there is no insurance company profit or load on the premium costs. </p>
<p>In a traditional captive, the members are also responsible for  		conducting their own underwriting. That is, the members of a captive must  		decide among themselves with whom they wish to share liability risk. There must  		be a sufficient number of members for the captive to be adequately capitalized,  		while at the same time limiting membership to facilities with low liability  		risk. Another variation on the risk retention captive is whats called a  		cell captive where the participants share administrative expenses  		but not risk.</p>
<p>The most common form of alternative nursing home insurance is a joint  		underwriting association (JUA), a state-sponsored organization that creates  		insurance pools and functions as an insurer in markets without a significant  		number of licensed insurers. A JUA has the power to sell insurance policies,  		collect premiums, and purchase reinsurance and it can usually guarantee a  		certain level of premium rates to its members. It also can levy surcharges on  		policyholders and, in some cases, on licensed insurers selling liability  		insurance, to create reserves to pay claims.</p>
<p>States that allow nursing facilities to buy-in to their JUA include  		Florida, Texas, Arkansas, California, Minnesota, Nebraska and Pennsylvania.  		Eligibility for a JUA may in some states come in tandem with a statute  		requiring nursing facilities to maintain liability insurance (e.g., Florida and  		Texas). Other state requirements can include requiring the state insurance  		commissioner to adopt best practices for risk management and loss control. Some  		states (e.g., Texas) fund their JUA reserves using a public bonding authority;  		others (e.g., Florida) have a Medicaid waiver to use a portion of the Medicaid  		nursing home payment as capital for the risk pool. </p>
<p>The Texas JUA was established as an insurer of last resort  		by legislation (S.B. 1839) in 2001. As mentioned previously, the Texas JUA uses  		facility characteristics and a risk assessment tool to adjust premiums for  		facilities participating in the JUA risk pool. Although there is a 30% discount  		for non-profit facilities, premiums through this alternative risk pool are  		reportedly no better than what are available on the market.  		According to the Texas Health Care Association and Texas Association for Homes  		and Services for the Aging, only about 40 nursing homes had elected to  		participate in the JUA. The state was conducting a survey of nursing home  		providers to learn more about why more facilities had chosen not to participate  		in the JUA.</p>
<p>There are also other forms of alternative insurance; for example,  		Indiana has the Indiana Voluntary Market Assistance Plan, an attempt to retain  		writers and attract additional insurers for commercial liability insurance  		coverage. Participants agree to quote for at least one of five applications  		received in the program. The program is available to facilities that have  		experienced three declines of prior insurance including at least one from an  		excess and surplus line insurer.</p>
<p>Key factors for providers to consider in deciding whether to join a  		captive risk retention group include: (1) the size of the risk pool and the  		liability experience of the other members of the captive; (2) how risk is  		shared across members; (3) capitalization requirements needed to fund reserves;  		and (4) entry and exit requirements established for the captive. </p>
<p>In Ohio, a new insurance captive was formed under the sponsorship of an  		insurance broker with specialized expertise in nursing home  		liability.<sup><font><a href="#ref36">36</a></font></sup> The  		brokerage firm, and the members of the captive, believed that the commercial  		market for liability insurance had overreacted, and that the market was  		overpriced. The members of the Ohio captive also believed that the prices  		charged by commercial carriers for Ohio providers reflected liability risk in  		other states with higher rates of litigation activity. In brief, the members of  		the Ohio captive believed they could reduce insurance costs by forming their  		own risk pool, rather than participating in the risk pools represented by the  		policyholders of the commercial carriers. By the end of 2004, about 25% of the  		providers in Ohio had become members of the captive.</p>
<p>Some observers of the marketplace (e.g., brokers) believed that many  		providers were naïve in thinking that they could do a better job than  		commercial carriers in providing insurance coverage through captives. There was  		considerable skepticism expressed about whether captives could exercise the  		political discipline needed to maintain strict underwriting standards (e.g.,  		excluding fellow providers from participation in the captive). Another concern  		was whether captives could achieve adequate capitalization, particularly if  		they were not able to purchase reinsurance.</p>
<p>During the course of the study, a number of new captives were formed.  		However, captives in this market had not been in existence long enough to make  		any conclusions about their viability over the longer term.</p>
<h2><a name="tort" id="tort">STATE TORT REFORM INITIATIVES</a></h2>
<p>Many state legislatures have responded to the rise in litigation against  		nursing homes and the resulting decrease in the availability of insurance by  		enacting tort reform laws that are intended to limit liability claims and/or  		losses to some degree.<sup><font><a href="#ref37">37</a></font></sup>  		These initiatives have been strongly supported by the nursing home industry,  		which has advocated that tort reforms are absolutely essential for constraining  		liability costs. While acknowledging the right of injured residents to seek  		fair compensation for damages through the courts, the industry has also  		contended that improvements in care quality are not sufficient to restrain the  		growth in litigation activity.</p>
<p>Tort reform efforts can be organized into three categories: measures  		that restrict access to the courts, reforms that regulate liability conditions  		and processes, and measures that limit compensation payments to plaintiffs and  		their attorneys. <a href="#table3">Table 3</a> summarizes recent tort reform  		efforts in a number of states that impact the nursing home industry. </p>
<h3>Restricting Access to the Courts</h3>
<p>In May of 2001, the Florida Legislature enacted S.B. 1202, repealing  		many of the more plaintiff-friendly measures that had been included in the  		Florida Patients Bill of Rights law. Among other measures, the bill  		shortened the statute of limitations for initiating an action against a nursing  		facility to two years. In 2002, Ohio enacted H.B. 412, extending state tort  		liability reforms for hospitals and physicians to include licensed nursing  		homes. Among other measures, the Ohio law established a one-year statute of  		limitations for bringing suits against nursing facilities, their employees, and  		suits brought under Ohios Residents Rights Law. The States of  		Louisiana, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Nevada each shortened their statutes  		of limitations for actions against nursing homes; Louisianas S.B. 748  		(2003) shortened their statute of limitations to three years, the enactment of  		Mississippis H.B. 2 (2002) reduced their statute of limitations to two  		years, Pennsylvanias H.B. 1802 (2002) set a seven-year statute of  		limitations, and Nevadas A.B. 1 (2002) set their statue of limitations at  		three years.</p>
<h3>Modifying Liability Rules</h3>
<p>Floridas S.B. 1202 includes the establishment of a  		reasonable care negligence standard to replace the former strict  		liability standard applied to nursing facilities and their nursing staff.  		Ohios H.B. 412 requires plaintiffs to prove that a facility demonstrated  		negligent or intentional misconduct in order to be awarded compensatory damages  		in suits with a patient bill of rights cause of action. Arkansas H.B.  		1038 (2003) modifies joint and several liability so that defendants who are  		found to be only partially at fault are responsible for a proportionate  		percentage of the damage they caused. In a 2004 special session, the State of  		Mississippi enacted H.B. 13, abolishing the rule of joint and several  		liability. In similar actions, Oklahoma enacted H.B. 2661 (2004), restricting  		joint liability to only defendants who are more than 50% at fault, and  		Nevadas A.B. 1 prohibited the application of the rule of joint and  		several liability in the recovery of non-economic damages for medical liability  		claims. Pennsylvanias S.B. 1089 (2002) prohibits the application of the  		rule of joint and several liability in the recovery of all damages, except when  		a defendant has been found liable for intentional fraud or tort or been held  		more than 60% liable. Also in Pennsylvania, H.B. 1802 bars individuals from  		suing for damages that were paid by a health insurer.</p>
<h3>Capping Damage Awards</h3>
<p>The most common type of tort reform has been measures which limit or cap  		damages awarded to plaintiffs and their attorneys. In Florida, S.B. 1202 places  		caps on punitive damages at the greater of three times compensatory damages or  		$1 million, except in cases where it is determined that the defendant was  		motivated solely by financial gain and where the defendant was aware of the  		danger in which they were placing the resident, in which case punitive damages  		are limited to the greater of four times compensatory damages or $4 million.  		The Florida measure places no caps in cases where it is determined that the  		defendant intentionally harmed the claimant. Additionally, this Florida  		legislation eliminates of the recovery of attorneys fees for cases  		involving injury or death. Arkansas H.B. 1038 and Idahos H.B. 92  		(2003), similar to the Florida measure, cap punitive damages at the greater of  		$250,000 or three times compensatory damages, with Arkansas setting a maximum  		at $1 million. In 2003, West Virginias H.B. 2122 capped non-economic  		awards in medical professional liability actions at $250,000.</p>
<p>The State of Texas enacted H.B. 4 in 2003, limiting non-economic damages  		to $250,000 per facility and placing a $500,000 limit on claims involving  		multiple providers. In the same year, the Louisiana legislature limited  		non-economic damages at $500,000 (S.B. 748, 2003). Likewise, Ohios S.B.  		281 (2003) limits non-economic damages at $350,000, increasable up to $1  		million, Mississippis H.B. 13 caps non-economic damages at $500,000, and  		Nevadas A.B. 1 limits non-economic damages in medical liability cases to  		$350,000. In 2004, the Oklahoma Legislature enacted H.B. 2661, capping  		non-economic damages at $300,000 in medical liability cases, excepting wrongful  		death actions.</p>
<p>Of the various tort reform initiatives enacted by states in recent  		years, the Texas tort reform bill (H.B. 4) is generally viewed by both  		providers and insurers as the legislation that has the greatest chance of  		reducing liability costs. This is because the Texas bill includes  		hard caps on economic and non-economic damages, <i>as well as  		punitive damages</i>, with no exceptions for exceeding the caps. Nonetheless,  		it is also expected that the constitutionality of the Texas tort reform bill  		will be contested in the courts, which is the reason why insurers have still  		not returned to the Texas market to any great extent.</p>
<h2><a name="discussion" id="discussion">DISCUSSION</a></h2>
<p>The future of the nursing home liability insurance market remains  		uncertain. While the Aon studies suggest that liability costs are leveling off  		from the dramatic increases of the late 1990s, the Aon data are not  		representative of the nursing home industry as a whole. Todays domination  		of the market by surplus line carriers that are excluded from state reporting  		requirements makes the collection of reliable data on current trends in the  		marketplace all the more difficult.</p>
<p>In 1995, the nursing home liability insurance market was small and not  		controversial. At an average premium of $50 per bed, the total size of the  		market was only about $85 million. If self-insured beds are excluded, the  		commercial market was actually less than $50 million. Today, if we  		conservatively assume an average premium cost per bed in the range of  		$800-$1,000, the total size of the market is in the range of $1.4-$1.7 billion  		annually. Thus, while there may be more risk in the market for commercial  		insurers, there is also considerably more financial opportunity as well. It is  		reasonable to conclude for insurers to be profitable in this market, they will  		have to be considerably more sophisticated about their liability exposure than  		those who were in the market ten years ago. </p>
<p>The future of the nursing home liability insurance market is obviously  		highly dependent upon the future of nursing home litigation. Although law firms  		that have developed specialized practices in nursing home litigation in Florida  		and Texas have made efforts to expand to other states, these expansions have,  		to date, not been remarkably successful. Whether their lack of success in  		expanding to other states is attributable to quality of care differences across  		states, different legal environments, or differences in jury behavior, is  		difficult to ascertain. Nonetheless, considerable anxiety remains in the  		provider and insurer communities that the highly successful methods and  		strategies developed by these firms will eventually spread nationwide. While  		legislatures in many states have enacted tort reform initiatives that have the  		intent of mitigating nursing home litigation, and liability costs, the  		effectiveness of these policy responses remains largely untested.</p>
<p>Consumer advocacy groups remain strongly opposed to policy responses  		designed to limit the ability of nursing home residents and their families to  		seek remedies through the courts for negligence and abuse committed by  		providers. They support nursing home litigation activity in the belief that  		state and federal quality assurance systems have been relatively ineffectual in  		forcing providers to maintain quality standards. </p>
<p>At the root of this policy issue are the views and perceptions of the  		American public. In negotiating settlements, plaintiffs and defendants make  		decisions about compensation for damages based upon their shared judgments of  		what juries <i>would </i>decide if cases were to go to trial. Most every person  		interviewed during this study, whether they were associated with the plaintiff  		side or the defendant side of the issue, agreed that the decisions of juries in  		nursing home negligence cases are virtually impossible to predict. One insurer  		said that it had conducted mock jury trials, testing the exact same case in the  		exact same manner, in front of multiple juries, with highly diverse results.  		Because the decisions of juries are so hard to predict, regardless of the facts  		of the case, both plaintiff and defense counsel almost always prefer to settle  		cases without a jury trial.</p>
<p>When people are dying, and body systems are failing through natural  		causes, it is extremely difficult to determine what adverse outcomes are  		attributable to negligent care practices. The provider community claims that  		many lawsuits brought against them are for adverse outcomes that are beyond  		their ability to control or prevent. On the other hand, all will agree that  		providers need to be held legally accountable for maintaining reasonable  		quality of care standards for the residents they care for. The rise in nursing  		home litigation and the volatility in the nursing home liability insurance  		market are testament to the fact that, at the public policy level, these  		difficult questions have not been addressed, or resolved, as well as they could  		be. Considerably more research, legal analysis, and policy development, is  		needed to provide greater clarity and guidance to the American public on this  		difficult social issue. As the American public continues to age, and the demand  		for long-term care services continues to increase, this debate over what  		constitutes proper balances is likely to continue.</p>

</ol><h2><a name="glossary" id="glossary">GLOSSARY</a></h2>
<p><b>Admitted Carriers</b> are commercial insurers whose nursing home  		liability insurance products are regulated by state departments of insurance.  		These carriers enjoy some advantages over non-admitted carriers. They can  		participate in state guaranty funds, which help protect policyholders in the  		case of insurer insolvency. Also, they have a marketing advantage over  		non-admitted carriers because some brokers, facility providers and lenders  		value state oversight and participation in the guaranty fund.</p>
<p>The <b>Alternative Market</b> to nursing home liability insurance is  		composed of various forms of self-insurance, meaning the risk is borne by the  		participants and not an insurance company. The different forms of  		self-insurance include risk retention and risk purchasing groups (RPGs),  		captives, rent-a-captives, and sponsored captives (Joint Underwriting  		Associations).</p>
<p><b>Arbitration Agreements</b> are contracts, the terms of which are  		determined by an arbitrator, entered into by opposing parties. An arbitrator is  		a person or panel of people who are not judges and may be: (1) agreed to by the  		parties; (2) required by a provision in a contract for settling disputes; or  		(3) provided for under statute. Arbitration is designed to be a fair and  		equitable means of dispute resolution agreed to by both parties to avoid a  		court trial and the associated expenses and time investment.</p>
<p><b>Capitalization</b> means funding the reserves of an insurance or  		self-insurance program to pay claims.</p>
<p>A <b>Cell Captive</b> is a captive in which member providers share  		administrative expenses but not risk.</p>
<p>A <b>Captive</b> is a self-formed pool of providers who share risk among  		themselves, thus acting as their own insurance company. Members do their own  		underwriting, meaning they decide among themselves which providers to admit to  		the captive. Members will share liability risk with the providers they admit.  		</p>
<p><b>Claims Made Policies</b> provide coverage for insured events that  		both occur and <i>for which a claim is made</i> during the term of the policy.  		Thus, if an incident occurs, but the policy is terminated before a claim is  		made, liability for the incident is not insured.</p>
<p><b>Claims Occurrence Policies</b> provide coverage for all incidents and  		events that occur during the term of the policy, regardless of when a liability  		claim is made, or when a lawsuit is settled.</p>
<p><b>Collateral Damages</b> are damages incurred by the plaintiff that are  		already covered by other sources of payment. Collateral source  		offset rules reduce awards by denying plaintiffs compensation for  		losses that are recouped from other sources, such as health insurance. These  		rules aim to prevent plaintiffs from double dipping by  		recovering for losses for which the plaintiff has already been remunerated  		through other sources of payment.</p>
<p><b>Deductibles</b> are initial amounts of claims incurred by the  		policyholder not covered by the insurance policy. Insurance coverage begins  		only for losses incurred above the deductible amount.</p>
<p><b>Economic Damages</b> in civil litigation is compensation due the  		plaintiff for financial losses caused by the wrongful actions of another party  		(e.g., awards for the medical bills of a nursing home resident caused by an  		abusive employee).</p>
<p><b>Estimated Liability Costs</b> are approximate calculations of  		expenses for damages to which a nursing home is exposed. Because estimates are  		derived from information provided by nursing homes and the cost of settlements  		of lawsuits is confidential information known only to the insurance carrier,  		plaintiffs attorney and defense attorney, these calculations are only  		estimates and are subject to change.</p>
<p><b>General Liability Claims/Losses</b> are amounts a nursing home  		liability insurer is legally obligated to pay as damages to a plaintiff due to  		bodily injury or property damage. </p>
<p>A <b>Joint Underwriting Association</b> is a state-sponsored  		organization that creates insurance pools and functions as an insurer in  		markets without a significant number of licensed insurers. It has the power to  		sell insurance policies, collect premiums, and purchase reinsurance and it can  		usually guarantee a certain level of premium rates to its members. It can also  		levy surcharges on policyholders and, in some cases, on licensed insurers  		selling liability insurance, to create reserves to pay claims.</p>
<p><b>Joint and Several Liability</b> in civil litigation is a situation in  		which the concurrent acts of two or more defendants bring harm to the  		plaintiff. Such acts need not occur simultaneously, but must contribute to the  		same event. In such a case, the damages may be collected from one or more of  		the defendants. If the court does not apportion blame in specific shares, the  		damages may be collected from any and all defendants. If a defendant does not  		have the financial wherewithal to pay, the others must make up the  		difference.</p>
<p><b>Non-admitted Carriers</b>, also called <b>Surplus Line Carriers</b>,  		are commercial insurers whose nursing home liability insurance products are not  		regulated by state departments of insurance. These insurers enjoy some  		advantages over admitted carriers. They have greater flexibility in designing  		and pricing products. Because they are not subject to state regulation, they  		can also change coverage forms and application protocols more quickly. However,  		they must pay an excess and surplus lines tax that is not levied on  		admitted carriers. They cannot participate in state guaranty funds, which help  		protect policyholders in the case of insurer insolvency</p>
<p><b>Non-economic Damages</b> in civil litigation is compensation due the  		plaintiff for intangible harms (e.g., pain and suffering).</p>
<p><b>Nursing Home Liability Insurance</b> is indemnification of nursing  		home providers against damages for negligent care and abuse.</p>
<p><b>Nursing Home Residents Rights Statutes</b> are state and  		federal laws to protect each nursing home residents civil, religious and  		human rights.</p>
<p><b>Offshore Captives</b> are captives located outside the United States.  		The most popular host states for offshore captives include Bermuda, Guernsey  		and the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p><b>Premium</b> is the charge paid by a policyholder for insurance  		coverage.</p>
<p><b>Professional Liability Claims/Losses</b> are amounts a nursing home  		liability insurer is legally obligated to pay as damages and associated claims  		and defense expenses to a plaintiff due to a negligent act, error or omission  		in a nursing home providers rendering or failure to render professional  		services.</p>
<p><b>Punitive damages</b> in civil litigation means monetary compensation  		awarded by a judge or jury which exceeds the losses suffered by the injured  		party in order to punish the defendant.</p>
<p><b>Regulated Insurance Carriers</b> are admitted carriers (see  		definition above).</p>
<p><b>Reinsurance</b> is the practice of insurance carriers ceding risk to  		other firms, called reinsurance companies, in order to limit their liability  		exposure. Reinsurance companies essentially provide insurance to insurance  		companies. Instead of assessing the risk of individual policyholders,  		reinsurance companies assess risk on a broader scale, such as on the basis of a  		particular product-line (nursing home liability insurance) or a geographic  		region.</p>
<p>A <b>Rent-A-Captive</b> is a captive, usually formed by an insurance  		company, broker or captive manager, and rented out to users (in this case  		nursing home providers) who avoid the cost of funding their own captive. The  		user provides some form of collateral so that the rent-a-captive is not at risk  		from any underwriting loss suffered by the user.</p>
<p><b>Risk Management Programs</b> are structured approaches to  		purposefully limit liability risk. They include systematic efforts to improve  		and maintain high standards for care quality, but can also include additional  		management techniques to minimize liability exposure, such as improving written  		documentation. They are often formalized within the management structure of  		nursing home providers in the form of Risk Management Committees, and/or a  		designated Director of Risk Management along with formal Risk Management plans  		that are implemented and monitored by senior management.</p>
<p>A <b>Risk Retention Group (RRG)</b> is an insurance company that is  		owned by its members. The members of an RRG come from the same industry. For  		instance, nursing home providers can form an RRG in order to obtain nursing  		home liability coverage.</p>
<p>A <b>Settlement</b> is an agreement reached between the legal counsel of  		the plaintiff and the defendant that terminates a civil litigation before a  		verdict is reached by the court.</p>
<p><b>Tort Reform</b> generally means a movement intended to curb  		litigation and damages in the civil justice system. With respect to nursing  		home liability insurance, many states have enacted tort reform through  		legislation and it has changed the legal framework under which residents and/or  		family members can seek damages for negligent or abusive care practices. States  		also placed limits on the amount of damages that could be awarded to plaintiffs  		and/or their family members, particularly non-economic damages for pain and  		suffering. </p>
<p><b>Underwriting</b> is the process by which an insurer assesses the risk  		of insuring a particular applicant for coverage. Risk retention groups also  		underwrite by assessing the risk of accepting a prospective member.</p>
