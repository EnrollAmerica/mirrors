<p> The market for professional liability insurance for nursing home  		operators has been in a state of flux in recent years, beginning in the late  		1990s. The cost of professional liability insurance has increased substantially  		in all areas of the country, though much higher increases have occurred in some  		regions than in others. Concurrently, the number of insurance carriers offering  		liability coverage for nursing homes has decreased, as many regulated insurance  		carriers incurred significant losses in this product line and decided to exit  		the market altogether. Those carriers that decided to stay in the market have  		changed the terms and conditions of liability coverage, taking on less risk at  		higher prices.<sup><font><a href="#notea">a</a></font></sup> The high  		cost and limited availability of professional liability insurance has resulted  		in a growing number of nursing home operators operating without any  		professional liability insurance coverage whatsoever.</p>
<p> A major factor contributing to the turbulence in the nursing home  		liability insurance market is increased litigation activity against nursing  		home operators. However, the nature of the link between nursing home litigation  		and the cost and availability of professional liability insurance is a matter  		of considerable debate in the policy arena. Some contend that, for a variety of  		reasons, the increased costs of professional liability insurance are out of  		proportion to the increased liability exposure faced by the industry. </p>
<p> This report is one of five case studies being prepared as part of a  		larger study sponsored by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning  		and Evaluation within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on  		trends and issues in the nursing home liability insurance market. Additional  		case studies were conducted of the nursing home liability insurance market in  		the states of California, Georgia, Florida, and Texas. The case studies are  		designed to provide greater insight into the dynamics of the problem by  		examining the experiences of states with differing long-term care, economic,  		political, legal, and insurance landscapes. This report presents the case study  		on nursing home litigation and insurance issues in the state of Ohio.</p>
<p> The case study draws largely upon a week long site visit conducted by  		the study contractor in late September and early October 2003. The case study  		offers a brief background on the Ohio nursing home industry, nursing home  		quality, and litigation and liability insurance trends in Ohio. The report  		draws on in-person, telephone, and email discussions, in addition to published  		and unpublished literature. Discussions were conducted with a broad range of  		stakeholders including consumer advocates, representatives of for-profit and  		not-for-profit nursing homes, plaintiff and defense attorneys, nursing home  		regulators, state Medicaid rate setting officials, nursing home ombudsmen,  		insurance carriers, and insurance brokers. Numerous follow-up calls were made,  		and additional background materials collected, during the fall of 2003 and  		spring of 2004 to augment the information obtained during the conduct of the  		site visit. </p>
<h2><a name="state" id="state">STATE ENVIRONMENT</a></h2>
<p>Ohio was selected as one of the five case study states for two primary  		reasons. First, Ohio had been reported to be a state with a relatively low  		level of nursing home litigation activity. The selection of states for case  		studies was conducted with the intention of including both states with  		reportedly high and low levels of nursing home litigation. Other states  		selected were reportedly high litigation states. Second, Ohio had recently  		enacted tort reform legislation with the intention of limiting potential  		increases in lawsuit activity against nursing homes. There was interest in  		identifying the reasons why stakeholders felt the need to enact tort reforms  		aimed at the nursing home industry, as well as ascertaining what impact, if  		any, the enacted tort reforms had had on litigation activity and the liability  		insurance market.</p>
<h3>Ohio Nursing Home Industry</h3>
<p>Ohios nursing home industry is distinctive in a number of ways  		that might affect the dynamics of the professional liability insurance market  		in the state. First, for-profit companies and regional and national chains  		control a larger than average share of the states 976 nursing facilities.  		Three-fourths of Ohios nursing homes are for-profit (75%), greater than  		the national average of 66%. Chain providers comprise 57% of facilities in  		Ohio, compared to 52% nationally.<sup><font><a href="#ref1">1</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Second, nursing home bed supply and utilization rates in Ohio are higher  		than the national average. Ohio has 91,941 certified nursing homes beds, 60 for  		every 1,000 people age 65 or older. This ratio is greater than the national  		average of 46 beds per 1,000 elderly. The bed supply is equally high when  		considering people age 85 or older, the age group most likely to use nursing  		facility care. Ohios ratio of 441 beds per 1,000 people age 85 or older  		is 28% above the national average of 345 beds per 1,000.<sup><font><a href="#ref2">2</a></font></sup> Even with this high supply, Ohios  		occupancy rate (88%) is slightly above average (86%).<sup><font><a href="#ref3">3</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Third, Ohios Medicaid reimbursement rate is one of the highest in  		the nation. In 2002, the state Medicaid program paid an average of $144 per  		day. This rate was 5th among 46 states that responded to a recent survey of  		Medicaid payment policies.<sup><font><a href="#ref4">4</a></font></sup> By contrast, the 2003 average private pay rate  		in urban areas, $154, ranked 21st among the 50 states and DC.<sup><font><a href="#ref5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Fourth, despite the high Medicaid reimbursement rate, nursing facilities  		in Ohio are not more dependent on Medicaid than in other states. Medicaid is  		the primary payer for 64% of residents in certified facilities, close to the  		current national average of 66%. Medicare is the primary payer for 13% of  		residents, also close to the national average (12%).<sup><font><a href="#ref6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Fifth, Ohio has the largest proportion of non-certified nursing facility  		beds in the country. Over 26,000 beds not certified by Medicare or Medicaid are  		available only to private pay individuals and represent 22% of total nursing  		facility beds in Ohio, compared to the national average of 5%. As a result,  		Ohio is below the national average in the percentage of beds certified for  		Medicare and Medicaid. However, this may be changing as the percentage of  		Medicare-certified beds increased from 49% in December 2001 to 73% in June  		2005. This increase reflected a national pattern during the same time period  		after changes were made in Medicare reimbursement policy. The national average  		increased from 60% to 82%. The percentage of Medicaid-certified beds remained  		constant during this time (77%), most of which are also Medicare-certified.  		Nationally, 91% of nursing facilities are Medicaid-certified.<sup><font><a href="#ref7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Nursing Home Quality and Oversight in Ohio</h3>
<p>Data from Medicare and Medicaid certification surveys indicate Ohio has  		fewer deficiencies than nursing facilities across the country. In 2004, surveys  		identified 6.7 deficiencies per Ohio facility, compared to the national  		average, 9.2. Only a small proportion of these quality concerns led to actual  		harm to residents or put residents at risk of death or serious injury (i.e.,  		immediate jeopardy). Ohio also had a lower than average percentage of  		facilities with the most serious deficiencies (11%, compared to the national  		average of 15.5%).<sup><font><a href="#ref8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>State survey data are frequently criticized as an imperfect measure of  		nursing home quality, however. A 1999 U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO)  		Report offered strong criticism of the nursing facility enforcement system, and  		noted large variations among states in the survey process.<sup><font><a href="#ref9">9</a></font></sup> Although a more recent GAO report  		noted improvements, it identified continued nursing home oversight shortcomings  		in several states, but not Ohio.<sup><font><a href="#ref10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Nursing home staffing levels in Ohio are above the national average.  		Ohio facilities employed 3.9 licensed nurse and certified nursing assistant  		staff per resident day in 2004, compared to the national average of  		3.7.<sup><font><a href="#ref11">11</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Nursing Home Litigation and Liability Insurance Trends  		in Ohio</h3>
<p>Two studies have attempted to measure nursing home liability costs in  		Ohio. The findings of the two studies are not altogether consistent. The  		differences between the studies may be attributable to the fact that the two  		studies used different data sources for generating estimates of nursing home  		liability costs. The first study, conducted by the Insurance Services Office  		(ISO) in 2002, covered 26% of the beds in Ohio with commercial professional  		liability insurance.<sup><font><a href="#ref12">12</a></font></sup>  		The ISO study estimated the annual frequency of claim activity in Ohio over the  		three-year period of 1998-2000 at about 2.0 claims per 1000 beds, about 33%  		<i>higher</i> than the national average of all facilities included in the  		study. However, the ISO study also estimated that average claim severity in  		Ohio was below average. The average claim amount in Ohio was about $115,000  		over the 1998-2000 time period, about 18% below the national average of  		$139,411 per claim. Overall, ISO estimated average loss costs of about $210 per  		bed in Ohio over this three-year period, almost exactly the same as the  		national average.</p>
<p>The second study, conducted by Aon Risk Consultants in 2004, included  		about 20% of the nursing home beds in Ohio.<sup><font><a href="#ref13">13</a></font></sup> However, the sample of nursing homes that  		contributed liability cost data in the Aon study was significantly different  		from the sample of nursing homes in the ISO study. The Aon study consisted  		primarily of nursing homes owned by national multi-facility chains that were  		self-insured. The estimates of claim frequency in the Aon study are higher than  		in the ISO study for the comparable time period, while the estimates of claim  		severity are somewhat lower. For the 1998-2000 time period, Aon estimated claim  		frequency at about 3.0 claims per 1,000 beds, higher than the ISO estimate. The  		estimates of average claim severity were actually <i>lower</i> in the Aon study  		during the 1998-2000 period, in the range of $80,000-$85,000.</p>
<p>Differences in estimates made in these two studies could be attributable  		to differences in the liability experience of the nursing homes included in the  		respective studies, as well as to differences in the actuarial assumptions used  		by the study analysts. The estimates generated in these studies are partly  		dependent upon what assumptions are made about the eventual resolution of  		outstanding liability claims that are still in litigation, since most claims  		take about three years to be resolved.</p>
<p>Although average loss costs per occupied bed in the ISO report were  		about equal to the national average, Aon estimated loss costs among Ohio  		facilities significantly below the national average. In the Aon study, average  		loss costs in Ohio over the 1998-2000 time period were estimated at $570 per  		occupied bed, only 31% of the national average loss cost of $1,833 per occupied  		bed over the same time period.</p>
<p>In its 2004 study, Aon projected that claim severity would increase  		sharply in Ohio after the year 2000, increasing to an average claim payout of  		$192,000 by 2003. This estimate was lowered significantly in the 2005 Aon  		study, when Aon estimated an average claim severity in 2003 of about  		$110,000.<sup><font><a href="#ref14">14</a></font></sup> This  		suggests a downward trend in settlements resolved between 2004 and 2005.  		Overall loss costs in Ohio were still estimated to be significantly below the  		national average.</p>
<p>Stakeholders interviewed during the September 2003 site visit confirmed  		the view that liability costs in Ohio were considerably below the national  		average. Most stakeholders characterized Ohio as a low-litigation  		state. Indeed, the estimates of claim frequency provided in the ISO and Aon  		studies are surprisingly high in comparison to the qualitative views of the  		stakeholders interviewed. Most respondents, including providers, indicated that  		lawsuits against nursing homes in Ohio were relatively rare. Note that the ISO  		and Aon studies include both <i>general </i><b>and</b> <i>professional  		</i>liability claims and losses, and neither study distinguished general  		liability claims from professional liability claims.<sup><font><a href="#noteb">b</a></font></sup></p>
<p>One factor that may contribute to low claim severity in Ohio is the  		positive reputation held by the nursing home industry in general. Stakeholders  		agreed that the nursing home industry in Ohio generally enjoys a positive  		public perception among the states citizens. Most nursing homes in Ohio  		are owned by small independent operators--local business people who may own a  		single facility or a small chain of nursing facilities, generally in a rural  		area. These independent operators are generally perceived by local citizens as  		responsible business people and upstanding members of the community. In many  		rural towns, the nursing home is one of the largest and most stable employers.  		Given this environment, it was felt that Ohio juries tend to be more  		sympathetic to the views of defendants, relative to juries in other states. In  		turn, this generally led to lower settlements in nursing home litigation cases,  		which are largely predicated on each sides expectation of what verdicts  		would be if cases were to go to trial. </p>
<p>Ohio differed from the other case study states on another dimension--the  		dearth of trial attorneys with an interest in taking on nursing home litigation  		cases. In stark contrast to the other four case study states--Texas,  		California, Florida, and Georgia--it was difficult to find a trial lawyer or a  		firm which specialized in nursing home litigation. While there were a few  		attorneys who specialized in defending cases for nursing home operators and  		insurance companies, there were virtually no lawyers on the plaintiff side who  		specialized in this area. Given that average settlements in Ohio were  		reportedly small, it was hypothesized that the nursing home litigation  		market was not considered a particularly attractive area for  		specialization. </p>
<h3>Nursing Home Liability Insurance Market in Ohio</h3>
<p>As late as 1999, the cost of nursing home liability insurance in Ohio  		was only about $50 per bed. About 60% of the nursing home liability insurance  		business in Ohio at that time was underwritten by one carrier--Monroe  		Guarantee, which pulled out of the market in 1999, reportedly because it  		foresaw huge losses in this product line due to historical underpricing and  		poor underwriting practices. With the exit of Monroe Guarantee and other  		admitted carriers, surplus line carriers began to enter the market, and prices  		quickly started to rise. In the year 2000, the average price per bed was in the  		range of $80-$160 bed. In 2001, prices increased to about $270 per bed; in  		2002, about $500 per bed, and in 2003, to about $800 per bed.<sup><font><a href="#notec">c</a></font></sup> Thus, between 1999 and 2003, the  		cost of professional liability insurance in Ohio increased by about 16  		fold.</p>
<p>Stakeholders in Ohio, both providers and insurance brokers, felt that  		the nursing home industry in Ohio was the victim of a panic in the  		nursing home liability insurance market created by carriers experiences  		in states other than Ohio, and by the reduced supply of insurance carriers in  		Ohio. Stakeholders believed that increases in the price of liability insurance  		could not be attributed to increased loss costs in Ohio itself, at least on the  		scale that they were experiencing. Several stakeholders stated that the annual  		Aon studies, which were the only studies generally available to the insurance  		industry, had actually contributed to increases in insurance prices and were  		not justified. These stakeholders expressed the view that the Aon estimates  		were biased upward in an attempt to justify the need for tort reforms.</p>
<p>In an interview with senior executives at one surplus line carrier in  		Ohio, executives acknowledged that the collapse of the regulated insurance  		market had created a business opportunity for their company. The company had  		been successful in increasing its market share in Ohio over the last several  		years, concentrating on securing the professional liability business of small  		independent operators, generally those with fewer than ten facilities. The  		average number of facilities per policy was 2.5. The companys focus was  		on the accurate and fair pricing of its products, given expected loss costs in  		their portfolio of facilities. The executives did not have much faith in risk  		management programs, which they believed, in many cases, were merely  		gimmicks. They also expressed the view that most tort reform  		initiatives were ineffective in reducing liability costs. Rather than  		attempting to win market share by beating its competitors on price, this  		company reported that it focused on selling products that provided real  		insurance coverage at a fair market price, which was generally higher than  		other surplus line carriers. For example, it was the only carrier in Ohio still  		writing policies on an occurrence basis with a relatively low deductible  		($5,000).</p>
<p>When asked if the company was employing any innovative claims management  		strategies to minimize loss costs, the officials responded that their strategy  		was generally to settle early and get cases off the books as quickly as  		possible. Although they believed that the legitimacy of many liability claims  		were marginal at best, they also acknowledged that usually something had  		gone wrong in the nursing home to result in a claim. Furthermore, they  		believed that juries in nursing home cases were unpredictable, and that it was  		easy to lose a case that the company viewed as defensible. The company had  		conducted mock trials of nursing home cases, trying the exact same case in  		front of multiple juries. These mock trials had validated the unpredictability  		of jury verdicts. Thus, the company rarely took a case to court, and usually  		settled. The executives cited one case of a wrongful death suit  		involving a 111-year-old nursing home resident, in which the company had paid a  		settlement.</p>
<p>A significant development in the Ohio insurance market in recent years  		was the formation of a new captive called The Alliance Program. The Alliance  		Program was created by the states largest insurance broker--Neace  		Lukens--based in Cincinnati. Captives are essentially new insurance companies,  		created by their policyholders, and can take a variety of forms.<sup><font><a href="#ref15">15</a></font></sup> Captives become an insurance alternative when  		coverage in the commercial market is either unaffordable or unavailable. The  		Alliance Program was a captive created specifically for Ohio nursing home  		providers who collectively believed they could self insure at a price that was  		significantly less than the market prices offered by the surplus line carriers  		selling professional liability coverage in Ohio. The role of the insurance  		broker--Neace Lukens--was a critical part of the captive, since the members of  		the captive were relying on the underwriting, risk management, and claims  		management expertise of the captive administrator to keep it financially  		viable.</p>
<p>Prior to the formation of The Alliance Program, Neace Lukens had  		developed an extensive risk management program of its own, which it required  		<i>all</i> of its customers to adopt as a condition of buying liability  		coverage through the company. In return, Neace Lukens negotiated lower prices  		from commercial insurers for the risk pool it brought to the carriers, passing  		those savings along to its customers. Neace Lukens incorporated its risk  		management program into The Alliance Program, and added both an underwriting  		and claims management capacity in creating the Program. With many years of  		experience in serving Ohios nursing homes as an insurance broker and risk  		management vendor, Neace Lukens had in-depth knowledge of the Ohio nursing home  		industry. With that experience, The Alliance Program captive was betting that  		it could effectively manage liability losses and provide liability coverage for  		its members at a lower cost than offered by the commercial market. Providers  		participating in The Alliance Program reported that premiums for professional  		liability insurance provided through the captive were one-half to one-third  		less than rates available in the commercial insurance market.<sup><font><a href="#ref16">16</a></font></sup> By the end of 2004, about 25% of  		all nursing homes in the state were participating in The Alliance Program.</p>
<p>During the contractors site visit in the fall of 2003, The  		Alliance Program was still in its early planning stages. At that time, there  		was an underlying tension in the provider community regarding which facilities  		were going to be invited to participate in the captive, and which  		facilities would be denied admission. While entry to the captive meant lower  		costs for liability coverage for its members (as long as the captive was  		effective in controlling loss costs) it also generally meant higher prices for  		those denied entry. </p>
<h3>Legal and Legislative Environment in Ohio</h3>
<p>While litigation activity against nursing homes in Ohio was the lowest  		of the five states selected for case study analysis, tort reform initiatives in  		Ohio were still active and continuous. Of particular interest is that tort  		reform initiatives in Ohio have been undertaken in the context of an ongoing  		dispute between the state legislature and the Ohio Supreme Court regarding the  		proper exercise of judicial authority.</p>
<p>In 1996, the state legislature enacted a comprehensive medical  		malpractice reform bill which, among other provisions, imposed caps on both  		non-economic damages and punitive damages. However, in August 1999, the Ohio  		Supreme Court, in a 4-3 decision, ruled that legislation unconstitutional. In  		its ruling on <i>State ex rel. Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers v. Sheward</i>, 86  		Ohio St. 3d 451, 715 N.E. 2d 1062 (1999), the Court asserted that the  		legislature had deliberately challenged the authority of the judicial  		branch by reenacting laws already declared invalid and attempting, with  		spurious findings and declarations of intent, to evade the Supreme Courts  		rulings.<sup><font><a href="#ref17">17</a></font></sup>  		Specifically, the Supreme Court stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The General Assembly has circumvented our mandates, while  		  attempting to establish itself as the final arbiter of the validity of its own  		  legislation. It has boldly seized the power of constitutional adjudication,  		  appropriated the authority to establish rules of court and overruled judicial  		  declarations of unconstitutionality, and, under the thinly veiled guise of  		  declaring public policy, establishing jurisdiction and  		  enacting substantive law, forbade the courts the province of  		  judicial review.<sup><font><a href="#ref18">18</a></font></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, since the Supreme Courts 1999 ruling, the state  		legislature continued to enact new tort reform laws, both in the area of  		medical malpractice, and more broadly across all areas of tort liability. Three  		pieces of legislation have directly affected the nursing home industry.</p>
<p>In August 2002, Governor Robert Taft signed House Bill 412 (H.B. 412)  		into law, a piece of legislation specifically targeted as a measure of relief  		for the nursing home industry. H.B. 412 included the following provisions:</p>
<ul><li>Extended state tort liability provisions governing hospitals and  		  physicians to include licensed nursing homes and other residential care  		  facilities, including assisted living facilities.</li>
<li> Limited tort liability to actions or omissions the facility  		  authorized, participated in, or ratified.</li>
<li> Established a firm one-year statute of limitations for bringing  		  malpractice lawsuits.</li>
<li> Provided statutory guidance on the factors to be considered in  		  awarding punitive damages, including a focus not only on a facilitys  		  assets, income and net worth, but also on the facilitys future financial  		  ability to provide services to the frail elderly if punitive damages are  		  awarded against it.</li>
<li> Excluded from evidence results of inspections, surveys and reports  		  that are conducted for regulatory compliance purposes in all cases except in  		  lawsuits brought by the Ohio Department of Health and/or the Ohio Department of  		  Jobs and Family Services (ODJFS), which administers the Ohio Medicaid  		  Program.</li>
<li> Required proof of negligent or intentional misconduct before  		  awarding compensatory damages against a home in patients bill of  		  rights suits.</li>
<li> Required notification of the ODJFS upon filing of a malpractice  		  lawsuit so the state can exercise its subrogation rights.</li>
</ul><p>In January 2003, the legislature enacted two additional tort reform  		bills that were primarily targeted at medical malpractice reform. Although  		early versions of the bills did not extend the provisions to nursing  		facilities, the final versions of the two bills were also applied to nursing  		homes, residential care facilities, and facilities for the mentally  		retarded.<sup><font><a href="#ref19">19</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Senate Bills 281 and 120 collectively included the following  		provisions:</p>
<ul><li> Placed a cap of $350,000 on non-economic damages for each victim in  		  most cases, or a maximum of $500,000 for each occurrence.</li>
<li> Put a $500,000 cap on non-economic damages for each victim in  		  catastrophic injury cases--the most egregious cases of medical malpractice,  		  such as loss of a limb. Death was not included because Ohio had a separate law  		  prohibiting caps in wrongful death cases. There was an additional $500,000 cap  		  imposed on claims that a spouse or companion might bring.</li>
<li> Required plaintiffs attorneys whose contingency fees exceeded  		  certain limits to make an application in the probate court for approval of the  		  fees.</li>
<li> Permitted defendants to introduce evidence of the plaintiffs  		  receipt of collateral benefits.</li>
<li> Established that arbitration between patients--hospitals--health  		  care providers is binding when a patient signs a contract before the rendering  		  of services. Such contracts become irrevocable after 30 days.</li>
<li> Established a statute of limitation of one year after the cause of  		  action occurs in which to bring a claim and a statute of repose barring claims  		  initiated after four years after the occurrence of the act or omission  		  constituting the alleged basis of the claim.</li>
<li> Gave defendants the right to compel the court to hold a hearing to  		  test whether a particular claim is supported by a reasonable good faith basis.  		  Attorneys fees and costs are available to a defendant that prevails in a  		  good faith hearing.</li>
<li> Allowed defendants to pay future damages exceeding $50,000 through  		  the use of periodic payments, rather than one lump sum.</li>
<li> Eliminated joint and several liability in most circumstances and  		  established proportionate liability as the rule rather than the exception.</li>
</ul><p>Despite these significant tort reform initiatives, the costs of nursing  		home liability insurance continued to rise after their passage. Although the  		initiatives included a number of provisions for weeding out frivolous lawsuits,  		the frequency of claims against nursing homes did not abate, nor were  		insurers/defendants more prone to defend claims in a jury trial. Further, as  		discussed previously, the Ohio tort reform legislation included various  		exceptions to damage limits and other constraints that served to weaken the  		effect of the legislation. The authors of the 2005 Aon study characterized the  		caps on non-economic damages in Ohio as follows: the exceptions are so  		broad that its potential impact on reducing long-term care patient liability is  		uncertain at this time.<sup><font><a href="#ref20">20</a></font></sup> Finally, there was a consensus among  		stakeholders that another ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court on the  		constitutionality of the tort reform laws was likely, although recent changes  		in the make up of the Court may result in a decision that supports the  		legislation. In any case, in 2004, insurance captives, not tort reform, were  		perceived to have the greatest potential for reducing the costs of liability  		insurance for Ohios nursing home providers.</p>
<h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>Of the five case study states, Ohio had the lowest nursing home  		litigation activity. There was no organized plaintiff bar in Ohio specializing  		in nursing home litigation, as was the case in other states. The annual Aon  		studies estimated that claim frequency among Ohio facilities was significantly  		below the national average, while the ISO studies (based on 1998-2000 data)  		estimated average frequency. In regard to claim severity, both the Aon and ISO  		studies indicate that the average size of settlements for nursing home claims  		in Ohio is significantly below the national average. Lower claim severity in  		Ohio may be attributable to the fact that, relative to other states, nursing  		home operators enjoy a better reputation among the general public. Lower  		settlement amounts in Ohio, as negotiated in settlement agreements, are likely  		related to shared expectations of lower awards by juries, and/or more verdicts  		in favor of defendants, had the claims proceeded to jury trials.</p>
<p>In spite of lower claim severity in Ohio, the cost of nursing home  		liability insurance in the commercial market increased by a factor of 16  		between 1998 and 2003. Stakeholders in Ohio attributed the rise in insurance  		costs to increased litigation activity in other states, and to insurers  		concerns that the litigation crisis would soon spread to Ohio. Nursing home  		providers saw themselves as victims of events external to Ohio. The Ohio state  		legislature has enacted a series of tort reform laws aimed at constraining the  		magnitude of nursing home litigation in Ohio and stabilizing insurance costs.  		Stakeholders agreed that these initiatives were largely pre-emptive  		strikes to prevent future increases in litigation activity in Ohio, and  		to send messages to both the out-of-state plaintiff bar and to the insurance  		markets of Ohios intent to not let the nursing home liability crisis get  		out of hand. However, the effectiveness of tort reforms enacted in 2002 and  		2003 remains uncertain at this time. Some skepticism has been expressed about  		whether these tort reforms will have a substantial impact on reducing liability  		costs. The most effective response to rising insurance costs in Ohio has been  		the creation of a new insurance captive, started by a self-selected group of  		facilities that have formed their own risk pool, with the administrative  		support of one of the largest insurance brokers in the state. As of December  		2004, about 25% of Ohios nursing homes were participating in the  		captive.</p>

</ol><h2><a name="glossary" id="glossary">GLOSSARY</a></h2>
<p><b>Admitted Carriers</b> are commercial insurers whose nursing home  		liability insurance products are regulated by state departments of insurance.  		These carriers enjoy some advantages over non-admitted carriers. They can  		participate in state guaranty funds, which help protect policyholders in the  		case of insurer insolvency. Also, they have a marketing advantage over  		non-admitted carriers because some brokers, facility providers and lenders  		value state oversight and participation in the guaranty fund.</p>
<p>The <b>Alternative Market</b> to nursing home liability insurance is  		composed of various forms of self-insurance, meaning the risk is borne by the  		participants and not an insurance company. The different forms of  		self-insurance include risk retention and risk purchasing groups (RPGs),  		captives, rent-a-captives, and sponsored captives (Joint Underwriting  		Associations).</p>
<p><b>Arbitration Agreements</b> are contracts, the terms of which are  		determined by an arbitrator, entered into by opposing parties. An arbitrator is  		a person or panel of people who are not judges and may be: (1) agreed to by the  		parties; (2) required by a provision in a contract for settling disputes; or  		(3) provided for under statute. Arbitration is designed to be a fair and  		equitable means of dispute resolution agreed to by both parties to avoid a  		court trial and the associated expenses and time investment.</p>
<p><b>Capitalization</b> means funding the reserves of an insurance or  		self-insurance program to pay claims.</p>
<p>A <b>Cell Captive</b> is a captive in which member providers share  		administrative expenses but not risk.</p>
<p>A <b>Captive</b> is a self-formed pool of providers who share risk among  		themselves, thus acting as their own insurance company. Members do their own  		underwriting, meaning they decide among themselves which providers to admit to  		the captive. Members will share liability risk with the providers they admit.  		</p>
<p><b>Claims Made Policies</b> provide coverage for insured events that  		both occur and <i>for which a claim is made</i> during the term of the policy.  		Thus, if an incident occurs, but the policy is terminated before a claim is  		made, liability for the incident is not insured.</p>
<p><b>Claims Occurrence Policies</b> provide coverage for all incidents and  		events that occur during the term of the policy, regardless of when a liability  		claim is made, or when a lawsuit is settled.</p>
<p><b>Collateral Damages</b> are damages incurred by the plaintiff that are  		already covered by other sources of payment. Collateral source  		offset rules reduce awards by denying plaintiffs compensation for  		losses that are recouped from other sources, such as health insurance. These  		rules aim to prevent plaintiffs from double dipping by  		recovering for losses for which the plaintiff has already been remunerated  		through other sources of payment.</p>
<p><b>Deductibles</b> are initial amounts of claims incurred by the  		policyholder not covered by the insurance policy. Insurance coverage begins  		only for losses incurred above the deductible amount.</p>
<p><b>Economic Damages</b> in civil litigation is compensation due the  		plaintiff for financial losses caused by the wrongful actions of another party  		(e.g., awards for the medical bills of a nursing home resident caused by an  		abusive employee).</p>
<p><b>Estimated Liability Costs</b> are approximate calculations of  		expenses for damages to which a nursing home is exposed. Because estimates are  		derived from information provided by nursing homes and the cost of settlements  		of lawsuits is confidential information known only to the insurance carrier,  		plaintiffs attorney and defense attorney, these calculations are only  		estimates and are subject to change.</p>
<p><b>General Liability Claims/Losses</b> are amounts a nursing home  		liability insurer is legally obligated to pay as damages to a plaintiff due to  		bodily injury or property damage. </p>
<p>A <b>Joint Underwriting Association</b> is a state-sponsored  		organization that creates insurance pools and functions as an insurer in  		markets without a significant number of licensed insurers. It has the power to  		sell insurance policies, collect premiums, and purchase reinsurance and it can  		usually guarantee a certain level of premium rates to its members. It can also  		levy surcharges on policyholders and, in some cases, on licensed insurers  		selling liability insurance, to create reserves to pay claims.</p>
<p><b>Joint and Several Liability</b> in civil litigation is a situation in  		which the concurrent acts of two or more defendants bring harm to the  		plaintiff. Such acts need not occur simultaneously, but must contribute to the  		same event. In such a case, the damages may be collected from one or more of  		the defendants. If the court does not apportion blame in specific shares, the  		damages may be collected from any and all defendants. If a defendant does not  		have the financial wherewithal to pay, the others must make up the  		difference.</p>
<p><b>Non-admitted Carriers</b>, also called <b>Surplus Line Carriers</b>,  		are commercial insurers whose nursing home liability insurance products are not  		regulated by state departments of insurance. These insurers enjoy some  		advantages over admitted carriers. They have greater flexibility in designing  		and pricing products. Because they are not subject to state regulation, they  		can also change coverage forms and application protocols more quickly. However,  		they must pay an excess and surplus lines tax that is not levied on  		admitted carriers. They cannot participate in state guaranty funds, which help  		protect policyholders in the case of insurer insolvency</p>
<p><b>Non-economic Damages</b> in civil litigation is compensation due the  		plaintiff for intangible harms (e.g., pain and suffering).</p>
<p><b>Nursing Home Liability Insurance</b> is indemnification of nursing  		home providers against damages for negligent care and abuse.</p>
<p><b>Nursing Home Residents Rights Statutes</b> are state and  		federal laws to protect each nursing home residents civil, religious and  		human rights.</p>
<p><b>Offshore Captives</b> are captives located outside the United States.  		The most popular host states for offshore captives include Bermuda, Guernsey  		and the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p><b>Premium</b> is the charge paid by a policyholder for insurance  		coverage.</p>
<p><b>Professional Liability Claims/Losses</b> are amounts a nursing home  		liability insurer is legally obligated to pay as damages and associated claims  		and defense expenses to a plaintiff due to a negligent act, error or omission  		in a nursing home providers rendering or failure to render professional  		services.</p>
<p><b>Punitive damages</b> in civil litigation means monetary compensation  		awarded by a judge or jury which exceeds the losses suffered by the injured  		party in order to punish the defendant.</p>
<p><b>Regulated Insurance Carriers</b> are admitted carriers (see  		definition above).</p>
<p><b>Reinsurance</b> is the practice of insurance carriers ceding risk to  		other firms, called reinsurance companies, in order to limit their liability  		exposure. Reinsurance companies essentially provide insurance to insurance  		companies. Instead of assessing the risk of individual policyholders,  		reinsurance companies assess risk on a broader scale, such as on the basis of a  		particular product-line (nursing home liability insurance) or a geographic  		region.</p>
<p>A <b>Rent-A-Captive</b> is a captive, usually formed by an insurance  		company, broker or captive manager, and rented out to users (in this case  		nursing home providers) who avoid the cost of funding their own captive. The  		user provides some form of collateral so that the rent-a-captive is not at risk  		from any underwriting loss suffered by the user.</p>
<p><b>Risk Management Programs</b> are structured approaches to  		purposefully limit liability risk. They include systematic efforts to improve  		and maintain high standards for care quality, but can also include additional  		management techniques to minimize liability exposure, such as improving written  		documentation. They are often formalized within the management structure of  		nursing home providers in the form of Risk Management Committees, and/or a  		designated Director of Risk Management along with formal Risk Management plans  		that are implemented and monitored by senior management.</p>
<p>A <b>Risk Retention Group (RRG)</b> is an insurance company that is  		owned by its members. The members of an RRG come from the same industry. For  		instance, nursing home providers can form an RRG in order to obtain nursing  		home liability coverage.</p>
<p>A <b>Settlement</b> is an agreement reached between the legal counsel of  		the plaintiff and the defendant that terminates a civil litigation before a  		verdict is reached by the court.</p>
<p><b>Tort Reform</b> generally means a movement intended to curb  		litigation and damages in the civil justice system. With respect to nursing  		home liability insurance, many states have enacted tort reform through  		legislation and it has changed the legal framework under which residents and/or  		family members can seek damages for negligent or abusive care practices. States  		also placed limits on the amount of damages that could be awarded to plaintiffs  		and/or their family members, particularly non-economic damages for pain and  		suffering. </p>
<p><b>Underwriting</b> is the process by which an insurer assesses the risk  		of insuring a particular applicant for coverage. Risk retention groups also  		underwrite by assessing the risk of accepting a prospective member.</p>
