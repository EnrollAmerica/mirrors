<p>The market for professional liability insurance for nursing facility  		operators is in a state of flux, and the cost of professional liability  		insurance has increased substantially in all areas of the country, though more  		so in some states than in others. At the same time, the number of insurance  		carriers offering liability coverage to nursing homes has decreased  		dramatically, as many regulated insurance carriers incurred huge losses in this  		product line in the late 1990s, and consequently decided to get out of the  		market altogether. Those carriers that have decided to stay in the market have  		changed the terms and conditions of liability coverage dramatically, taking on  		far less risk at much higher prices.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#notea">a</a></font></sup> Consequently, in some areas of the country,  		many nursing facility owners have decided to operate without any professional  		liability insurance coverage whatsoever.</p>
<p>A major contributing factor to increased cost and reduced availability  		of professional liability insurance for nursing homes has been increased  		litigation. However, the nature of the link between nursing home litigation and  		the cost and availability of professional liability insurance is a matter of  		considerable debate in the policy arena. </p>
<p>This report presents an update of the nursing home liability insurance  		market in Florida. The report is one of five case studies that were prepared as  		part of a larger study sponsored by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation within the Department of Health and Human Services  		(HHS) on trends and issues in the nursing home liability insurance market.  		Additional case studies have been conducted of the nursing home liability  		insurance market in the states of California, Ohio, Texas, and Georgia. The  		case studies are designed to provide greater insight into the dynamics of the  		liability insurance market by examining the experience of states with differing  		long-term care, economic, political, legal, and insurance landscapes. This  		report presents the case study on nursing home facility litigation and  		insurance issues in Florida.</p>
<p>The methodology employed in the Florida case study was somewhat  		different than the methodologies employed in the other four case studies.  		Initially, Florida was <b>not</b> selected as a case study state because, due  		to the extremely severe liability insurance crisis in that state, a number of  		other research projects focusing on Florida had been recently completed or were  		currently underway. However, it was later decided to conduct an abbreviated  		case study analysis of Florida, focusing on the impacts of Senate Bill 1202, a  		comprehensive tort reform initiative enacted by the Florida legislature in  		2001. The Florida case study was conducted primarily through an analysis of  		secondary materials and phone interviews with key informants, including nursing  		home providers, state officials, plaintiff and defense attorneys, insurance  		carriers, and researchers. </p>
<h2><a name="state" id="state">STATE ENVIRONMENT</a></h2>
<p>For the past decade, Florida has been a focal point of the national  		nursing home liability insurance crisis. In the mid 1990s, Florida was one of  		the first states to experience a significant increase in liability claims  		against nursing homes.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref1">1</a></font></sup>  		By the late 1990s, most commercial insurers had stopped selling professional  		liability coverage to Florida nursing homes altogether, and had decided to exit  		the market. As a result, a large number of nursing home operators in the state  		(some stakeholders estimated 50%) were operating without liability insurance  		coverage at all. In 2001, the Florida state legislature enacted major tort  		reform legislation (Senate Bill 1202 or S.B. 1202) which had the dual policy  		objectives of: (1) improving the quality of care provided in Floridas  		nursing homes; and (2) limiting both the frequency and severity of nursing home  		claims. This case study provides an update on Floridas nursing home  		liability insurance crisis since the enactment of S.B. 1202 in 2001. </p>
<h3>Florida Nursing Home Industry</h3>
<p>One impact of the nursing home liability insurance situation in Florida,  		and to a lesser extent elsewhere, has been the divestiture of nursing home  		facilities by large national chains. Many of the larger, multi-state nursing  		facility operators adopted a strategy of identifying facilities accounting for  		a disproportionate share of patient liability costs and reducing their  		liability exposure by divesting those facilities entirely. In some cases,  		national chains have elected to exit specific states entirely. In a 2003 Health  		Care Industry Market Update conducted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  		Services (CMS) it was noted that the top ten largest nursing facility companies  		accounted for a decreasing percentage of all nursing home beds.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref2">2</a></font></sup> Moreover, the report noted that  		the nations largest chains were divesting at a faster rate than the  		overall nursing home sector. While the overall nursing home bed count dropped  		by 2.1%, the combined bed count of the largest ten chains declined 17.9%. The  		report speculated that this development may be attributable to the recent  		departures of some of the larger chains from states with high liability  		exposure such as Florida.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref3">3</a></font></sup> As described further below, four of the top ten  		largest nursing home chains have completely divested their Florida operations  		in recent years.</p>
<p>In January 2002, Beverly Enterprises, the nations largest nursing  		facility operator, with over 40,000 beds in 355 facilities across 25 states,  		sold the entirety of its Florida operations. Beverlys 49 nursing  		facilities and four assisted living centers were purchased for $165 million by  		FC Properties. FC Properties arranged a leasing agreement with Florida Health  		Care Properties, which continues to operate the facilities. Beverly stated that  		the sale was part of a strategy to divest facilities that accounted for a  		disproportionately high share of its patient care liability costs.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref4">4</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Kindred Healthcare, Inc., the nations third largest nursing  		facility operator with 250 facilities in 29 states, exited Florida completely  		in July 2003. To execute the Florida divestiture, Kindred initially purchased  		its 15 leased properties and then sold the properties to a third company. The  		lease buyout cost Kindred $64 million, approximately the same price the company  		negotiated for the subsequent sale of the properties. In connection with the  		Florida divestiture and a simultaneous divestiture of its Texas facilities,  		Kindred reported a pre-tax loss of $43 million for the second quarter of  		2003.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref5">5</a></font></sup></p>
<p>In December 2003, Mariner Health Care, Inc., completed the divestiture  		of its remaining facilities in Florida by terminating the leases associated  		with seven properties throughout the state. Mariner, the fourth largest nursing  		facility operator in the U.S., with 260 facilities in 20 states, once operated  		27 facilities in Florida. Following the divestiture of 20 Florida facilities in  		August 2003, Mariners chief executive officer (CEO) cited liability cost  		concerns as a primary reason for the sale: [T]his transaction affords us  		the opportunity to substantially reduce our exposure to liability insurance  		costs and litigation risks in the State of Florida and at the same time  		de-leverage the company.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref6">6</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Another top ten nursing facility operator, Extendicare Health Services,  		Inc., ceased all of its nursing home operations in Florida in January 2001.  		Extendicare, an operator of 266 long-term care facilities in 12 states,  		launched a plan to divest all Florida operations much earlier, in December  		1999. The 2001 announcement marked the sale of its remaining 16 facilities in  		the state for a combined sum of $62.4 million. </p>
<p>In late 2000, National HealthCare Corporation (NHC), operator of 76  		long-term health centers in 11 states, divested completely its nursing facility  		business in Florida through the sale of its 12 nursing facilities to 12 newly  		formed companies. At the time of the divestiture, the President of NHC stated  		that their decision to leave Florida was motivated by their inability to secure  		affordable liability insurance coverage. The NHC divestiture was especially  		newsworthy due to the controversial nature of its sale. The change-of-ownership  		papers filed by the company identified a former NHC official as the leader of  		the group of investors taking over the facilities.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref7">7</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Nursing Home Quality and Oversight in Florida</h3>
<p>One of the policy objectives of S.B. 1202 was to enact reforms that  		would improve the quality of nursing home care in Florida. Since its enactment,  		there have been some signs of improved quality throughout Floridas  		nursing facilities. Most notably, the Joint Select Committee on Nursing Homes  		reported in 2004 that the stakeholders who testified before the Committee  		unanimously agreed that the quality of care in Florida nursing homes was  		improving. Many experts and industry insiders attributed the improvement to the  		implementation of S.B. 1202, primarily its mandate for (and funding of)  		increased staffing levels. Nursing facilities in Florida had achieved a  		reduction in quality of care deficiencies, in both frequency and severity. The  		Florida Health Care Association testified that since S.B. 1202 the state had  		enacted the highest nursing home staffing standards in the nation, and  		Floridas facilities performed better than the national average on  		multiple standardized quality indicators. In testimony, these sentiments were  		also supported by consumers and advocates including the American Association of  		Retired Persons (AARP) and the National Citizens Coalition for Nursing  		Home Reform.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref8">8</a></font></sup></p>
<p>CMS recently released data that concur with the findings of the Joint  		Select Committee on Nursing Homes. As part of the national Nursing Home Quality  		Initiative, Floridas facilities have been working with the state Quality  		Improvement Organization, Florida Medical Quality Assurance, Inc. (FMQAI). The  		CEO of FMQAI applauded the efforts of Floridas facilities, citing the  		2004 CMS finding that the states nursing homes had improved significantly  		across several important quality indicators, including measures of chronic pain  		and post acute pain.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref9">9</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Finally, in January 2005, Floridas Agency for Health Care  		Administration announced that it would begin providing small grants to fund  		innovative nursing home quality improvement projects. The agency is utilizing  		the states Quality of Long Term Care Improvement Trust Fund to provide  		$500,000 for the first year of grants. Nursing facilities can submit proposals  		with ideas to improve care and enhance the quality of life for their  		residents.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref10">10</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Nursing Home Litigation and Liability Insurance Trends  		in Florida</h3>
<p>A 2003 study conducted by researchers at Harvard Universitys  		School of Public Health estimated that compensation payments to plaintiffs in  		cases of nursing facility litigation in Florida amounted to $1.1 billion in  		2001.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref11">11</a></font></sup> Data from the  		Insurance Services Office (ISO) reported in 2002 indicated that claim severity  		in Florida was an estimated 2.1 times the national average.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref12">12</a></font></sup> The ISO report also stated that  		while the national average loss ratio was 357%, Floridas average was  		1072%. While only 17% of claims nationally generated losses in excess of  		$50,000, that number soared to 56% in Florida. A 2003 study conducted by Aon  		Risk Consultants estimated average loss costs per occupied bed of $10,480, over  		four times the national average.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref13">13</a></font></sup> This estimate was derived from liability  		claims data representing 54% of all nursing home beds in the state. </p>
<p>The second policy objective of S.B. 1202 was to limit both the frequency  		and severity of nursing home claims. An initial effect of the legislation was  		an immediate increase in the number of lawsuits filed, as litigators rushed to  		file their suits before the effective date of the legislation, October 5, 2001.  		A survey of 675 Florida nursing facilities found that 62% were sued in the  		first nine months of 2001. Researchers at the University of South  		Floridas (USF) Florida Policy Exchange Center on Aging theorized that if  		S.B. 1202 was unable to improve the situation for the states nursing  		facilities, legislators would likely face new demands for further tort reform,  		including lower limits on punitive damages and new limits on compensatory  		damages.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref14">14</a></font></sup> Many  		insurance industry insiders agreed with this point of view and believed that  		S.B. 1202 would fall short of curbing litigation to an extent sufficient to  		lure insurers back into the Florida market. Insurers praised the patient care  		quality measures enacted in the law but expressed the view that the legislation  		would have minimal impact on curbing frivolous litigation.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref15">15</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Evidence of the effect of S.B. 1202 on reducing the frequency and/or  		severity of nursing home lawsuits is mixed. The Tampa-based plaintiff firm of  		Wilkes &amp; McHugh, one of the most aggressive nursing home litigators in the  		entire country, reported that the number of suits brought against nursing homes  		in Florida in 2003 was down 17% from the year 2000. Separate research conducted  		by the Orlando Sentinel found that the number of lawsuits brought against  		nursing homes declined sharply after the enactment of S.B. 1202, and was at a  		four-year low in five Central Florida counties.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref16">16</a></font></sup> Attorneys representing the nursing home  		industry offered an explanation for the decline in suits during testimony  		before the Joint Select Committee on Nursing Homes. They claimed that liability  		insurance policies with minimal coverage limits (e.g., $25,000) had discouraged  		plaintiffs from filing lawsuits. The nursing home attorneys testified that when  		plaintiffs lawyers learn through pre-suit inquiries that a facility has a  		very low coverage limit, they often choose to settle the claim within policy  		limits. They noted that the opposite is true as well; large insurance caps act  		as an incentive to bring suits.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref17">17</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Other data suggest that S.B. 1202 has had a minimal effect on reducing  		nursing home liability costs in the state. In December 2003, the Florida Health  		Care Association estimated the pace of lawsuits for Florida nursing facilities  		continued at 2-3 per day.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref18">18</a></font></sup> In its most recent analysis of general and  		professional liability insurance costs in the nursing home industry, published  		in March 2005, Aon Risk Consultants significantly lowered its estimates of  		average loss costs per occupied bed in Florida during the 2002-2004 time period  		from estimates made in previous studies.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref19">19</a></font></sup> However, average loss costs in Florida still  		exceeded average loss costs in the country as a whole by a factor of three  		($7,500 in Florida in 2004 versus $2,310 nationwide). Regarding the impact of  		S.B. 1202 and other tort reform bills enacted in Florida, Aon concluded  		based on our current study, it is inconclusive whether or not the bills  		have had an effect on reducing claim frequency in Florida.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref20">20</a></font></sup> Furthermore, Aon concluded the impact  		of Senate Bills 1200 and 1202 on claim severity is similarly inconclusive at  		this time.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref21">21</a></font></sup></p>
<p>One intention of S.B. 1202 was to reduce the number of frivolous  		lawsuits filed against nursing homes. However, some evidence has come forward  		suggesting that the majority of lawsuits in Florida are not frivolous. When  		Floridas 2001 Task Force on Availability and Affordability of Long-Term  		Care released its report, it concluded that all of the 225 cases it examined  		had merit.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref22">22</a></font></sup> Also, two  		large Florida newspapers, the South Florida Sun Sentinel and the Orlando  		Sentinel, conducted their own review of nearly 1,000 lawsuits filed from  		1997-2001, and concluded that virtually all of the lawsuits reviewed had  		merit.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref23">23</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The reforms passed in S.B. 1202 may have had an effect on reducing  		lawsuits brought against facilities that carry finite policies. As discussed  		earlier, the provisions of S.B. 1202 did not include a mandatory minimum  		coverage amount or scope; it only required that facilities maintain an active  		liability policy. In the face of increasing costs, many facilities chose to buy  		finite policies with extremely low coverage limits (e.g., $25,000 per claim).  		Anecdotal accounts surfacing since the passage of S.B. 1202 indicate that  		facilities carrying policies with low limits are far less likely to be sued.  		Note that large self-insured chains are not similarly protected by low coverage  		limits, simply due to the fact that they are self-insured. This may partly  		explain why the large nursing home chains were leaving the Florida market  		altogether. </p>
<p><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a> below, provided by the Florida Agency  		for Health Care Administration, shows that the frequency of attorney notices of  		intent has trended down in recent years. If, in fact, future research finds  		that lawsuit frequency is decreasing, it will remain unclear whether the  		decline was primarily attributable to the frivolous lawsuit deterrents set  		forth in S.B. 1202, or to the increasing use of finite liability insurance  		policies.</p>
<h3>Nursing Home Liability Insurance Market in Florida</h3>
<p>In the mid to late 1990s, many commercial insurers experienced  		significant losses in their nursing home professional liability product lines,  		particularly in the Gulf and southern states, as loss costs greatly exceeded  		insurance reserves. Consequently, many commercial insurers decided to exit the  		nursing home liability insurance market altogether. When researchers from the  		AARP Public Policy Institute commissioned Weiss Ratings, Inc., to survey  		nursing home liability insurers, they found that insurers mentioned Florida,  		Alabama, and Texas most frequently as the states where they had stopped  		offering coverage.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref24">24</a></font></sup> A  		University of South Florida study found that from February through October of  		2001, there were no admitted insurance carriers (which adhered to state  		insurance regulations) offering nursing home liability coverage in  		Florida.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref25">25</a></font></sup> The USF study  		found that at the time of the survey, nearly 20% of nursing facilities in the  		state were without liability coverage entirely, while an additional 36% were  		self-insured.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref26">26</a></font></sup> In March  		2004, Floridas Joint Select Committee on Nursing Homes asked  		Floridas Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) to survey the 21 admitted  		insurers that at one time offered liability coverage for nursing homes. OIR  		found that only six were still offering coverage at the time, although all on a  		non-admitted basis.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref27">27</a></font></sup> The Committees final report concluded  		that [g]eneral and professional liability insurance, with actual  		transfer-of-risk, is virtually unavailable in Florida.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref28">28</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Compounding the insurance availability problem, Floridas 2001  		landmark passage of S.B. 1202 set forth a requirement that all facilities had  		to have professional liability insurance by January 1, 2002, but set forth no  		minimum requirement for the amount of coverage. Without any state-licensed  		liability insurance carriers to provide coverage, nursing facilities were left  		with few, generally inadequate, options for purchasing liability coverage.  		According to the Florida Health Care Association, most nursing home facilities  		faced only two legitimate options for coverage: limited coverage from  		commercial surplus lines carriers, or costly coverage through the Long Term  		Care Risk Retention Group (LTCRRG).<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref29">29</a></font></sup></p>
<p>Commercial insurers remaining in Florida were providing professional  		liability coverage on a non-admitted basis only. The USF study  		found that in 2001, insured Florida facilities paid a liability insurance  		premium minimum average cost of $6,434 per bed.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref30">30</a></font></sup> That compared to a national per bed minimum  		average of $2,340. An in-depth examination of the issue confirmed the extent of  		the insurance availability and affordability problem when Floridas Joint  		Select Committee on Nursing Homes was re-appointed by the Florida Legislature  		in late 2003. The Committee, charged with examining the liability insurance  		crisis and assessing the impact of S.B. 1202, detailed in their report that  		excess and surplus line carriers were exclusively offering finite  		policies to nursing facilities with very low limits in the range of  		$25,000-$50,000 per single occurrence. Typically, a $25,000 finite liability  		policy cost a Florida nursing home operator $32,500. In the event of a  		liability claim, insurers paid out only up to the limit amount offered under  		the policy. These finite policies accomplished little more than allowing  		facilities to meet the coverage requirement established in S.B. 1202, without  		insurance carriers assuming any real risk for professional liability. Due to  		their size and financial stability, some of the publicly-traded, multi-state  		nursing facility chains were able to purchase catastrophic coverage with higher  		coverage amounts, albeit with very high deductibles. For example, a Florida  		representative for Manor Care/HCR told the Committee that they were able to  		purchase coverage from a European carrier with a $5 million per case  		deductible.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref31">31</a></font></sup></p>
<p>The other option for liability insurance coverage available to  		Floridas nursing facilities is the LTCRRG. Announced in February 2003,  		the LTCRRG is a stock certificate company providing general and professional  		liability insurance to nursing facilities, assisted living centers, and  		independent living centers. The LTCRRG is licensed by the Florida OIR and was  		initially capitalized with an interest-free surplus note of $6 million from the  		Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. By law, all facilities insured  		through the LTCRRG must be stockholders in the Group as well. Nursing  		facilities were required to invest $780 per insured bed, with this  		capitalization charge used to repay the $6 million surplus note.  		Over and above the initial capitalization charge, the average premium for  		nursing facilities was set at $1,049 per bed. The LTCRRG limits coverage to  		$250,000 per claim with an aggregate limit of $500,000.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref32">32</a></font></sup> As of January 15, 2004, the Group had 182  		policy holders accounting for over $2 million in premiums. However, of the 182  		policy holders, only two were nursing facilities. The vast majority (176) were  		assisted living facilities.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref33">33</a></font></sup> The Joint Select Committee on Nursing Homes  		found that the capitalization charge was the main factor deterring nursing  		facilities from joining the LTCRRG.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref34">34</a></font></sup> Given the choice, most facilities were  		choosing the less expensive option of purchasing the minimal amount of  		liability coverage available, from surplus line carriers, as previously  		discussed. </p>
<p>At the time of this writing, it is unclear when professional liability  		insurance carriers will return to the Florida market on an admitted basis. In a  		February 2004 interview, the President of Uni-Ter, a major underwriting  		management corporation, captured the gravity of the liability insurance  		availability situation for nursing facilities in Florida. [Nursing  		facilities] are up against it in terms of what is worse. Losing your assets by  		going broke because youre buying insurance or going broke because you  		cant afford to buy insurance and get sued.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref35">35</a></font></sup></p>
<h3>Legal and Legislative Environment in Florida</h3>
<p>In response to the nursing home liability insurance crisis, the Florida  		legislature enacted S.B. 1202 in 2001 with the policy objective in restoring  		stability to the liability insurance market. The legislation included a  		relatively long list of reforms that were intensely negotiated between  		constituencies who believed that the fundamental cause of the crisis in Florida  		was substandard quality of care, and constituencies who believed that  		unrestrained litigation and frivolous lawsuits were the root cause of the  		situation. Some of the more significant tort reform measures in the bill  		included caps on punitive damages, a shortening of the statute of limitations,  		the application of a higher negligence standard for filing residents  		rights lawsuits, and the removal of automatic attorneys fees.  		Importantly, however, the legislation included no absolute caps on claims for  		non-economic damages.</p>
<p>Since the passage of S.B. 1202, other noteworthy legislative measures  		have been debated. In April 2004, a proposed constitutional amendment that may  		have reduced the number of lawsuits in Florida died on the floor in Committee  		on Health, Aging, and Long-Term Care. The proposed amendment, S.B. 3020, would  		have required that a claimant receive at least 70% of the first $250,000 of  		recovery in a medical liability claim involving a contingent fee. The amendment  		would have also required that claimants receive at least 90% of all damages in  		excess of $250,000.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref36">36</a></font></sup></p>
<p>A recent court decision may also have a positive impact on reducing loss  		costs in Florida, thereby bringing down insurance costs. In December 2004, the  		Florida Supreme Court in <i>Knowles v. Beverly Enterprises</i> held that the  		survivors of deceased nursing home patients had a right to recover damages  		under the nursing home residents bill of rights only in cases when  		alleged abuse and neglect <b>directly resulted</b> in the patients death.  		The four-to-two decision applied only to lawsuits filed before May 15, 2001,  		the date when Governor Bush signed S.B. 1202 into law. The ruling applied to an  		estimated 600-1,500 outstanding cases, and according to one source, eliminated  		approximately 20%-50% of all active nursing home abuse and neglect  		cases.<sup><font><a href="NHliab-FL.htm#ref37">37</a></font></sup></p>
<h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>Some five years after enactment, the impact of S.B. 1202 on stabilizing  		the nursing home liability insurance market remains inconclusive. The available  		data, on the whole, suggest that the frequency of nursing home lawsuits in  		Florida is declining. However, some attribute this decline in claim frequency  		to the lack of insurance coverage among many nursing home facilities, thereby  		reducing the incentive for plaintiffs to litigate. The divestiture of large  		national chains of their Florida facilities has had the same effect of limiting  		opportunities for plaintiffs to target nursing home operators with deep  		pockets. Thus, in addition to the legislative impacts of S.B. 1202  		itself, it is reasonable to conclude that the dramatic increase in nursing home  		litigation during the late 1990s planted the seeds of its own demise by  		decimating the insurance market which fed it. Should the liability insurance  		market again stabilize, it will be interesting to observe whether increased  		insurance coverage for Floridas nursing home facilities might spark  		another increase in litigation activity in the future.</p>

</ol><h2><a name="glossary" id="glossary">GLOSSARY</a></h2>
<p><b>Admitted Carriers</b> are commercial insurers whose nursing home  		liability insurance products are regulated by state departments of insurance.  		These carriers enjoy some advantages over non-admitted carriers. They can  		participate in state guaranty funds, which help protect policyholders in the  		case of insurer insolvency. Also, they have a marketing advantage over  		non-admitted carriers because some brokers, facility providers and lenders  		value state oversight and participation in the guaranty fund.</p>
<p>The <b>Alternative Market</b> to nursing home liability insurance is  		composed of various forms of self-insurance, meaning the risk is borne by the  		participants and not an insurance company. The different forms of  		self-insurance include risk retention and risk purchasing groups (RPGs),  		captives, rent-a-captives, and sponsored captives (Joint Underwriting  		Associations).</p>
<p><b>Arbitration Agreements</b> are contracts, the terms of which are  		determined by an arbitrator, entered into by opposing parties. An arbitrator is  		a person or panel of people who are not judges and may be: (1) agreed to by the  		parties; (2) required by a provision in a contract for settling disputes; or  		(3) provided for under statute. Arbitration is designed to be a fair and  		equitable means of dispute resolution agreed to by both parties to avoid a  		court trial and the associated expenses and time investment.</p>
<p><b>Capitalization</b> means funding the reserves of an insurance or  		self-insurance program to pay claims.</p>
<p>A <b>Cell Captive</b> is a captive in which member providers share  		administrative expenses but not risk.</p>
<p>A <b>Captive</b> is a self-formed pool of providers who share risk among  		themselves, thus acting as their own insurance company. Members do their own  		underwriting, meaning they decide among themselves which providers to admit to  		the captive. Members will share liability risk with the providers they admit.  		</p>
<p><b>Claims Made Policies</b> provide coverage for insured events that  		both occur and <i>for which a claim is made</i> during the term of the policy.  		Thus, if an incident occurs, but the policy is terminated before a claim is  		made, liability for the incident is not insured.</p>
<p><b>Claims Occurrence Policies</b> provide coverage for all incidents and  		events that occur during the term of the policy, regardless of when a liability  		claim is made, or when a lawsuit is settled.</p>
<p><b>Collateral Damages</b> are damages incurred by the plaintiff that are  		already covered by other sources of payment. Collateral source  		offset rules reduce awards by denying plaintiffs compensation for  		losses that are recouped from other sources, such as health insurance. These  		rules aim to prevent plaintiffs from double dipping by  		recovering for losses for which the plaintiff has already been remunerated  		through other sources of payment.</p>
<p><b>Deductibles</b> are initial amounts of claims incurred by the  		policyholder not covered by the insurance policy. Insurance coverage begins  		only for losses incurred above the deductible amount.</p>
<p><b>Economic Damages</b> in civil litigation is compensation due the  		plaintiff for financial losses caused by the wrongful actions of another party  		(e.g., awards for the medical bills of a nursing home resident caused by an  		abusive employee).</p>
<p><b>Estimated Liability Costs</b> are approximate calculations of  		expenses for damages to which a nursing home is exposed. Because estimates are  		derived from information provided by nursing homes and the cost of settlements  		of lawsuits is confidential information known only to the insurance carrier,  		plaintiffs attorney and defense attorney, these calculations are only  		estimates and are subject to change.</p>
<p><b>General Liability Claims/Losses</b> are amounts a nursing home  		liability insurer is legally obligated to pay as damages to a plaintiff due to  		bodily injury or property damage. </p>
<p>A <b>Joint Underwriting Association</b> is a state-sponsored  		organization that creates insurance pools and functions as an insurer in  		markets without a significant number of licensed insurers. It has the power to  		sell insurance policies, collect premiums, and purchase reinsurance and it can  		usually guarantee a certain level of premium rates to its members. It can also  		levy surcharges on policyholders and, in some cases, on licensed insurers  		selling liability insurance, to create reserves to pay claims.</p>
<p><b>Joint and Several Liability</b> in civil litigation is a situation in  		which the concurrent acts of two or more defendants bring harm to the  		plaintiff. Such acts need not occur simultaneously, but must contribute to the  		same event. In such a case, the damages may be collected from one or more of  		the defendants. If the court does not apportion blame in specific shares, the  		damages may be collected from any and all defendants. If a defendant does not  		have the financial wherewithal to pay, the others must make up the  		difference.</p>
<p><b>Non-admitted Carriers</b>, also called <b>Surplus Line Carriers</b>,  		are commercial insurers whose nursing home liability insurance products are not  		regulated by state departments of insurance. These insurers enjoy some  		advantages over admitted carriers. They have greater flexibility in designing  		and pricing products. Because they are not subject to state regulation, they  		can also change coverage forms and application protocols more quickly. However,  		they must pay an excess and surplus lines tax that is not levied on  		admitted carriers. They cannot participate in state guaranty funds, which help  		protect policyholders in the case of insurer insolvency</p>
<p><b>Non-economic Damages</b> in civil litigation is compensation due the  		plaintiff for intangible harms (e.g., pain and suffering).</p>
<p><b>Nursing Home Liability Insurance</b> is indemnification of nursing  		home providers against damages for negligent care and abuse.</p>
<p><b>Nursing Home Residents Rights Statutes</b> are state and  		federal laws to protect each nursing home residents civil, religious and  		human rights.</p>
<p><b>Offshore Captives</b> are captives located outside the United States.  		The most popular host states for offshore captives include Bermuda, Guernsey  		and the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p><b>Premium</b> is the charge paid by a policyholder for insurance  		coverage.</p>
<p><b>Professional Liability Claims/Losses</b> are amounts a nursing home  		liability insurer is legally obligated to pay as damages and associated claims  		and defense expenses to a plaintiff due to a negligent act, error or omission  		in a nursing home providers rendering or failure to render professional  		services.</p>
<p><b>Punitive damages</b> in civil litigation means monetary compensation  		awarded by a judge or jury which exceeds the losses suffered by the injured  		party in order to punish the defendant.</p>
<p><b>Regulated Insurance Carriers</b> are admitted carriers (see  		definition above).</p>
<p><b>Reinsurance</b> is the practice of insurance carriers ceding risk to  		other firms, called reinsurance companies, in order to limit their liability  		exposure. Reinsurance companies essentially provide insurance to insurance  		companies. Instead of assessing the risk of individual policyholders,  		reinsurance companies assess risk on a broader scale, such as on the basis of a  		particular product-line (nursing home liability insurance) or a geographic  		region.</p>
<p>A <b>Rent-A-Captive</b> is a captive, usually formed by an insurance  		company, broker or captive manager, and rented out to users (in this case  		nursing home providers) who avoid the cost of funding their own captive. The  		user provides some form of collateral so that the rent-a-captive is not at risk  		from any underwriting loss suffered by the user.</p>
<p><b>Risk Management Programs</b> are structured approaches to  		purposefully limit liability risk. They include systematic efforts to improve  		and maintain high standards for care quality, but can also include additional  		management techniques to minimize liability exposure, such as improving written  		documentation. They are often formalized within the management structure of  		nursing home providers in the form of Risk Management Committees, and/or a  		designated Director of Risk Management along with formal Risk Management plans  		that are implemented and monitored by senior management.</p>
<p>A <b>Risk Retention Group (RRG)</b> is an insurance company that is  		owned by its members. The members of an RRG come from the same industry. For  		instance, nursing home providers can form an RRG in order to obtain nursing  		home liability coverage.</p>
<p>A <b>Settlement</b> is an agreement reached between the legal counsel of  		the plaintiff and the defendant that terminates a civil litigation before a  		verdict is reached by the court.</p>
<p><b>Tort Reform</b> generally means a movement intended to curb  		litigation and damages in the civil justice system. With respect to nursing  		home liability insurance, many states have enacted tort reform through  		legislation and it has changed the legal framework under which residents and/or  		family members can seek damages for negligent or abusive care practices. States  		also placed limits on the amount of damages that could be awarded to plaintiffs  		and/or their family members, particularly non-economic damages for pain and  		suffering. </p>
<p><b>Underwriting</b> is the process by which an insurer assesses the risk  		of insuring a particular applicant for coverage. Risk retention groups also  		underwrite by assessing the risk of accepting a prospective member.</p>
