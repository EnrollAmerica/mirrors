<hr /><p>An earlier paper in this project analyzed four State Medicaid programs  		to assess the extent to which they served as a "safety net" for high cost  		children and youth, using cross-sectional Medicaid data for one year in each  		State (Burwell and Herz, 1990). This study takes that analysis one step  		further, and examines the experience of a cohort of high cost Medicaid children  		over several years. In a sense, this study examines the extent to which the  		safety net may be temporary for some high cost children, and permanent for  		others. </p>
<p>Seven years of Medicaid data were used to analyze the experience of high  		cost children. The study population consisted of children and youth under age  		26 with Medicaid expenditures of $25,000 or more during 1983 in California.  		Longitudinal Medicaid data from 1980 through 1986 were analyzed for this cohort  		of children. Thus, the study analyzed their retrospective and prospective  		experience with Medicaid. The major research questions addressed by the study  		were: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>What proportion of high cost children are "new" to the Medicaid  			 program when they experience a period of high medical expenditures? To what  			 extent do high cost children remain enrolled in Medicaid after their period of  			 high expenditures?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have these children had high costs on Medicaid in the past? Do they  			 have persistently high costs in the future?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there variations in the longitudinal experience of high cost  			 Medicaid children by age, institutional status or eligibility group? What are  			 the characteristics of high cost children who use Medicaid as a permanent  			 safety net?</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>DATA SOURCES AND STUDY LIMITATIONS</h2>
<p>The data for this study were drawn from the Tape-to-Tape data base.  		Tape-to-Tape is a multi-State Medicaid data base developed by the Office of  		Research and Demonstrations at HCFA. Tape-to-Tape includes information on every  		Medicaid enrollee and every claim processed by the Medicaid Management  		Information System (MMIS) in several States since 1980. For this study, a  		research file was constructed of all children and young adults up to age 26 in  		California who had total Medicaid payments in 1983 in excess of $25,000.<font><a href="cahcmces.htm#note1">1</a></font> The threshold amount of $25,000 was  		arbitrary and was simply used to identify children with extraordinarily high  		Medicaid expenditures. Study data for each child included information on their  		enrollment, utilization and Medicaid expenditures in 1983, plus their  		experience in the Medicaid program from 1980 through 1986. Thus, the research  		file included a total of 7 years of data for this cohort of high cost children.  		</p>
<p>A few high cost children were excluded from the study cohort.  		<a href="cahcmces.htm#appendA">Appendix A</a> reviews the sample selection steps and  		discusses other data limitations. </p>
<p>It should be noted that California was not a representative State with  		regard to its Medicaid program in 1983 or at any point over the seven year  		study period. From 1980 through 1986, it covered more of the Medicaid optional  		eligibility groups than other States. Of relevance to this analysis of  		children, California included the optional Medicaid group of all Ribicoff  		children under age 21 in its coverage throughout the study period. Ribicoff  		children are those residing in two-parent families. Ordinarily, children living  		with both parents cannot qualify for Medicaid through the AFDC program since  		they are not considered to be deprived of parental support or "dependent." With  		the Ribicoff optional group, children living with both parents can qualify for  		Medicaid (although their parents cannot qualify) if the family's income meets  		the Medicaid income eligibility standards used by the State. </p>
<p>California also had a medically needy program during the study period.  		Medically needy coverage is important since it allows children in families of  		any income level to qualify for Medicaid. With a medically needy program, a  		State can allow persons to qualify for Medicaid through "spending-down," even  		if their income exceeds the medically needy income level. The spend-down  		process allows applicants to deduct medical expenses from income in determining  		financial eligibility. Thus, children from families of any income level could  		qualify for Medicaid, assuming their medical bills were large enough. </p>
<p>Finally, for all its eligibility groups, California used much higher  		income thresholds than other States to determine financial eligibility. As  		shown in <a href="cahcmces.htm#table1">Table 1</a>, its monthly payment standard for an  		AFDC family of 4 in 1983 was $625, compared to $368 for the median State  		nationwide. California's SSI income standard for a disabled person living  		independently was $451 in 1983, compared to $304 for the median State. Its  		medically needy income level for one-person was $544, with $801 for  		four-persons. These levels were also considerably higher than other States. All  		of California's financial criteria relevant to Medicaid were the highest in the  		continental United States throughout the seven year study period. Thus,  		California offered greater possibilities for Medicaid to work as a safety net  		for high cost children than other States. </p>

</tr></table><h2>HIGH COST COHORT</h2>
<p>The study cohort consisted of 4,726 California children under age 26 who  		had Medicaid expenditures of $25,000 or more in 1983. As shown in  		<a href="cahcmces.htm#table2">Table 2</a>, about half of the cohort (48.5%) were  		institutionalized (in a long-term care or inpatient psychiatric facility)  		during 1983, and about half (51.5%) were not. </p>
<p>Data in <a href="cahcmces.htm#table2">Table 2</a> show several differences between  		the noninstitutionalized high cost group and the institutional group. The vast  		majority of the institutional group were teenagers and young adults, while just  		over half of the noninstitutional group was 3 years of age or less. The  		predominance of older children in the institutionalized group is not  		surprising, since it is rare for young children to be institutionalized. The  		age distribution for the noninstitutional group resembles a reverse J-shape,  		with the lowest incidence of high costs for children in the 4-10 years age  		group. This age distribution pattern for the noninstitutional group follows the  		same general pattern shown for all high cost pediatric hospitalizations in  		California (Ku, 1990). </p>
<p>Both groups had significantly more males than females, which is also  		consistent with previous research on high cost children (Burwell, 1990). This  		pattern was somewhat stronger with the institutional group. </p>
<p>The vast majority of institutionalized children (89.4%) qualified for  		Medicaid through the SSI cash assistance group. This pattern is related to an  		important difference in eligibility criteria used for the noninstitutional and  		institutional groups. For children considered to be living at home (i.e. the  		noninstitutionalized), program regulations generally require that the income  		and resources of parents are considered in determining their eligibility for  		cash assistance and Medicaid. After certain disregards for earned and unearned  		income, parental income is compared to the AFDC, SSI or medically needy income  		standards (adjusted for family size) to determine whether a child will qualify  		or cash and/or medical assistance. However, parental income is not "deemed" to  		be available to institutionalized children. Thus, most disabled children in  		institutions are not considered to have any income, and they qualify for cash  		assistance under the SSI program. In 1983, these children would have received  		an SSI monthly payment of $25 to cover their incidental needs while in the  		institution. An additional 6.8% of the institutionalized group passed the SSI  		disability test, but were medically needy (indicating they had some income).  		</p>

</tr></table><p>A completely different eligibility profile prevailed for the  		non-institutionalized group. Only 26.6% of the noninstitutional group were  		eligible for Medicaid through the SSI disabled cash or medically needy groups.  		The AFDC and Ribicoff groups provided the main entry to Medicaid eligibility  		for noninstitutional high cost children. </p>
<p>The average Medicaid expenditure per high cost child in 1983 was $43,845  		for the institutional group, compared to $59,387 for the noninstitutional  		group. Noninstitutional children incurred higher Medicaid costs, even though  		their average length of enrollment on Medicaid during 1983 was 8.5 months,  		compared to 11.7 months for institutionalized high cost children. The average  		expenditure per personyear of enrollment incorporates this adjustment for  		length of enrollment. Using personyears of enrollment as the denominator,  		noninstitutionalized children averaged $83,769 per recipient in 1983 Medicaid  		expenditures, compared to only $45,204 for institutionalized children. </p>
<p><a href="cahcmces.htm#table3">Table 3</a> shows the distribution of expenditures per  		recipient for each of the study groups, and indicates there were many more very  		expensive children among the noninstitutional group. Ten percent of  		noninstitutional children had Medicaid expenditures in 1983 of $104,408 or  		more. The most expensive 10% of institutionalized children had expenditure  		levels of only $48,982 or more. Thus, there was less variance in overall 1983  		Medicaid expenditure levels among the high cost institutional group. </p>
<p>Returning to <a href="cahcmces.htm#table2">Table 2</a>, we see that 90% of the  		expenditures for the noninstitutional group were for inpatient hospital care,  		while only 10% of the expenditures for the institutional group were in this  		service category. The vast majority of Medicaid expenditures for high cost  		children in the institutional group were for ICF/MR and SNF care. </p>

Children with  		private insurance coverage in the noninstitutional group had significantly  		lower Medicaid expenditures per recipient (using personyears of enrollment) in  		1983--$77,036 compared to $84,143 for children without insurance. However,  		private insurance did not reduce Medicaid expenditures for the institutional  		group. Institutionalized children with insurance averaged $46,461 per recipient  		in 1983 Medicaid expenditures, compared to $44,909 for uninsured children.  		Since private insurance usually provides little coverage for long-term care,  		this result is not surprising. </p>

Since the spend-down children incurred  		costs to satisfy the spend-down liability, their total costs (the spend-down  		liability plus the Medicaid expenditures) would clearly exceed the Medicaid  		expenditure level for high cost children who did not spend-down. It is not  		clear why spend-down children had higher Medicaid expenditures. One possible  		explanation is that families may resort to the spend-down process only when the  		hospital costs are extraordinarily high.

<p>The major impetus for this study was to better understand the  		longitudinal Medicaid patterns of high cost children. The first research  		question of interest is the extent to which high cost children were "new" to  		Medicaid as a result of their high cost episode. We excluded infants from this  		analysis since all infants were new to the program in 1983, and the data base  		did not provide information on the Medicaid eligibility status of their  		mothers. </p>
<p>If Medicaid is working as a safety net for children with catastrophic  		health needs, presumably many children over one year of age would not have been  		enrolled prior to the high cost episode. However, we have to keep in mind that  		new children (high cost or not) are always coming onto Medicaid. For example,  		Ellwood and Bane reported that at a point in time, approximately 21% of AFDC  		cases have been enrolled for less than one year (Ellwood and Bane, 1983),  		although this rate included families with only newborns. We also have to  		consider that SSI children are a portion of our high cost group. Generally the  		new enrollment rate for SSI children nationwide has been running about 20%  		annually (Staren, 1990). Although it is difficult to estimate precisely how  		many new high cost children would be "normal" for Medicaid each year, these  		rates for the AFDC and SSI programs provide some guidance. </p>
<p><a href="cahcmces.htm#table8">Table 8</a> shows us the extent to which children in  		the high cost cohort were enrolled in Medicaid before and after 1983. About 66%  		of the noninstitutional high cost group (who were at least age 1 by 1983) were  		enrolled in Medicaid in 1982, compared to 96% of the institutional group. Thus,  		in 1983 about one-third of the noninstitutional high cost children were "new"  		to the program (excluding children born in 1983). The "new" entry rate to the  		high cost institutional group was considerably less (about 4%). </p>

</tr></table><p>The "new" entry rate of 34% for noninstitutional high cost children is  		considerably higher than the expected AFDC rate of 21% (which would probably be  		lower if newborns were excluded) and the SSI rate of 20%, suggesting that  		California's Medicaid program did pick up a significant number of high cost  		children in 1983 beyond what would be expected with normal caseload turnover  		and increases. </p>
<p>The next question is the extent to which high cost children are  		temporary or permanent Medicaid enrollees. Again, it is important to think  		about the normal expected length of enrollment for children on Medicaid. For  		AFDC cases at a given point in time, 50% to 60% would have been enrolled for  		four or more years (Ellwood and Bane, 1983). For SSI children, we would expect  		an even longer duration. Previous research has shown that California children  		who became eligible for SSI cash assistance had low turnover, whereas Ribicoff  		and medically needy children in California had very short periods of enrollment  		(Rymer and Adler, 1985). </p>
<p>Data in <a href="cahcmces.htm#table8">Table 8</a> show that high cost  		institutionalized children have a high probability of remaining on Medicaid  		over time, while noninstitutionalized children show considerably greater  		turnover. In 1986, about 90% of the institutionalized group were still on  		Medicaid, and 6% were deceased. Thus, Medicaid appears to work as a permanent  		source of coverage for high cost institutional children. Remember that most of  		the institutional children are SSI cash children. </p>
<p>In contrast, by 1986 only about half of the noninstitutionalized high  		cost group were still Medicaid enrollees. Also, by the end of 1986, about 10%  		of this group were deceased. Thus, for about 40% of the noninstitutional group,  		Medicaid was working more as a catastrophic insurance program, i.e. Medicaid  		coverage was used during an episode of high costs, but did not continue to  		provide ongoing coverage over time. On the other hand, slightly more of the  		high cost children continued to be enrolled in 1986 than were eligible in 1980.  		Thus, high cost children exited the program at a somewhat slower rate than they  		entered. </p>
<p>For the noninstitutional cohort, there were age-related differences in  		the pre and post 1983 enrollment patterns. Younger children were more likely  		than older children to have been enrolled in Medicaid prior to the high cost  		episode. <a href="cahcmces.htm#table9">Table 9</a> shows the retention rates on Medicaid  		for the noninstitutional cohort by age group. In 1982 (the year before the high  		cost episode of interest), 68.5% of children ages 1-4 and 76.2% of children  		ages 4-10 were enrolled in Medicaid, compared to 61% of children over age 10.  		</p>

</tr></table><p>However, older high cost children (in the noninstitutional cohort) were  		more likely to remain enrolled on Medicaid after the high cost episode than  		infants. Only 40.6% of infants in the high cost cohort were still on Medicaid  		in 1986 (three years after the high cost episode), compared to 49.9% of  		children ages 1-3, 56.7% of children ages 4-10, 47.9% of children ages 11-20  		and 53.5% of children ages 21-25. If the denominator was adjusted for the  		proportion of children in the noninstitutional cohort who died, the retention  		rates for the older groups would be even higher. For example, by the end of the  		study period, 19.2% of the 21-25 year age group were deceased, compared to only  		3.8% of infants. </p>
<p>Thus, younger children in the noninstitutionalized high cost cohort were  		significantly more likely to be enrolled prior to the high cost episode than  		older children. This suggests that the safety net may be especially important  		for older children, i.e. "new" enrollees were disproportionately older  		children. After the high cost episode, infants were less likely than other age  		groups to remain enrolled. </p>
<p>The differences in the rates of deceased children by age group are also  		worth noting. The rates of death by the end of 1986 were highest for children  		in the 4-10 year and 21-25 year age groups. Generally, the period from 4-10  		years of age is a relatively healthy time, with significantly lower morbidity  		races than occurs for other age groups of children (Office of Technology  		Assessment, 1988). However, our data suggest that for Medicaid children who  		become sick enough to incur very high costs at this age, the mortality rate is  		much higher than for younger children with similarly high costs. Returning to  		<a href="cahcmces.htm#table7">Table 7</a>, we see that about 18% of children in the 4-10  		year age group had diagnoses related to neoplasms, and later data will show  		that a very high rate of death occurred for children with neoplasms. We do not  		have any explanation as to why the rate of death dropped to 10.9% for children  		in the 11-20 age group and then rose to 19.2% for children in the 21-25 age  		group. </p>
<p>Another objective of the longitudinal analysis was to analyze the  		Medicaid eligibility patterns for the noninstitutional high cost children group  		over time. Issues of interest with regard to eligibility include the extent to  		which high cost children use the optional eligibility groups, such as the  		medically needy provisions or Ribicoff coverage, to access Medicaid. Also, what  		proportion of high cost children have disabling conditions of sufficient  		severity that they eventually become eligible for Medicaid through the SSI  		disability provisions? </p>
<p>The routes to Medicaid eligibility are less of an issue for  		institutionalized children. The eligibility pathway for institutional children  		is fairly straightforward. As reported earlier, the vast majority of them  		qualify through the SSI cash assistance group since parental income and  		resources are not deemed to be available to children in an institutional  		setting. </p>
<p><a href="cahcmces.htm#table10">Table 10</a> presents eligibility information for the  		cohort of noninstitutionalized high cost children. The first column shows the  		initial enrollment group under which the children in the cohort qualified.<font><a href="cahcmces.htm#note2">2</a> </font>The second column shows their primary  		eligibility group for 1983 (i.e. where they had the longest period of  		enrollment). Then the third column shows the distribution of children by their  		last reported enrollment group. For some children, their entire spell of  		enrollment may have been limited to 1983. Other children may have been  		continuously enrolled from 1980 to 1986 without a change in enrollment groups.  		Thus, the initial and last enrollment groups can overlap with the 1983 group.  		</p>

</tr></table><p>Two patterns are important in the longitudinal eligibility data. First,  		the proportion of high cost children passing the SSI disability test was only  		15.8% with regard to initial eligibility, but increased to 40.0% by the last  		eligibility group. In 1983 when the study sample was selected, 26.6% were  		considered to be SSI disabled. Thus, many of the high cost children entered the  		Medicaid program through the AFDC (including the AFDC medically needy) or  		Ribicoff groups, but were sufficiently disabled that they eventually qualified  		for coverage through the SSI disability provisions. By the point of their last  		eligibility group, about 32.6% of the study sample qualified as SSI disabled  		children receiving cash assistance, with another 6.4% qualifying as medically  		needy SSI disabled children. </p>
<p>A second pattern to note is the importance of medically needy coverage  		and the Ribicoff group as pathways for initial entry to Medicaid. In 1983, both  		medically needy coverage and coverage of Ribicoff children through age 20 were  		options for States. Half (50.7%) of the high cost children cohort  		(noninstitutionalized) used these optional coverage provisions for their  		initial entry to Medicaid. Further, this coverage remained important. During  		1983, 46% of the study cohort qualified for Medicaid through the optional  		groups. Finally, over 40% used these provisions for their last reported  		eligibility group. Thus, many of the noninstitutionalized high cost children  		would not have qualified for coverage if California's Medicaid program had not  		chosen to include the medically needy and Ribicoff optional coverage groups in  		its program. With the medically needy coverage, California opened up Medicaid  		eligibility to children whose family income exceeded the AFDC and SSI cash  		program income standards. With Ribicoff coverage, Medicaid was made available  		to all children under age 21 in two-parent families. </p>
<p><a href="cahcmces.htm#table11">Table 11</a> provides further information on the  		longitudinal eligibility patterns for noninstitutionalized children, showing  		the different eligibility "pathways" used by high cost children over the 7 year  		study period. Children who were eligible throughout their entire period of  		enrollment as SSI disabled children (either cash or medically needy) averaged  		4.4 years of Medicaid enrollment over the 7 year study period. Children who  		qualified under the SSI disability provisions for at least part of their  		enrollment (plus either AFDC or Ribicoff coverage) averaged 4.2 years of  		eligibility on Medicaid. Thus, the 40% of high cost children who eventually  		passed the SSI disability test had considerably longer lengths of enrollment  		than children qualifying under the other groups. Children whose entire  		eligibility was through the Ribicoff group averaged only 1.2 years of Medicaid  		enrollment, and children using the AFDC provisions averaged closer to 3 years.  		As expected, children who were sufficiently ill to pass the SSI disability test  		became long-term Medicaid enrollees, whereas the AFDC and Ribicoff children  		experienced much shorter durations of enrollment on average. </p>

</tr></table><p>It should be emphasized, however, that these data on durations of  		enrollment have problems of left and right censoring. Some children in our  		cohort were no doubt enrolled in Medicaid prior to 1980 (the earliest year in  		our data set), and we expect even more children continued to be enrolled after  		1986. Thus, the magnitude of difference between eligibility patterns shown in  		<a href="cahcmces.htm#table11">Table 11</a> might be even greater if we had complete  		information on enrollment. In particular, we expect the eligibility groups with  		longer lengths of enrollment may be biased downwards. For example, we suspect  		that the data in <a href="cahcmces.htm#table11">Table 11</a> may be complete for many of  		the children who used the Ribicoff only eligibility path to Medicaid since this  		is a Medicaid only group (i.e. no cash assistance). However, we expect the two  		groups involving disabled children would show even greater average lengths of  		enrollment if complete data were available. Most of the disabled children were  		receiving SSI cash assistance and we know this group has little turnover. </p>
<p>A final issue of interest is the extent to which high cost children are  		<b>persistently</b> high cost to Medicaid. <a href="cahcmces.htm#table12">Table 12</a>  		shows the proportion of children in the 1983 high cost cohort who were high  		cost from 1980 to 1982 and 1984 to 1986. This table uses two definitions of  		high cost: those children whose expenses were equal to or greater than $25,000,  		and those whose Medicaid expenses were $10,000 to $24,999. Other years of data  		were adjusted to 1983 dollars, using the medical care component of the Consumer  		Price Index. </p>

However, as shown in <a href="cahcmces.htm#figure1">Figure 1</a> and <a href="cahcmces.htm#figure2">Figure 2</a>, these rates  		differed significantly by institutional status. In 1980, only 11.5% of the  		noninstitutional group were high cost (defined as over $10,000 in Medicaid  		expenditures), compared to 80.8% of the institutionalized. Similarly, only 9.1%  		of the noninstitutional group remained high cost in 1986 (or about one-fifth of  		those still enrolled), compared to 76.9% of the institutional group (or about  		87% of those still-enrolled). </p>

<p>Once again, age appears to be a factor. Most institutional children were  		older, and <a href="cahcmces.htm#table13">Table 13</a> shows us that the likelihood of  		remaining high cost was lowest for children under age 4 in the noninstitutional  		high cost cohort. Only 2.6% of the 1983 high cost infant cohort  		(noninstitutional) continued to be high cost to Medicaid in 1986, compared to  		13.6% of the 11-20 year group, and 17% of the 21-25 year group. </p>

For  		example, only 2% of children with problems from the perinatal period in 1983  		remained high cost in 1986. Thus, most premature and low birthweight infants,  		as well as children involved in accidents or injuries, do not remain high cost.  		Instead, their need for expensive coverage under Medicaid appears to be  		time-limited. The children who are likely to remain high cost are those with  		chronic, permanent conditions. </p>

<h2>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p>Study data showed several patterns with regard to the longitudinal  		experience of high cost Medicaid children in California in 1983: </p>
<ul><li>
<p>About half of California's high cost children on Medicaid in 1983  			 were SSI children in long-term care facilities. Almost all of these  			 institutionalized children had been high cost in the past and were high cost  			 over the next 3 years. About 7% of this group were deceased within 3 years.  			 Most of these children received SSI cash assistance, and their average age was  			 18.7 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other half of the high cost children group, the  			 noninstitutionalized, differed considerably. Three years following the high  			 cost episode, only about half of the noninstitutionalized group remained on  			 Medicaid, and 10% were deceased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most noninstitutionalized high cost children were not persistently  			 high cost. Only about 12% of noninstitucionalized had been high cost to  			 Medicaid 3 years prior to the high cost episode and only 9% remained high cost  			 3 years later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noninstitutionalized high cost children had a very different profile  			 than institutionalized children. The average age was 7.9 years, and over half  			 of the children were under age 4. Most of the children in this group used the  			 AFDC cash or medically needy groups, or the Ribicoff provisions to access the  			 Medicaid program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infants composed 30% of the noninstitutionalized high cost group.  			 They were the age group among high cost children least likely to remain on  			 Medicaid after 3 years. Infants were also the age group least likely to remain  			 high cost, and the had the lowest death rate. The most frequent diagnoses for  			 high cost infants involved conditions originating in the perinatal period and  			 congenital anomalies. It appears that these problems were not permanently  			 disabling, at least not to the extent that the children met the SSI disability  			 criteria or required continued intensive medical care under Medicaid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The noninstitutionalized children most likely to remain enrolled in  			 Medicaid were those with permanent chronic conditions who became eligible under  			 the SSI disabled provisions. SSI disabled children were also the vast majority  			 of children with continued high cost. The diagnoses which were most likely to  			 result in persistent high cost are: diseases of the blood and blood forming  			 organs (includes sickle cell anemia), diseases of the skin and subcutaneous  			 tissue (includes chronic skin ulcers and bed sores), endocrine, nutritional and  			 metabolic disorders (includes diabetes and cystic fibrosis), mental disorders,  			 diseases of the genitourinary system (includes kidney disease) and diseases of  			 the respiratory system (includes bronchitis, pneumonia, and asthma).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To what extent is Medicaid working as a safety net for high cost  		children? Study data suggest that the number of "new" high cost children in the  		noninstitutional group enrolled in California during 1983 was greater than  		would have been expected with normal caseload turnover and growth. Further,  		most of these noninstitutional children did not remain high cost, and only  		about half were still enrolled in Medicaid three years later. This pattern  		suggests that California's Medicaid program was serving as catastrophic  		insurance for children experiencing a high cost episode. On the other hand,  		study data does not suggest that this catastrophic coverage was reaching middle  		class families with high cost children. Only 15% of the children incurred a  		spend-down liability (indicating their family income exceeded the medically  		needy level). Also, the size of the spend-down liabilities was not great. Since  		many of the children used the Ribicoff eligibility provisions to qualify for  		Medicaid, they were probably from two-parent families or the group often  		referred to as the working poor. </p>
<p>A finding of major policy significance is that about half of the high  		cost children (noninstitutional) used optional coverage groups (medically needy  		and Ribicoff coverage provisions) in order to qualify for Medicaid during the  		high cost episode. Without these optional coverage groups, California's safety  		net for high cost children would probably have been cut in half. </p>
<p>These results underscore the importance of optional coverage in serving  		high cost children--especially those who are younger and are not disabled  		enough to meet the SSI disability criteria. The numerous expansions to Medicaid  		eligibility during the 1980s to extend coverage for infants and all children  		living in poverty make mandatory some of the coverage groups California opted  		to include in its Medicaid program in 1983. However, States are still not  		required to have medically needy programs for children. Neither are States  		mandated to provide Ribicoff coverage through age 20. Finally, most States do  		not have income eligibility thresholds as high as those used by California.  		</p>
<p>In 1989, fifteen States did not have medically needy programs. All  		States now cover some Ribicoff children, although their Ribicoff coverage may  		only cover such children whose families meet the AFDC cash assistance financial  		criteria (i.e. they do not have medically needy programs). Recent Medicaid  		legislation mandated State coverage effective April 1990 of all children  		(including those in two-parent families) up to age 6 in families with incomes  		up to 133% of the poverty level. Nevertheless, twenty States in 1989 did not  		offer Ribicoff coverage to children all the way to age 18. Only twenty States  		in 1989 offered Ribicoff coverage to all children up to age 21, which is  		comparable to California's program in 1983 (National Governors' Association,  		1990) . </p>
<p>Financial levels also continue to be low for AFDC and medically needy  		programs in most States. In 1989, the median AFDC benefit level in 1989 for a  		family of 3 was $364, which was 44% of the Federal poverty level for that size  		family. The Federal SSI benefit standard in 1989 for a single person was $368  		which was 68% of the Federal poverty standard for a single individual under age  		65 (Committee on Ways and Means, 1990). The median State medically needy  		threshold in 1989 for a family of 3 was $516, which was 63% of the Federal  		poverty level (National Governors' Association, 1990). Thus, most States  		Medicaid programs today would not offer the safety net available through the  		California program in 1983. </p>
<p>Another policy implication from the study results involves infants and  		young children. Since over half of the (noninstitutionalized) high cost group  		were under age 4, there is obviously an important need for catastrophic  		coverage to this age group. Indeed, the need for coverage to young children may  		be even greater now, with the spread of AIDS to children and the increased  		number of drug exposed infants and children. It would be interesting to update  		this high cost profile to see if the proportion of younger children in the high  		cost group has become even greater since 1983 and to determine whether the  		long-term patterns of high cost infants and younger children have changed,  		given these more recent developments. There is growing concern that drug  		exposed infants in particular may require prolonged medical and social  		assistance. </p>
<p>One study result regarding the catastrophic coverage of high cost  		infants is somewhat perplexing. Only 41% of the high cost infants in 1983  		continued to be enrolled in California's Medicaid program in 1986. Further,  		only 3% continued to have Medicaid expenditures exceeding $10,000 annually. On  		the one hand, this result is reassuring in that it shows that many of these  		infants did not remain high cost or continue to be a burden on the Medicaid  		program. On the other hand, what happened to the majority of these high cost  		infants with regard to their ongoing health care needs? Children with major  		health care problems at birth are more likely to require ongoing health care  		throughout their lives than other children. For example, low birthweight  		infants are at greater risk for developing lifelong impairments such as  		learning disabilities, mental retardation and cerebral palsy (National  		Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, 1989). </p>
<p>Generally, we would assume these high cost infants lost Medicaid  		eligibility due to the improved financial circumstances of their families.  		However, did these high risk infants move to a source of ongoing health care  		coverage once they lost Medicaid eligibility? Families exiting Medicaid due to  		earnings often do not have a source of ongoing health care coverage. About  		one-third of children in working poor families in 1986 were without any health  		insurance (Rosenbaum, 1989). Thus, we are concerned that some of these infants  		may have moved to a situation of no health care coverage or inadequate  		coverage. </p>
<p>Study results showing the persistent high costs to Medicaid associated  		with institutionalized children underscore the importance of options available  		to States to provide community-based care for disabled children who would  		otherwise be institutionalized. Currently, 36 States are using home and  		community-based waivers to provide disabled children specialized services in a  		home or community setting. Seventeen States are using the TEFRA option to waive  		parental deeming of income to their children and provide them cost-effective  		home care (Hall, 1990). Any further steps which could be taken to assist States  		in providing more cost-effective care should be pursued. </p>
<p>Finally, it is difficult to generalize from these findings on high cost  		children in California to the Medicaid program as a whole. We know California's  		Medicaid program in 1983 offered more comprehensive benefits and used less  		restrictive eligibility criteria than other States. We believe that these  		program differences had an impact on the dynamics of Medicaid coverage for high  		cost children, but we do not have enough information on the longitudinal  		experience of high cost children in other States to say this with certainty. We  		also would expect that the situation in 1990 may be very different for high  		cost children (even in California) from what was happening in 1983. As  		mentioned earlier, we now have pediatric AIDS and the problems related to drug-  		exposed infants. </p>
<p>We see many needs for further research. For example, in their  		cross-sectional study of high cost children, Burwell and Herz reported that  		over 70% of the high cost group were institutionalized in Georgia, Michigan and  		Tennessee. Would these institutionalized children in other States show the same  		persistence with regard to high Medicaid costs as we saw in California? Does  		California provide more short-term catastrophic coverage to the  		noninstitutionalized than occurs in other State Medicaid programs? Do other  		State Medicaid programs show the same patterns with regard to high cost  		infants? Are high cost infants and young children more likely to remain on  		Medicaid and continue to be high cost than they used to be? </p>

</tr></table><p>Among the enrollees in the excluded groups, 33 persons fell into two of  		the six groups. Most of these enrollees (n = 30) were classified as both AFDC  		adults and HMO enrollees. After multiple identification numbers for the same  		individuals were combined, a final sample size of 4,726 was obtained. Specific  		reasons for eliminating certain groups of enrollees are described below. </p>
<p>In examining a sample of inpatient claims for high cost <b>AFDC  		adults</b>, it was evident that many identification numbers belonging to adult  		female enrollees had been used to bill Medicaid for both their care and their  		infants' care at delivery. This billing practice can extend into the first few  		months of life for the newborn. In many of the cases examined, mothers had  		significant problems during pregnancy and/or at labor and delivery (e.g., were  		hospitalize for fetal-pelvic disproportion, breech presentation, preterm labor,  		anemia of the mother). Their infants typically had significant problems as well  		(e.g., congenital malformations, extreme prematurity). This combination of  		factors undoubtedly contributed to the large total costs associated with  		"shared" mother-baby identification numbers. It is our belief that most of the  		total costs for each mother-baby case among AFDC adults were incurred by the  		infant rather than the mother. Because most high-cost AFDC adult cases probably  		represented more than one recipient, we deleted these enrollees from the study  		sample. More generally, the elimination of the AFDC Adult group from the study  		sample probably resulted in an undercount of some high cost children,  		especially those under the age of one and for whom a significant percentage of  		costly medical care occurred early in life before they received their own  		identification number separate from their mother's record. The exact magnitude  		of this problem is unknown. </p>
<p>Several other groups of enrollees were also eliminated from the study  		sample. <b>Crossovers</b> are those individuals who are dually enrolled in both  		Medicaid and Medicare. In general, claims for these enrollees are first  		processed and paid by Medicare. Some portion (sometimes all) of the uncovered  		balance of the claim is then paid by Medicaid. Because the claims information  		in the Tape-to-Tape files are often incomplete on crossover claims, individuals  		who had such claims were eliminated from our sample. </p>
<p>For similar reasons <b>HMO/capitated enrollees</b> were also deleted  		from the study sample. In the Tape-to-Tape files, only the monthly premium  		payments for these enrollees are included. These payments do not necessarily  		reflect the full extent of service utilization or costs associated with medical  		care in the same way that fee-for-service payments do. Payments for  		HMO/capitated enrollees are thus artifically truncated and are not directly  		comparable to other types of enrollees. </p>
<p>Finally, a small number of enrollees were eliminated from the study  		sample for several other reasons. Santa Barbara and Monterey county residents  		were dropped because the Tape-to-Tape files do not contain complete claims  		information on these individuals (both counties independently processed their  		own claims during the study period and these claims were not included in the  		Tape-to-Tape database). Because refugee and other Federal and State only  		enrollees represent very small groups who are not part of the regular Medicaid  		program, they were also eliminated from the study sample. </p>
<p>In general, the Tape-to-Tape database has certain limitations relevant  		to this study. First, some types of claims are not routinely part of  		California's Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) from which the  		Tape-to-Tape files are developed. The most significant omission is EPSDT  		services. Only non-EPSDT preventive care and treatment services delivered to  		children and young adults are included in the database. However, we believe the  		aggregate impact of this omission is minimal in light of the fact that high  		costs tend to be associated with use of curative or long-term care rather than  		preventive services. </p>
<p>A second issue with the California Tape-to-Tape database is that  		enrollees may have multiple identification numbers over time. Assignment of new  		identification numbers can occur in a variety of circumstances, for example,  		when an enrollee moves from one county to another, when the eligibility group  		changes, or when new family budget units are assigned. SysteMetrics has  		developed a complex algorithm for linking multiple identification numbers for  		individual enrollees which handles the vast majority of these situations.  		However, it is possible that some problems of this type remain undetected and  		uncorrected. To the extent this is true, some children who met our criterion  		for high cost but whose payments were divided among unlinked identification  		numbers will be missing from our study sample. </p>
