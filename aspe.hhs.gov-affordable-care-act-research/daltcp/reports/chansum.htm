</dl><h2><a name="summary" id="summary">SUMMARY OF DEMONSTRATION</a></h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), in recognition  		of the large and rapidly growing need for long-term care for the functionally  		impaired elderly, funded a major demonstration to test the feasibility and  		cost-effectiveness of an alternative community-based long-term care service  		delivery concept integrating health and social services.</p>
<p>Ten community projects in ten different States participated in the  		National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration. Participating States were  		Florida, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,  		Pennsylvania, and Texas.</p>
<h3>A. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT</h3>
<p>The Channeling demonstration was an intra-departmental long-term care  		initiative funded by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the  		Administration on Aging (AoA), and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  		Planning and Evaluation (ASPE). The Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation was responsible for the coordination and implementation of overall  		program policy in cooperation with the Administrator of the Health Care  		Financing Administration and the Assistant Secretary for the Office of Human  		Development Services.</p>
<h3>B. EARLY FEDERAL PLANNING EFFORTS</h3>
<p>Planning for the Channeling demonstration began at the Federal level in  		1978. The initial Federal concept of a service planning and coordination agency  		(as originally identified in a government briefing memorandum dated July 14,  		1978) entailed creating new agencies with three inter-related functions: (1) to  		channel all or part of the long-term care population--that is, to match those  		in need with appropriate long-term care service settings; (2) to plan for the  		long-term care service system to ensure that sufficient supplies of needed  		services and settings would be available; and (3) to coordinate directly or  		indirectly the provision of long-term care services.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 1980, Congress appropriated $20 million for a long-term  		care initiative to be designed and implemented by three groups within DHHS.  		Funding for such a research and demonstration effort was included in the  		research budgets of AOA and HCFA. The responsibility for managing the  		initiative was lodged in ASPE, reflecting statements in the congressional  		committee report on the budget and in a letter from the Appropriations  		Committee as to the intent of Congress.</p>
<p>The Federal planning efforts culminated in the issuance in April 1980 of  		a request for proposals from States interested in operating a Channeling  		project. The States, a technical assistance contractor, and an evaluation  		contractor were selected in September 1980.</p>
<p>DHHS had overall responsibility for the demonstration. The technical  		assistance and evaluation contractors had demonstration-wide responsibilities  		carried out under DHHS' direction. The fact that these activities were all  		demonstration-wide was crucial to the establishment of uniform procedures  		across sites, the commitment of State and site staff to the evaluation  		objectives of the demonstration, and the faithfulness of program operators to  		the operational procedures imposed on them by the research requirements.</p>
<p>DHHS announced the selection of 12 States in September 1980: Florida,  		Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, New  		York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. (Hawaii and Missouri were later dropped  		for budgeting reasons from the group of research sites included in the national  		evaluation of Channeling, although they continued to operate their Channeling  		programs.)</p>
<h3>C. OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>Channeling was the provision of community-based long-term care services  		to people 65 and older who are functionally impaired and are unable to manage  		the essential activities of daily living (ADL) on their own, and who lack  		adequate informal supports. The core purposes of the Channeling demonstration  		were:</p>
<ul><li> To marshall and direct long-term care resources in a community in  		  ways that contain overall costs.</li>
<li> To increase access to a wider range of services than is currently  		  available.</li>
<li> To match services used to the identified needs of the client.</li>
<li> To concentrate public resources on those persons with the greatest  		  need for subsidized long-term care.</li>
<li> To stimulate the development of needed in-home and community  		  services which do not exist or are in short supply.</li>
<li> To reduce the unnecessary use of publicly-subsidized long-term care  		  services, including costly medical and institutional services.</li>
<li> To promote efficiency and quality in community long-term care  		  delivery systems.</li>
<li> To promote a reasonable division of labor between informal support  		  systems (including families, neighbors, and friends), privately financed  		  services and publicly-financed care.</li>
<li> To maintain or enhance client outcomes, including physical and  		  mental functioning and quality of life.</li>
</ul><p>Two models of Channeling were tested in the demonstration: a Basic Case  		Management Model and a Financial Control Model (or Complex Model). Although  		initial plans had called for a second round procurement to select the financial  		control model projects, Federal resource limitations ruled out this strategy.  		As a result, it became necessary to select from among the Channeling projects  		already chosen those that would implement the financial control model.</p>
<h3>D. DESCRIPTION OF CHANNELING MODELS</h3>
<p>The Basic Case Management Model superimposed a coordinating and  		accountability mechanism--case management--onto the present system of services  		and client eligibilities. It accepted the features of the present long-term  		care system as given and introduced a mechanism responsible for helping clients  		gain access to and coordinate the services they need to continue to live in the  		community. The Channeling organization assigned to each client a case manager,  		who performed a comprehensive assessment of service needs; developed a plan of  		care that responded to those needs; arranged for the provision of needed  		services, relying on family and friends where feasible; followed up to see that  		they are provided and monitored their provision on an ongoing basis; and  		reassessed needs periodically or when circumstances changed. Thus, the case  		manager was accountable for identifying the entire package of services needed  		by the client and served as a client advocate in negotiating the complex array  		of programs and service providers.</p>
<p>The Basic Case Management Model, therefore, tested the premise that the  		major difficulties in the current long-term care system are problems of  		information, access, and coordination, which can be essentially solved by  		client-centered case management.</p>
<p>The Financial Control Model (or Complex Model) modified the Basic Model  		to control costs and to strengthen the projects' ability to access needed  		services. Projects were provided with fixed budgets, set at 60 percent of the  		average Medicaid Skilled Nursing Facility/Intermediate Care Facility (SNF/ICF)  		rate in the catchment areas, designed to help gain control over rising costs  		and increased demand for long-term care services. Federal and State waivers  		provided reimbursement for a variety of services that offered clients and care  		planners the opportunity to design more appropriate and efficient care plans  		than is generally possible under the current fragmented system of categorical  		programs. Services for which coverage was extended included:</p>
<table><tr><td>Day Health and Rehabilitative Care</td>
<td>Day Maintenance Care</td>
</tr><tr><td>Home Health Aide Services</td>
<td>Homemaker/Personal Care Services</td>
</tr><tr><td>Housekeeping Services</td>
<td>Chore Services</td>
</tr><tr><td>Companion Service</td>
<td>Home Delivered Meals</td>
</tr><tr><td>Respite Care</td>
<td>Skilled Nursing</td>
</tr><tr><td>Physical Therapy</td>
<td>Speech Therapy</td>
</tr><tr><td>Occupational Therapy</td>
<td>Mental Health Services</td>
</tr><tr><td>Housing Assistance</td>
<td>Adult Foster Care</td>
</tr><tr><td>Non-routine Consumable Medical Supplies </td>
<td>Adaptive and Assistive Equipment</td>
</tr></table><p>These services were paid for from a pool of service dollars primarily  		comprising Medicare and Medicaid funds, made available through waivers of some  		requirements of those programs. Services reimbursed out of the services pool  		were not dependent on a client's eligibility for particular categorical  		programs. Case managers had the power to authorize the amount, duration, and  		scope of services paid for from the funding pool. This vested in the case  		manager the power to limit, alter, or terminate services in response to changes  		in client needs. The power to authorize community-based services, irrespective  		of funding source, enhanced the case manager's ability to obtain services and  		control the cost of care plans, making the case manager accountable for the  		full package of services funded. In addition, clients whose income was above a  		protected amount (200 percent of SSI, plus State supplement, plus food stamp  		bonus) were required to share in the cost of services for which they would be  		subject to an income test outside of Channeling.</p>
<h3>E. CORE FUNCTIONS</h3>
<p>Both the Basic and the Complex Model included the following core  		clinical functions.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Screen.</b> The process during which information was collected  			 and recorded on the screen instrument, and a preliminary determination made  			 whether an applicant was appropriate for the demonstration by comparing that  			 information to standard selection criteria. The information needed for this  			 comparison included age and nature of the applicant's problems, available  			 formal and informal supports, extent of unmet needs, the probable duration of  			 the needed care, and performance on ADL's (activities of daily living) and  			 IADL's (instrumental activities of daily living).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Assessment</b>. The collection of in-depth information about a  			 person's situation and functioning which allows identification of the person's  			 problems in the major functional areas, and permits the development of a plan  			 of care. The Baseline Assessment Instrument was used both for research and  			 clinical purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Care Planning</b>. The process of developing an agreement between  			 client and worker regarding client problems identified, outcomes to be  			 achieved, and services to be provided in support of goal achievement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Arranging for Services</b>. The process of negotiating with  			 service providers, including formal and informal resources, for the delivery of  			 needed services to the client in the manner described in the care  			 plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Follow-up and Monitoring</b>. The continuing contact the case  			 manager has with providers and clients to ensure that services are being  			 provided in accordance with the care plan and to ascertain whether these  			 services continue to meet the client's needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Reassessment</b>. The scheduled or event-precipitated  			 re-examination of the client's situation and functioning to identify changes  			 which occurred since the initial or most recent assessment and to measure  			 progress toward the desired outcomes outlined in the care plan.</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>F. CASE MANAGEMENT</h3>
<p>The case manager assessed need, developed a plan of care, coordinated  		and arranged for services, monitored services provision, reassessed need and  		revised care plan as the client's condition changed, and served as the client's  		advocate.</p>
<p>There were several factors involved in Channeling case management:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>The Population</b>. The clients were frail, vulnerable, severely  			 impaired, often isolated, in need of long-term care services for an extended  			 period of time, and in the absence of Channeling, were at high risk of being  			 institutionalized. More detailed information on the Channeling population is  			 attached in a series of tables (see below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cost Consciousness</b>. The case managers, usually social workers  			 and nurses, followed procedures that maintained awareness, and allowed control,  			 of the costs of services that comprised plans of care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Work with Informal Supports</b>. The case manager worked with the  			 family, family members, and other informal supports in order to arrange for  			 formal providers to augment what the informal support system was capable of  			 doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Health and Social Services</b>. The case manager attempted to  			 establish a new set of relationships between health and social service  			 providers to substitute services provided in the community--both formal and  			 informal--for institutional care, wherever community care is  			 appropriate.</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>G. PHASES OF THE DEMONSTRATION</h3>
<p>There were four major phases in the Channeling demonstration:  		demonstration planning, buildup, steady state, and demonstration closeout.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><b>Demonstration Planning Phase</b>. DHHS signed contracts with the  			 participating States in September 1980. The planning phase lasted from this  			 date until the local projects became operational. During this phase the sites  			 were selected, detailed administrative and operational procedures designed,  			 staff hired and trained, relationships with local providers and referral  			 sources established, Medicare and Medicaid waivers obtained, financial  			 arrangements for reimbursement of providers completed, data collection  			 instruments designed, and research procedures affecting the local projects  			 defined. The planning phase ended when local projects began accepting clients,  			 which occurred on a staggered basis between February and June 1982. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Buildup Phase</b>. The buildup phase was marked by intense  			 outreach and screening efforts to build project caseloads in order to achieve  			 both the planned research sample size and the planned scale of operations at  			 each site. There were two distinct time periods within this phase. The first,  			 the randomization period, generally started when projects began accepting  			 clients, and was the period during which applicants to Channeling were randomly  			 assigned to the treatment or control group.<sup><font><a href="chansum.htm#note1">1</a></font></sup> Randomization ended at a project when it  			 achieved its planned research sample; for all projects this occurred in  			 May-June 1983. The second, the residual buildup period, started at this point  			 and was the period during which the projects continued to add clients to their  			 caseload totals in order to meet the target caseload sizes established by DHHS  			 for their planned scales of operation. During the residual buildup period, the  			 projects adjusted their staffing patterns to accommodate the requirements of  			 the steady state phase. The buildup phase ended in September 1983.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Steady State Phase</b>. During the steady state phase, which  			 began in October 1983, the projects were required to maintain a steady caseload  			 size. As clients left the caseload because of death, institutionalization,  			 improvement in condition, and so on, new applicants were screened and accepted  			 to the caseload if eligible. This period most nearly resembled the operation of  			 an ongoing program. There was continual turnover in caseload composition, but  			 caseload and staff sizes were relatively stable. The steady state phase lasted  			 until June 1984.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Demonstration Closeout Phase</b>. During the demonstration  			 closeout phase the projects stopped accepting new clients and implemented their  			 plans for the closeout of the federally funded demonstration. The evaluation  			 data do not cover this phase. The nature of the phaseout activities varied  			 greatly from project to project: some went out of operation entirely, but most  			 continued in some fashion with different funding arrangements. This phase  			 extended from July 1984-March 1985, which was the end date of the States  			 contracts with DHHS. (Fiscal staff in financial control projects were continued  			 to June 1985 to close out their books for reimbursement of services.)</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>H. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CONTRACT</h3>
<p>The technical assistance contractor for the Channeling demonstration was  		Temple University. Major responsibilities included: training screeners,  		assessors and case managers; responding to the needs of the sites; maintaining  		the communication network; assisting the government on program issues; and  		conducting an exploratory study of care planning. A number of program-related  		materials were developed during the planning and implementation of Channeling.  		The DHHS contract with Temple University ran from September 30, 1980 through  		December 1985.</p>
<h3>I. THE EVALUATION</h3>
<p>Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (MPR), under contract to DHHS was  		responsible for evaluating the demonstration. This included the development of  		the research design, data collection instruments and procedures, the collection  		of the data and the performance of the analysis. MPR is an independent policy  		research and evaluation firm based in Plainsboro, New Jersey.</p>
<p>The evaluation employed a randomized experimental design to compare what  		happens under the demonstration with what would have happened in its absence.  		Applicants judged appropriate for the demonstration, based on a functional  		impairment screen, were randomly assigned to either a client or a control  		group. This permitted a direct comparison of the impact of the demonstration on  		participants with the outcomes of the control group members who received their  		services through the conventional delivery system. Participants in the  		research, both clients and controls, received comprehensive initial and  		follow-up interviews designed to gather data about their health, quality of  		life, use of formal and informal services, and expenditures for services.  		Additional information on costs and use of formal services were obtained from  		Medicare/Medicaid records and service provider interviews with informal  		caregivers. The evaluation also included an analysis of the actual  		implementation experience of the project, its relation to the existing service  		delivery system, its costs and its clientele. This analysis was based on  		interviews with key provider and project staff in the demonstration  		communities, as well as on data from the instruments used in the impact  		analysis, project reports, and existing public and project documentation.</p>
<p>All data collection activities involving information about individuals  		were reviewed and approved by MPR's Institutional Review Board established for  		protection of human subjects involved in research. All data about individuals  		remain confidential. Individuals who agreed to participate in the demonstration  		and research signed an informed consent, as well as releases for access to  		their records. Data collection forms and instruments were reviewed and approved  		by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, and they, along with the project's  		record-keeping system, have received clearance under the Federal Privacy Act.  		The DHHS contract with MPR, Inc. ran from September 30, 1980 through June 15,  		1986.</p>
<h3>J. MAJOR DATA COLLECTION ACTIVITIES</h3>
<ul><li> Screening data on all appropriate applicants.</li>
<li> Baseline and two six-month follow-ups on full sample of treatments  		  and controls. An 18 month follow-up on half the sample.</li>
<li> Medicaid and Medicare claims data on full sample.</li>
<li> Extracts from provider billing records of services utilized by a 20  		  percent subsample of treatments and controls.</li>
<li> Baseline validation interviews by MPR interviewers of about 400  		  treatment group members.</li>
<li> Check of death records for sample members who do not have a  		  completed follow-up interview.</li>
<li> Baseline and two six-month follow-up interviews with primary  		  informal caregivers for a subsample of late enrollees.</li>
<li> Process analysis interviews with staff of States, sites, Temple  		  University, and DHHS.</li>
<li> Channeling project cost and caseload reports.</li>
</ul><h3>K. MAJOR FINDINGS</h3>
<p>Major findings from the demonstration include the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The population served by Channeling was extremely frail, had low  			 incomes and reported many unmet needs. The average age was 80 years, the  			 average income was $542 a month and 84 percent were restricted in their ability  			 to perform ADL. The remainder, while having no ADL impairments, had multiple  			 impairments with respect to the IADL. A large majority of respondents (82.5  			 percent) reported their overall health as fair or poor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A high proportion of the Channeling sample was female (70.8  			 percent). Slightly more than 30 percent were married at the time of their  			 baseline interview. With respect to ethnicity, blacks constituted approximately  			 24 percent of the sample while Hispanics comprised approximately 4.5 percent.  			 Over one-third of the sample members (37 percent) lived alone and 47 percent  			 had been hospitalized in the two months prior to enrollment in  			 Channeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channeling's comprehensive case management services were implemented  			 largely according to plan for the treatment group, but a substantial minority  			 of the control group also received case management from other sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channeling substantially increased the receipt of formal community  			 services; this increase was particularly noteworthy in the Financial Control  			 Model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite the increase in case management and formal community  			 services, Channeling did not affect hospital use under either model. For  			 example, at the end of the twelfth month after the baseline interview, 3.6  			 percent of the treatment group and 4.1 percent of the control group in the  			 Basic Model were in a hospital. For the Financial Control Model, 6.2 percent of  			 the treatment group and 5.1 percent of the control group were in a hospital.  			 The treatment-control differences in all cases are not statistically  			 significant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channeling did not affect nursing home use under either model. At  			 the end of the twelfth month after baseline, 11.5 percent of the treatment  			 group and 12.6 percent of the control group in the Basic Model were in a  			 nursing home. For the Financial Control Model, 11.3 percent of the treatment  			 group and 13.5 percent of the control group were in a nursing home. There  			 differences are not statistically significant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channeling did not have a significant effect on the longevity of the  			 sample members under either model. The mortality rate for the sample was about  			 17 percent six months after random assignment, 27 percent after 12 months and  			 36 percent after 18 months. There were no statistically significant differences  			 observed between treatment group and control group members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no evidence that Channeling led to substitution of formal  			 for informal care in the Basic Case Management Model. There was evidence of  			 some substitution in the Financial Control Model. However, it resulted from  			 reductions in caregiving by some friends and neighbors rather than primary  			 caregivers such as spouses or daughters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channeling led to an increase in the total subsistence, medical and  			 long-term care costs per client over the 18 month observation period. The Basic  			 Case Management Model appeared to increase these costs by about $1500 per  			 client or approximately 8 percent above the $18,000 in costs that would be  			 expected without Channeling. In the Financial Control Model, the cost increase  			 was $3500 or 16 percent over the $23,000 that would otherwise be  			 expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public expenditures for subsistence, medical treatment and long-term  			 care services for the first 18 months after enrollment increased under both  			 models. In the Basic Model, government costs rose by 10 percent (approximately  			 $1900 per client) and in the Financial Control Model by 17 percent ($3900) per  			 client. These increases were due mostly to the costs of Channeling case  			 management and for the extra formal community services arranged by  			 Channeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channeling improved the well-being of caregivers by some measures,  			 especially in terms of satisfaction with care arrangements and overall life  			 satisfaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channeling reduced reported unmet needs, increased confidence in  			 receiving needed services and increased satisfaction with service arrangements  			 for clients. There were small but generally beneficial effects on social and  			 psychological well-being.</p>

<p><b><i><a name="Applebaum1" id="Applebaum1">An Analysis of</a> Site-Specific Results</i>,  		Robert A. Applebaum, Randall Brown and Peter Kemper, May 1986</b>. This report  		examines the site-specific impacts of the Channeling Demonstration in an effort  		to determine whether any one site or group of sites was more successful than  		others in achieving the objectives of the demonstration. Overall, the core case  		management functions were implemented consistently across the ten sites.  		Caseload sizes ranged from 36 per assessor/case manager in Baltimore to 54 in  		Houston. While there were site-specific differences in such areas as time  		elapsed from assessment to service initiation and overall service expenditures,  		no overall patterns are obvious. Similarly, the effects of environmental  		factors such as nursing home bed and hospital bed supply do not manifest  		patterns that appear to affect Channeling's impacts. There is little evidence  		that one site or group of sites was markedly more or less effective in  		achieving the objectives of the Channeling Demonstration. (NTIS Accession No.  		PB90-244930)</p>
<p><b><i><a name="Thornton1" id="Thornton1">Analysis of Channeling</a> Project Costs</i>,  		Craig Thornton, Joanna Will and Mark Davies, May 1986</b>. This report examines  		a small but key aspect of Channeling--the costs of operating the demonstration  		itself. The ten sites incurred costs of $23 million as they prepared for and  		later provided case management and long-term care services to clients between  		September 1980 and June 1984. In addition to the project costs, the States  		spent $2.8 million and the technical assistance contractor spent $1.6 million  		between September 1980 and June 1984. During the period studied, the Basic Case  		Management sites enrolled 3,300 clients; the Financial Control sites enrolled  		3,900 clients. Over 51,000 ongoing case-months of service were provided by the  		ten sites. These cost estimates correspond to the demonstration as fielded and  		therefore reflect the small scale extra administrative and research costs that  		are part of a demonstration. Based on the available literature, the estimated  		average costs for Channeling are comparable with those of other demonstrations.  		(NTIS Accession No. PB86-236742/AS)</p>
<p><b><i><a name="Thornton2" id="Thornton2">Analysis of the</a> Benefits and Costs of  		Channeling</i>, Craig Thornton and Shari Miller Dunstan, May 1986</b>. The  		principal finding of this report is that Channeling led to an increase in total  		costs for clients, including costs for medical and long-term care services and  		costs for shelter, food and other daily living expenses. The Basic Case  		Management Model appeared to increase these costs by about $1,300 during the 18  		month period of the demonstration; this represents an increase of approximately  		7 percent over the $18,500 per client costs expected in the absence of  		Channeling. For the Financial Control Model, costs per client increased by  		approximately $3,400 for the 18 month period or approximately 15 percent over  		the $23,000 expected in the absence of Channeling. In both models, these  		increased costs appeared to produce benefits in the form of reduced unmet  		client needs and increases in the reported levels of life satisfaction by  		clients. Primary caregivers also reported more satisfaction with their lives  		and with the care arrangements for clients. The underlying question is whether  		the largely intangible benefits of Channeling are worth the net costs of  		producing them. (NTIS Accession No. PB87-179016/AS)</p>
<p><b><i><a name="Kemper2" id="Kemper2">Channeling Effects for</a> an Early Sample at  		6-Month Follow-up</i>, Peter Kemper, Robert Applebaum, Randall S. Brown, George  		J. Carcagno, Jon B. Christianson, Thomas W. Grannemann, Margaret Harrigan,  		Nancy Holden, Barbara Phillips, Jennifer Schore, Craig Thornton and Judith  		Wooldridge, May 1985</b>. A preliminary analysis of interview data at 6-month  		follow-up for a sample of approximately 3,000 early enrollees in Channeling  		indicated the following. (1) The population served was old and frail. (2) The  		intervention was implemented largely according to design. (3) Substantially  		more of the treatment group received case management and formal services than  		did the control group. (4) Treatment-control differences were not statistically  		significant with respect to hospital use, nursing home use and mortality. (5)  		There were indications that Channeling improved the self-perceived well-being  		of treatment group members compared to controls. Channeling did not  		significantly reduce the amount and type of informal care provided. These  		findings are subject to modification based on analysis of the full research  		sample and additional data collection. (NTIS Accession No. PB86-219011/AS)</p>
<p><b><i><a name="Corson1" id="Corson1">Channeling Effects on</a> Formal Community-Based  		Services and Housing</i>, Walter Corson, Thomas Grannemann, Nancy Holden and  		Craig Thornton, May 1986</b>. Both the treatment group and control group  		members in the Channeling Demonstration used community services extensively.  		Channeling increased the use of services by the treatment group compared to the  		control group. The expectations at the outset of the demonstration were that  		such increases would be due to the fact that greater numbers of the elderly  		would remain in the community, as well as increased use of services by those  		already in the community. In reality, all the observed service-use increases  		were due to the latter effects, since no impact was observed on mortality or  		institutionalization. The largest increases in service use were observed for  		personal care and housekeeping services, which are the ones usually not covered  		by existing public programs or private insurance. There were increases in  		public and total costs. At the same time, there is evidence that in the  		Financial Control Model projects were able to use their purchasing power to  		reduce the per-unit costs of some services. (NTIS Accession No.  		PB86-236593/AS)</p>
<p><b><i><a name="Wooldridge1" id="Wooldridge1">Channeling Effects on</a> Hospital, Nursing  		Home and Other Medical Services</i>, Judith Wooldridge and Jennifer Schore, May  		1986</b>. The impacts of the Channeling demonstration on hospital, nursing home  		and other medical service use as well as mortality can be summarized as  		follows. Channeling had no impact on mortality; death rates for the treatment  		and control groups were very high but not statistically significant. The  		population served was not at high risk of institutionalization. Private persons  		and Medicaid were the major payers for nursing home care. Nursing home use and  		expenditures were lower for the treatment group and the control group but the  		differences were not large and generally not statistically significant.  		Reductions in nursing home use in the Basic Model were concentrated in one  		site, viz., Southern Maine. Channeling reduced nursing home use for persons in  		a nursing home at the time of their screen for Channeling eligibility. Control  		group hospital use and expenditures were very high, although they fell over  		time. The control group exhibited a high use of and expenditures on other  		medical services. Channeling had no impact on the use of or expenditures on  		hospital, physician and other medical services. (NTIS Accession No.  		PB86-234341/AS)</p>
<p><b><i><a name="Christianson1" id="Christianson1">Channeling Effects on</a> Informal  		Care</i>, Jon B. Christianson, May 1986</b>. Channeling was expected to  		increase the use of formal community-based care by the frail elderly. However,  		if this led to substitution of formal for informal care, the public sector  		would then be paying for services otherwise provided by family and friends.  		There was no evidence that such substitution occurred in the Basic Case  		Management Model. In the Financial Control Model, Channeling did lead to modest  		substitution of certain services, but there is no evidence of widespread  		substitution. Nor is there evidence of reductions in informal care by primary  		caregivers. The effect appears to be due to withdrawal by some friends and  		neighbors. Additionally, Channeling improved the well-being of primary  		caregivers by some measures, such as reducing caregiver worry about receiving  		sufficient help and increasing overall life satisfaction. This report also has  		an available Appendices. (NTIS Accession No. PB86-240033/AS)</p>
<p><b><i><a name="Applebaum2" id="Applebaum2">Channeling Effects on</a> the Quality of  		Clients' Lives</i>, Robert A. Applebaum and Margaret Harrigan, April 1986</b>.  		This report presents the impact of the Channeling demonstration on the quality  		of clients' lives. Channeling was expected to affect life quality through two  		mechanisms: (1) the provision of case management and expanded services to  		people who would have stayed in the community even without Channeling and (2)  		reduced institutionalization. Even though Channeling had no significant impact  		on institutionalization rates, the results generally bear out these  		expectations. For both the basic case management model and the financial  		control model at 6 and 12 months, treatment group members reported more  		satisfaction with service arrangements, more confidence about receiving needed  		services and fewer unmet needs than did the control group. There were no  		substantial differences between the two Channeling models on these dimensions.  		(NTIS Accession No. PB86-218690/AS)</p>

In general there was  		substantial uniformity of Channeling impacts within the research sample.  		Differential impacts, where they existed, occurred primarily for nursing home  		use and expenditure variables. Both the Basic Case Management Model and the  		Financial Control Model showed reduced nursing home use and/or cost for the  		small fraction of the sample residing in a nursing home when screened into the  		program. The Financial Control Model also reduced nursing home use for those on  		a nursing home waitlist at screen, though this effect appears to be confined to  		persons not eligible for Medicaid. The cost savings from reduced nursing home  		use appeared to accrue primarily to private payers rather than to the Medicare  		and Medicaid programs. (NTIS Accession No. PB86-243532/AS)</p>

Although  		there is strong evidence that there were no true treatment/control differences  		at randomization due to chance (based on analysis of screening data), a  		substantial number of large and statistically significant differences emerged  		between the two groups on baseline variables. It was concluded that  		differential measurement largely accounted for these differences. In the  		regression analysis, for non-comparable baseline variables with screen  		counterparts, the screen version was used as a control variable. Other  		non-comparable baseline variables (without a screen counterpart) were excluded  		from the set of control variables with the exception of hospital and nursing  		home days, which are replaced with information from the screen on whether the  		sample member was in a hospital or nursing home at screen or referred to  		Channeling by hospital or nursing home staff.

This report results from an investigation of the extent to which differential  		attrition from the research sample in the Channeling demonstration might have  		led to biased estimates of program impact.

This report makes use of baseline data on informal caregivers to explore  		several issues central to informal caregiving, including the composition of the  		informal care network, the types and level of care provided by that network,  		financial assistance provided by informal caregivers, and their well-being.

The caregivers were in most cases the wives, daughters or daughters-in-law of  		the elderly recipients of care. One-third were active in the labor market,  		mostly full time; almost 40 percent were 65 years or older. Primary caregivers  		averaged almost 6 hours per day on care-related activities.

<p><b><i><a name="Brown4" id="Brown4">The Effects of</a> Case Management and Community  		Services on the Impaired Elderly</i>, Randall Brown and Barbara Phillips,  		February 1986</b>. The evaluation of the National Long-Term Care Channeling  		Demonstration featured a randomized design in which applicants to the program  		were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which had the opportunity  		to receive Channeling services, and the control group, which was barred from  		participation. Both groups were interviewed at baseline, 6-months, 12-months  		and--for half the sample--18-months. Under this arrangement, some treatment  		group members could refuse Channeling case management and services, while some  		control group members might obtain similar services elsewhere in the community.  		This report bases its analysis not on treatment/control differences but on  		differences between those who received case management and those who did not  		(regardless of whether they were in the treatment or control group). Because of  		methodological problems, it is not possible to determine unambiguously whether  		case management and formal community services affect nursing home use or other  		outcomes.

The  		National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration was designed as a rigorous  		test of comprehensive case management of community care as a way of containing  		long-term care costs while providing adequate care to those in need. A  		randomized experimental design was employed to evaluate the demonstration. Two  		models of Channeling were tested: (a) Basic Case Management Model (five sites),  		and (b) Financial Control Model (five sites). Channeling enrolled an extremely  		frail elderly group whose average age was 80 years. The intervention was  		implemented largely according to plan. Channeling increased formal community  		service use. It had no significant effect on nursing home use, hospitalization  		or mortality. Channeling led to reduced unmet needs, increased client  		confidence in receipt of care and increased life satisfaction. Neither model  		had a major effect on the proportion of informal caregivers giving care;  		however, Channeling increased informal caregivers' satisfaction with service  		arrangements and satisfaction with life. Overall, the evidence indicates that  		the expansion of case management and community services beyond what exists does  		not lead to cost savings. But it does yield benefits in the form of increased  		home care, reduced unmet need and greater life satisfaction for clients and  		their informal caregivers who bear most of the care burden.

The documents  		includes model agreements. (NTIS Accession No. PB86-244779/AS)</p>
<p><b><i><a name="Temple1" id="Temple1">Applicant Screen Set</a></i>, 1982</b>. This set  		contains the standardized instrument that was used to screen applicants to the  		Channeling project according to specific criteria thought to contribute to  		being "at-risk" of institutionalization. The screen was usually conducted over  		the telephone with the person referring the applicant. Completion of the screen  		over the phone generally took from 15-25 minutes. Some screens were done  		in-person when the respondents could not use the telephone. Included in this  		document are the <i><b>National Long-Term Care Demonstration Applicant  		Screening Instrument Training Manual</b></i> and <b><i>Screening Training for  		Screeners: A Trainer's Guide</i></b>.

This problem-specific  		approach describes various circumstances likely to be encountered among frail  		elderly persons in the community. Each problem area includes a comprehensive  		list of items that should be considered by a case manager. Model care plans are  		also included. This document can be used for training case managers in the  		specifics of effective assessment and case management. (NTIS Accession No.  		PB87-141073/AS)</p>
<p><b><i><a name="Temple2" id="Temple2">Assessment Training for</a> Case Managers: A  		Trainer's Guide</i>, 1985</b>. The is guide provides trainers with materials  		for a three-day training program on use of the National Long-Term Care  		Demonstration Clinical Baseline Assessment Instrument (C-BAI) utilizing a  		case-study method designed to give workers experimental training in the  		techniques of effective assessment. The <b><i>Clinical Baseline Assessment  		Instrument Set</i></b>, consisting of blank forms and the Training Manual  		designed for individual workers is included (the C-BAI Set is also available  		separately).

<p><b><i><a name="Temple3" id="Temple3">Case Management Forms</a> Set</i>, 1985</b>.  		This set of materials includes the care plan and reassessment forms and  		guidelines for their use. These should be useful to persons actually engaged in  		case management as well as their trainers. The care plan is organized to  		describe problems, outcome measures, types of help needed and informal/formal  		service providers. Reassessment in channeling was done every six months or when  		an event triggered a need for re-evaluation of the care plan. The reassessment  		form, organized for easy clinical use, is significantly shorter than the  		clinical baseline assessment instrument. (NTIS Accession No.  		PB86-236106/AS)</p>
<p><b><i><a name="Temple4" id="Temple4">Case Management Training</a> for Case Managers:  		A Trainer's Guide</i>, Linda M. Sterthous, 1985</b>. Case management involves  		working with a client and family to agree upon problems, goals, and services  		necessary to support the client in the community. Data collected from an  		assessment is used to develop a care plan. Case management includes arranging  		services, monitoring the client's situation on an ongoing basis and adjusting  		the service package as needed. This guide presents an outline and course  		content for a three-day training program in case management utilizing the  		tools, documents and techniques developed for the channeling demonstration. The  		course utilizes a case study method designed to give workers experimental  		training in the techniques of case management.

<p><b><i><a name="Temple5" id="Temple5">Clinical Baseline Assessment</a> Instrument  		Set</i>, Temple University, 1983</b>. The National Long-Term Care Demonstration  		Clinical Baseline Assessment Instrument (C-BAI) is a modification of the  		original clinical and research baseline assessment instrument used in the  		demonstration. The instrument was used to conduct face-to-face interviews of  		elderly clients who wanted to remain in their own homes. Assessment interviews  		usually took 1-1½ hours to complete. Two versions of the form were used:  		one for clients being interviewed in their community residence and one for  		clients being interviewed in an institution. This set includes both  		institutional and community versions of the instrument and a training manual  		designed to introduce workers to the instrument. (NTIS Accession No.  		PB86-241114/AS)</p>
<p><b><i><a name="Temple6" id="Temple6">Community Services and</a> Long-Term Care:  		Issues of Negligence and Liability</i>, Elias S. Cohen and Linda S. Sterthous,  		1982</b>. Agencies operating under the National Long-Term Care Channeling  		Demonstration program had complex assignments to assess the needs of older  		people requiring long-term care, to determine what services met such needs and  		to arrange for the delivery of services. Responsibility for a client was spread  		across several agencies, organizations, and individuals. This paper examines  		the liability, and avoiding or minimizing risks of negligence. (NTIS Accession  		No. PB86-244753/AS)</p>
<p><b><i><a name="Sterthous1" id="Sterthous1">Informal Services and</a> Supports</i>, Linda  		M. Sterthous, 1985</b>. This is a collection of practice-oriented papers  		dealing with the various ways in which informal services and supports were  		encouraged and utilized in channeling. Written primarily by case managers and  		supervisors from the channeling sites, topics range from the development of  		family support groups to the development of a volunteer network. An extensive  		bibliography on informal supports is included. (NTIS Accession No.  		PB86-244233/AS)</p>
<p><b><i><a name="Temple7" id="Temple7">Screening Training for</a> Screeners: A  		Trainer's Guide</i>, 1985</b>. A standardized instrument was used to screen  		applicants to the National Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration according to  		specific criteria thought to contribute to being "at-risk" of  		institutionalization. The screen was usually conducted over the telephone  		beginning with the person referring the applicant. Completion of the screen  		generally took 15-25 minutes. This trainer's guide contains all the materials  		needed to train staff members of a long-term care program to conduct the  		screening process using the Channeling Applicant Screen. Included is a detailed  		lesson plan for a two-day training program, lecture notes, handouts, scripts  		and the <b><i>Applicant Screen Set</i></b> (1982), which contains blank forms  		and the manual for screeners (screen set available separately).

<p><b><i><a name="Temple8" id="Temple8">The Channeling Case</a> Management Manual</i>,  		1986</b>. Case management is the process of integrating and synthesizing  		information from an assessment into a care plan. It involves working with a  		client and family to agree upon problems, goals, and services necessary to  		support the client in the community. Case management also includes arranging  		for services, monitoring the client's situation on an ongoing basis, and  		adjusting the service package as needed. This manual contains an overview of  		the core functions of the channeling program and the role of the case manager  		and describes support functions such as record keeping. It is a basic primer  		covering the principles of good practice for case managers. (NTIS Accession No.  		PB86-229093/AS)</p>
<p><b><i><a name="Grannemann3" id="Grannemann3">The Channeling Financial</a> Control  		System</i>, Marilyn Grannemann, 1985</b>. The ten sites of the National  		Long-Term Care Channeling Demonstration provided case management to very  		impaired elderly clients who wished to remain in the community. Five of the  		sites that developed the financial control model could pay for services from a  		pool of waiver dollars and state and local funds. This report describes the  		computerized and manual cost control system that was used by the five financial  		control model sites to keep service expenditures for clients below a  		pre-determined level or "cap." The system's strengths and weaknesses are  		described and recommendations are included. (NTIS Accession No.  		PB86-240041/AS)</p>
