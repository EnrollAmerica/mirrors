<p>States which endeavor to cut their Medicaid outlays by more effectively  		targeting home care services to individuals at high risk of becomming long-term  		nursing homes residents find a critical need for effective models to predict  		institutional residency.</p>
<p>Given a variety of Medicaid and Medicare policy changes since the  		mid-1970s, we hypothesized that some risk factors for nursing home residency  		might have changed. Using two national cohorts of institutionalized and  		noninstitutionalized aged, we estimated weighted logistic regression models to  		identify individual factors which differentiated nursing home residents from  		the noninstitutionalized elderly in 1985 compared to 1977.</p>
<p>To test whether state sociodemographic and Medicaid policy variables  		differentially affected statewide nursing home use rates between 1986 and 1976,  		we estimated a multiple regression paired comparison model. We also estimated a  		two stage weighted least squares regression model of state-to-state nursing  		home use rate variation for 1986.</p>
<p>Results showed considerable resilency across the two study years in  		individual indicators of need, including dependency in activities of daily  		living, mental disorders, lack of social support, poverty age and race. Prior  		nursing home use and Alzheimer's disease newly evaluated in the 1985 model  		proved to be important additions to the model. Dignoses, other than specific  		mental illnesses, ceased to be important predictors of nursing home  		residency.</p>
<p>State-level analysis of the change in nursing home use rates detected no  		differences in the predictors between the two study years. Variation in use in  		1955 was positively associated with the supply of nursing home beds, the  		percent of the state's population that was aged 85 and over, and broader and  		more generous Medicaid coverage policies. Use declined as the state's total  		population and its population aged 65 and over increased, and as the average  		price of nursing home care increased.</p>
<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>Targeting home and community care services to applicants at high risk of  		nursing home entry is an essential requirement for cost effectiveness of home  		care (Weissert and Cready, 1989) and is required of states in providing  		services under the Medicaid Home and Community Care Act (Title XIX, Section  		1915 [c][1] of the Social Security Act. For states trying to use their nursing  		home pre-admission screening programs and similar assessment opportunities to  		accomplish such targeting, valid algorithms for predicting institutionalization  		are essential.</p>
<p>While there is considerable agreement in previous research on the  		important variables to include in such preadmission screening instruments, the  		continued importance of these predictors has not been tested in nationally  		representative data collected after the introduction of a large number of  		Medicaid and Medicare policy changes which were implemented during the late 70s  		and early 80s.</p>
<p>This analysis compares predictors of institutional residency in 1977 and  		1985 among two national cohorts of individuals who responded to national  		surveys of nursing home and community-dwelling elderly persons. A state-level  		analysis of change in predictors of state nursing home use rates for 1976 and  		1986 was also conducted using aggregate state sociodemographic and Medicaid  		policy variables. Finally, a model was estimated to predict state-to-state  		variation in nursing home use in 1986.</p>
<h2><a name="previous" id="previous">PREVIOUS RESEARCH</a></h2>
<p>Over the past two decades factors associated with institutionalization  		have been the subject of numerous multivariate research efforts. Some have been  		cross-sectional in design, comparing noninstitutionalized and institutionalized  		elderly at a particular time. Others have used longitudinal designs, and  		therefore are able to assess, assuming appropriate theoretical underpinnings,  		which factors cause nursing home institutionalization. The overriding concern  		with all of these studies is what characteristics put a person at high risk for  		institutionalization.</p>
<p>Nursing home residency has been found to be positively associated with  		advanced age (Chiswick, 1976; Vicente, Wiley and Carrington, 1979; McCoy and  		Edwards, 1981; Branch and Jette, 1982; Brock and O'Sullivan, 1985; Shapiro and  		Tate, 1985; Cohen, Tell and Wallack, 1986; Weissert and Cready, 1989), being  		female (Greenberg and Ginn, 1979; Shapiro and Tate, 1985), and being white  		(Palmore, 1976; McCoy and Edwards, 1981; Weissert and Cready, 1989). However,  		many have found no relationship between gender and institutional residency  		(Vicente, Wiley and Carrington, 1979; McCoy and Edwards, 1981; Branch and  		Jette, 1982; Cohen, Tell and Wallack, 1986 and Weissert and Cready, 1989).</p>
<p>Institutional residency also has been found to vary positively with  		income (Chiswick, 1976; and Greenberg and Ginn, 1979) and with receipt of  		public assistance (Cohen, Tell and Wallack, 1986; Weissert and Cready,  		1989).</p>
<p>Availability of social support, variously measured, has been shown to be  		negatively correlated with nursing home use. Currently, single (e.g. widowed)  		elderly are more likely to reside in a nursing home (Greenberg and Ginn, 1979;  		Vincente, Wiley and Carrington, 1979; Cohen, Tell, and Wallack, 1985; and  		Weissert and Cready, 1989), as are those living alone (Vincente, Wiley, and  		Carrington, 1979; McCoy and Edwards, 1981; and Branch and Jette, 1982), living  		without a spouse (Shapiro and Tate, 1985), living with a nonrelative (McCoy and  		Edwards, 1981) or living in senior housing (Shapiro and Tate, 1985). Likewise,  		lacking a social support network (Brock and O'Sullivan, 1985), or having few  		social contacts (McCoy and Edwards, 1981 and Shapiro and Tate, 1985) have been  		shown to be positively associated with institutionalization.</p>
<p>Various health related conditions have also been shown to be related to  		institutionalization. These include mental impairment (Branch and Jette, 1982;  		Shapiro and Tate, 1985; Weissert and Cready, 1989), physical functioning  		dependency (Greenberg and Ginn, 1979; McCoy and Edwards, 1981; Branch and  		Jette, 1982; Shapiro and Tate, 1985; Cohen, Tell and Wallack, 1986; Weissert  		and Cready, 1989), and certain diagnoses, such as cancer, stroke and diseases  		of the nervous system (Greenberg and Ginn, 1979; Weissert and Cready, 1989).  		Attitudinal factors have also been shown to play a role. Perceived poor health  		status has been positively associated with institutional residency (Evashwich  		et al, 1984; Shapiro and Tate, 1985; Cohen, Tell, and Wallack, 1986), as has  		favorable attitudes towards nursing home placement (Greenberg and Ginn,  		1979).</p>
<p>Other patient level factors associated with institutionalization include  		being in a hospital (McCoy and Edwards 1981; and Shapiro and Tate, 1985), not  		seeing a physician regularly (Evaswhick, et al., 1984), having few formal  		service contacts (Branch and Jette, 1982), and taking medications (Greenberg  		and Ginn, 1979).</p>
<p>In addition to individual characteristics, community characteristics or  		contextual variables also have been shown to significantly affect nursing home  		use. These include region of residency (McCoy and Edwards, 1981), although  		Cohen, Tell, and Wallack (1986) found no regional effect, and the availability  		of nursing home beds (which varies by region), which has been found to  		positively affect nursing home use (Scanlon, 1980; McCoy and Edwards, 1981; and  		Weissert and Cready, 1989).</p>
<p>Findings on the effect of the level of urbanization have been mixed.  		Some (Chiswick, 1976; McCoy and Edwards, 1981; and Shapiro and Tate, 1985) have  		found no significant difference in nursing home use rates by urbanicity, while  		others (Dunlop, 1976; and Scanlon, 1980) have found a positive  		relationship.</p>
<p>The percentage of households residing in poverty has been found to  		negatively affect rates of institutionalization (Scanlon, 1980; and McCoy and  		Edwards, 1981), while income has been found to positively affect rates  		(Scanlon, 1980; and McCoy and Edwards, 1981). Finally, private pay price has  		been found to vary inversely with rates of nursing home use (Scanlon,  		1980).</p>
<p>Thus, despite varying methods and data sources, the results of research  		conducted on data from the late 1970s have shown considerable agreement  		regarding what factors place an individual at risk of nursing home residency.  		Drawing from these previous works, a model of nursing home residency can be  		conceptualized as follows:</p>
<p><b>Institutionalization = f[Sociodemographic Characteristics</b> (e.g.,  		age, sex, race, income, etc.), <b>Social Support</b> (e.g., living arrangement,  		marital status, etc.), <b>Functional Status</b> (e.g., activities of daily  		living dependencies, mobility dependencies, etc.), <b>Mental Impairments and  		Diagnoses</b> (e.g., cancer, nervous system disorder, etc.), <b>Prior Health  		Care Use</b> (e.g., recent hospitalization, previous nursing home admission,  		etc.), <b>Perceptions/Attitudes</b> (e.g., perceived health status, attitude  		towards nursing home placement, etc.), and <b>Community Characteristics</b>  		(e.g., region, supply of beds, etc.)].</p>
<p>Because data limitations precluded us from estimating one model which  		contained both individual characteristics and contextual factors, we developed  		both an individual- and a state-level model. Each is described in detail  		below.</p>
<h2><a name="data" id="data">DATA SOURCES AND METHODOLOGY</a></h2>
<p>For the 1985 individual-level analysis data were drawn from two national  		surveys: the 1984 National Health Interview's supplement on Aging (SOA) (which  		we aged as described below) and the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey. The 1977  		analysis, used the 1977 National Nursing Home Survey merged with the 1977  		Health Interview Survey.</p>
<p>For the state-level analysis data were drawn from a variety of sources:  		the 1986 Area Resource File System (ARF); the 1984 Medicaid 2082 data set; 1976  		and 1986 Medicare Enrollment Statistics; 1980 and 1989 <b>Statistical Abstract  		of the United States</b>; 1984 and 1986 <b>Analysis of State Medicaid Program  		Characteristics</b>; and the 1986 Inventory of Long Term Care Places.</p>
<p>The 1984 SOA, based on a multistage area probability sample, provides  		self-reported characteristics (such as conditions and impairments, and  		functional abilities) for 11,497 civilian noninstitutionalized people aged 65  		and over. A more detailed description of the survey is provided by Fitti and  		Kovar (1987).</p>
<p>The 1985 NNHS is a stratified two-stage probability sample of nursing  		and related care homes, their residents and their staff, which contains  		sociodemographic, diagnostic, and functional status data for 5,243 current  		nursing home residents. Data were obtained via interviews with staff most  		familiar with the resident's medical record, and supplemented with phone  		interviews with the resident's family members. A more detailed description is  		provided by Hing (1987).</p>
<p>For the state-level analysis data were drawn from the 1986 Area Resource  		File System (ARF) and the 1986 Inventory of Long Term Care Places, as well as a  		variety of government publications. The ARF is a county-specific data base  		containing more than 7,000 variables concerning a wide range of social,  		economic, and health resource characteristics, and is described in detail  		elsewhere (Area Resource File, 1987).</p>
<p>Medicaid 2082 data sets contain annually compiled state-level data  		pertaining to Amount of Medicaid spending and number of recipients. The data  		are categorized by eligibility and service type. </p>
<p>The 1986 Inventory of Long Term Care Places (U.S. Department of Health  		Services, 1987a) was designed to provide a current sampling frame for nursing  		and related-care homes (and facilities for the mentally retarded) for the 1987  		National Expenditure Survey, and therefore provides a comprehensive listing of  		nursing homes in the United States. It is also described in detail elsewhere  		(National Center for Health Statistics, 1987).</p>
<p>Medicare Enrollment Statistics were used as estimates of the elderly  		population. Enrollment data by age, sex, and race for each state and county in  		the United States are available from the Bureau of Data Management and Strategy  		at the Health Care Financing Administration (Medicare Enrollment Statistics,  		1985).</p>
<p>Data were also compiled from <b>Statistical Abstracts of the United  		States</b> (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1982; 1987), and 1984 and 1986  		<b>Analysis of State Medicaid Program Characteristics</b> (U.S. Department of  		Health and Human Services, 1985; 1987b).</p>
<h2><a name="indiviual" id="indiviual">INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL ANALYSIS</a></h2>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>Two national cohorts of institutionalized and noninstitutionalized aged  		were used for the individual level analyses. Analysis on the 1977 cohort was  		previously conducted and is described in detail elsewhere (Weissert and Cready,  		1989).</p>
<p>For the later year anlysis the 1984 SOA and the 1985 NNHS were used to  		develop a weighted-logistic regression model to estimate the likelihood of  		institutional residency--that is being a resident of an institution at a given  		point in time, not of being admitted to an institution. Because data relate to  		a cross sectional sample of nursing home residents, they are more reflective of  		long-term stayers in nursing homes than short-term stayers. This is so, because  		while turnover rates tend to be high in nursing homes, the proportion of long  		stayers in a home at any given time greatly exceeds the proportion of short  		stayers (Keeler, Kane, and Solomon, 1981; and Lui and Manton, 1984). For the  		purposes of identifying characteristics of individuals who actually become  		nursing home residents and consume most nursing home resources, this type of  		sample is greatly superior to an admission cohort, which is dominated by short  		stay patients.</p>
<p>To conduct the analysis the SOA and the NNHS were concatenated. Because  		both surveys were designed to be representative samples of their corresponding  		populations, it was possible to devise a weighting strategy allowing for  		estimation which is representative of the nation (exclusive of Hawaii and  		Alaska).</p>
<p>The strategy bad to account for three factors. First, because the two  		surveys were collected at different sampling rates, the weights had to account  		for the "oversampling" of nursing home residents relative to their presence in  		the population. Additionally, the complex nature of the survey design on both  		data sets and the inconsistency in survey years between the two data sets had  		to be taken into account. To account for these three factors we developed three  		weighting procedures and a population inflation factor.</p>
<p>The first procedure normalizes the provided survey weight variable  		separately within each of the two data sets (the NNHS and the SOA) to sum to  		the actual sample size of each data set. Under such a weighting procedure  		appropriate coefficient estimates are produced for all parameters of interest  		except the intercept, and standard errors produced are equivalent to those  		produced with simple random sampling.</p>
<p>The second procedure has two parts. The first part normalizes the  		provided survey weight variable for the NNHS to sum to the actual sample size  		for the NNHS. The second part accounts for the oversampling of the nursing home  		population by multiplying the SOA weight from part one by the ratio of the true  		size of the nursing home sample to the size of the nursing home sample  		population. The parameter estimates produced with this procedure are equivalent  		to those produced under the first procedure, except for the intercept which is  		now correct.</p>
<p>The problem is that to account for the "oversampling" of the nursing  		home population the noninstitutionalized population is inflated, thus producing  		overstated significance levels and standard errors somewhat smaller than are  		appropriate. However, more appropriate standard errors can be calculated by  		multiplying the standard errors produced under this second procedure by an  		inflation factor composed of the median ratio of the standard errors produced  		under the first procedure to those produced under this procedure.</p>
<p>The third procedure accounts for the complex nature of the survey  		resign. The inflated standard error--produced from calculations combining the  		first and second procedure as described above--is adjusted relative to the mean  		square error (MSE) from a SAS supported procedure called RTILOGIT (Shah et al.,  		1984). This procedure uses the primary sampling unit and strata to account for  		the complex nature of the sampling design. (While the primary sampling unit was  		avaiable on both the public. use tapes, and the stratum was available on the  		SOA, we were forced to construst the strata for the NNHS.)</p>
<p>In summary, by adjusting standard errors produced under the second  		procedure by the inflation factor (median ratio of the standard errors produced  		under the first procedure to those produced under the second procedure), and by  		the ratio of the MSE from RTILOGIT relative to the second procedure, results  		which are compatible with the structure of the two samples are obtained.</p>
<p>Finally, because of the inconsistency in years between the SOA (1984)  		and the NNHS (1985) a population inflation factor was needed for the SOA. The  		purpose of the population inflation factor is to adjust the weights for the  		1984 SOA data, making the weighted data set representative of the 1985  		noninstitutionalized elderly population, and thus compatible with the 1985  		NNHS.</p>
<p>Two data sets were used to construct the inflation factor: the 1984 SOA  		and the 1985 Health Interview Survey (National Center for Health Statistics,  		1986). Comparing population estimates produced on the two allows for  		calculation of the rate of change in the noninstitutionalized population  		between 1984 and 1985. Growth rates were compared by age, sex, race, and region  		by fitting a logistic regression model that included age, sex, race, and region  		to a binary dependent variable indicating from which survey an individual came  		(see <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>).</p>
<p>Results showed that rates of growth did not vary significantly by age,  		sex, race, or region, thus indicating that a single inflation factor (1.0231)  		could be used to reweight the 1984 SOA. After reweighting, the SOA was merged  		with the NNHS. It was this merged data set on which the later year  		individual-level analysis was conducted. The SAS procedure PROC LOGIT (SAS  		Institute Inc., 1985) was used in combination with the three weighting  		procedures as described above to develop the logistic regression model.</p>
<p>Combined, the data sets represent substantially the entire aged  		population in the coterminous United States, excluding persons who reside in  		long-term institutional facilities other than nursing homes. (Predominant among  		these would be mental institutions and board and care homes.) Thus, results are  		in general representative of the national elderly population. </p>
<h3>Variable Definitions</h3>
<p>The dependent variable for the analysis, residency status, was coded '1'  		for nursing home residents and '0' for SOA respondents. Merger of the two data  		sets required construction of a single set of comparable variables. While  		identical variable definitions were available on both data sets for the  		majority of explanatory variables, in a few instances comparable constructs had  		to be developed.</p>
<p><b>Sociodemographics, Prior Nursing Home Use, and Geographic  		Residency</b>. With minimal recoding age, gender, race, marital status, having  		living children, having previously resided in a nursing home, residence in a  		metropolitan area, and residence in the midwest were identically available on  		both data sets. Age was coded as a continuous variable that reflected age at  		interview and ranged from 65 to 108. The others were each coded as dichotomous  		variables with males, whites, those not currently married, those having living  		children, those having previously resided in a nursing home, those residing in  		a metropolitan area, and those residing in the Midwest coded 1; others were  		coded 0.</p>
<p><b>Functional Dependency</b>. Dependency in activities of daily living  		was also available on both data sets. Dichotomous variables were created for  		each of six activities of daily living (ADLs): bathing, dressing, toileting,  		continence, transferring, and eating. Bathing and transferring were coded 1 if  		the respondent currently received human assistance in performing the activity,  		and 0 otherwise. Dressing, toileting, and eating were coded 1 if the respondent  		currently received human assistance in performing the activity or did not  		engage in the activity, and 0 otherwise. Last, a dichotomous variable was  		created for incontinence status. If the respondent received human assistance  		with a device (such as a catheter or ostomy), or was bowel or bladder  		incontinent once a week or more, the incontinent variable was coded 1;  		otherwise it was coded 0.</p>
<p>In addition to these six dichotomous variables four dependency recodes  		were constructed for use in the analysis. The first was a count of how many  		activities in which the respondent was dependent (coded 0 to 6). The second was  		a dichotomous variable reflecting whether or not the respondent was dependent  		in any of five (bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, or eating)  		activities (coded 1 if dependent in any of the five; 0 otherwise).</p>
<p>Finally individuals were classified by their most severe functional  		dependency into one of two mutually exclusive groups. In order of severity the  		groups were: (1) receives human assistance toileting or eating, or both and (2)  		receives human assistance bathing or dressing, or both, but does not receive  		human assistance toileting or eating. Each of the two variables was coded 1 to  		reflect dependency, and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>An additional third level, mobility dependency, was added to the  		severity pair. Individuals who were neither toileting or eating dependent, nor  		bathing or dressing dependent were coded 1 if they received human assistance in  		walking or transferring, or if they were bedfast or chairfast; otherwise they  		were coded 0.</p>
<p>In addition a separate variable, regardless of other functional  		dependencies, indicating whether or not the individual was bedfast or chairfast  		was constructed. For respondents from both the NNHS and the SOA individuals  		were coded 1 if they were bedfast or chairfast, or both, and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p><b>Poverty Status</b>. Poverty, also a dichotomous variable, was coded 1  		for those determined to be living in poverty, and 0 for all others. However,  		for this variable identical constructs were not available on both data  		sets.</p>
<p>For respondents to the SOA residing in poverty was defined by a poverty  		index which was available on the public use data set. The index is based on  		family size, number of children under 18 years of age and family income using  		1983 poverty levels published by the Census Bureau in August of 1984. For  		several respondents this item was missing. Therefore, for any respondent for  		which the poverty index was missing, but for whom household size was known and  		household income was known to be greater than or equal to $20,000 the poverty  		variable also was coded 0. This was a justifiable imputation, because cross  		tabulations of $20,000 income indicator variable and the household size  		variable indicated that each of the respondents with household income greater  		than or equal to $20,000 fell well above 1983 federal poverty levels given  		household size (U.S. Census Bureau, 1987).</p>
<p>For respondents to the NNHS no direct measure of income was available.  		Instead individuals were classified as living in poverty if any of their  		charges during their month of admission were paid by Medicaid, other state  		funded indigent care, other government assistance (excluding Medicare) or  		welfare, or if the payment source was undetermined.</p>
<p>The lack of comparability for the poverty status variable as defined on  		both data sets is unavoidable. Persons supported by Medicaid or other  		government assistance or welfare can, and perhaps often do, have incomes above  		the poverty line. However, they still represent the lower portion of the income  		distribution.</p>
<p><b>Mental Impairment and Diagnoses</b>. Dichotomous variables were also  		developed for a series of diagnositic categories. For each diagnositic category  		the individual was coded 1 if they currently had at least one of the diagnoses  		included in the category.</p>
<p>For nursing home residents (1985 NNHS) current primary and other  		diagnoses were taken from the medical record. The 1985 NNHS used the Ninth  		Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) to code  		diagnoses.</p>
<p>For noninstitutionalized elderly (1984 SOA) diagnostic categories were  		generated from conditions listed in the Diagnostic Recode B file of the survey.  		This file primarily contains conditions mentioned in response to other  		questions on the SOA. Over 90 percent of the conditions were listed in response  		to questions regarding activity limitations, doctor's visits, hospitalizations  		or restricted activity days.</p>
<p>Although the 1984 SOA used specially created diagnostic codes, they are  		fully computable with ICD-9 codes for the level of diagnostic detail we  		desired. Thus, from these codes and the ICD-9 codes on the NNHS, we developed  		diagnostic categories which are comparable for both data sets. The diagnositic  		categories and their defining ICD-9 codes are shown in <a href="#table2">Table  		2</a>.</p>
<h3>Simultaneity</h3>
<p>Because of the cross sectional nature of the data set it is possible  		that characteristics which distinguish aged individuals in nursing homes from  		those in the community reflect the effects of institutional life rather than  		the cause of institutionalization. This is not of concern if our purpose is to  		discuss the correlates of nursing home residency or factors which awe  		indicative of residency status. However, if the model is to be used  		prospectively simultaneity becomes an important issue.</p>
<p>This is of particular concern with the poverty status variable and the  		functional dependency variables. To overcome this problem for the poverty  		status variable we used payer source upon admission. This should eliminate the  		simultaneity problem caused by the fact that many people become poor after they  		enter a nursing home and "spend down" their resources, prior to becoming  		Medicaid eligible (Burwell, Adams, and Meiners, 1988).</p>
<p>To evaluate the potential effects of simultaneity from the functional  		status variables we replaced these variables and corresponding interaction  		terms with instruments. Neither significance levels nor conclusions were found  		to be altered substantially by such a replacement.</p>
<h3>Statistical Model and Hypotheses</h3>
<p>Given the variables available on both data sets we hypothesized that  		residency status is a function of <b>Sociodemographic Characteristics</b> (age,  		sex, race, and poverty status), <b>Social Support</b> (marital status and  		living children), <b>Functional Status</b> (activities of daily living  		dependencies, mobility dependency, and bed/chair fast), <b>Mental Impairment,  		Diagnoses</b> (cancer, nervous system disorder, arthritis, cerebrovascular  		disorder, circulatory disorder, diabetes, hypertension, injuries, and  		respiratory disorder), <b>Prior Health Care Use</b> (previous nursing home  		admission), and <b>Community Characteristics</b> (region, and urbanization).  		Specifically we hypothesized that the likelihood of nursing home residency  		would increase with age, and was higher for females; whites; unmarried  		individuals; functionally dependent individuals; individuals with each system  		disorder; individuals residing in poverty, the midwest, and urban areas; and  		those who have previously been in a nursing home.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Weighted logistic regression results are presented in <a href="#table3">Table 3</a>. The model was statistically significant  		(X<sup>2</sup>=3981.28 with 19 df, p&lt;.0001). The probability that the i-th  		individual resided in a nursing home is specified as</p>
<table><tr><td>P<sub>i</sub> = exp<sup>(b<sub>o</sub> +  			 X<sub>i</sub>B)</sup> / 1 + exp<sup>(b<sub>o</sub> + X<sub>i</sub>B)</sup></td>
</tr><tr><td>where: P<sub>i</sub> is the predicted probability for the i-th  			 indiviudalexp is the exponential functionb<sub>o</sub> is an intercept  			 termX<sub>i</sub> is a vector of explanatory variables, andB is a  			 vector of coefficients.</td>
</tr></table><p>The final model included age, sex, race, marital status, children, prior  		nursing home use, poverty status, residing in the midwest, residing in a  		metropolitan area, being ADL dependent, number of ADL dependencies, being bed  		or chairfast, having arthritis, having Alzheimer's disease, having a mental  		diagnosis, having a disorder of the nervous system, and having cancer. Each of  		the explanatory variables except for gender were found to be significantly  		related (p &lt;.05) to the likelihood of nursing home use. Although gender has  		sometimes been shown to affect nursing home use, it was not a significant  		factor in our model.</p>
<p>All pairwise interactions were tested, and only two were found to be  		significant: being ADL dependent interacted with prior nursing home residency  		and being ADL dependent interacted with having a mental disorder. The final  		model therefore consisted of all significant main effects, gender, and the two  		significant pairwise interactions.</p>
<p>Because the constructed poverty status variable was not available for a  		number of respondents on both data sets (11.6 percent of all respondents), we  		evaluated the similarity of missing respondents to individuals of known poverty  		status. Comparisions were made through cross tabulations of poverty status with  		each of the other variables in the model, as well as through logistic  		regression analysis. The latter was done by adding a third category to the  		poverty status variable, unknown poverty status. Results from both sets of  		analyses indicated that individuals of unknown poverty status are similar to  		those who are not in poverty, and similar in a manner which causes them to have  		a smaller likelihood of being a nursing home resident. Furthermore, logistic  		regression results did not significantly change when the unknown poverty  		category was collapsed with the not-in-poverty category. Because the results  		did not significantly change and because of the similarity of respondents with  		unknown poverty status to those known not to be in poverty, we elected to  		combine individuals with unknown poverty status with those known not to be in  		poverty. All results are reported using this combination.</p>
<p><a href="#table3">Table 3</a> ranks by type--dichotomous and  		continuous/ordinal--each variable in descending order by estimated odds ratio  		(far right column). The odds ratio indicates the relative risk of  		institutionalization associated with a given trait. For a dichotomous variable  		the odds ratio represents the extent to which the chance of  		institutionalization is greater for an elderly person with the trait relative  		to one without the trait. For example, an individual who has a mental disorder  		has a 91.73:1 greater chance of nursing home residency than one who does not  		have a mental disorder, or an individual who is not married has a 5.09:1  		greater chance of residing in a nursing home than an individual who is married.  		For a continuous variable the odds ratio represents the increased likelihood of  		nursing home residency for each additional unit of the trait held. For example,  		with each increasing year (i.e., age) the likelihood of institutional residency  		increases by 1.10.</p>
<p>Main effects with large positive odds ratios were mental disorder, ADL  		dependency and prior nursing home use. However, the effect of ADL dependency  		was found to differ by whether individuals had previously been in a nursing  		home and whether they had a mental disorder. Similarly the effects of prior  		nursing home use and mental disorders were found to vary by ADL dependency.  		Regardless of the level of those significant interaction variables, ADL  		dependency, prior nursing home use and mental disorder all had an odds ratio  		greater than one. Increases in the likelihood of nursing home residency also  		were associated with being not married, white, having Alzheimer's disease,  		living in the midwest, and living in a metropolitan area. An increase in the  		number of ADLs and age also produced substantial increases in the likelihood of  		nursing home residency. All other variables had a small negative effect on the  		likelihood of residency, including having cancer, being bedridden or chairfast,  		not being in poverty, having arthritis or rheumatism, and having a nervous  		disorder.</p>
<p>Since the model is based on cross-sectional data it does not imply  		causal relationships, but instead describes the similarity of an elderly  		individual to nursing home residents. Stemming from this is the potential  		problem of simultaneity, or that the distinguishing characteristics are not  		causes of institutional residency but in fact the effects of  		institutionalization.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the lack of availability of certain data items, the  		equation omits several important variables. In particular these include  		perceived health status and attitudes towards nursing home placement.  		Additionally, while a region and urbanicity variable were entered in the model,  		privacy concerns prevented us from other including other community variables  		such as the availability of nursing home beds, which are known to affect  		nursing home use rates. Interpretation of the estimated coefficients therefore  		must be undertaken cautiously since the importance of each may be distorted  		because the coefficient for any included variable is influenced by any omitted  		variables that are correlated with it (Kennedy, 1989).</p>
<h2><a name="comparison" id="comparison">1985 VS 1977 COMPARISON</a></h2>
<p>Results from the 1977 individual-level analysis, including odds ratios,  		are presented in <a href="#table4">Table 4</a>. Differences between those and  		the 1985 results are primarily among three sets of measures: mental illness;  		poverty; and other diagnoses. Though precise odds ratio comparison across the  		years are not appropriate due to differences in samples, variable definitions,  		and model specification, the substantial changes in the odds ratios for these  		three sets of variables warrant investigation.</p>
<p>Three types of explanations appear to be important: changes in variable  		definitions; changes in model specification; and true changes in the residency  		status of elderly individuals with a particular trait. Changes due to different  		samples should be minimal given that all four of the data sets used are  		nationally representative and used similar sampling frames in each year.</p>
<p>But some variable definition options changed in both surveys between the  		two years. For example, both used the ICD-9 codes in 1985 to collect diagnostic  		information. Data item collected also increased on both surveys. Living  		children and prior nursing home use, which were not available in 1977, were  		added in 1985. On the other hand, geographic identifiers were not available for  		the later data set, precluding addition of state-specific variables to patient  		records as was done in 1977.</p>
<p>Real changes are indicated by higher or lower proportions of the  		population residing in nursing homes in the two years after definitional  		differences have been controlled. <a href="#table5">Table 5</a> presents  		prevalence rates by residency for the two years under the 1977 definition. Also  		shown are the prevalence rates by residency in 1985 for the variables which  		were not available in 1977 or for which an altered definition was found to  		improve the 1985 model fit.</p>
<p>Residents with a mental disorder as defined using the 1977 definition  		were about as likely to reside in nursing homes in 1985 as they were in 1977:  		roughly 40 percent were nursing home residents in both years. However, using  		the 1985 definition--which excludes senility--, almost two thirds of  		individuals with mental disorders resided in nursing homes. In other words,  		when the disorder was specific or serious enough to be labeled something other  		than senility, the individual had about a two-thirds chance of residing in a  		nursing home in 1985, accounting for its greater importance as a predictor. Had  		the more precise definition been available in 1977, mental disorders might have  		been more important in the 1977 model.</p>
<p>Similarly, a more precise definition of poverty became available in  		1985. Because of the potential simultaneity problems associated with poverty  		(i.e., elderly individuals often become poor upon admission to a nursing home),  		we elected to use payor status upon admission to reflect poverty status for  		nursing home residents in 1985, an option that was not available in 1977. (The  		previous analysis had available only current payor status.) Because the  		variable has been reversed (i.e., coded one reflects poverty in 1977 and not in  		poverty in 1985), appropriate odds ratio comparisons can be made by taking the  		inverse of one of the odds ratios. Thus, residing in poverty, which had an odds  		ratio of 3.36 in 1977, had an odds ratio of 5.26 (1/0.19) in 1985, meaning that  		being in poverty increased the likelihood of nursing home residency by more in  		1985 than in 1977.</p>
<p>In comparison to mental disorders and poverty, the importance of other  		diagnoses appear to have diminished between the two years. Each of the  		diagnoses variables which were available for inclusion in the 1977 model were  		also available for inclusion in the 1985 model. However, many were found to no  		longer be significant (e.g., diabetes, circulatory diseases, respiratory  		disease, and injuries), or to have diminished in importance (e.g., nervous  		system disorders, cancer, and arthritis), regardless of the definition  		employed. In fact the nervous system disorders variable found to produce the  		best fit in the 1985 model was a broader one than the one used in 1977. In 1977  		it included only Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy, but, in  		the later year it included all nervous system disorders including sensory  		impairments and a variety of other problems likely to be noteworthy to a  		community resident but not important enough to list as a diagnosis in a nursing  		home chart filled with multiple disabling disorders. This probably explains its  		drop in odds ratio to less than one, indicating a small negative association  		with nursing home residency.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, prevalence rates for seven disorders did change  		substantially suggesting that individuals with those problems were treated  		differently in 1985 versus 1977. Five conditions less likely to be associated  		with nursing home residence in 1985 compared to 1977 were (<a href="#table5">Table 5</a>): arthritis/rheumatism; circulatory disease;  		diabetes; and a multiple disease category called cancer, anemia, kidney and  		digestive disease. Although individuals with an injury were more likely to be  		nursing home residents in 1985 than in 1977, the presence of an injury was not  		a significant predictor of nursing home residency when controlling for other  		factors in 1985.</p>
<p>Beyond these three domains (mental illness, poverty and other diagnoses)  		little substantial change was found between the years. Although the importance  		of marital status appeared to decline, some of the explanation almost certainly  		lies in the presence in the 1985 model of another variable measuring social  		support: living children.</p>
<p>Prior nursing home use, which was available for inclusion in the 1985  		model and not in the 1977 model, is likely to be an indirect indicator of poor  		social support, and in capturing some of variation which in 1977 was attributed  		to social support.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate that what is most important in  		differentiating residents from nonresidents is functional ability, both  		physical and mental. Both the drop in predictive power of most diagnoses and  		the sorting out of mental disorders leads to the conclusion that  		institutionalization was best predicted in 1985 by focusing on behavioral  		rather than clinical indicators of need. Nursing home residents in 1985, as  		they did in 1977, suffered a multiplicity of breakdowns including physical and  		mental functioning, social support, mental disorders and financial resources.  		However, the importance of diagnoses other than mental disorders apparently  		diminished, while mental disorders, functional dependency, old age and social  		support continued to be important. Prior nursing home use which was found to be  		important in 1985, would most likely would have been important in 1977 had a  		measure been available for the model, and the significance of region and  		metropolitan area in 1985 probably reflected the continued importance of both  		the nursing home bed supply and style of practice variation.</p>
<h2><a name="state" id="state">STATE-LEVEL ANALYSIS</a></h2>
<h3>Variable Definitions</h3>
<p>Candidate explanatory variables for analysis of change in predictors of  		statewide nursing home use rates included aggregate measures of each state's  		population, including age, sex, and race structure, socioeconomic status, and  		death rate; nursing home bed supply; and a variety of Medicaid policy variables  		(<a href="#table6">Table 6</a>). Dollar values for the earlier year variables  		were adjusted for inflation with the Historical Consumer Price Index for All  		Urban Consumers (U.S. Department of Labor, 1987), and for both years for  		regional cost of living differences with average hourly earnings data from the  		U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1987).</p>
<p>Our state-level conceptual model paralleled the individual level model.  		Thus, we expected nursing home use rates to be higher among states in which the  		population was older (ELDERLY POP, 75+ POP, 85+ POP), a greater percent of whom  		were white (WHITE) and female (FEMALE). Per capita income (INCOME) was expected  		to vary positively with use rates, while the number of Supplemental Security  		Income recipients (SSI RECPTS) was expected to vary inversely with nursing home  		use rates.</p>
<p>Use was expected to increase with broadened Medicaid eligibility. Hence,  		the ratio of the Medicaid eligible population to the poverty population (MCAID  		ELIGIBLES) was expected to vary positively with use rates, while status as a  		209 B state (209B) was expected to decrease use rates. Additional indicators of  		Medicaid generosity, the average Medicaid payment per elderly recipient (MCAID  		PAY/RCPT) and the average Medicaid Home health care payment (MCAID HH  		PAY/RCPT), were also expected to vary positively with the nursing home use  		rate.</p>
<p>In addition, the level of urbanization in the state (METRO POP) was  		expected to vary positively with nursing home use. As was the supply of nursing  		home beds (NH BEDS), which varies regionally and within region by level of  		urbanization.</p>
<p>Because private pay price is not readily available for nursing home care  		we used the Medicaid state average per them payment to nursing homes (MCAID  		ICF, MCAID SNF) as a proxy for private pay price. Although Medicaid payments  		are always less than private pay charges, State Medicaid programs are mandated  		to set rates in accordance with actual costs, and may also account for private  		pay prices when establishing reimbursement rates (Harrington and Swan, 1984).  		We therefore hypothesized that nursing-home use rates would decrease as the  		Medicaid payment rate increased--an indication that the demand for nursing home  		care is price elastic, or downward sloping.</p>
<p>Although direct measures of the prevalence of functional dependency are  		not available at the state-level, functional dependency has been shown to be  		effectively modeled among the noninstitutionalized population by age, race and  		sex (Unger and Weissert, 1988; Elston, Koch and Weissert, forthcoming). As  		mentioned above, all three proxies are included in the model. Nor were direct  		measures of the prevalence of specific diseases available at the state-level.  		Instead, we used the death rate for persons age 65 and over (DEATH RATE) as a  		proxy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to data constraints a number of variables were not  		available for entry in our state-level model. These included the availability  		of social support, and consumer preferences or the population's general  		attitude towards nursing home placement.</p>
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>Initially we conducted a multiple regression paired comparison test to  		determine whether contextual factors affecting nursing home use rates had  		changed significantly between 1976 and 1986. The paired multiple regression  		comparison test was in the form of </p>
<table><tr><td><img src="/system/files/images-reports-basic/68271/instrfg1.gif" /></td>
</tr></table><p>The dependent variable was the change in the number of nursing home  		residents per 1000 elderly state residents between 1986 and 1976. The  		explanatory variables in such a model are entered in pairs: both the later year  		(1986) and the change between the two years (1986's value less 1976's value).  		Because the coefficient on the later year reflects the change in the  		coefficient between the two years, this approach allows for the statistical  		testing of which of several policy factors differentially affected rates of  		state nursing home residency between 1976 and 1986.</p>
<p>As a result of the paired entry of explanatory variables (e.g., the  		later year and the change variables), results tend to be unstable due to the  		high degree of multicollinearity present. We therefore elected to use the  		multiple regression paired comparison test as a means only to test whether  		significant differences existed between the two years, and to fit a separate  		ordinary least squares regression model to determine what factors affected  		nursing home use rates in 1986.</p>
<p>Each of these two models was checked for violations of the assumptions  		necessary for ordinary least squares regression such as heteroskedasticity,  		correlated error terms, and non-normality of errors. To correct for  		heteroskedasticity weighted least squares regression was used for both  		analyses. Weights were constructed by taking the inverse of the variance  		estimate pooled over both years. Cases found to be overly influential in either  		of the two models were individually dropped from the analysis, but subsequently  		reincluded because results and conclusions were not significantly altered by  		their elimination.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Using the multiple regression paired comparison test, changes in the  		coefficients between the two years were evaluated for statistical significance.  		Results indicated that none of the coefficients changed significantly between  		the two years (<a href="#table7">Table 7</a>). How much of this inability to  		detect a change is due to the exclusion of important variables such as a direct  		measure of the prevalence of ADL dependency, precise measures of changes in the  		adoption and effectiveness of a variety of health policy variables, such as  		pre-admission screening programs and nursing home payment methodology we cannot  		say. That fact that Medicare's hospital Prospective Payment System (PPS)  		apparently had no effect on rates of institutionalization may reflect the fact  		that only a relatively small proportion of nursing home residents could have  		been affected by PPS in 1985 (Hing, 1989).</p>
<p>The model found to best fit the 1985 data is shown in Table 8. Nursing  		home use rates increased as the percent of the state's elderly population over  		the age of 85 increased, as the percent of the poverty population covered by  		Medicaid increased, as the supply of nursing home beds increased, and as the  		average Medicaid payment per elderly Medicaid recipient increased. On the other  		hand use rates decreased as the ICF rate (a proxy for private price) increased,  		as the state's total population increased, and as the percent of the state's  		population over 65 increased. Per capita income was found not to significantly  		affect nursing home use rates. This model fit expectations quite well.</p>
<p>However, possible endogeneity exists with the Medicaid ICF rate, as well  		as with the Medicaid average payment, and the supply of nursing home beds. To  		adjust for these effects, we re-estimated the 1986 model using weighted  		two-stage least squares regression using the SAS procedure PROC SYSLIN.</p>
<p>Two-stage least squares regression requires the specification of  		instrumental variables which can be substituted for each included endogenous  		variable in the system of equations. In the first stage each endogenous  		variable (e.g., Medicaid ICF rate, Medicaid average payment rate, and nursing  		home bed supply) was regressed on all exogenous variables in the system. In the  		second stage, the estimated values generated in the first stage for each of the  		endogenous variables were substituted for the actual values in the regression  		equation.</p>
<p>The weighted two stage least squares results are shown in  		<a href="#table7">Table 7</a>. As expected results did not differ substantially  		from the weighted ordinary least squares estimation. Each of the variables  		remained significant (p&lt;.10), except the per capita income variable which  		remained nonsignificant. Furthermore, none of the estimated coefficients for  		the significant variables changed substantially in magnitude, and none changed  		in sign.</p>
<h2><a name="discuss" id="discuss">DISCUSSION</a></h2>
<p>Recent reviews of the risk of institutionalization literature by Kane  		and Kane (1987) and Shapiro and Roos (1989) have shown that despite differences  		in the definitions of measures used, and varying study populations and research  		methodologies, age, social support, mental impairment, and functional  		dependency have continually been shown to be significantly associated with  		nursing home placement. However, all of the studies reviewed were conducted  		using pre-1980 data, and thus, it is reasonable to question whether the same  		factors predict nursing home placement today.</p>
<p>Using both individual- and state-level, mid-1980 data, the purpose of  		this study was to determine what factors affect nursing home residency status,  		and to examine how these factors have changed over the past decade. Findings  		here confirm the resiliency of previously confirmed risk factors at both the  		individual- and state-level. Specifically, our findings confirm that the  		likelihood of nursing home residency continues to be greater with the presence  		of a mental disorder, functional dependency, lack of social support, and  		increasing age. Additionally, we found the likelihood of nursing home residency  		to be greater if an individual had previously been in a nursing home, had  		Alzheimers disease, was poor, or resided in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Changes, to the limited extent that there were any, generally suggest an  		increasing focus in the more recent year on behavioral indicators of need  		rather than clinical diagnoses. In state-level analysis, however, no  		significant changes were detected between the two years. But, the 1985  		state-level nursing home use model produced results generally supportive of the  		1985 individual level model.</p>
<p>The apparent resiliency of these nursing home risk factors lends support  		for their inclusion in nursing home and home care preadmission screening (PAS)  		instruments which are intended to identify likely nursing home users.  		Furthermore, results across the two years appear to be similar. The relative  		importance of several highly predictive measures: ADL dependency, mental  		disorder, lack of social support, and age, has not changed substantially.  		Likewise, race, poverty and region remained moderately important. But,  		diagnoses, other than specific mental disorders, became much less important.  		Prior nursing home use, an addition to the model in 1985, proved to be an  		important positive predictor of nursing home residency.</p>
<p>This finding of little shift in importance of the major predictors is an  		especially important finding because while there is substantial agreement in  		the field on which variables are predictors, the field has seen continued  		discrepancy in the relative weights assigned to these risk factors in  		predicting nursing home residency. In this study, which used nationally  		representative data sets for two widely separated time periods and estimated  		different models, the most important predictors proved robust in relative as  		well as overall importance.</p>
