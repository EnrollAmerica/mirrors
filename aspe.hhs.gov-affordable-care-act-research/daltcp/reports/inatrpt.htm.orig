<p>The importance of early infant attachment cannot be overstated. It is at  		the heart of healthy child development and lays the foundation for relating  		intimately with others, including spouses and children. It affects parents'  		abilities to nurture and to be responsive to their children. The effects of  		infant attachment are long-term, influencing generations of families.</p>
<p>For the vast majority, the experience of the mother's care is the first  		experience of reality. But the demands of modern life and culture are placing  		new demands on parents. With these demands comes the need for clarity regarding  		the basic requirements of the newborn and the young infant: what is needed to  		nurture appropriately? Because attachment is a fundamental theme of social  		function, it is a central issue in social policy.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of infant attachment, there has been no recent,  		comprehensive literature review that incorporates research from the variety of  		disciplines, including child development, ethology, and the behavioral and  		psychodynamic literatures. For this reason, the Department of Health and Human  		Services commissioned a multidisciplinary literature review on infant  		attachment theory and research, and conducted a seminar of experts to critique  		the review and propose a research agenda.</p>
<p>At one point in the seminar, the researchers were pushed to articulate  		-- in lay terms and for the general public -- what they could definitely say  		about early infant attachment. Their list of conclusions can be found in Part  		II of this document. In particular, some said that the mother's closeness (in  		terms of quantity of time with the child) during the first nine months is  		critical, while others indicated the second nine months as equally critical.  		The easy consensus was that the quality of care (in terms of caregiver  		responsiveness) in the first year or two of life influences the quality of the  		attachment. This does not mean, the researchers added, that the time beyond two  		years is not critical; it just has not been fully researched.</p>
<p>There was less agreement on the degree to which the quantity (in terms  		of hours per week) of non-parental care affects the quality of the attachment.  		Many researchers agreed that more research is needed on the interactive effects  		of quantity and quality of care on attachment outcomes, as well as on  		attachment to fathers, successful intervention strategies, and attachment in  		different cultural contexts.</p>
<p>Virginia L. Colin must be congratulated for a most thorough review of  		the literature, a review which drew the unanimous praise of the leading  		researchers in the field who attended the seminar. It is a significant  		contribution to the field of infant attachment research.</p>
<p>Susan D. Abbott of Nancy Low &amp; Associates Inc., has our sincere  		thanks for managing the whole contract so well. Mary Lou Rife deserves special  		recognition for her skillful and diligent editing.</p>

<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
<p>In February 1991, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  		Evaluation (ASPE) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)  		sponsored a two-day research seminar on <b>infant attachment</b>. The  		participants were invited researchers and clinicians, well-known in their  		fields, representing developmental, psychodynamic and ethological  		orientations.</p>
<p>Officials at DHHS recognized that the family structure and child-rearing  		practices are significantly affected by contemporary social and economic  		conditions. In this regard, they believe that comprehensive, multi-disciplinary  		research on infant attachment is critical to inform policy makers involved in  		such issues as parental leave, child care, family support systems and  		intervention strategies for high-risk children.</p>
<p>The DHHS seminar had three primary goals: <b>(1) to critique a prepared  		literature review of infant attachment; (2) to identify research gaps; and (3)  		to build a consensus for an interdisciplinary research agenda</b>. Throughout  		the seminar, the participants grappled with key questions that the literature  		poses:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>What factors influence an infant's pattern of attachment to his or  			 her parents?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the consequences of the nature of a child's first  			 attachments?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long lasting are the consequences?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the impact of maternal employment and day care on the  			 child's attachment?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To what extent are infants attached to secondary caregivers, such as  			 fathers and child care providers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we measure influences, outcomes and other conditions  			 associated with infant attachment?</p>
</li>
</ul><p>This final report has three major sections. The first part is a brief  		summary of an extensive literature review on infant attachment. The complete  		literature review is available upon request from The Department of Health and  		Human Services by contacting:</p>

<p>The Research Agenda, the third part of the report, outlines the areas  		that the participants identified for future research.</p>
<h2><a name="chapI" id="chapI">I. THE LITERATURE REVIEW: A SUMMARY</a></h2>
<h3>Attachment Theory</h3>
<p>Psychoanalyst John Bowlby introduced attachment theory in the late  		1950's. In the following two decades, numerous other researchers elaborated  		upon this theory which integrates viewpoints from psychoanalysis, cognitive  		psychology, systems theory and ethology (study of animal behavior).</p>
<p>Bowlby defines an <b>attachment</b> as an enduring emotional bond  		characterized by a tendency to seek and maintain closeness to a specific  		figure, particularly during stressful situations.</p>
<p>Attachment theory states that a child's first relationship is a love  		relationship that will have profound long-lasting effects on an individual's  		subsequent development. Closeness to the attachment figure provides protection  		and a psychological sense of security. Attachments should lay a good foundation  		for being able to form other secure relationships, to seek support when needed,  		and to draw strengths from the support which is given.</p>
<p>A caregiver who is reliably available and responsive to a baby's needs  		forms the basis for secure attachment, for competence in exploring the  		environment and forming other relationships, and for developing  		self-esteem.</p>
<p>Within attachment theory, "<b>representational models</b>" play a  		significant role. These unconscious structures are mental representations of  		the self and others, based on early experiences in first relationships. They  		set the stage for interactions with new social partners and have long-term  		consequences for shaping personality, organizing behavior and developing close  		relationships.</p>
<p>Bowlby asserted that it is not uncommon for a person to hold conflicting  		internal models of an important relationship. One model may develop largely  		from a child's direct experience with a caregiver, while another may result  		from cognitive input--for example, statements from the parents that do not  		support the experience.</p>
<p>Changes in attachment behavior and in one's representational models of  		attachment relationships can develop from developmental changes and/or changes  		in experience, especially with another attachment figure. Changes in the  		child's attachment can also result from changes in the parent's behavior due to  		family circumstances, such as the birth of a sibling, a death, divorce, or  		marriage, an economic setback or advance, a relocation to a new neighborhood, a  		child's entry into child care or school, involvement of a social worker, or  		psychotherapy.</p>
<p>Attachment theory, is first of all, a theory about the nature of  		<b>all</b> human beings. It touches on several critical elements of an  		individual's emotional life--the tendency to form attachment bonds; the role of  		the caregiver; the anxiety and anger which separation and loss provoke; and the  		nature of grieving for the loss of an attachment.</p>
<p>Secondly, this theory categorizes the nature of a child's first  		attachment as either <b>secure</b> or <b>anxious</b> and attempts to describe  		the impact of these patterns on subsequent behavior and relationships.</p>
<h3>Early Research on Infant Attachment</h3>
<p>In the 1960's, Mary Ainsworth, one of Bowlby's colleagues, conducted  		seminal longitudinal studies of 26 pairs of mothers and babies in their natural  		setting. Trained observers visited the subjects in their homes, in Baltimore,  		Maryland, for four hours at a time, every three weeks during the first year,  		making notes on the infants' behaviors and mothers' sensitivity in responding  		to the infants.</p>
<p>At the time these babies were approaching their first birthday,  		Ainsworth and her colleague, Barbara Wittig, developed the "<b>Strange  		Situation</b>," a semi-standardized laboratory procedure for observing babies'  		responses to being in a new place, meeting an adult female stranger, being  		separated from the mother for a brief period, and being left alone in an  		unfamiliar place for a brief period. At age one, 23 of the 26 infants in the  		Baltimore study were among the 106 babies on which Ainsworth reported. This  		method proved to be a rich source of data about attachment patterns and has  		been used to assess thousands of infants. In this technique, highly experienced  		coders use scales to rate the intensity of interactive behavior in four areas:  		proximity and contact-seeking: contact-maintaining; resistance; and avoidance.  		Then they categorized the infant's patterns of attachment behavior as either  		secure or anxious.</p>
<p>Ainsworth described three major categories of attachment: <b>secure</b>,  		<b>anxious/avoidant</b>, and <b>anxious/ambivalent</b>. After years of  		additional research by many investigators, Mary Main and Judith Solomon in 1986  		identified a fourth pattern: <b>anxious/disorganized/disoriented</b>.</p>
<p>These four major patterns of attachment describe unique sets of  		behavior:</p>
<p><b>Secure</b>: Securely attached babies are able to use the attachment  		figure as an effective secure base from which to explore the world. When such  		moderately stressful events as brief (3-minute) separations in an unfamiliar  		environment occur, these securely attached babies approach or signal to the  		attachment figure at reunion and achieve a degree of proximity or contact which  		suffices to terminate attachment behavior. They accomplish this with little or  		no open or masked anger, and soon return to exploration or play.</p>
<p><b>Avoidant</b>: Babies with avoidant attachments are covertly anxious  		about the attachment figure's responsiveness and have developed a defensive  		strategy for managing their anxiety. Upon the attachment figure's return after  		the same moderately stressful events, these avoidant babies show mild version  		of the "detachment" behavior which characterizes many infants after separations  		of two or three weeks; that is, they fail to greet the mother, ignore her  		overtures and act as if she is of little importance.</p>
<p><b>Ambivalent</b>: In babies with anxious/ambivalent attachments, both  		anxiety and mixed feelings about the attachment figure are readily observable.  		At reunion after brief separations in an unfamiliar environment, they mingle  		openly angry behavior with their attachment behavior.</p>
<p><b>Disorganized/Disoriented</b>: Babies classified in this group appear  		to have no consistent strategy for managing separation from and reunion with  		the attachment figure. Some appear to be clinically depressed; some demonstrate  		mixtures of avoidant behavior, openly angry behavior and attachment behavior.  		Other show odd, often uncomfortable and disturbing behaviors. These infant are  		often seen in studies of high-risk samples of severely maltreated, very  		disturbed or depressed babies, but also appear in normal middle-class  		samples.</p>
<h3>Determinants of Attachment Patterns</h3>
<p>A large body of evidence demonstrates that the mother's sensitivity in  		responding appropriately to her baby's needs is a principal determinant of the  		baby's attachment pattern. More positive maternal characteristics, such as  		autonomy, flexibility, and nurturance, tend to be associated with secure infant  		attachment. Studies of mothers with personality disorders, such as depression,  		bipolar disorders, or schizophrenia, support the view that disturbances in  		caregivers' personalities predict anxious attachments in infants. In addition,  		the mother's representational model of attachment relationships appears to be a  		good predictor of her baby's attachment pattern.</p>
<p>Anxious attachments among babies will vary with both the individual  		mother-infant interaction and the culture. A number of studies in the U.S. and  		Europe indicate that rejection of the baby, particularly rebuffing the baby's  		bids for contact, prompts the development of avoidant defenses. Inconsistent,  		unpredictable responding--ignoring signal at times, being intrusive at other  		times, responding sensitively on occasion--apparently fosters  		anxious/ambivalent attachments. Unresolved mourning, serious maternal  		psychopathology, and child abuse are associated with anxious/disorganized  		infant attachments. Estimates of the frequency of anxious attachment among  		abused and/or neglected children have ranged from 70% to 100%.</p>
<p>Research has identified at least two other factors that increase the  		risk of anxious attachment: infant irritability and low levels of practical and  		social support for the mother. Poor marital quality and the instability in the  		family's situation, associated with extreme poverty, may also increase the risk  		of anxious attachment. Any one of these factors in isolation does not clearly  		or consistently increase the frequency of anxious attachment. However, when two  		or more of these factors occur together, the likelihood of the baby developing  		an anxious attachment to the mother increases significantly. Each of these  		variables may be considered a risk factor by making it more difficult for the  		mother to respond sensitively to her baby.</p>
<p>In most circumstances, boys and girls are equally likely to be securely  		attached to their mothers. In high-risk samples, boys may be at greater risk  		than girls for anxious attachment. Poverty, in the absence of other risk  		factors, does not appear to increase the risk of anxious attachment.</p>
<p>Research on premature infants demonstrates that the infant's initial  		characteristics have little impact on patterns developed by their first  		birthday, except when long-term medical risks may complicate the mother-infant  		interaction and contribute to anxious attachment. In general, the mother's  		influence on attachment outcomes is greater than the infant's influence.</p>
<h3>Stability of Attachment Patterns</h3>
<p>In stable middle class families, most studies find at least 80%  		stability in Strange Situation classifications from 12 to 18 months. Two  		studies, in fact, have reported high stability of attachment to the mother from  		infancy to age six. In these Studies, the family circumstances were stable, and  		the patterns of maternal care were consistent over time. High stability has  		been noted in middle class families, even when the mother's employment status  		had changed between Strange Situation interviews. The maternal employment  		status in these situations had been stable for some months before each Strange  		Situation.</p>
<p>In low socioeconomic samples, studies indicate less stability in  		attachments. One recent study demonstrates 60% stability of major categories A,  		B and C, with secure attachments being more stable than the insecure. It is  		likely that if the D (anxious/disorganized) category had been available at the  		time of the study, these attachments may have been more stable since  		attachments in this category tend to change infrequently.</p>
<h3>Effects of Attachment Patterns on Later Development</h3>
<p>It is often difficult to differentiate between outcomes resulting from  		early attachment patterns and those from associated aspects of present  		experiences. However, it has been widely observed that children interact with  		both familiar and new people on the basis of their previous adaptations,  		thereby perpetuating adaptive or maladaptive behavior.</p>
<h4>Secure Attachments</h4>
<p>Most infants (approximately 65%) are securely attached. Children who are  		securely attached to their mothers in infancy tend to have advantages in a  		variety of arenas as toddlers, preschoolers and kindergartners. They do not  		perform better on cognitive tasks than anxiously attached children in most  		studies, but they do tend to be more persistent and enthusiastic in the way  		they pursue a task. Secure children are generally more sociable, cooperative  		and competent and more ego-resilient. Peers and teachers prefer them to  		children with anxious attachments. It is difficult to distinguish whether these  		favorable outcomes are the effects of secure attachment in infancy or of  		correlated aspects of more recent experience and relationships.</p>
<h4>Anxious Attachments</h4>
<p>Anxious attachments are common (35% in most U.S. samples, whether  		middle- or lower-class), and they may not be cause for much concern. Most  		anxiously attached children do not develop psychopathology, but they appear to  		be at greater risk for it than secure children. In high-risk samples, anxious  		attachments are more common especially in the anxious/disorganized (D)  		category.</p>
<p>About 20% of infants in most American samples are anxious/avoidant and  		have been the subject of close study. Their behavior is characterized by  		detachment, restricted emotional awareness, masked feelings and difficulty in  		expressing negative emotions. Their defensive posture, a reaction to  		insensitive, rejecting care received in infancy, is carried into later  		situations where it is maladaptive. An avoidant child does not request  		practical assistance or emotional support, lacking trust that people around him  		will respond positively. Children in this category play most often with  		objects, have limited fantasy play and are unable to admit normal  		imperfections.</p>
<p>Anxious/Ambivalent infants (10 to 15% of most samples) are often less  		persistent, less enthusiastic and less compliant as toddlers than those  		classified as secure, express more anger and frustration. Preschoolers in this  		category are found to become victims of exploitation in interaction with peers.  		They are likely to elicit mixed responses from peers that perpetuate ambivalent  		feelings and expectations about relationships.</p>
<p>It is estimated that approximately 10 to 15% of infants are  		disorganized. Because this is still a relatively new category, it is possible  		that more infants fit this category. Some researchers are re-evaluating  		videotapes to code this category more accurately. One well-executed study found  		that infants with anxious/disorganized attachments were at risk for showing  		hostile/aggressive behavior problems at age five.</p>
<p>The fundamental importance of an infant's attachment needs were  		dramatically illustrated in studies of institutionalized babies who had no  		regularly present caregiver. A startling percentage of babies waned and died  		despite good physical care. A high percentage of babies who spent much of their  		infancy in an institution became either socially indifferent, or developed  		"affect hunger," an insatiable need for attention and affection from  		indiscriminant sources. Neither group was able to form meaningful attachments  		to caretakers or peers. As adolescents, they tended to be aggressive and  		impulsive and engage in anti-social behavior.</p>
<h4>Adolescent and Adult Attachment Patterns</h4>
<p>The frequencies of each of the major patterns of attachment (secure,  		avoidant and ambivalent) in samples of adolescents and adults are very similar  		to their frequencies among infants. In the older groups, as in infancy, each  		category of attachment is about as common among males as among females. The  		patterns seem to be quite meaningful for describing teenagers and adults as  		well. Since the anxious/disorganized category has been described only recently,  		no studies of adolescents and adults, has been undertaken, using this  		classification.</p>
<p>Secure adolescents and adults describe their most important love  		experiences as especially happy, friendly and trusting. Their relationships  		lasted longer than the relationships of their anxiously attached peers.  		Avoidant adolescents and adults have difficulty building, enjoying and  		maintaining intimate relationships. They are described as "distant," with few  		close friends or long-term love relationships. Their relationships are often  		tinged with fear and jealousy. They tend to idealize their parents and many are  		compulsive about their work.</p>
<p>Anxious/ambivalent adolescents and adults report love relationships that  		involved obsession, extreme sexual attraction, desire for union and extreme  		jealousy. They report self-doubts and feel misunderstood and underappreciated.  		They get high scores in loneliness and are most likely to report a lack of  		paternal support.</p>
<p>Studies indicate that patterns of attachment may even help to predict or  		explain the adult's approach to work and success or failure in the job setting.  		For example, secure attachments in adulthood may support self-confident,  		effective involvement in one's work. Avoidant adults might approach their work  		somewhat compulsively to avoid their difficulties and deficiencies in  		interpersonal relationships. Anxious/ambivalent adults, preoccupied with unmet  		attachment needs, might often allow interpersonal involvements to interfere  		with their work.</p>
<p>Studies which specifically relate the pattern of attachment in infancy  		to one's pattern of attachment in adolescence or adulthood are not available.  		No subjects have been followed for that length of time. However, other sorts of  		evidence support the view that patterns of attachment are frequently  		transmitted from generation to generation. Parents with autonomous or balanced  		representational models, for example, are much better able to give sensitive  		care to their babies, resulting in securely attached children. Other evidence  		regarding the effects of early attachment on adulthood focuses primarily on  		long-term effects of loss of an attachment figure in childhood or major  		disruptions of attachments in childhood.</p>
<h3>Intervention Strategies</h3>
<p>Families at high risk for anxious attachments can be identified by  		trained researchers when an infant is as young as three or four months old.  		Infant intervention programs can be quite effective with high-risk  		mother-infant dyads. Successful programs include important key elements:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The mother's sensitive responsiveness to the baby is the major focus  			 of the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychotherapy addresses conflicts from the mother's past which  			 affect her current behavior toward her baby.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therapist visits the family once a week for one year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practical supports are considered for the mother (child care,  			 medical care, foodstamps, housing, transportation.</p>

<li>
<p>Intervener establishes trusting relationship with caregiver,  			 especially in multi-cultural, high risk populations.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Studies indicate that short-term parent training sessions or other  		programs that focus on cognitive learning are rarely effective. It has been  		proposed that social changes, such as provision of affordable housing, or  		teaching parents alternatives to physical punishment, would decrease stress and  		violence within the family thereby creating better opportunities for more  		positive attachment behavior.</p>
<p>Among families <b>not</b> at high risk for anxious attachment due to  		poverty, deviant parent behavior, or unstable situations, investigators have  		not yet clarified what kind of intervention may decrease the frequency (about  		35%) of anxious attachments. The type of intervention required for these  		families depends on the specific difficulties identified. For example,  		long-term psychotherapy is often prescribed for mothers with personality  		disorders, while brief visits by therapists, teaching mothers how to respond to  		irritable babies, have been found effective.</p>
<h3>Special Areas of Infant Attachment Research</h3>
<h4>Attachment Hierarchies</h4>
<p>Recent studies indicate that babies tend to develop clear, stable  		hierarchies of attachment figures. The duration of each relationship, the  		proportion of time the baby spent with each caregiver each week, the quality of  		each attachment, and the intensity of each caregiver's emotional investment in  		the baby all appeared to influence the baby's attachment hierarchy.</p>
<p>However, most of those factors favor the mother most of the time Under  		moderate stress, most, but not all, infants direct attachment behavior more to  		their mothers than to their fathers or child care providers.</p>
<p>Data on responses to separation from or loss of an attachment figure  		also suggest that the primary caregiver may be a much more important attachment  		figure than previously considered. Loss of the mother prior to age 11 predicts  		much greater vulnerability to depression than loss of the father.</p>
<p>There has been no good test of Bowlby's monotropy hypothesis--that  		babies are genetically biased to treat one attachment figure, the primary  		caregiver, as much more important than any other.</p>
<h4>Maternal Employment</h4>
<p>While there has been much debate regarding a baby's attachments to an  		employed mother, studies have indicated that most babies with employed mothers  		are securely attached to them. Several specific findings have been made:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Approximately 55% of infants, whose mothers return to full-time jobs  			 when the baby is less than six months old, are securely attached to the  			 mother.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoidant attachments are highest among babies who start day care in  			 the first six months of life and spend more than 20 hours per week in  			 non-parental care. Frequency of avoidant of avoidant attachment increases front  			 20% to 28% in these situations. However, there is not sufficient data to  			 determine causes of very modest statistical associations between material  			 employment and infant avoidance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part-time child care does not appear to be a risk factor for anxious  			 attachments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child care which begins after the baby's first birthday does not  			 appear to jeopardize the quality of an infant's attachment to the primary  			 caregiver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marital quality may play a particularly salient role in child  			 development when both parents hold full-time jobs.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Findings about whether the mother's return to a job changes the infant's  		pattern of attachment to her or to the father have been inconclusive.  		Researchers need data on how employed mothers, fathers and other caregivers  		interact with the babies in the course of everyday life. Long-term naturalistic  		observations of interactions in employed-mother families would be an  		exceptionally useful methodology for gathering this type of information.</p>
<h4>Fathers</h4>
<p>The patterns of attachment to two parents are similar, significantly  		more often than one would expect by chance. Attachment researchers hypothesize  		that sensitive responsiveness underlies secure attachment to fathers as well as  		to mothers. However, most fathers interact with babies much less than mothers  		do, and they usually take a different role in relation to the baby. The factors  		which underlie secure attachment to the father may, therefore, differ from the  		factors which relate to secure attachment to the mother.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that hundreds of babies have participated in Strange  		Situations with the father, researchers cannot say with confidence what the  		precursors of secure attachment to the father are. They have little data on  		prior interaction with the fathers in other settings, natural or contrived. It  		seems likely that models of attachment relationships influence both one's  		choice of a marriage partner and the quality of care one gives to a baby.</p>
<h4>Infant Child Care</h4>
<p>One study indicates that in 54% of cultures surveyed, someone besides  		the mother was also important in providing care for infants, often another  		female relative. If human babies are genetically biased toward directing most  		of their attachment behavior to one person, it appears that they are adapting  		quite successfully to receiving care from a secondary attachment figure.</p>
<p>In our culture, as many as half of the mothers of babies under one year  		old are now employed, and many require child care services. Yet, we have almost  		no information about infants' attachments to child care providers. We do not  		know what proportion of such attachments are secure, whether the pattern of  		attachment to the mother is a good predictor of the pattern of attachment to  		the child care provider, or what the impact of the attachment to the child care  		provider on the child's subsequent development may be. Furthermore, we do not  		know what the effects of loss of this early attachment figure may be.</p>
<p>We do know that 85% of mothers rely on family child care as opposed to  		institutional day care. However, there is little research that distinguishes  		the strengths and weaknesses of the different kinds of child care  		situations.</p>
<h4>Gender Differences</h4>
<p>Hundreds of studies of infants, toddlers, and preschoolers have reported  		no sex differences in frequencies of insecure attachment or in the effect of  		different attachment patterns in adolescents and adulthood. Secure, ambivalent  		and avoidant attachments are about equally common in boys and girls in infancy.  		The new anxious/disorganized category was not used in most studies. A few  		studies found that boys were more vulnerable than girls to variables which  		might underlie anxious attachment or to consequences of negative  		attachment.</p>
<h4>Cross Cultural Research</h4>
<p>A majority of babies is securely attached to the mother in every culture  		studied to date. Clearly, different cultures have different infant care  		practices which underlie their definitions of "secure" attachments. For  		example, secure attachments in Japanese families and Israeli kibbutzim are  		characterized by a great deal of physical closeness. In Northern European  		countries, however, close physical contact may not be a cultural norm for  		identifying secure attachments.</p>
<p>Attachment theory would predict an increased risk of avoidance for  		cultures which stress independence and strive to instill it by pressing babies  		to behave independently at an early age. This line of thought, however, may not  		be applicable to specific countries, like Germany, where autonomy is highly  		valued in personal development.</p>
<p>In the U.S., it appears that the surest way to foster sturdy  		independence in a child is to lay a secure foundation by responding sensitively  		to the infant's signals. In the Japanese culture, children are expected to rely  		on their mothers for help and emotional support throughout childhood. About 30%  		of babies in Japan are classified as anxious/ambivalent. In this case, however,  		we do not know whether these attachments are maladaptive, either biologically  		or socially.</p>
<h3>Assessment Procedures</h3>
<p>It is not possible to assess patterns of attachment in infants until  		late in the first year. Researchers have observed interactions of infants for  		appropriate developmental stages in the early months (i.e., preferring mothers  		over strangers at five months) that may correlate to assessments made later in  		a Strange Situation.</p>
<p>Ainsworth's <b>Strange Situation</b> has been used as a primary method  		of assessing the quality of an infant's attachment to a caregiver. The Strange  		Situation, appropriate for babies from 11 to 20 months old, has impressive  		levels of validity and usefulness. Some questions have been raised about its  		validity in other cultures, where the stressfulness and meaning of its events  		may differ from typical interpretations in the U.S.</p>
<p>Other concerns about the Strange Situation relate to issues of  		administration and scoring, including the amount of time lapsed between  		assessments for each infant, adequacy of stress levels, and lack of a security  		scale. Some variability exists among psychological laboratories in coding  		Strange Situation behavior. In addition, The D category,  		"anxious/disorganized/disoriented" needs to be used in all new studies which  		include Strange Situations.</p>
<p>The <b>Attachment Behavior Q-set</b>, which rates security on a scale,  		is appropriate for children up to three years old. While this test assesses  		degrees of security, it does not describe patterns of insecurity.</p>
<p>The <b>MacArthur Attachment Working Group</b> has been experimenting for  		several years with modifications of the Strange Situation appropriate for  		preschoolers, developing guidelines for coding their behavior. Members of the  		group hope to complete their coding system for 1991 publication.</p>
<p>Mary Main and her colleagues have developed a laboratory procedure and  		coding system for assessing attachment patterns in six-year-olds based on the  		Strange Situation.</p>
<p>For adolescents and adults, two tests are widely used: Hazan and  		Shaver's trichotomous self-report measure describes current experiences in  		relationships; the <b>Adult Attachment Interview (AAI)</b>, a one-hour clinical  		interview, focuses on early attachment history and current interpersonal  		relationships.</p>
<h2><a name="chapII" id="chapII">II. INFANT ATTACHMENT SEMINAR SUMMARY OF THE  		PROCEEDINGS</a></h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A complete list of the 10 participants and their professional  		affiliations is attached at the end of this section.</p>
<p>In the first session of the seminar, the participants described their  		work in infant attachment from their respective disciplines, which ranged from  		psychoanalysis, family therapy and developmental psychology, to primate  		research, cross-cultural research and social cognition.</p>
<p>The participants used the major topics from the literature review to  		guide their discussion.</p>
<h3>Attachment Theory</h3>
<p>The participants discussed the roots of attachment theory in  		<b>psychoanalysis</b> and <b>ethology</b> (science of animal behavior) and the  		continuing influences of both traditions. Considerable time was spent on the  		<b>role of anger in attachment theory</b>, more specifically, on its adaptive  		and destructive functions. While excessive hostility is destructive in the  		mother-child relationship, participants were reminded of Bowlby's view of anger  		as serving a biological adaptive function for both the individual and the  		species. For example, a baby's anger at a mother who disappears, and a parent's  		anger at a child who wanders off, play a protective function. Bowlby believed  		that human possibilities for anger implied biological survival mechanisms,  		although he admits that at times anger is maladaptive.</p>
<p>Attachment theory comments extensively on the instinctive nature of all  		human beings. The major focus of much theory and research has been the infant's  		maintenance of proximity to the parent and on the parent's caregiving  		behavior.</p>
<p>The "representational models" that underlie the theory are defined as  		unconscious structures which guide the individuals' perceptions and behavior,  		and include both cognitive and emotional components. Most participants agreed  		that feelings, thoughts and behaviors need to be viewed as integrated, not  		isolated, factors within an attachment relationship.</p>
<h3>Determinants of Attachment Patterns</h3>
<p>The <b>major determinant of the infant's pattern of attachment (secure,  		avoidant, ambivalent, or disorganized) appears to be the quality of care the  		primary caregiver(s) provides</b>. Participants agreed with experts who have  		repeatedly emphasized and demonstrated that the caregiver's sensitive  		responsiveness is of great importance. A caregiver must be able and willing to  		notice an infant's cues, to interpret their meaning accurately, and to respond  		appropriately. A caregiver with too much ambivalence or rigidity or too  		preoccupied with her own needs cannot respond sensitively, and may cause an  		anxious attachment for the infant.</p>
<p>In terms of infant temperament, the consensus at the seminar was that  		the <b>distinct personalities of babies can influence attachment outcomes</b>.  		Despite considerable effort, it was recognized that psychologists have had very  		little success in defining and measuring temperament variables (negative  		emotionality, sociability, etc.) in human beings. It is easier to study  		temperament factors in primates. For example, experiments with rhesus monkeys  		have demonstrated that temperamental tendencies, such as fear of new events,  		are highly influenced by hereditary factors. Rhesus babies with these kinds of  		temperaments are at high risk for attachment difficulties and other social  		problems, when their mothers are unskilled and rejecting, and when the  		environment is stressful. Introducing them to more responsive mothering and a  		calm environment greatly decreases their vulnerability.</p>
<p>The question was raised as to whether infants and mothers are equal  		partners in terms of accommodating each other. It appears that most of the  		time, both mothers and babies have great flexibility in behaviors available to  		them. Mothers, however, have a greater freedom of choice about their behavior.  		Therefore, the <b>quality of care the mother provides will probably have more  		influence than the infant's temperament on the infant's pattern of  		attachment</b>.</p>
<p>Issues of attachment versus autonomy develop as the child gets older. A  		sensitive mother will respect even an infant's growing need for independence.  		The early childhood years demand that a mother work collaboratively with a  		child in handling separation and reunion matters. In preschool years,  		children's attachments move into the phase of "goal-corrected" partnerships,  		when language becomes important and is used by the child to communicate his  		needs and thus influence the quality of the relationship.</p>
<h3>Outcomes of Early Attachment Patterns</h3>
<p>Participants agreed that while the quality of attachment in infancy does  		not predict the total behavior of a person, the first attachment does lay the  		foundation for handling subsequent phases of development. <b>Children with  		secure attachments</b> have more basic trust than those who are anxiously  		attached. They have more ego resiliency through early and middle childhood,  		unless they experience significant negative changes. They can also cope with  		setbacks, and recover more quickly. Securely attached children have more  		flexibility in processing current information and in responding appropriately  		in new situations and relationships.</p>
<p><b>Anxious/avoidant children</b> carry anger and anxiety unconsciously  		and build defenses against perceiving or communicating certain types of  		emotional information. They demonstrate more displaced aggression and more  		non-compliance than other groups. Nevertheless, they perform well on  		developmental tests and on tasks that measure cognitive skills.</p>
<p><b>Anxious/ambivalent children</b> have difficulty regulating the  		expression of negative emotions and are preoccupied with attachment concerns to  		a degree that interferes with constructive functioning.</p>
<p>In high risk samples, <b>anxious/disorganized children</b> are most  		likely to develop behavior problems.</p>
<p>Many anxiously attached children function quite normally. However,  		securely attached children always look equal to, or better than, anxiously  		attached children in measure of personality, social behavior and approaches to  		cognitive challenges. Researchers have identified characteristics such as  		resilience, persistence and cooperation as principal factors in their success.  		The consistency with which secure attachment is associated with positive  		outcomes is striking.</p>
<p>Research has shown that institution-reared children and foster children,  		who have been shuttled frequently from home to home, lose their capacity to  		form deep emotional bonds.</p>
<h3>Intervention Strategies</h3>
<p>The participants reported that it has become easier in the last few  		years to identify those infants and mothers who are at risk for problems  		related to attachment. In addition, much has been learned about developing  		appropriate ways to change maladaptive behavior. <b>Primate research</b>, which  		has provided some illuminating data about intervention techniques, was a topic  		of great interest at the seminar.</p>
<p>Research with non-human primates, whose early attachment was inadequate,  		identified simple intervention strategies. One activity was moving the mother  		and baby from a cage where they lived alone, to a group that included  		well-adjusted mothers and children. This change resulted in decreased  		isolation, increased social support and more appropriate models for behavior.  		The mother in this case was returning to a more "normal" (in evolutionary  		terms) social environment.</p>
<p>A second intervention which works with rejecting, inadequate monkey  		mothers is simply to continue returning the infant to physical contact with the  		mother, usually by placing the baby on the mother's back. Eventually, the  		infant's care-eliciting behaviors begin to affect the mother's ability to  		provide responsive care.</p>
<p>The participants discussed the implications of these interventions in  		the human realm. Two studies were cited that found that baby carriers, which  		hold the baby against the mother's chest, improve attachment outcomes for  		inner-city babies. A third study, which focused on placing mothers in front of  		their babies during directed play, instead of behind them, resulted in rapid  		improvements in mother-infant interaction in a high-risk sample.</p>
<p><b>For high-risk families</b>, (involving poverty, abuse, neglect,  		depression, psychiatric problems) <b>multi-faceted, long-term strategies are  		needed</b> that include psychotherapy for the mother and that offer practical  		social support for the entire family. There is currently <b>no evidence that  		teaching child development principles in a didactic "classroom" situation, to  		parents in either high-risk or low-risk samples improves attachment  		outcomes</b>.</p>
<h3>Special Areas of Infant Attachment Research</h3>
<h4>Maternal Employment</h4>
<p>Studies show that 50% of mothers have jobs in the baby's first year;  		perhaps as many as 3/4 of them have full-time jobs. Issues regarding maternal  		employment and child care needs were considered a high priority by the  		participants.</p>
<p>Several points were made about employed mothers. <b>Most babies develop  		secure attachments. This is true even when the mother returns to a full-time  		job within the first six months of the baby's life</b>. Babies of mothers with  		full-time jobs are more likely than other babies to have avoidant attachments,  		but there are no good studies explaining why. There are no studies of the later  		correlates of early avoidance in employed mother families.</p>
<p><b>Participants expressed concern about the mother's well-being, in  		addition to the infant's care</b>. They commented that large numbers of  		American families are living in very stressful circumstances, with limited  		choices available to them in terms of parental leave, child care, or part-time  		work options. Families, therefore, are making difficult choices between meeting  		the baby's and mother's needs, whether the mother's employment is an economic  		necessity or a valuable part of her own development.</p>
<h4>Fathers</h4>
<p>Participants noted that, in general, the father's caregiving role with  		the baby is not the same as the mother's. Father tend to be playmates, often  		stepping back to let the mother take over when the baby needs comfort. There is  		no substantial data available regarding the particular aspects of interaction  		that underlie infants' attachment to their fathers.</p>
<p>Some studies suggest that good marital relationships are associated with  		secure infant attachments. While the explanation for the correlation between  		the two is not known, the father's support for the mother appears especially  		important.</p>
<p>There is not much research available on single mothers and the potential  		for their babies to be at risk for anxious attachments. While studies of very  		small samples indicate that there is no greater risk, larger samples of  		hundreds of infant-mother dyads are needed to reach any conclusions.</p>
<h4>Infant Child Care</h4>
<p>Few studies exist concerning the patterns of young children's  		attachments to their child care provider. The participants voiced the need for  		research that focuses on the processes involved in a child care relationship  		and on its consequences for later development.</p>
<p>Some participants expressed concern about extended child care--in which  		an infant receives more than 20 hours per week care by a provider; they fear  		that the parent's ability to steer the child's development trajectory is being  		diminished. In addition, these infants are at greater risk for avoidant  		attachments; the frequency increases by 8% (from 20% to 28%) for this  		group.</p>
<p>More professionals are involved in caregiving earlier in a child's life.  		While they believed that an enduring, supportive relationship with a nanny may  		be an optimal alternative, they acknowledged that this type of situation is  		seldom available to most parents. No studies on child care have differentiated  		between types of family care (e.g., a live-in nanny, family day care group,  		commercially operated day care center).</p>
<p>Research has demonstrated that having two secure attachments for an  		infant predicts better outcomes than only one, and that one secure attachment  		is better than having none. This prediction is true when the second attachment  		figure is either a father or a non-parental care provider.</p>
<h4>Attachment Hierarchies</h4>
<p>There is reason to believe that the <b>primary caregiver or principal  		attachment figure in infancy is likely to have a more powerful and long-term  		influence on the child's developmental trajectory than anyone else in  		childhood. In most cases, this person is the mother</b>.</p>
<p>Participants noted that in primate species, the mother and child are  		embedded in a multi-generational, matriarchal kinship network. If a problem  		arises in the primary relationship, some other person in the system contributes  		care.</p>
<p>Grandmothers were cited as being very often important attachment  		figures; but they are rarely included in attachment research.</p>
<h4>Gender Differences</h4>
<p><b>Most studies have not found gender differences in attachment  		patterns</b>. Therefore, participants cautioned against drawing confident  		conclusions from results found in only one or two studies that determine that  		boys are more at risk on attachment issues.</p>
<p>Among humans and other primates, mothers do not treat boys and girls  		very differently in infancy. Nevertheless, large sex differences in behavior  		emerge in the early childhood period and increase in adolescence. Studies with  		primates indicates that the presence of a male exaggerates sex differences in  		the infants.</p>
<h4>Cross-Cultural Research</h4>
<p>Discussion focused on cultural differences in caregiving that affect  		patterns of secure and anxious attachment. For example, in many parts of the  		world, face-to-face interactions between infants and adults is very rare; but  		where caregiving includes breastfeeding and a high degree of responsiveness to  		mild signs of distress, a majority of secure infants may result.</p>
<p>Likewise, many cultures rely on kinship support networks that play major  		roles in the early attachment relationship to the mother. Participants observed  		that isolation of a mother and her young children from others, to the degree  		that is common in the U.S., puts her in a deprived social environment, compared  		to the one in which human behavior evolved.</p>
<h3>Assessment Issues</h3>
<p>Participants agreed that the Strange Situation is a robust assessment  		procedure. This method reflects differences associated with individual care and  		with individual cultures, and identifies care associated with maltreatment,  		maternal depression and maternal alcoholism.</p>
<p>It was agreed that researchers should use the "D" (anxious/disorganized)  		category in all new studies using Strange Situations. They should also attend  		to subgroups of D's, since the history and prognoses for some subgroups are  		drastically different. In addition, recommended re-analysis of videotapes of  		Strange Situations previously participants conducted to include the D  		category.</p>
<p>Researchers require additional cross-cultural data to determine if  		precursors, consequences and major implications of Strange Situations are  		similar or different in each culture.</p>
<p>There is mixed evidence on the usefulness of the <b>Attachment Q-set</b>  		for children up to three-years-old, as well as the reliability of the coding  		patterns of attachment in modified Strange Situations for preschoolers.</p>
<p>The participants did not discuss other assessment situations such as the  		AAI or Hazan and Shaver's self-report because of time constraints and other  		priorities.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The participants agreed that it is difficult to make definitive  		conclusions regarding the complex issue regarding infant attachment. However,  		there are a few broad areas on which the researchers were able to reach  		consensus:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>All babies become attached to a primary caregiver, if one is  			 available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being attached to someone is better than being attached to no  			 one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure attachments are better than insecure attachments for later  			 child development outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Ego resiliency" -- or flexible, adaptive behavior -- is a clear  			 outcome of a secure attachment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attachment occurs within a family context and social community.  			 Consequently, directly or indirectly, attachment outcomes may be affected by  			 interaction among many individuals as well as by environmental  			 characteristics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A secure attachment is not necessary nor sufficient to achieve  			 positive cognitive outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quality of care (in terms of caregiver responsiveness) in the  			 first year or two of life influences the quality of the attachment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>There was less agreement about the degree to which the quantity of  		parental vs. non-parental care (in terms of hours per week) affects the quality  		of the attachment. Many researchers agreed that more research is needed on the  		combined effects of quantity and quality of care on attachment outcomes.</p>
<p>The participants concluded by recommending that naturalistic,  		longitudinal evaluations with larger sample sizes are needed to disentangle the  		mediating effects of environmental and individual characteristics on attachment  		outcomes.</p>
<h2><a name="chapIII" id="chapIII">III. RESEARCH AGENDA</a></h2>
<p>Seminar participants were especially supportive of several key areas for  		future research that they believe are critical to understanding more about  		infant attachment and its consequences on later development.</p>
<p>The participants identified as a top priority <b>extensive naturalistic  		observations of infants, toddlers, and preschoolers in which researchers visit  		families in their homes, over a long period of time, to observe normal  		variations in interaction</b>.</p>
<p>This type of study, while very time-consuming and costly, is the only  		type of research that can clarify issues of major importance in the area of  		infant attachment -- from infant temperament and representational models, to  		specific patterns that underlie anxious/disorganized attachment in both high-  		and low-risk samples. This is the only kind of research that overcomes  		subjects' tendencies to withhold information from observers or to demonstrate  		select behavior.</p>
<p>Participants identified several research areas that focuses on viewing  		the infant in the context of the entire family and with childcare providers.  		Questions most frequently raised throughout the session included:</p>
<ul><li><b> </b>
<p><b>How do infants and toddlers of employed mothers interact with  			 their fathers?</b></p>
</li>
<li><b> </b>
<p><b>How do young children (three to six years old) relate to their  			 fathers?</b></p>
</li>
<li><b> </b>
<p><b>What kind of attachment do infants and toddlers establish with  			 their day care providers?</b></p>
</li>
<li><b> </b>
<p><b>What kind of relationship do three and four-year olds have with  			 their mothers and fathers?</b></p>
</li>
</ul><p>The long-term naturalistic studies provide general information about the  		family regarding infant temperament variables, social support for the mother,  		marital quality, and sibling attachments. Samples from both the lower class and  		upper class, with subsamples from specific racial and ethnic groups would be  		valuable. This type of study, in which families are visited often, over a long  		enough period of time, can begin to answer many questions about types of  		families, including those with <b>employed mothers</b>: How are they different  		from families in which one parent stays with the baby almost all the time? Is  		there more or less maternal intrusiveness? Is there room for father-baby  		interaction? Is there more irritability because everyone is tired and rushed:  		What trade-offs must the families make--about the baby's well-being, the  		mother's well-being, the quality of the marriage--when they have a choice about  		both parents holding full-time jobs? What are successful families doing that  		enable them to meet all members' needs well?</p>
<p>Little information exists regarding the kinds of two-person or  		three-person interactions that influence the patterns of <b>infants'  		attachments to their fathers</b>. In fact, there is almost no data that  		clarifies how fathers interact with babies.</p>
<p>The third area cited, <b>infants and toddlers with child care  		providers</b>, is important in determining the effects of alternative  		caregivers on patterns of attachment. A large number of babies are spending  		most of their time, five days a week, in day care. There are critical questions  		to be asked about child care providers: Do babies almost always become attached  		to their hired non-parental caregivers? Are babies in family day care settings  		more or less likely than babies in institutional day care to form secure  		attachments to their caregivers? How does the high rate of turnover among child  		care providers affect babies? Does a young child who has experienced repeated  		losses of caregivers develop defense mechanisms to guard against forming new  		attachments? Is there a number of hours per week in a child care situation that  		appears to be optimum for infants or children at various ages? Most of these  		questions have yet to be addressed in research.</p>
<p>As children enter new development phases in the <b>preschool</b> years,  		children's attachments enter the phase of goal-corrected partnerships. In  		response to changes in the child's needs and abilities, mothers change the way  		they themselves interact. The variables that influence attachment may differ  		from those which were most relevant in infancy. Fathers may increase their  		involvement and change the nature of the role they play in relation to the  		child. Research needs ethological observations from which conclusions could be  		drawn about both normative changes and individual differences.</p>
<p>The MacArthur Attachment Working Group has been working on interpreting  		laboratory measures of preschooler attachment patterns for years, and continues  		to have difficulty defining subgroups and finding meaningful associations with  		prior experience. Information is needed about the children in their everyday  		environments. Researchers would then have a better chance of developing useful  		laboratory measures and coding systems and would be able to make more  		informative use of existing ones.</p>
<p>In terms of <b>research methodology</b>, the participants also noted  		that more studies of convergent and discriminant validity are needed to clarify  		more effectively what attachment does and does not include, what outcomes it  		should and should not predict. This information would enable researchers to  		speak more precisely about those aspects of parent-child interaction which  		influence attachment outcomes and those variables that influence other outcomes  		(cognitive development, mastery motivation, relationships with peers,  		etc.).</p>
<p>The participants identified specific <b>topics</b> for further study for  		which a variety of research methods would be appropriate, including the  		long-term studies of families in their home or child care environments.</p>
<h3>Babies' Attachment Hierarchies</h3>
<p>Studies in this area would help to answer significant questions: When  		two or more people are extensively involved in caring for and protecting a  		baby, does the baby nevertheless become much more attached to one than to the  		other(s)? If so, how is that figure selected? Will the first primary attachment  		figure have the most impact on the child's representational models,  		self-esteem, personality and associated aspects of development? Can a secure  		attachment to a secondary attachment figure buffer a child from some of the  		negative effects associated with an anxious attachment to the principal  		attachment figure? If a child's primary caregiver and principal attachment  		figure in infancy is a child care provider, will that person later have far  		more influence than the parents on the child's development than is usual in  		other families? When a young child loses a hired caregiver who was an important  		attachment figure, does the child grieve? Do children respond to repeated  		losses by developing long-lasting defenses against new intimate  		relationships?</p>
<h3>Intervention Strategies</h3>
<p>Researchers are becoming increasingly successful in making early  		identifications of babies who are at risk for very disturbed attachment  		patterns and other serious problems. They are also increasingly effective in  		locating and describing intervention strategies for families. More work needs  		to be done in this area.</p>
<h3>Siblings</h3>
<p>Researchers need to understand the similar and different pattern of  		attachments of children with the same mother and make determinations as to why  		there are such varying patterns.</p>
<h3>Representational Models</h3>
<p>Many questions need to be answered about these unconscious structures  		that affect later behavior: How do age-related changes in cognitive abilities  		and memory systems affect the continuing development of representational  		models? At what point in life do representational models so influence new  		perceptions and interactions that they begin to maintain themselves? What  		factors prompt the change of patterns of attachment and the associated  		representational models? How does a child integrate information from different  		sources who may represent conflicting representational models of himself? What  		representational model most influences his interactions with new social  		partners?</p>
<h3>Attachment in Adolescence and Adulthood</h3>
<p>Common questions that are frequently raised regarding the impact of  		attachment in adolescence and adulthood include: To what degree and in what  		ways do childhood patterns of attachment influence the formation of intimate  		relationships in adolescence? In terms of attachment variables, which teenagers  		are most likely to have babies at an early age? Who usually serves as the  		primary attachment figure for the baby of a teenage mother? Is the quality of  		the teenage mother's relationship with her mother a good predictor of the  		quality of her baby's attachment to her? If so, why? What processes affect the  		development of attachment in this population? Do they differ from the processes  		which affect attachment in other populations? Very few data are available in  		this population.</p>
<p>Mary Main's Adult Attachment Interview appears to be an excellent tool  		for studying adults' representational models. Other measures are also now  		available. Research is now able to clarify aspects of marriages and intimate  		friendships that constitute attachment and explain how patterns of attachment  		are related to other aspects of marriage and friendship. Study needs to  		continue on the relationship between the parent's representational models, his  		or her interaction with the baby, and the baby's pattern of attachment.</p>
<p>It would be of great interest to compare Hazan and Shaver's self-report  		measure of attachment and classifications with Main's Adult Attachment  		Interview. Studies of marriages as attachment relationships would also be  		helpful. Throughout childhood, the usual measures of attachment patterns are  		based on behavior at reunion with the attachment figure. Developing a system  		for coding reunion behavior in couples is an obvious next step. It would be  		interesting to learn whether there are correlations in results from reunion  		behavior, AAI classifications and self-report classifications of the sarne  		individuals and couples.</p>
<h3>Cross-Cultural Research</h3>
<p>Research efforts must be expanded to cultures where the patterns of  		childrearing differ noticeably from childrearing in the United States. Again,  		lengthy naturalistic observations repeated over a long period of time are most  		valuable. This kind of study would allow researchers to determine whether the  		Strange Situation procedure is appropriate for assessing patterns of attachment  		in Japan, for example, and whether Japanese Group B babies are indeed more  		secure and likely to show more flexible, adaptive behavior as preschoolers than  		Japanese group C babies. Likewise, it would be easier to determine whether  		German babies identified as group B show more ego resiliency than children who  		were in group A, a pattern found in studies of U.S. babies.</p>
<p>An especially valuable arena for attachment research is the kibbutz in  		Israel where the mother is rarely the principal caregiver in infancy; rather  		one caregiver, the metapelet, spend the most hours with the baby. Questions  		here would focus on whether the baby shows clear, strong, stable preferences  		among the attachment figures when two or three are available simultaneously. In  		this situation, what factors most influence the baby's selection of a principal  		attachment figure?</p>
<p>Within the U.S., opportunities for cross-cultural research are available  		among black, Hispanic, Native American, Chinese and other subcultural groups to  		shed light on the commonalities and variability among cultures in the  		determinants and consequences of the various patterns of infant attachment.</p>
<p>At present, no research has demonstrated whether the consequences of  		avoidant attachment for inner-city minority children differ from their  		consequences for white children in middle-class suburbs. Avoidant attachments  		are fairly common In both groups. Lengthy, repeated, naturalistic observations  		are needed to discover what patterns of interaction underlie the different  		patterns of attachment in different cultural groups. Less expensive research  		designs would suffice to study the sequelae of the different patterns. For  		example, Strange Situations could be conducted on infants at 12 to 18 months of  		age, and repeated at three years to see how they are reacting to nursery  		school. These observations would support the naturalistic studies done at six  		months and provide "snapshots" of their attachment behavior in later  		months.</p>
<h3>Efficient Assessment Procedures</h3>
<p>Long-term naturalistic observations made or reviewed by insightful  		clinicians would maximize the likelihood of developing valid assessment  		procedures. Work oil assessment procedures at several age levels should  		continue. Alternatives to the Strange Situation have been proposed, and there  		is work in progress on assessing attachments in pre-schoolers, 6-year-olds,  		adolescents and adults. The well-validated Strange Situation warrants further  		study regarding its coding and overall use. Laboratories differ from each other  		somewhat in cutoff points for classifying a behavior pattern into some of the  		subgroups, and there is a need to verify or re-establish cross-lab reliability  		in coding. One specific recommendation is to collect a set of videotapes for  		use in training future coders that would include classifications on which  		coders from several different labs had agreed. A second suggestion is to us the  		D category (anxious/disorganized/disoriented) in all Strange Situations and to  		recode all tapes previously done with the D category.</p>
<p>There is certainly reason to believe that early attachments have a  		long-lasting impact on personality, behavior, and intimate relationships. More  		information is needed about their determinants and sequelae, and about the  		experiences which help an individual overcome the effects of a negative  		attachment history.</p>
