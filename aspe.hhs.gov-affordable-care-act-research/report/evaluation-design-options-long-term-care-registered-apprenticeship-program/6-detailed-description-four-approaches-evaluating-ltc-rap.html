    <p>In this section, we describe a four component approach to evaluating the LTC RAP. The four components are: (1) use of the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) administrative dataset to compare apprentices with non-apprentices and LTC RAP employers and non-employers; (2) a cross-sectional telephone survey of apprentices and non-apprentices; (3) focus groups with apprentices and employers without a comparison group; and (4) a cost-benefit analysis of the LTC RAP from the employers perspective. With the exception of the cost-benefit analysis, which depends in part on the analyses of the administrative dataset and the telephone survey, each component is separate, but complementary, and could be funded without the others.</p>

              <p>This option for evaluating the LTC RAP relies on using RAPIDS administrative data on LTC RAP apprentices combined with employer and employee information from the LEHD database, a Census Bureau data file that includes state-level Unemployment Insurance administrative information on employment and earnings. This quasi-experimental strategy identifies a comparable comparison group for LTC RAP apprentices by matching characteristics of apprentices with other long-term care workers in the database who have not participated in the apprenticeship program. Similar matching and comparison is also performed for employer sponsors.</p>
<p><i><b>Research Questions</b></i></p>
<p>This evaluation design helps answer the following research questions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>What is the impact of registered apprenticeship on apprentices?</p>
<ul><li>How does participation in a LTC RAP affect job tenure within an employer, compared to tenure and employment stability in the absence of the apprenticeship program?</li>
<li>How does participation in a LTC RAP affect employment stability within the long-term care industry, compared to employment stability within the long-term care industry in the absence of the apprenticeship program?</li>
<li>How does participation in a LTC RAP affect earnings growth compared to earnings growth in the absence of the apprenticeship program?  </li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>What is the impact of registered apprenticeship on LTC RAP sponsors?</p>
<ul><li>How does offering a LTC RAP affect overall direct care worker turnover, compared to worker turnover in the absence of the apprenticeship program?</li>
<li>How does offering a LTC RAP affect the loss of employees to competing long-term care providers, compared to the loss of employees in the absence of the apprenticeship program?</li>
<li>How does offering a LTC RAP affect employment and revenue growth, compared to employment and revenue growth in the absence of the apprenticeship program?  </li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><i><b>Overview of Evaluation Design</b></i></p>
<p>This quasi-experimental design would use firm and worker level LEHD data on apprenticeship sponsors to construct treatment groups of workers who have participated in apprenticeship programs and comparison groups of workers for non-sponsor long-term care providers. The LEHD is a research program directed by the Census Bureau that combines state administrative data on workers and firms from state Unemployment Insurance programs to generate a national matched quarterly employer-employee database. Because this data is required by law, it is unusually complete and accurate on the limited variables it includes. Unlike administrative data available from individual states, the LEHD data can identify workers who move across state lines and firms who have workers in multiple states. Since the core of the LEHD is a matched employer file and worker file, it captures labor market dynamics from both the firm and the workers perspective. Another feature of the LEHD is that a variety of other Census surveys and Internal Revenue Service data are matched to employers and employees using Social Security numbers and Employer Identification Numbers. These identifiers are not directly available to researchers, but researchers can submit lists of Social Security numbers and Employer Identification Numbers to the Census Bureau to obtain an extract of the LEHD data for analysis.</p>
<p>To answer research questions related to the impact of the LTC RAP on apprentices, the following treatment and comparison groups will be constructed from the LEHD data:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>All workers who have participated in LTC RAPs and all low-wage workers in matched long-term care firms not administering a LTC RAP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All workers who have participated in LTC RAPs and all non-apprentice low-wage workers in LTC RAP sponsoring long-term care firms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All low-wage workers employed by LTC RAP sponsors and all low-wage workers in matched long-term care firms.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>One limitation of the LEHD data in constructing these comparison groups is that low-earning direct care workers employed by long-term care firms cannot be distinguished from other low-earning workers employed in long-term care firms, such as housekeeping staff and dietary workers. However, if a known apprentice is matched to housekeeping/dietary staff in a sample, it will be because their earnings histories are extremely close. This suggests a certain degree of substitutability between occupations. Of course there may be some unobserved motivations and values for these different workers, but what matters is the question <i>if these apprentices had not received an apprenticeship would their wage trajectories be comparable to the earnings trajectories of someone in the same industry with the same earnings history</i>. This limitation is an issue primarily for nursing homes, residential care facilities and group homes for people with intellectual disabilities because they provide room and board and employ substantial numbers of housekeeping and dietary staff members; it is less of a problem for home health agencies because they hire relatively fewer non-direct care staff.</p>
<p>To answer research questions related to the impact of the LTC RAP on employers, the treatment group would be all LTC RAP sponsoring firms and the comparison group would be non-LTC RAP sponsoring long-term care firms matched to the treatment groups on variables, such as geographic location, establishment revenue, and number of low-wage employees using propensity score matching techniques. Propensity score matching uses a statistical model to predict the probability of being in the treatment (apprenticeship) group using a series of observable characteristics. This predicted probability of being in the treatment group is then used to construct weights for the comparison group, which make the weighted comparison group more comparable to the treatment group on observable characteristics, therefore somewhat mimicking random assignment. The impact of registered apprenticeship on employment, earnings, turnover, job growth, and worker separation outcomes can be estimated comparing the difference-in-means between the treatment and comparison groups after matching or, ideally, as a difference-in-differences multivariate model, which compares the differences in the outcome over time for apprentices or firms offering LTC RAP and firms not administering a LTC RAP (a strategy that Mueser,Troske, and Gorislavsky(2007) find to be superior in program evaluations of job training programs using propensity score matching of administrative data).</p>
<p>An important advantage of this evaluation design approach is that it can use all persons who have ever been apprentices in the LTC RAP, including those who no longer work for the long-term care provider that administered the apprenticeship or even those no longer working in long-term care. Since the identification of a comparison group is completed after the identification of LTC RAP apprentices, appropriate comparison groups can be constructed for all LTC RAPs, regardless of their implementation date. Indeed, the use of RAPIDS data over a several year period and over several sponsors helps ensure that outcomes are not affected by cyclical factors, and circumstances in specific local markets. This cannot be guaranteed by an experimental design at a specific site. <b><i><a href="6-detailed-description-four-approaches-evaluating-ltc-rap.html#exhibit5">Exhibit 5</a></i></b> summarizes the proposed LEHD impact analyses.</p>

<p><i><b>Treatment of Long-Term Care Occupations</b></i></p>
<p>Occupations are identified in the RAPIDS database with occupational codes. In contrast, the LEHD data do not identify worker occupations, but they do identify the industry of the employer. This would typically be an obstacle to identifying an appropriate comparison group, but in the case of long-term care there is a close correspondence between occupation and industry groups. The predominant LTC RAP occupations are CNAs, HHAs, HSSs and DSSs. These occupations align with the industry sectors presented in <b><i><a href="6-detailed-description-four-approaches-evaluating-ltc-rap.html#exhibit6">Exhibit 6</a></i></b>.</p>

<p>Treatment cases of a specific occupation in the RAPIDS data can be matched to corresponding comparison cases employed by a firm in the corresponding industry in the LEHD data in two different ways. First, treatment cases could be segregated by industrial sector, and matched exclusively to comparison cases in the same sector, so that the propensity score matching is done separately by industry group (which is expected to correspond closely to the occupation group of interest). However, some long-term care firms provide several different services, but are required by state administrative data systems to report only one industry (typically their predominant activity). For example, a nursing home facility operated by a hospital might be classified as a hospital rather than a nursing home for its industry codes, because the hospital facility is the firms predominant activity. To account for this, a second option is to consider all treatment cases (i.e., not segregate them by industry), match them to all comparison cases, and use industry groups as a matching variable only, rather than as a way of identifying industrial sub-samples.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Design</b></i></p>
<p>Potential selection bias in this quasi-experimental evaluation of the LTC RAP could occur in at least two ways: the non-random selection of different providers into the LTC RAP initiative or the non-random selection of different employees into the LTC RAP within the provider. One possibility is that higher quality, more financially secure long-term care providers are more likely to start a LTC RAP. On the other hand, those long-term care providers already doing well and satisfied with their training programs may be least likely to use the LTC RAP. From this perspective, bias could run in either direction, especially if the comparison is based on levels and not on changes for each group.</p>
<p>Also, site visits indicate that higher quality employees are generally chosen to participate in the LTC RAPs as apprentices. If so, estimates based on simple comparisons of participants and non-participants might overstate the impact of LTC RAP. To address this problem, an evaluation can use propensity score matching on pre-apprenticeship enrollment earnings (which should help to capture unobservable human capital that contributes to on-the-job productivity), age, gender, job tenure, firm size, and industry to identify a comparison sample. Pre-program earnings and employment records may be a good matching indicator, one likely to capture individual differences in unmeasured pre-program characteristics related to performance in the job market. While variation in <i>wage rates</i> is modest for long-term care workers, there is considerable variation in hours worked and in job tenure. Since the LEHD only provides information on quarterly earnings (i.e., hourly wages multiplied by hours worked), there should be more variation in earnings than in wages. This method is widely used by evaluators of other programs targeted at low-wage workers (Mueser,Troske, and Gorislavsky, 2007 ).</p>
<p>Access to the universe of long-term care providers and LTC RAP sponsors in state Unemployment Insurance administrative data systems through the LEHD allows for the construction of a variety of comparison and treatment groups. Testing between multiple treatment and comparison groups enables evaluators to address biases that may be present in some specifications, but not others. For example, potential selection bias may produce a regression estimate either above or below the true effect. Using two different comparison groups for each outcome will allow generation of these upper and lower bound effects so that the true effect can be bounded between the two estimates. This strategy provides some assurance of the range of the treatment effect.</p>
<p>Multiple treatment/comparison group pairs are amenable to the propensity score matching approach, and each pair has advantages and disadvantages associated with it. These are summarized in <b><i><a href="6-detailed-description-four-approaches-evaluating-ltc-rap.html#exhibit7">Exhibit 7</a></i></b>. If propensity score matching on observable characteristics successfully accounts for unobservable characteristics of apprentices and LTC RAP sponsors because they are correlated with the unobservable characteristics, then selection biases can be minimized.</p>

<p>If propensity score matching on observable characteristics successfully accounts for unobservable characteristics of apprentices and LTC RAP sponsors because they are correlated with the unobservable characteristics, then selection biases can be minimized.</p>
<p><i>1. Treatment Groups</i></p>
<p>The treatment groups used in the evaluation, presented in <b><i><a href="6-detailed-description-four-approaches-evaluating-ltc-rap.html#exhibit8">Exhibit 8</a></i></b>, will be drawn from employers and apprentices in the RAPIDS data that are identifiable in the LEHD data. The LEHD covers all workers covered by the state Unemployment Insurance program (which should be the entire RAPIDS universe). A total of over 4,300 unique LTC RAP participants are included in the RAPIDS system between January 2005 and May 2011, representing 119 programs. This treatment group may expand if more LTC RAPs are implemented between May 2011 and any evaluation. If sample sizes were adequate, separate analyses could be conducted of workers who completed the apprenticeship program, people currently in the program, and people who dropped out prior to completing the program. It is not uncommon for social programs to have high dropout rates and be effective for those who complete the program. </p>

<p><i>2. Comparison Groups</i></p>
<p>If all LTC RAPs were implemented simultaneously, a single comparison group could be chosen for all programs. However, this is not the case. In order to guarantee that pre-apprenticeship characteristics of the treatment group are matched to characteristics of the comparison group during the same time frame, propensity score matching must be conducted separately for each quarterly wave of LTC RAP registration. Thus, the apprentices that register with a LTC RAP at varying points in time will be matched to comparison cases from the LEHD data on the basis of quarterly earnings occurring before the LTC RAP registration.</p>
<p>The propensity score matching to determine the appropriate weights for the comparison group would follow Rubin (2001) and Mueser, Troske, and Gorislavsky (2007) , and consist of an estimation of the predicted probability of being in the treatment group as a Logit function of eight quarters of earnings data and a set of additional variables, including industry/occupation group and geographic location for each quarter of the LEHD data available.</p>
<p>The propensity score matching approach is applied in two different ways to obtain the different comparison groups desired. In the first way, one applies propensity score weighting to construct a comparison group of roughly the same size as the treatment group (e.g., apprentices). In the second way, one applies weights to the population at large from whom the comparison group is drawn (e.g., all long-term care employers). Apprentices or employers/sponsors which have a close match get a high weight and apprentices or employer/sponsors which do not have a close match get a low weight. </p>
<p><i><b>Estimated Statistical Power</b></i></p>
<p>Evaluators develop statistical power calculations in order to determine the minimum sample size necessary to have confidence in the studys ability to detect a policy relevant impact. Interest in identifying the minimum sample size needed is common because of the cost of obtaining a larger sample, for example, by increasing the number of people required to complete surveys. For this particular evaluation, the evaluator would have access to a large sample at very modest cost. To be conservative, for the apprentice-level calculations, we used the approximate number of apprentices (3,750) in the RAPIDS data at the end of 2009 for the size of each of the treatment and control groups in the comparisons to be made. For the employer sponsor calculation, we assumed 150 employer sponsors would have a LTC RAP by the time a potential evaluation was fielded; in other words, we assumed that additional programs would be added to the current 119 employer sponsors.</p>
<p>In estimating power calculations, the issue is: How small a difference in each outcome measure (e.g., the impact) can be detected at p&lt;0.05 with approximately 80% power given the number of apprentices (or employer sponsors) in the analysis for the variation (expressed as the standard deviation) in the outcome measure? Statistical power is the degree of confidence (probability) with which one can correctly reject the hypothesis that there is no impact. Conventionally, statisticians suggest that power of 80% is satisfactory.</p>
<p>We estimated statistical power for three different outcomes -- apprentice annual earnings and job tenure, and employer sponsor-level turnover. For the outcome measure of apprentice annual earnings, the analysis could detect a difference as small as $300 in annual earnings using mean annual earnings of $21,000 and a standard deviation of $5,000, and assuming 3,750 employees each in the apprentice and comparison groups. For the outcome measure of apprentice job tenure, the analysis could detect a difference in job tenure as small as 0.7 months using mean tenure of 30 months and a standard deviation of 12 months, assuming 3,750 employees each in the apprentice and comparison groups. For the outcome measure of annual employer-sponsor turnover (where turnover is expressed in percentage points), the analysis could detect a difference as small as 5 percentage points using a mean turnover rate of 55 percentage points and a standard deviation of 25 percentage points, assuming 150 employers in the LTC RAP employer sponsor group and almost 99,850 employers in the comparison group. In each case, the evaluator would be able to detect even relatively low impacts of the LTC RAP.</p>
<p><i><b>Domains on Which Information Will Be Gathered</b></i></p>
<p>Information will be collected on treatment and comparison cases using data from the LEHD. An advantage of using this data is that it ensures that information is collected consistently across all programs, and between treatment and comparison groups. The primary domains on which information will be gathered are:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>Quarterly earnings</b>: Earnings recorded in state unemployment insurance data systems are reported in the LEHD for each job held in a quarter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Quarterly employment</b>: Cases will be considered employed in a quarter if they have positive earnings during that quarter. Quarterly employment information can also be used to construct a job tenure variable, which can be used for matching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Industry</b>: The LEHD records four digit NAICS industry codes which will be mapped on to occupational codes in the RAPIDs data (see <b><i><a href="6-detailed-description-four-approaches-evaluating-ltc-rap.html#exhibit6">Exhibit 6</a></i></b>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Employer</b>: Employer Identification Numbers are also provided in the LEHD data so that in addition to assessing the impact of the LTC RAP on employment and earnings in general, attachment to the RAP sponsoring firm, and firm turnover will also be determined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Geographic location</b>: The geographic location of long-term care providers will be an important matching variable, which ensures that long-term care providers are compared to cases operating in comparable long-term care markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Demographic characteristics</b>: Age and gender are available on employees in the LEHD and can also be used to match. Education level and race/ethnicity are not available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Firm revenue</b>: Gross revenues collected in economic censuses and linked to the LEHD can be used for matching to ensure that treatment cases are compared to comparison cases from similar sized firms.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition to this primary information, other firm-level data available in the LEHD may be used to improve the quality of the match between treatment and comparison groups. For example, information on firm age, if complete, could contribute to the quality of the match.</p>
<p><i><b>Data Collection Process</b></i></p>
<p>While no primary data collection will be necessary for this evaluation design, data will be obtained from the LEHD, which is maintained by the Census Bureau. Researchers must apply to the Census Bureau for use of the LEHD data for specific projects. This application process can be time consuming, and should be initiated very early in the evaluation process. Evaluators will not be able to identify data linked to specific Social Security numbers or employer identification numbers, but they will be able to submit these identifiers to the Census Bureau, so that cases can be extracted and assigned an identification number for the analysis.</p>
<p>Social Security numbers and Employer Identification Numbers for LTC RAP sponsors and participants will be drawn from the RAPIDs data for submission to the Census Bureau. After applying for use of the LEHD data and signing a data users agreement, the Census Bureau will provide:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>All LEHD cases that have Social Security numbers that match the Social Security numbers of LTC RAP participants. These Social Security numbers will be replaced with personal identification keys and an indicator variable identifying the cases as apprentices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All LEHD cases that do not have Social Security numbers that match the Social Security numbers of registered apprenticeship program participants, but who have been employed by firms that have sponsored LTC RAPs. These firms will be identified by an Employer Identification Number submitted to the Census Bureau. Social Security numbers for these cases will be replaced with personal identification keys and an indicator variable identifying these cases as non-apprentices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All LEHD cases who have been employed by firms that have not sponsored LTC RAPs but who have reported NAICS industry codes associated with the long-term care industry (Codes 6231, 6216, 6233, 6232, 6239, and 6241).</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Time Frame to Collect and Analyze Data</b></i></p>
<p>We anticipate that the LEHD analysis option would take approximately 27 months to complete. The activities would include initial planning and data acquisition, including obtaining Social Security numbers for matching RAPIDS to LEHD data (15 months), data cleaning and analysis (6 months), and report development (6 months). According to DOL officials, the application process for obtaining personal data, such as Social Security numbers, takes about a year.</p>
<p><i><b>Cost</b></i></p>
<p>We estimate costs for this option to be approximately $285,000.</p>
<p><i><b>Statistical Methods for Analyzing the Data</b></i></p>
<p><i>1. Propensity Score Matching</i></p>
<p>Propensity score matching methods will be used to generate an appropriate comparison group for the quasi-experimental evaluation design. This technique generates weights to be applied to the comparison group so that it more closely resembles the treatment group on observable variables. The match will be conducted by producing a predicted probability of being in the treatment group using a logit model of treatment group status as a function of earnings history, employment history, geographic location, industry, and other matching variables.</p>
<p>Ideally, matching on these observable characteristics should help to control for other unobservable characteristics as well. Certain apprentice characteristics may be correlated with the earnings of apprentices, although these characteristics are not measured in the LEHD data. While wages for direct care workers do not vary greatly (Khatutsky, Wiener, Anderson et al., 2011), the number of hours worked do , so some of the variation in earnings may reflect the unmeasured characteristics of workers selected to become apprentices.</p>
<p>Once a predicted probability of being in the treatment group is produced for all members of the comparison group, a variety of matching strategies can be used that predict probability to weight the comparison group. These include the nearest neighbor method, the odds ratio method, and the Kernel density method. The nearest neighbor method pairs each treatment case with the comparison case that has the closest propensity score to it, generating a one-to-one match between the treatment and comparison group. The odds ratio method and the Kernel density method generate a weight for all comparison cases using the propensity score. Comparison cases with high propensity scores are given high weights, and those with low propensity scores are given low weights. Mueser, Troske, and Gorislavsky (2007) find that impact estimates for job training programs are not especially sensitive to the choice of matching method. In order to confirm the robustness of any evaluation of the LTC RAP initiative, multiple matching methods should be used. After implementing these matching strategies, Rubin (2001) suggests several balancing tests to confirm the strength of the match. The balancing tests are various versions of a difference of means test on the matching variables. A strong match should reduce statistically important differences between the treatment and comparison groups on the matching variables.</p>
<p><i>2. Impact Estimation</i></p>
<p>Once the propensity score matching method produces a viable comparison group, several estimation strategies can be used to produce an estimate of the impact of the LTC RAP program, including a difference of means test of post-registration earnings with and without regression adjustment, and a difference-in-differences test of earnings with and without regression adjustment. Mueser, Troske, and Gorislavsky (2007) find that the difference-in-differences estimator is more faithful to random assignment results, although multiple approaches should be attempted and compared. The estimated differences can be examined by the level of the propensity score; thus, one can observe changes in earnings for those most likely selected for the program as compared with changes in earnings for those least likely to be selected. Sample size constraints may limit the principal subgroup analysis to the CNA and DSS occupational categories, although other characteristics of workers (e.g., age or race) may also be of interest.</p>
<p><i>3. Alternative Versions of the Administrative Data Design</i></p>
<p>If selection bias is considered to be a major obstacle to evaluation of the LTC RAP, other alternative non-experimental strategies can be considered using LEHD data administrative data. One alternative strategy is a regression discontinuity design, which uses pre-determined cut-offs in the assignment of treatment to identify the impact of the treatment. For example, all CNAs at Agape Senior are ranked, and apprentices are chosen from among the top 20% of employees. Since there is a sharp cut-off in the assignment of treatment, cases immediately above and immediately below the cut-off are expected to be very similar on all of their characteristics, except for their admission to apprenticeship, generating a type of natural experiment. Regression discontinuity designs might be appropriate for LTC RAPs which use some sort of test or evaluation to assign employees to the apprenticeship. Only a minimal difference is expected in the performance of employees in the 79th percentile compared to the 80th percentile, but there is a large difference in likelihood of becoming an apprentice. The change in the outcome variable at this point of discontinuity provides a reasonable estimate of the impact of the treatment. Although not common among LTC RAPs, Agape Senior is probably not the only LTC RAP program that uses an objective employee performance measure to decide who will participate (or at least who will be offered the opportunity to participate) in the apprenticeship program. If enough programs use this approach, it may be possible to use this analytic approach. Sample sizes and the frequency of using this approach of selecting apprentices may, however, limit the feasibility of this approach, especially for a national evaluation.</p>

              <p>Survey data collection and analysis is a potential evaluation option to address research questions regarding the apprenticeship experience on topics not available in secondary data. For the LTC RAP evaluation, a survey of apprentices would provide systematic quantitative information on the experiences of apprentices with the LTC RAP compared to direct care workers not in the LTC RAP.</p>
<p><i><b>Research Questions</b></i></p>
<p>A survey of direct care workers who have participated in the LTC RAP program, including those who did not complete the program and a comparison group would address a range of research questions that cannot be answered directly by employers, sponsors, or partnering organizations or through administrative data, such as the LEHD. Potential research questions center on how the LTC RAP affects:</p>
<ul><li>Job satisfaction</li>
<li>Intent to leave the job and the long-term care field</li>
<li>Participation in welfare programs (SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, etc.)</li>
<li>Relationship with supervisor, other staff members, and clients</li>
<li>Confidence in caregivingabilities</li>
<li>Knowledge and skills of caring for people with disabilities</li>
<li>Time and financial investment on the part of apprentices to participate</li>
<li>Opinions about the LTC RAP</li>
<li>Opinions about other training for direct care work</li>
<li>Future career plans
</li>
</ul><p>These research outcomes for the survey are generally more difficult to measure than outcomes like annual earnings, wages, and job tenure. Ideally, the outcome measures should be tested to ensure that they are valid and reliable measures and that there is variation in the responses. For example, commonly used measures of job satisfaction typically report very high levels of respondents who are extremely or very satisfied with their job (Bishop et al., 2009 ). Thus, it might be difficult to measure the impact of the LTC RAP on this dimension.</p>
<p><i><b>Brief Overview of Design</b></i></p>
<p>The suggested design would involve a survey of apprentices in facilities/agencies operating apprenticeship programs and a matched sample of non-apprentices at a single point in time. Thus, this survey would be a cross-sectional design; it would be able to find association between variables, but it would not be claim that the LTC RAP caused the differences because it does not measure changes over time. All direct care workers who started the apprenticeship program and still working for the facility/agency employer which administered the LTC RAP would be included. Non-apprentices would be employees of either branches within the same organization that are not implementing the apprenticeship program or employees of wholly different long-term care provider organizations not implementing apprenticeship programs.</p>
<p>A telephone survey is recommended to obtain data from apprentices. Given the number of sites and the small number of apprentices at most sites, an in-person survey would be prohibitively expensive. In addition, direct care workers generally have low education and literacy skills, and may also have cultural differences that make a mail survey problematic. Workers may have difficulty reading and interpreting the questions. In addition, similar surveys of CNAs (National Nursing Assistant Survey) and HHAs (National Home Health Aide Survey) have been successfully conducted by telephone.</p>
<p>The survey will be administered as a computer assisted telephone interview (CATI), which will ensure standardized question administration and will reduce data entry costs. Also to minimize costs, the survey would only be conducted in English and Spanish, but not other languages. The survey would be conducted over a 4-month period. Contact information, such as telephone numbers and addresses, for apprentices and the comparison group workers will be obtained from employers. As a practical matter, obtaining contact information for apprentices who have left the employment of the provider that trained them will be difficult if not impossible and will not be attempted. The survey administrator would vary the days and times of contact attempts in order to maximize the possibility of reaching sample members to schedule the full interview.</p>
<p>Given the similarity in the goals of the apprenticeship programs across the four occupations of the LTC RAP, and the relative few numbers of apprentices in some occupations such as HHA and HSSs, a single survey across all occupations is recommended. Even with the entire universe of apprentices, the number of completed surveys for HHAs and health care support specialists is too small to analyze separately. To control for differences across occupations, the four main LTC RAP occupations will be entered as control variables in the multivariate analyses. Subgroup analyses of CNAs, the largest occupation, and DSSs, the second largest occupation, will be possible if there is a large enough number of respondents.</p>
<p>Given the relatively small number of employers/sponsors and of apprentices, the sample design should include all current and past apprenticeship sponsors/employers and all apprentices currently employed by these employers/sponsors, including those who have already completed their apprenticeships and those who did not complete the apprenticeship. The evaluator will need to identify through secondary data (such as RAPIDS) or directly through employers those apprentices that are still working for them. The comparison group of workers who have not participated in LTC RAP will be drawn from the same or, more likely, other organizations providing similar types of services.</p>
<p>The sample should result in approximately the same number of completed surveys for apprentices and for comparison group members. To achieve this result, the evaluator will likely need to oversample the comparison group because the response rate may be lower because of their lack of knowledge and interest in an evaluation of the LTC RAP. For prior surveys of CNAs and HHAs, the ASPE/NCHS achieved roughly 75% response rates for facilities/agencies and a 75% response rate for workers, giving a 50% overall response rate.</p>
<p>Conservatively, using RAPIDS data, slightly lower response rates of about 67% for the 80 current employers with approximately 1,500 apprentices in training currently would yield about 1,000 completed surveys for apprentices. Consistent with the 2004 National Nursing Assistant Survey which provided a monetary incentive to workers to encourage participation, this survey will provide a $35 incentive payment. We do not anticipate payment of incentives to employers to provide the contact information.</p>
<p>The sample would include a comparison group of workers from providers not sponsoring apprenticeships or from non-apprenticeship-sponsoring branches of parent organizations who have apprenticeships in some, but not all branches. However, only a few sponsoring employers have multiple branches to make selection of comparison group members possible. Therefore, most, if not all of the comparison group would need to be drawn from non-apprenticeship-sponsoring organizations, which would have to be recruited to the study.</p>
<p>To provide a close comparison to apprentices and their sponsoring employers, comparison organizations ideally would be in same geographic area and have comparable size, ownership status, payer mix, and other important characteristics. This data is routinely collected for nursing homes and home health agencies by CMS, but is not available at the national level for other types of providers participating in LTC RAP. For other providers, many long-term care employers are members of state and national associations, and comparison group employers for these providers could be identified through their membership rosters. In addition, if ASPE and NCHS grant permission to use it, RTI International developed a sample frame of residential care facilities for use in the 2010 National Survey of Residential Care Facilities (Wiener et al., 2010 ). NCHS recently awarded a contract to RTI International to update the sample frame for residential care facilities in 2012.</p>
<p>Motivating non-apprenticeship-sponsoring facilities to participate will be difficult because of lack of interest or knowledge about LTC RAP or the perceived cost of participating. Moreover, facilities may not believe it is in their best interest to have outsiders asking their workers about subjects such as job satisfaction, relationships with supervisors, and wages and benefits. Employers may also be reluctant to release personal contact information or Social Security numbers of workers without their explicit permission, even if the employers are supportive of the survey. Letters of support from provider associations and high-ranking HHS and DOL officials may help with recruitment.</p>
<p>Comparison group members need to closely resemble apprentices in selected characteristics. Therefore, comparison group direct care workers ideally should be prospectively matched with apprentices, potentially using employment history/earnings, age, gender, race, education or similar factors, but doing so would be difficult. Alternatively, the evaluator could control for such matching retrospectively through statistical adjustments if sufficient data were collected from both apprentices and non-apprentices. Potential response bias may still occur if important variables are not collected during the survey. For example, apprentices and non-apprentices may vary on unobserved characteristics (e.g., altruism or motivation) for which data is not collected or successfully measured.</p>
<p><i><b>Estimated Statistical Power</b></i></p>
<p>Preliminary calculations of statistical power needed to detect differences in outcomes such as satisfaction or intent to leave suggest that the apprentice group would need to have 1,000 respondents and 600 comparison group workers for a total sample of 1,600 respondents. These numbers for completed respondents are of this magnitude to allow for sufficient power for subgroup analyses of CNAs and DSSs, the two largest occupation groups. Respondent group sizes in excess of these numbers to provide enough statistical power for subgroup analyses of HHA and HSSs.</p>
<p>Measures such as job satisfaction and intent to leave ones job have relatively little statistical variation (Bishop et al., 2009 ), therefore relatively large numbers of apprentice and comparison group members are needed to detect statistically significant differences as small as 5 percentage points at probability of less than 0.05 (p&lt;0.05). For a binary outcome variable in logit analysis such as Satisfied/Not Satisfied defined on a 100 percentage point scale, one could detect a difference as small as 1.25 percentage points using a mean of 82 percentage points and a standard deviation of 10 percentage points, assuming 1,000 apprentices and 600 comparison group members. We believe a sample of this size would provide sufficient power for assessing impact.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Frame Construction for Programs and Apprentices</b></i></p>
<p>To identify sample frame members, lead letters from important HHS and DOL officials and letters of support from the relevant provider associations would be prepared and sent to prospective employers. These letters would provide assurances that the privacy of participating employers and employees will be protected. Senior staff from the evaluator would contact employer sponsors by phone to introduce themselves and address any remaining questions and solicit commitment in participation. Once agreeing to participate, employers would provide contact information (e.g., names, telephone numbers, and addresses) of their currently employed employees who ever participated in the LTC RAP and non-apprentice workers from other branches if possible. Similar information would be obtained from the comparison group facilities. Sample members would be sent a pre-notification letter 1 week before interviewing is scheduled to give advance notice to sample members that they have been chosen for a survey, establish survey legitimacy, and provide information about the survey.</p>
<p>Survey organizations often experience problems obtaining valid telephone numbers for potential respondents. Lower income people such as long-term care workers may not have listed landlines, and it is not likely cell phone numbers could be attained independently of the employers. Employers may or may not be willing to share home or cell phone numbers of workers, and it would not be appropriate to survey workers while on the job because of potential fear of retaliation by management if they criticize the facility/agency or their supervisors. Thus, the proportion of apprentices who are successfully contacted may be lower than anticipated.</p>
<p><i><b>Domains on Which Information Will Be Gathered</b></i></p>
<p>The survey will collect information on the outcomes of interest (e.g., satisfaction, intent to leave, new knowledge and skills attained) and also on an array of other domains which will be used in analyses to statistically control for factors not related to the effect of apprenticeship. These domains include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Worker background (e.g., demographics, socioeconomic status, family relationships, residence status).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personality inventory to assess fit with caregiver role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employment history (e.g., number and types of previous jobs, relative prior pay and availability of benefits, previous training, life/employment skills).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Availability and uptake of fringe benefits offered.</p>

</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Questionnaire Development</b></i></p>
<p>The evaluator would identify the specific domains that will be included in the questionnaire and, would identify potential questions and issues related to data collection. After obtaining feedback from ASPE and DOL, the evaluator would begin to develop the actual draft questionnaire. The evaluator would prepare an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance package to include the essential supporting statement sections (e.g., justification, effort to identify duplication, methods to minimize burden, cost and response burden estimates, publication plans, and statistical methodology) and relevant information on research questions and survey protocol. The final OMB clearance package will include the final questionnaire.</p>
<p><i><b>Data Collection Process</b></i></p>
<p>The survey would be conducted using a CATI system and last approximately 30 minutes. Once an interviewer makes an initial contact with a potential respondent, the interviewer will schedule a time to administer the survey. At that time, the interviewer would administer the introduction, which would include obtaining informed consent from the respondent and assures of privacy of responses. The interviewer will then administer the survey, following the script that the CATI program displays on the computer screen. The CATI system conducts edit checks for appropriate response values and correct use of skip patterns to increase data accuracy during the interview. As data are collected daily, project staff would review responses and generate frequencies and means of key variables to ensure that data look as expected and no unusual response patterns are observed. Similarly, project staff would monitor response rates daily by apprenticeship and comparison group and for the sample overall. Should response rates be lower than expected, staff would implement corrective measures, such as varying the number of call attempts or call schedule or developing more targeted scripts to address refusals or questions that sample members may have.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the data collection period, the data would be cleaned (e.g., provide standardized codes for yes, no, refusal and dont know responses) and a dataset would be created for analysis. As part of the creation of the final dataset, programmers would prepare an accompanying codebook containing questions and responses, as well as key data collection variables such as date of interview and final disposition code for any non-interviews.</p>
<p><i><b>Time Frame to Collect and Analyze Data</b></i></p>
<p>We anticipate that the entire survey option would take approximately 2.5 years to complete. The activities would include questionnaire and sample frame design (6 months), preparation of OMB package and clearance (8 months), data collection (6 months), data cleaning (2 months), and analysis and reporting (8 months).</p>
<p><i><b>Ballpark Cost</b></i></p>
<p>We estimate the total costs for conducting the survey are approximately $450,000, which includes questionnaire and sample frame design, translation of the survey into Spanish, preparation of OMB package and clearance, data collection in English and Spanish, data cleaning, and analysis and reporting. Costs for the actual data collection would be approximately $335,000, which include costs for programming the 30-minute, closed-item 75-question survey into the CATI system, interviewer training, developing and mailing all pre-notification letters, delivering an English and Spanish-language CATI survey over a 4-month period, multiple call attempts for approximately 10 days, a survey case management system to schedule and track calling attempts and survey status, a $35 incentive for survey completion, cleaning the data and preparing a SAS dataset with survey frequencies and documentation of all coded items.</p>
<p><i><b>Main Statistical Methods for Analyzing Data</b></i></p>
<p>The data would be analyzed using both descriptive and multivariate regression techniques. Means for all analysis variables would be prepared for all respondents and for apprentice versus comparison group members. Descriptive analyses using comparisons of means (e.g., age) and proportions (e.g., gender) and cross tabulations of outcome measures (e.g., satisfaction, intent to leave) with selected characteristics of interest (e.g., employer profit status, worker job tenure) would be calculated. Descriptive analyses without testing for statistically significant differences could be calculated on apprentices with varying characteristics, but small sample sizes for given characteristics (e.g., those with any specialty training, various occupations, and source of related training instruction) would prevent much statistical significance testing for such differences on outcomes.</p>
<p>Multivariate regression would be used to analyze the effects of participating in apprenticeship on outcome measures representing the key research questions. The outcome measures are typically multilevel outcomes (e.g., extremely satisfied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, extremely dissatisfied) that would be analyzed using multinomial logit, or multiple levels could be combined into only two levels and analyzed using logit. The principal independent policy variable would be a yes/no indicator of any participation in apprenticeship. The basic empirical model analyzed that would control for apprenticeship and other domains that are hypothesized to affect the outcome of interest would be:</p>
<blockquote><p>Outcome = yes/no indicator of apprenticeship, demographic and socioeconomic status, family relationships, residence status, personality type, employment history, employer benefits, organizational culture, pre-apprenticeship training + error</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There potentially may be enough CNAs and DSSs in the data to estimate regression analyses on that subgroup of apprentices, but there would not be enough apprentices in the remaining occupations to perform similar analyses. However, it is not likely that there would be sufficient statistical power to test for statistically significant differences in apprenticeship characteristics (e.g., specialty versus only advanced competencies) among the subgroup of apprentices in regressions because few apprentices with such characteristics are likely to be represented in the data. Because we anticipate that the universe of employer/sponsors and the universe of their currently employed apprentices would be used to construct the sample frame, descriptive and multivariate analyses would not have to control for the effects of the sample design.</p>

              <p>Primary data collection using focus groups may provide a low-cost research design option that would obtain information to inform policy. Focus groups would provide a means for apprentices to voice opinions on a range of topics about how the apprenticeship program works from their perspective, its strengths and weaknesses, and how it could be improved. Focus groups of employer sponsors could provide information on why they chose an apprenticeship program and important program elements, and what they perceive to be the benefits to employers and apprentices. In both cases, focus groups allow for a more extensive, open-ended data gathering than is possible in a survey. The focus groups would also allow gathering detailed information about the LTC RAP professions for which there are two few sites to conduct statistical analyses. Because the data is qualitative and does not include a large enough sample to conduct statistical analyses, it cannot answer such quantitative questions as whether LTC RAP increases earnings or reduces turnover.</p>
<p><i><b>Research Questions</b></i></p>
<p>The research questions to be addressed by the focus groups center on the motivation for entering/starting the LTC RAP and the views of direct care workers and employers about the operation of the program.</p>
<p><i>1. Apprentices</i></p>
<p>Potential research questions to be addressed by focus groups of apprentices include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>How and to what extent does apprenticeship affect caregiving abilities? What types of new knowledge and skills were attained? How and how well does the apprenticeship teach hard and soft skills and problem-solving skills?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the apprenticeship affect working with supervisors and working in teams? How do the apprentices relate to comparable workers who do not participate in the LTC RAP?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does apprenticeship differ from other training previously received?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What personal funds and time did apprentices use in order to participate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Were they able to complete the apprenticeship and why or why not?</p>

<p>What changes would they suggest making in the apprenticeship program?</p>

</li>
</ul><p><i>2. Employers</i></p>
<p>Research questions to be addressed by focus groups of employer sponsors would include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Why did the organization choose an apprenticeship program to train and develop direct care workers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What relationships with outside organizations were beneficial in developing your program?</p>
</li>

</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Brief Overview of Research Design</b></i></p>
<p><i>1. Apprentice Focus Groups</i></p>
<p>This evaluation design would conduct multiple apprentice and employer/sponsor focus groups. First, eight apprentice focus groups in eight sites would be conducted. The evaluator would recruit apprentices from selected employer sponsors who would provide the names and contact information for all of their employed apprentices. Employers would not be allowed to select the participants. Two focus groups would be conducted for each of the four LTC RAP occupations. Conducting more than one focus group for each occupation and conducting multiple focus groups across employers minimizes the possibility that results are purely idiosyncratic or reflect the experience of just a few participants who are the most verbal in an individual group. Final site selection of employer sponsors would occur after discussions with ASPE and DOL. Possible selection criteria for identifying employer sponsors from whom apprentices would be selected would be total number of apprentices employed, occupation type, ownership type and chain status.</p>
<p>Each focus group will consist of approximately 8-9 worker participants, for a total of approximately 70 participants. Budget assumptions are based on recruiting English speaking participants in order to avoid the added costs associated with translating the focus group protocol into the additional language and translating the focus group discussion into English. Even though 70 participants would be included, OMB clearance would probably not be needed because each focus group would contain a maximum of nine individuals, and question scripts would necessarily differ across occupations and by employer so that no set of focus group questions would be the same. </p>
<p>The evaluator would work with each employer to help arrange for local logistics for conducting each focus group. In order to encourage workers to be candid, the focus group will be held at a location away from the employers work site, but convenient for the apprentices. A small token of appreciation would be provided to the employer for their efforts in providing the names and contact information of the apprentices and suggesting focus group locations. A $75 payment would be provided to focus group members as an incentive to participate.</p>
<p>No comparison group of non-apprentices would be involved. With such small numbers of participants, no statistical analysis would be performed.</p>
<p><i>2. Employer Focus Groups</i></p>
<p>Because of the difficulty and expense of bringing employer sponsors around the country together for a focus group, only two focus groups of LTC RAP employer sponsors is proposed. For convenience, this focus group would occur as a side meeting of long-term care national association annual meetings. For example, the American Health Care Association and LeadingAge are two of the largest national associations of nursing homes and residential care facilities. Currently, many LTC RAP employer sponsors are members of these organizations. Both organizations have annual meetings at which a focus group potentially could be conducted.</p>
<p>In addition to invitations to employer sponsors from the evaluator, letters from officials of the national associations and high ranking HHS and DOL officials encouraging organizational members to participate in the focus groups would be included to promote the importance and legitimacy of the endeavor. The evaluator would select up to nine employer sponsors from each association who would attend separate focus groups. Once contacted, the evaluator would work to identify the best day and time across all selected employer sponsor personnel attending their respective national association meetings. Employer sponsors would not incur additional costs for attending the focus group session beyond their time to prepare and attend. Therefore, only some nominal incentive payment to participants is anticipated.</p>
<p><i><b>Sample Frame Construction</b></i></p>
<p>For the apprentice focus groups, the entire universe of employers and currently employed apprentices, all identified from the most recent RAPIDS data extract, would serve as the sample frame. Employers would be stratified by their LTC RAP occupations and number of employed apprentices, and on selected apprenticeship program characteristics thought to be instrumental in conducting apprenticeships such as ownership status. Once employers are identified, all currently employed past and current apprentices would be eligible for recruitment. For the employer sponsor focus groups, the evaluator would work with association management to identify a convenience sample of LTC RAPs in RAPIDS data who are members of the respective associations.</p>
<p><i><b>Domains on Which Information Will Be Gathered</b></i></p>
<p>To guide discussion, the evaluator would develop a focus group protocol and structured discussion guides, including specific questions with suggested probes. The protocol would include discussion of approximately 7-8 topics and last about 2 hours. Questions for apprentices would be prepared recognizing the limited education of most apprentices. Topic domains would include those addressed in the research questions previously listed.</p>
<p><i><b>Data Collection Process</b></i></p>
<p>As part of the enlistment process, participants will receive letters and phone calls asking them to participate. Provisions for informed consent and confidentiality of responses would be provided as part of the process. Any special needs of enlisted participants would be identified. Details of the logistics (e.g., date, time, and location) of the focus group would be provided to participants.</p>
<p>The day before the focus group, two staff members from the evaluator would travel to each site to preview the site, make any final arrangements, and setup. Upon arrival, focus group participants would be greeted, registered, introduced to other participants, and invited into the room. Light refreshments and food would be provided. The focus group moderator would provide a brief overview of the process, establish rapport with participants, and conduct the focus group. The second staff person would take notes on a laptop and provide assistance for issues that arise during the group so the moderator could continue with group moderation. The focus group will be recorded; only apprentices who agree to have their comments recorded will be included in the focus group. Generally, it is assumed that given the physically demanding job of apprentices, none would need extensive accommodations during the meeting. For the focus group for employer sponsors, any special accommodations most likely would be provided as part of their association meeting.</p>
<p><i><b>Timeframe to Collect and Analyze Data</b></i></p>
<p>Approximately 12-14 months would be needed to identify employers and sites, develop the necessary materials, recruit apprentices and leadership staff from employer sponsors, conduct the focus groups, analyze the data, and develop a research report of findings. If OMB clearance is required, then an additional 6 months would be required to complete the project.</p>
<p><i><b>Ballpark Estimated Cost</b></i></p>
<p>The entire focus group evaluation option would cost approximately $150,000, which includes labor and travel costs to develop the protocol, conduct the focus groups, analyze the focus group data, and write a single summary report of findings. The subset of costs for actual conduct of each focus group would be approximately $10,000 for recruitment from a list, logistics, facilitation and written transcripts.</p>
<p><i><b>Main Methods for Analyzing Data</b></i></p>
<p>The transcripts of the focus groups would be analyzed for themes either by hand or through a qualitative analysis software package such as QSR NVivo. A single thematic report would be developed along the lines of the topic domains contained in the discussion guide. One section of the report would discuss apprentice findings, and a second section would discuss employer sponsor findings.</p>

              <p>Employers in long-term care are highly constrained in what they pay their workers, face government training requirements even if they do not offer apprenticeships, and often pay low-wage rates even to highly qualified workers. As in any service industry, productivity in long-term care is hard to measure. Indeed, in some cases, increased efficiency is an indicator of poorer quality (e.g., reduced feeding time for severely disabled nursing home residents). For any voluntary program, like the LTC RAP, that provides more extensive training than that required by federal and state law and regulation, long-term care providers must believe that the additional training is worthwhile for the organization. In other words, the benefits must exceed the costs. This component of the evaluation will quantify those factors for employers participating in the LTC RAP.</p>
<p>The primary resource costs are the salaries of instructors, mentors, office staff, and others for the periods they deliver the training and the dollar costs of materials, rent, and other material inputs. Another cost is the lost productivity of participants while they are taking part in the training, a cost which is minimized in apprenticeship programs. The primary benefits to the employers is reduced turnover and improved productivity/quality of care provided by the trainees, usually measured in evaluations of job training programs as the present value of the increases in earnings over time. Improved quality may reduce accidents and increase the number of consumers who use the service.</p>
<p><i><b>Research Questions</b></i></p>
<p>Given these considerations, the key questions in the cost-benefit analysis are:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>What is the impact of LTC RAPs on employer costs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the value of benefits of long-term care apprenticeships to employers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the ratio of benefits to costs for employers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What costs do apprentices incur by participating in a long-term apprenticeship?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the impact of participating in an apprenticeship on subsequent employment and earnings?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the ratio of benefits to costs to workers of participating in LTC RAPs?</p>
</li>
</ul><p><i><b>Overview of Design</b></i></p>
<p>This evaluation option will conduct a cost-benefit analysis from the perspective of LTC RAP employer sponsors and from the perspective of apprentices. Since little direct public money is spent on LTC RAP, the analysis will not be from the societal government perspective. Data on the employers will be collected through a web, mail and telephone follow-up survey and structured discussions with the management of LTC RAP employer sponsors. The option would not include a comparison group. Data generated from the LEHD data analysis will be used to conduct the cost-benefit analysis for apprentices.</p>
<p><i>1. Employers</i></p>
<p>Through in-depth interviews and surveys, the evaluator can work with employers to determine cost elements, cost savings, and other benefits to LTC RAP sponsors. The survey questions would be explained carefully to the employer and the evaluator would provide technical support to clarify any questions the employer might have. The evaluation option will collect data on the costs and benefits of the LTC RAP from 50 employer/sponsors. Forty of the employers/sponsors will complete a web survey. In addition, ten of the largest LTC RAP employer sponsors would receive a more detailed telephone survey to gain a deeper understanding of their costs and benefits. The LEHD administrative record analysis will provide estimates of the extent to which LTC RAP apprentices leave their employers at rates similar to or different from other workers with similar wages in the firm. This information will strengthen estimates of the potential benefits employers derive from reduced turnover.</p>
<p>LTC RAP employers will be asked to identify the time costs of trainers, the costs of related instruction, thewage costs of the apprentices while in class training, and the cost of replacing apprentices while they are in class training. They will be asked to specify whether the apprentices are paid for the time they invest in related instruction. In some cases, other organizations, government agencies, and foundations reimburse some employer costs associated with apprenticeships. Nonetheless, these costs are true costs regardless of who pays for the use of resources and should be included.</p>
<p>On the benefit side, employers will be asked to report turnover for various classes of workers. LTC RAP employers will be asked to supply data on turnover for those who took apprenticeships and those who did not, and turnover rates before and after the adoption of apprenticeship training, if available. If apprenticeships do lead to fewer quits or discharges, the monetary benefit of reductions in turnover will be calculated. To do so, employers will be asked to quantify recruitment and initial training costs for regular workers not in an apprenticeship program. In addition, the apprenticeship program might lower the likelihood of errors or accidents. Employers of long-term care workers would be asked to make informed guesses based on their experience about the potential cost savings from reductions in errors or accidents. These estimates will have a high-level of measurement error and will be used only to develop gross order of magnitude estimates.</p>
<p><i>2. Apprentices</i></p>
<p>In order to conduct the cost-benefit analysis from the perspective of the apprentice, data from the LEHD will be used. We propose that the evaluator follow the procedure of Hollenbeck (2011) in estimating foregone earnings and post-apprenticeship net earnings. In the case of long-term care, wages have little variation, resulting in modest benefits from the standpoint of wage gains. However, the advantages of apprenticeship for the workers may be significant in terms of retaining employment and the stability of employment within the firm and within the industry and in being assigned to work more hours as a more highly valued staff person. Thus, earnings of workers may rise as a result of apprenticeship programs even if hourly wage rates do not increase very much. The empirical evidence drawn from the LEHD-based impact study will yield estimates of earnings differentials between apprentices and matched comparison groups in each calendar quarter from the point of entry into the apprenticeship program through the latest post-program period.</p>
<p>The analysis will analyze earnings during the apprenticeship period to determine whether apprentices have foregone earnings by participating in the program. Based on the site visits, apprentices will not incur any foregone earnings within the long-term care firm for which they work, but they might forgo earnings that might have been achieved by leaving for a new job at another provider or leaving the long-term care field altogether. In some cases, apprentices incur out-of-pocket costs and they do forgo some leisure time to participate in classes and to study. Next, the analysis will calculate estimates of earnings gains achieved after completing the program. Projecting gains far beyond the period for which data are available involves uncertainties, but evaluators can provide sensitivity analyses to determine how the size of net benefits for apprentices varies with what one assumes about whether any observed gains in earnings erode over time after the last follow-up period. Once each quarters earnings impact is determined, the evaluators will calculate the present value of earnings gains.</p>
<p><i><b>Domains on Which Information Will Be Gathered and Questionnaire Development</b></i></p>
<p>The employer survey will gather information on the costs and benefits to employers. The primary costs to employers are:</p>
<ul><li>Salary costs per hour of the mentor/teacher times the number of lost production hours</li>
<li>Wages of the apprentice lost to production</li>
<li>Employer spending on classroom instruction</li>
<li>Management salary and other costs for administering the program</li>
<li>Miscellaneous administrative costs (e.g., reporting to DOL, record keeping, award certificates, etc.)  </li>
</ul><p>Weighed against these costs are the benefits to the employer. The primary benefits are:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The value of production generated by apprentices during the apprenticeship period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability for employers to obtain post-program benefits because the productivity of workers completing their apprenticeships exceeds their wage. This result can occur because of imperfect information (the training firm knows the worker better than other firms) or other factors (Wolter and Ryan, 2011).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Savings in recruitment and other training costs associated with lower turnover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increases in the quality of goods and/or services resulting from a more highly trained workforce; may include quality improvements that reduce risks of high cost mistakes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Savings in worker compensation and insurance premiums.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved reputation for quality as high-level training will be perceived by consumers as a proxy for higher quality services.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Evaluations of some job training programs and particularly apprenticeship programs ask employers to examine the effect of the training on productivity. <b><i><a href="6-detailed-description-four-approaches-evaluating-ltc-rap.html#exhibit9">Exhibit 9</a></i></b> provides an example of a typical question for assessing productivity gains.

<p><i><b>Time Frame to Collect and Analyze Data</b></i></p>
<p>The main tasks are: (1) developing the survey instrument, creating an on-line version and pretesting the survey; (2) obtaining OMB clearance; (3) conducting data collecting and providing technical assistance to employers as they complete the survey with 40 employers/sponsors; (4) 1 hour in-depth telephone interviews with ten of the employers/sponsors; (5) analysis of the data; and, (6) write up of the cost-benefit analysis. It is estimated that, including 6 months for OMB clearance, that the cost-benefit analysis will take 14 months.</p>
<p><i><b>Cost Estimate</b></i></p>
<p>The estimated cost for conducting the cost-benefit analysis is $100,000.</p>
<p><i><b>Main Statistical Methods for Analyzing Data</b></i></p>
<p>The standard method for estimating the value of production is to ask employers about the productivity of apprentices relative to the productivity of workers who have fully mastered the occupation. On the assumption that master workers contribute to production what they earn as wages, the production benefits equal:</p>
<p align="CENTER">VP<sub>a</sub> = W<sub>q</sub> * (P<sub>a</sub>/P<sub>q</sub>) * H<sub>a</sub>,</p>
<p>where VP<sub>a</sub> is the value of the added production generated by the apprentice, W<sub>q</sub> is the wage rate of master workers, P<sub>a</sub>/P<sub>q</sub> is the productivity of the apprentice relative to the productivity of master workers, and H<sub>a</sub> is the hours the apprentice devotes to production.</p>
<p><i><b>Additional Analyses</b></i></p>
<p>Based on the value of production and other benefits (e.g., reduced hiring and training costs) relative to costs, it is possible to calculate the present value of benefits and costs during the apprenticeship period and during the apprenticeship and 3-4 years of post-apprenticeship for each employer. The report will then display the distribution of net benefits (benefits - costs) and the cost-benefit ratios across employers. For example, it will show what share of firms reaped net benefits of say, $4,000 and over, $3,000-$3,999, $2,000-$2,999,  negative 1,000-negative 1,999, less than negative $2,000, etc.</p>
<p>The cost-benefit analysis can examine the relationship between the characteristics of employers and their programs and the net benefits they accrue from a LTC RAP. Other studies have documented high-levels of employer satisfaction from their participation in registered apprenticeship programs (Lerman, Eyster, and Chambers, 2009 ). To the extent that the results indicate high net benefits in this apprenticeship program, the findings can be used to help market the program to the long-term care industry as a whole.</p>
