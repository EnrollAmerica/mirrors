    <p><b>MISSION: To provide advice on public health and science to the 		Secretary of HHS, executive direction to program offices within OPHS, and, at 		the direction of the Secretary, coordinate crosscutting public health and 		science initiatives in the Department.</b> </p>
<p><strong>OPHS Evaluation Program</strong></p>
<p>OPHS provides advice, policy and program coordination, and leadership in 		the implementation, management, and development of activities related to public 		health and science, as directed by the Secretary of HHS. OPHS provides advice 		to ensure that the Department conducts broad-based public health assessments 		designed to better define public health problems and solutions to those 		problems. It assists other components of HHS in anticipating future public 		health issues and problems and provides assistance to ensure that HHS designs 		and implements appropriate approaches, interventions, and evaluations that will 		maintain, sustain, and improve the health of the Nation. OPHS provides a focus 		for leadership on matters including recommendations for policy on 		population-based public health and science and, at the Secretary's direction, 		leads and coordinates initiatives that cut across agencies and operating 		divisions. In addition, OPHS communicates and interacts, on behalf of the 		Secretary, with national professional and constituency organizations on matters 		of public health and science. </p>
<p> In keeping with its newly defined role within HHS, OPHS has 		specifically sought to develop an evaluation plan that avoids duplication of 		efforts that might more appropriately and effectively be undertaken by the 		operating divisions of the Department or by the Office of the Assistant 		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. Thus, the direction of the fiscal 1996 		evaluation strategy for OPHS is toward public health and science issues that 		cut across multiple interests of the operating divisions and that require a 		coordinated approach to achieve the most effective results. In addition, OPHS 		commits itself to carrying out every project proposed as part of this year's 		strategy in collaboration with relevant operating divisions. </p>
<p> OPHS specifically conducts evaluations requested of the Secretary by 		Congress that are most appropriately managed by staff with medical or health 		sciences credentials and that cannot be assigned to an operating division. 		Also, evaluations are conducted to support the Assistant Secretary for Health's 		role as senior advisor to the Secretary on matters of public health and 		science. This role includes the responsibility to "assist the Secretary in 		developing a policy agenda for the Department to address major population-based 		public health, prevention and science issues" and to provide "leadership and a 		focus for coordination of population-based health, clinical preventive services 		and science initiatives that cut across operating divisions." In addition, OPHS 		conducts evaluations specific to the needs of the program offices located 		within OPHS, such as Women's Health, Minority Health, Disease Prevention/Health 		Promotion, International Health, and Emergency Preparedness. </p>
<p><strong>Summary of Fiscal 1995 OPHS Evaluations</strong></p>
<p>In fiscal 1995, OPHS's predecessor, the Office of the Assistant 		Secretary for Health (OASH), completed 12 evaluations in an effort to better 		inform policy decisions throughout the Public Health Service (PHS) as the 		health care sector went through a period of rapid change. Studies were in 		diverse areas of public health in an effort to strengthen the public health 		infrastructure, including primary health care, HIV/AIDS, work force training, 		women's health, and substance abuse. OASH efforts focused on issues that cut 		across PHS program areas, as follows. </p>
<p> In an effort to study and learn from past experiences, one study, 		performed by the Institute of Medicine (IoM), analyzed crisis decisionmaking by 		the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and 		Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health in response to a threat to 		the blood supply that emerged in the early 1980s--HIV. These Federal entities, 		as well as the plasma fractionation industry, community blood banks, and other 		groups, have responsibilities to protect the supply of blood from communicable 		disease. The report concludes that the system did not deal well with blood 		safety issues, that strong leadership is required to counteract legal and 		competitive concerns that may inhibit effective agency action when a crisis is 		not well defined, and that agencies need to formulate a systematic approach to 		advisory committees and should not rely on the entities they regulate for data 		analysis or modeling. These lessons are being used by the Assistant Secretary 		for Health in a cross-departmental review on blood safety. </p>
<p> Another project, also performed by the IoM, examined current HHS 		standards for methadone programs and evaluated the effects of Federal 		regulations on the provision of methadone treatment services. Unlike other 		controlled substances, methadone use is controlled by a multitiered system of 		regulations, and Federal oversight of methadone programs is provided by FDA, 		the Drug Enforcement Administration, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and 		the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The IoM report 		examines the underlying ideology of methadone regulations that societal risks 		of methadone outweigh its benefits to such an extent that its use must be 		extraordinarily regulated. The IoM committee concludes such an approach is not 		valid in the current environment, and the scope of Federal regulation should be 		scaled back to untie clinicians' hands in determining the best course of a 		patient's treatment. </p>
<p> A third report examined the clinical background for trials involving 		the experimental drug fialuridine (FIAU) and its parent drug fiacitabine to 		determine whether any rules governing the trial process should be changed, and 		if so, what burdens or costs these changes might place on future clinical 		trials. The study followed up on an NIH clinical drug trial in which several 		hepatitis B virus (HBV) outpatients who had been administered FIAU were 		hospitalized with liver failure; five patients died and two were saved only by 		liver transplantation. The report finds that the entire set of trials reviewed 		was an ethically sound clinical research project designed and carried out by 		highly competent investigators who frequently exceeded regulation requirements 		imposed by institutional review boards. The report discusses conclusions and 		recommendations issued by FDA and concurred with them without ascribing blame 		for the tragedy to any party. </p>
<p> Among projects in the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion 		(ODPHP), one report obtained baseline data on the disease-prevention activities 		of 1,310 nurse practitioners as primary care providers and compared the 		findings to target goals from 17 objectives of Healthy People 2000: National 		Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives. The 892 respondent reported 		spending 50 percent or more of their time providing primary care. In the areas 		of assessment services, screening and immunizations, cancer-screening services, 		obstetrics/gynecology, and family medicine, nurse practitioners generally met 		or exceeded the target percentages of the Healthy People 2000 objectives for 		selected services. </p>
<p> In an effort to document the relative investment in public health in 		the United States, nine States participated in another ODPHP project to develop 		a tool for collecting Federal, State, and local public health expenditures 		using the essential services of public health terminology. Data-collection 		instruments were distributed to State health officials who, in turn, 		coordinated the data collection for State and local public health, substance 		abuse, and environmental agencies. Mental health data collection was 		coordinated through the National Association of State Mental Health Program 		Directors. The report is intended to lay important groundwork for tracking 		these expenditures over time and across various agencies and levels of 		government. </p>
<p> An evaluation by the Office of Minority Health (OMH) was designed to 		document, describe, and assess the effectiveness of community- based projects 		that address HIV/AIDS prevention within minority communities. The study 		compares various community-based approaches to disease prevention in nine 		projects and will be used by OMH and other agencies to identify successful 		practices and common themes to apply as innovative community-based risk- 		reduction strategies when targeting minority communities and at- risk 		populations. The study found that viable linkages with community-based 		providers and social service agencies are critical to the provision of 		effective, coordinated, and comprehensive HIV/AIDS services in the community; 		that projects that build upon existing AIDS activities are better able to 		influence the local health care and social service agencies and are more likely 		to continue after Federal funding ends; and that projects must conduct and 		document internal formative/process evaluations. </p>
<p> Four OASH evaluation projects were concerned with the operation of 		programs in the PHS regions. One project evaluated the impact of factors that 		impede the implementation of breast and reproductive cancer prevention efforts 		at nine Community and Migrant Health Centers (C/MHCs) located in California. In 		reviewing screening, referral, diagnosis, treatment, and case management 		protocols, the report finds that the majority of C/MHCs have weaknesses in the 		areas of community education and outreach; designation of staff to perform 		specific duties; attention to ethnic or culturally specific barriers to health 		care; and overall lack of understanding about the importance of protocols. To 		correct these weaknesses, a Primary Care Effectiveness Review has been 		scheduled for each center. </p>
<p> After identifying a gap in reproductive health care information within 		the C/MHC setting, an interagency task force in PHS Region IX began an 		evaluation project to strengthen the regional public health information 		infrastructure. The study focused on a representative sample of women 20 to 44 		years of age who received reproductive health care services from 1 of 36 study 		sites. Using a 220-item data-collection instrument designed to collect and 		analyze the frequency and extent of services provided, the study gives regional 		programs an information base that will help improve quality of care by 		disclosing demographic and utilization patterns of the typical client. The 		system provides immediate feedback on quality of care through documentation 		analysis; for example, preventive health screenings are highly documented, 		while services related to the report of abuse and violence are the most poorly 		documented. Also, prenatal documentation tends to be complete, and 		documentation of health promotion education and counseling appears low. </p>
<p> Copies of the PHS Region IX report were sent to all C/MHCs involved in 		the study and to executive and clinical staff in the region. Technical 		assistance in the areas of violence and abuse, reproductive health, and 		depression is being made available to the centers as part of a continuous 		quality-improvement plan. In addition, forms are being redesigned to improve 		staff use. A domestic violence task force has been organized in the region to 		address the issues raised in the report. </p>
<p> A report from Region IX assesses HBV education and outreach efforts 		among primary care centers serving Asians and Pacific Islanders, who constitute 		more than 50 percent of the infectious HBV carriers in the United States. The 		report summarizes programs at five centers, which completed and returned a 		self-assessment tool. It finds that program staffing is the strongest component 		of HBV education and outreach programs, and media-based outreach is the 		weakest. The report recommends sensitizing staff to cultural beliefs and 		attitudes impacting on HBV, using translated health education materials, 		integrating HBV activities with standard patient care protocols, using ethnic 		media, and developing linkages with school-based health programs and other 		community-based programs that help high-risk Asian/Pacific Islanders overcome 		the barriers identified by the study. The centers are now working to 		incorporate these findings into ongoing staff training and development. </p>
<p> From surveys mailed to nine C/MHCs in Region VI, another project 		assessed the level of interest in primary care, practice-based research. The 		report finds that significant barriers to research include lack of research 		skills and expertise, too many other clinical responsibilities, and lack of 		access to research consultation. The report recommended further evaluation of 		PHS and non-PHS clinic sites to determine topics of interest; encouragement of 		collaborative arrangements with academic researchers; and, where possible, the 		use of electronic forums for clinicians. As a result, the Region VI office 		convened a primary care research meeting in San Antonio to provide clinicians 		with an opportunity to discuss research interests and provided technical 		assistance to clinicians in accessing electronic bulletin boards as a means of 		acquiring research information. </p>
<p> Two studies were completed demonstrating the impact of the rapidly 		changing health care delivery system. One project evaluated responses to a 		Federal Register notice soliciting comments on the extent to which competitive 		health plans contract with academic medical centers (AMCs). The objective was 		to obtain insight into the potential impact of further growth in managed care 		organizations (MCOs) on the viability of AMCs and their teaching hospitals and 		to determine what additional research would be useful to further explore these 		issues. The study finds that the growth of managed care enrollment will change 		the mix of patients admitted to AMCs, thus affecting training opportunities for 		resident physicians and other health professionals. Both AMCs and MCOs suggest 		that the costs of teaching and research be separated from patient care costs 		and funded through separate mechanisms. </p>
<p> Another project analyzed issues raised by proposals for improving the 		supply, training, and distribution of primary care providers. Many proposals 		considered by Congress included provisions that would have altered the mode of 		funding graduate medical education, thus changing the numbers and types of new 		physicians. The report includes a chart book on the supply, training, and 		distribution of physicians; background on the need for an increased number of 		generalist physicians; and estimates of the number of advanced practice nurses 		and physicians' assistants that would be needed if the number of physician 		residents were reduced. </p>
<p><strong>OPHS Evaluations in Progress</strong></p>
<p>In reviewing evaluation projects for 1996, OPHS considered the following 		priority areas: congressional mandates, cross- departmental initiatives, OPHS 		strategic plan-related initiatives, program improvements, and the Government 		Performance and Results Act. OPHS selected 20 program and policy evaluations 		for funding for 1996, which are described below. </p>
<p> The Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels, appointed by the 		President, is evaluating factors relevant to possible FDA regulation of labels 		for dietary supplement regarding health claims. This project was requested by 		Congress. </p>
<p> An evaluation of the Cooperative Agreements for Demonstration Projects 		for Capacity Building at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) 		is under way. This cross-departmental initiative will examine the extent to 		which the overall program and individual projects have resulted in the 		establishment of offices of sponsored programs and the adoption of uniform 		processes. The evaluation will also assess how well the program has achieved 		increased funding for health-related research and training at the institutions 		and how effectively it has enhanced current research, training, and services. 		</p>
<p> The OPHS evaluation priorities related to strategic planning 		initiatives will focus on several areas. First, the organization of the Healthy 		People 2000 objectives reflects categorical funding streams and the concern of 		special interests in the field of health. To promote an integrated public 		health message, OPHS will reconsider the basic framework of national health 		goals and objectives in preparing for the Healthy People 2010 plan. The study 		will collect insights on the current objectives framework from the Healthy 		People 2000 consortium members, State health agencies, managed care industry 		representatives, and major Fortune 500 purchasers of health care plans. </p>
<p> School health programs, both comprehensive and categorical, continue to 		be developed and implemented throughout the Nation. OPHS will fund a study to 		identify evaluations of school health programs and make available an updated 		compilation of methodologically sound studies and their findings to assist 		school boards, administrators, health personnel, and health educators trying to 		maximize limited resources for effective health programs. </p>
<p> OPHS will continue to expand efforts to improve nationally available 		data on public health infrastructure, especially focusing on local public 		health capacity. In addition, funds will be used to support a similar effort 		conducted by several pilot States to categorize funding for population-based 		health activities, as distinct from funding of personal clinical services. The 		results will provide local health officials and planners with a validated 		instrument for estimating the level of support for essential public health 		functions. </p>
<p> In the area of health data and the environment and in continuing 		support for public health infrastructure revitalization, OPHS will fund 		development of two data-tracking systems: one related to sentinel public health 		indicators, related health outcomes, levels of health risks, and the health 		protection infrastructure, and the second on national and State-level data 		concerning environmental health outcomes and risks. OPHS will also fund an 		assessment of health plan involvement in community-based initiatives and a 		survey of clinicians to assess the level of provision of and the importance 		placed on preventive clinical services by primary care providers. </p>
<p> OPHS will support several projects to help improve program operations 		and management. These include a study of management alternatives for emergency 		preparedness and response, an evaluation of a new model of coordinating and 		integrating HIV- prevention messages and primary care in high-risk populations, 		an evaluation of the Minority Health Resource Center, and the assessment of the 		Adolescent Family Life Program. </p>
<p> OPHS will continue support for the work of the Panel on Cost- 		Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, a non-Federal expert panel appointed in 		1993, which will publish its report this year. The report will be discussed at 		a conference to explore the panel's recommendations and conduct workshops on 		the application of cost- effectiveness analysis for specific medical and public 		health applications. OPHS will also provide support through the National 		Academy of Sciences for a critical reassessment and revision of dietary 		reference intakes (recommended dietary allowances). </p>
<p> The implementation of GPRA is a priority for OPHS. The development of 		performance measures for public health programs will be crucial for program 		planning, budgeting, and legislative development. OPHS will target efforts in 		three program areas to develop these measures. First, it will support 		completion of the consultation begun in fiscal 1995 with State and local health 		officials concerning the development of performance measurement systems that 		can be used to improve accountability for expenditure of Federal funds. OPHS 		will help States and local governments determine the impact Federal programs 		are having on improving the health status of Americans. OPHS will also discern 		the extent to which States and major American cities have current data 		available to measure their own year 2000 objectives and selected national 		objectives. Finally, the Office of Minority Health will examine its 		Bilingual/Bicultural Service Demonstration Grant Program, which intends to 		build the capacity of community-based organizations to address access to health 		services for limited English-speaking minority populations. </p>
<p><strong>New Directions for OPHS Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>The next few years will be a time of enormous transformation for this 		Nation's health care system. The need to manage skyrocketing health care costs 		and rein in the Federal budget deficit--while trying to address the health 		needs of more than 40 million uninsured Americans and a general population that 		is becoming older as well as more linguistically and culturally diverse-- 		presents enormous challenges to HHS, OPHS, and their partners in the public 		health community. </p>
<p> The shifting emphasis on managed care presents new opportunities 		coupled with new dilemmas about how best to ensure that, in the quest to manage 		the cost of care, overall quality of care is not unduly compromised. It raises 		new questions of how to ensure a work force that is properly trained and fully 		capable of performing the essential services of public health for increasingly 		diverse populations in this increasingly dynamic health care environment. 		Furthermore, transformations in the health care and public health arena 		necessitate monitoring and assessing (and the data systems to do so) effects 		and impacts of these changes on the financing, organization, and availability 		of population- and clinic-based preventive services and medical treatment. </p>
<p> OPHS has given highest priority in its fiscal 1997 strategic plan and 		evaluation efforts to addressing these issues. The plan emphasizes the need for 		a strong foundation for public health in the 21st century. The priorities focus 		attention on (1) the information systems and work force that constitute the 		Nation's public health infrastructure and that are necessary to effectively 		provide the essential services of public health; and (2) the impact of managed 		care arrangements on the resources available for this infrastructure and on the 		health of all Americans, especially those most vulnerable. </p>
<p> Future OPHS evaluation planning efforts will reflect the OPHS strategic 		plan as well as the broader HHS programmatic priorities related to improving 		the health of all Americans and assessing the effects of health sector 		transformation. Planned investigations in support of the public health 		infrastructure include analyses of existing and needed data systems and data to 		adequately monitor health status and address potential threats to the public's 		health before they become actual threats; better assessments of public health 		expenditures at the Federal, State, and local level; and examinations of 		policies and programs that impact population-based services in the States and 		communities. Efforts related to managed care include evaluations of service 		delivery to Medicaid managed care beneficiaries; identification of deficiencies 		in the "safety net" (e.g., the uninsured) as a result of managed care; an 		assessment of outreach efforts to racial/ethnic minority populations in the 		implementation of Medicaid managed care; and collection of baseline data on the 		extent to which managed care organizations and State and local health agencies 		with linguistically and culturally diverse populations in their service areas 		are able to provide services. </p>
<p> Other planned activities will focus on addressing specific health needs 		of the most vulnerable populations. These include evaluations of successful 		models for overcoming system barriers to better integration of prevention and 		treatment services for populations at high risk of HIV infection and those with 		HIV disease; the effectiveness of demonstration projects intended to promote 		abstinence among teens who are not sexually active and a project to improve 		parenting skills among pregnant or parenting teens; guidelines and tools to 		enhance the development and assessment of health information and materials for 		linguistically and culturally diverse audiences; the impact of HBCUs consortium 		activities on reducing family and domestic violence; and the research base for 		post-traumatic stress disorders in women, children, and minorities. </p>
<p> Finally, in response to the increased need to measure the performance 		and effects of public health programs and activities, OPHS will support efforts 		to integrate national Healthy People 2000 objectives and performance measures 		in grants with program and department performance plans; develop and implement 		measures that assess the capacity of State and local health agencies to provide 		essential public health services and to meet OPHS goals; and ensure expansion 		of the public health knowledge base through scientific investigations in the 		behavioral and social sciences, preventive medicine, public health practice, 		nutrition, environmental and occupational health, and health systems and 		services. </p>
