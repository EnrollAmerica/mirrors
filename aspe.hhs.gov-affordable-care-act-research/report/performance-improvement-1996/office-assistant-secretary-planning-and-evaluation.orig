<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Adolescent Time Use, Risky Behavior, and Outcomes: An 		Analysis of National Data</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 109 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This report uses several large-scale databases to 		examine the time-use patterns of United States adolescents in the late 1980's 		and early 1990's. The report compares these patterns with those exhibited by 		young people 10 to 20 years ago, and tests whether participation in 		extracurricular activities reduces the chances that they will engage in various 		risky behaviors. The report finds that (1) most teenagers have a lot of 		unfilled discretionary time; (2) teenagers use this time to watch television, 		talk on the telephone, gather with friends in malls or other local hangouts, or 		work at low-skill jobs; (3) compared with earlier cohorts from the mid-1970's 		or early 1980's, teenagers spend no more time doing homework--despite 		supposedly more rigorous courses--they read fewer books, do fewer household 		chores, attend fewer religious services, and participate less in traditional 		school-based activities; (4) students who spend no time in extracurricular 		activities are 57 percent more likely to have dropped out of school by senior 		year, 49 percent more likely to have used drugs, 37 percent more likely to have 		become teen parents, 35 percent more likely to have smoked cigarettes, and 27 		percent more likely to have been arrested than those who spend 1 to 4 hours per 		week in extracurricular activities; and (5) the effectiveness of organized 		youth activities depends upon the extent to which the activities develop 		skills, create challenges, and provide fulfilling experiences for participants.

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Beginning Too Soon: Adolescent Sexual Behavior, 		Pregnancy, and Parenthood</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 110 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This series of three reports discusses trends in 		adolescent sexual behavior and fertility, as well as trends in adolescent 		pregnancy prevention programs. The reports discuss recent trends in sexual 		behavior among this population, its use of contraceptives, and outcomes of 		pregnancy. The reports highlight findings in the following areas: (1) sexual 		intercourse among teens; (2) contraceptive use; (3) pregnancy outcomes; and (4) 		prevention programs. The reports find that the rate of sexual intercourse among 		teens is increasing, but that contraceptive use is consistently low. The 		reports stress that the younger a teen is at the time of sexual initiation, the 		more likely the experience is to have been coercive, and the more likely it is 		that the teen will become pregnant or contract a sexually transmitted disease. 		The reports also note that many factors, such as race, family income, 		developmental characteristics, educational success and goals, and neighborhood 		mores, influence the age of first sexual intercourse. The reports indicate that 		contraceptive use among teens varies: older teens are more likely to use 		contraceptives than are risk-taking teens; contraceptive methods requiring male 		involvement, such as condoms and withdrawal, are more common at first 		intercourse, while female-based methods are more common in longer standing 		relationships. Furthermore, there is generally a lag time between first sexual 		intercourse and obtaining contraceptive services. The reports note that 		prevention programs emphasizing behavioral skills-oriented sex education and 		recommending abstinence and consistent contraceptive use are most effective, as 		are other programs that address alternate life options for teens. However, most 		of the prevention and intervention strategies designed to affect the teen birth 		rate are small, ad hoc, and poorly designed short-term projects lacking a 		useful evaluation strategy. </p>

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Case Management in Service Integration: An Annotated 		Bibliography</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 111 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> Case management is integral to many service 		integration projects and programs, which use case managers as the primary link 		between clients and services. While no standard definition of case management 		exists, some consensus on a case manager's functions is emerging. These 		functions include (1) assessing client needs; (2) creating an action plan; (3) 		brokering services; and (4) ensuring that appropriate services are accessed and 		delivered. This annotated bibliography includes information on (1) case 		management practices and case manager functions; (2) evaluations that consider 		the process and outcomes of case management; and (3) case management 		operations. The articles and books selected focus on practices that cross 		organizational boundaries and that generally include young children in the 		population served. Items included in the bibliography were published after 1983 		and are currently in print and available through public libraries or for 		purchase. The bibliography excludes works dealing with geriatrics, mental 		illness, or medical care. The abstracts do not critique or analyze the works 		described. See also PIC ID 5307-5307.9 and 5307.B-5307.C. (Annotated 		bibliography 35 pages.) </p>

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Child Support Enforcement</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 112 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This report examines the problem of child support 		enforcement and its impact on welfare reform. The report was prepared by the 		interagency Working Group on Welfare Reform, Family Support, and Independence. 		It presents information on the state of child support enforcement in the Nation 		and provides a rationale for reform of the system. The report finds that (1) a 		gap exists between current child support collections and the amount that, 		theoretically, could be collected (this amount is about $33.7 billion); (2) 		this gap exists because not all child support awards are paid, awards are 		generally inadequate, and many eligible custodial parents do not have a child 		support order or award in place; (3) the number of children potentially 		eligible for child support has grown, primarily because of out-of-wedlock 		births; and (4) there have been some improvements in collection of child 		support payments (for children eligible for AFDC) and in paternity 		establishment. However, the report also asserts that fundamental system reform 		is needed; children have the right to receive support from both parents, and 		reform will save welfare dollars. This reform should be effected through 		universal, immediate paternity establishment; standardization of child support 		awards throughout the Nation (regularly updated); and vigorous interstate 		enforcement of child support orders.

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Evaluation of Transition To Work Demonstration 		Projects Using a Natural Supports Model</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 113 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This report describes and evaluates the methods used 		by six demonstration projects to help schools and adult providers obtain 		integrated employment using natural supports for students with very severe 		disabilities (severe mental retardation, autism, learning disability, or other 		condition). The major categories of service provided include (1) 		student-centered planning, which helps the student identify goals and interests 		and assesses the behavior and knowledge the student needs to attain them; (2) 		community-based job experience; (3) job placements, ideally before the client 		has left school; and (4) transition out of the school system, including 		long-term vocational support and locating jobs when needed. The report also 		finds that (1) almost 335 persons with disabilities were identified as having 		participated in the projects; (2) sites attempt to select those with the most 		severe disabilities for inclusion; (3) most participants work less than 		half-time; (4) jobs are usually located by using direct telephone calls to 		potential employment sites; and (5) costs increase for schools using this 		method, but not for most parents and employers. The report details barriers 		encountered by sites, including difficulty in locating jobs, complex and rigid 		funding procedures, transportation problems, and staff turnover. The report 		suggests several areas for consideration in the future expansion and 		improvement of the program. (Final report variously paginated, plus appendix.) 		</p>

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Exploratory Study of the Barriers and Incentives To 		Improving Labor Force Participation Among Persons With Significant 		Disabilities</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 114 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> In recent years, substantial interest has emerged in 		improving opportunities for people with disabilities to join, remain in, or 		return to the work force. Disability income support programs like Supplemental 		Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance now have work 		incentive programs. The Americans With Disabilities Act has made it illegal for 		employers to discriminate against persons with disabilities. This report 		provides background information on the barriers and incentives to improving the 		work force participation of persons with significant disabilities. The report 		includes (1) a literature review on various aspects of the competitive labor 		market for persons with disabilities; (2) the use of personal assistance 		services and assistive devices by disabled workers; (3) the impact of welfare 		reform strategies on persons with disabilities; and (4) selected programs that 		offer comprehensive services to help persons with significant disabilities 		participate in competitive employment. The report also provides a research 		agenda, noting that a substantial amount is known about the employment of 		persons with disabilities, but much more information is needed to help the 		government analyze the impact of current policies on this population. More 		research would also assist in formulating policies that are designed to 		increase the participation of persons with disabilities in competitive 		employment.

<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 115 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This report presents information about the Family and 		Community Violence Prevention Program workshop held in January 1995 in 		Washington, D.C., for a consortium of historically black colleges and 		universities (HBCUs). The consortium has been developing and demonstrating 		interventions aimed at curbing the incidence of family and community violence. 		Participants included 30 HBCU participants, 6 Federal personnel, and 8 members 		of the contractor's staff. Originally planned for HCBUs as a 1-day training 		session on evaluability assessment, the conference was extended to 1.5 days. 		The first day included a review of the goals of the training workshop, a 		viewing of antiviolence public service announcements, an overview of 		evaluability assessment, the identification of stakeholders and environmental 		factors surrounding the demonstration projects, and a review of evaluability 		assessment logic models. The second day offered an opportunity for HCBU 		participants to develop evaluability assessment action plans for use in their 		demonstration projects. After the conference, participants completed a process 		evaluation of the training workshop. Process evaluation results show that 		participants' expectations were reasonable and were met to their satisfaction. 		Participants gained an understanding of the need for evaluability assessments 		and were prepared to conduct them. After the conference, the contractor also 		offered technical assistance to all HCBUs, based on lessons learned during the 		conference. </p>

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Fifty-State Health Reform Database</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 116 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This project constructed a database consisting of data 		elements related to health reform for all 50 States. This database supports the 		generation of customized State profiles for a variety of purposes. For example, 		Administration officials need information specific to each State in order to 		better support a State's health care reform efforts. The database will also 		allow comparison of individual State health care report efforts to the Federal 		effort and to each other. Some of the questions that can be answered by the 		database include (1) how many States have adopted small group market reforms or 		risk pools for uninsurables and (2) how Federal reform efforts might affect 		each State. The database has not been updated since the end of 1994, but can be 		updated for a small additional investment of resources. </p>

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Final Report of the Task Force on the Privacy of 		Private Sector Health Records</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 117 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> The mandate of the Task Force on the Privacy of 		Private Sector Health Records was to examine the extent to which problems exist 		with the collection, storage, and use of health information in the private 		sector. The changing policy environment refocused the mission to include 		examination of ways to protect the privacy of all health care information 		within the context of health care reform and the development of electronic 		health information networks. The task force examined the social, legal, and 		economic issues affecting the privacy of people who use the health care system. 		It addressed several policy questions, including (1) the kinds of records to be 		protected; (2) the treatment of especially sensitive records; (3) the level of 		legislation that should enact privacy provisions; (4) the circumstances under 		which a record keeper should disclose health information; (5) the impact of 		automation on the privacy of health records; (6) the use of unique identifiers 		for health records; (7) the oversight structure needed to protect privacy, 		confidentiality, and security matters and violations; and (8) the training, 		education, and awareness programs needed for health care users and providers. 		The report recommends a coordinated Federal policy on the privacy of health 		care records; the use of universal identifiers; effective security standards 		and guidance; the establishment of a data protection entity; and an education 		program about the issue.

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>JOBS Evaluation: Early Findings on Program Impacts in 		Three Sites</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 118 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This report presents impact results of an evaluation 		of the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program in three 		sites: Atlanta, Georgia; Grand Rapids, Michigan; and Riverside, California. The 		JOBS program examines two interventions: the labor force attachment (LFA) 		approach, emphasizing rapid job entry; and the human capital development (HCD) 		approach, which offers longer, skill-building education and training 		activities. Participants were randomly assigned to one of these approaches or 		to one of two control groups. The report is based on telephone and in-person 		surveys of 2,604 people in the three sites. The report finds that (1) the three 		sites successfully operated two distinct, well-run, and highly mandatory LFA 		and HCD versions of JOBS; (2) the LFA approach increased participation in 		job-search activities dramatically, slightly increased participation in other 		work-directed services, and resulted in a high rate of sanctioning (removal of 		a portion of welfare benefits because of nonparticipation); (3) the HCD 		approach also resulted in a high rate of sanctioning, and the basic services 		provided were primarily basic education and job search; and (4) the LFA 		approach substantially increased the number of people who found work and left 		the welfare rolls within 2 years, and the LFA's impact on AFDC receipts and 		payments and on earnings was substantial, while the HCD approach had not yet 		translated into higher earnings. </p>

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>JOBS Evaluation: How Well Are They Faring? AFDC 		Families With Preschool-Aged Children in Atlanta at the Outset of the JOBS 		Evaluation</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 119 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This report provides a descriptive summary of a Child 		Outcomes Study (a component of the larger JOBS program evaluation) in Fulton 		County, Georgia, near the start of the JOBS evaluation. The Fulton County JOBS 		evaluation uses a human capital development approach, a labor force attachment 		approach, and a control group. The descriptive sample included 790 respondents 		from the JOBS Child Outcomes Study in Fulton County. All respondents were 		mothers whose youngest child was between age 3 and 5 at the time of random 		assignment, all were 20 years of age or older, and 96 percent were 		African-American. The report finds that the mothers in the Fulton County sample 		are highly disadvantaged in many ways. Their reading and math literacy levels 		are low, they report minimal economic or other assistance from the fathers of 		their children, and they have high rates of depressive symptoms. On the other 		hand, most report social support from family and friends, have completed high 		school or the graduate equivalent degree, have positive attitudes about 		maternal work, and have taken steps toward limiting their childbearing. The 		children in the sample are also disadvantaged: their receptive vocabulary is 		substantially below the national mean and many lack the skills and knowledge 		needed for school readiness. Finally, the report notes that the heterogeneity 		of the sample mothers will lead to varied outcomes for their children. </p>

<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> The JOBS program provides an array of job search, work 		experience, education, and training services to families who receive AFDC. The 		program requires participation; those who do not participate are sanctioned 		with the loss of part of their welfare grant. The legislation authorizing JOBS 		also requires States to meet specific, and incrementally increasing, 		participation standards. This report uses data collected from the case files of 		1,113 AFDC recipients in three JOBS evaluation sites (Atlanta, Georgia; Grand 		Rapids, Michigan; and Riverside, California) to examine participation rates. 		The report notes that the definitions of participation and the classes of 		people included in the measure greatly affect the feasibility of achieving a 		particular standard. The report finds that (1) only 5 to 10 percent of all 		single-parent AFDC clients participated in the JOBS program or worked the 		required hours during each week in a month; (2) including sanctioning in the 		definition of participation raises participation rates to between 9 and 21 		percent; (3) using only JOBS-mandatory individuals in the measure increases the 		participation rate; and (4) if participation rates remained at 1992 levels at 		the sites, the rates would fall far short of the ultimate standards contained 		in the 1995 welfare reform bills, despite the JOBS program's tough standards, 		and its success compared with other programs.

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Managed Care for People With Disabilities: Developing 		a Research Agenda</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 121 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This report provides background information for a 		meeting held on the subject of managed care and people with disabilities, 		hosted by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation's 		Office of Aging, Disability, and Long Term Care Policy. The purpose of the 		meeting was to (1) review the implications of the movement toward managed 		health care for people with physical and mental disabilities; and (2) flesh out 		a research and demonstration program to improve the understanding of the impact 		of managed care on people with disabilities. The report highlights critical 		policy areas and related research issues around managed care and disability. 		These policy areas include (1) functional and demographic characteristics of 		persons with disabilities who receive managed care; (2) the impact of managed 		care, including how participation affects access to needed services; (3) 		targeting managed care plans to people who are disabled; (4) financing and 		reimbursement; (5) service coverage and organization of the delivery system; 		and (6) quality assurance. For each of these areas, the report discusses the 		policy issues involved, research completed and under way on the subject, and 		suggested directions for research. The report stresses that little information 		has been generated about how any of these areas affect persons with 		disabilities. The report also notes that many persons with disabilities fear 		the role managed care will play in their access to services and the quality of 		those services, and that some of these fears are justifiable.

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Minnesota Learning Readiness Initiative: Reforming the 		Delivery of Social Services to School-Aged Children and Families in Hennepin 		County, Minnesota</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 122 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This report presents information on a major 		collaborative service integration initiative in Hennepin County, Minnesota. The 		two-track initiative was intended to mobilize community planning and 		collaboration around the development of school-linked services. The first 		track, the Learning Readiness Initiative, concentrated on research and 		development. The second track, the School Human Services Redesign Initiative, 		was a large-scale effort to reform delivery of social and other support 		services to families. The Learning Readiness Initiative began with a 		feasibility study, "When Kids and Systems Collide," which found that, despite 		over $1 billion spent on education and human services in Hennepin County, a 		massive policy collaboration was needed to make these services effective. The 		initiative used research and development-oriented grant making to develop new 		approaches and to foster collaboration. The School Human Services Redesign 		Initiative, begun while the Learning Readiness Initiative was still under way, 		had four goals: (1) to increase equity on all levels among students in school 		achievement, school service, and health outcomes; (2) to strengthen families' 		ability to support their children; (3) to enhance the responsiveness of human 		services and schools to the needs of students and families; and (4) to 		strengthen community bonds.

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>New Approaches To Evaluating Community Initiatives: 		Concepts, Methods, and Contexts</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 123 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This report examines issues in evaluating 		comprehensive community initiatives (CCIs). CCIs have their origins in the 		settlement houses of the late 19th century and the War on Poverty, among other 		influences. Most CCIs seek to provide social and health care services to 		low-income communities, as well as improve general conditions in the 		communities. Most operate under the belief that authority and responsibility 		must reside at the local level, rather than with the municipal, State, or 		Federal governments. The report's introduction addresses several factors that 		make CCIs difficult to evaluate, including horizontal and vertical complexity; 		contextual issues, such as the macroeconomic climate that is out of the control 		of CCIs; flexible and evolving interventions; the broad range of outcomes 		sought; and the absence of a comparison community or control group. The 		articles included in the report attempt to address some of these difficulties. 		The article titles are (1) "Evaluating CCIs: A View From History"; (2) "Nothing 		as Practical as Good Theory: Exploring Theory-Based Evaluation for CCIs for 		Children and Families"; (3) "How Do Urban Communities Affect Youth? Using 		Social Science Research to Inform the Design and Evaluation of CCIs"; (4) 		"Problems in the Evaluation of Community-Wide Initiatives"; (5) "Using 		Community-Level Indicators of Children's Well-Being in CCIs"; and (6) "The Role 		of the Evaluator in CCIs."

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Noncustodial Parents' Participation in Their 		Children's Lives: Evidence From the Survey of Income and Program 		Participation</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 124 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This study examines the relationship between 		noncustodial parental involvement, child well-being, child support, custody and 		visitation arrangements, parental income, and family structure. In examining 		these interactions, the report focuses on father involvement and child 		well-being. The report includes (1) a literature review and annotated 		bibliography and (2) a secondary analysis using the Survey of Income and 		Program Participation. Because the majority of noncustodial parents are 		fathers, it is hoped that the findings from this report will provide new 		insights for promoting father involvement for children in divorced, separated, 		and never-married families. </p>

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Options for Full-Day Services for Children 		Participating in Head Start</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 125 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This study examines full-day services offered by eight 		Head Start grantees that fund extended hours by combining resources from a 		variety of sources. Data were collected during 2-day site visits to each 		grantee. The grantees provide services in one of three ways: (1) wraparound 		care, which uses funding from sources other than Head Start to expand services; 		(2) wrap-in care, in which Head Start grantees contract with another provider 		and fund the set of services needed to bring the contracted program up to Head 		Start standards; and (3) connected care, in which grantees contract with 		existing child care programs to provide children with supervised care before 		and after the Head Start day. The report examines program differences in 		full-day services, funding, fiscal management, and collaboration. The report 		finds that grantees (1) develop innovative ways to train staff and to integrate 		parent activities and home visits into the full-day programs; (2) develop ways 		to allocate funding from various sources, but also deal with several funding 		issues, including parental loss of eligibility for full-day funding, 		retroactive reimbursements, and funding shortfalls; and (3) encounter quality 		assurance problems using wrap-in or connected care. The report lists several 		issues for consideration by Federal policymakers and points toward needed 		research. (Final report 47 pages, plus appendix.) </p>

<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 126 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This report was sponsored and performed jointly by 		ASPE, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 		and NIDA. This report provides data on substance use and substance-related 		impairments among participants in the AFDC program. The study uses data from 		the 1991 and 1992 National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse to gain information 		about the prevalence of substance abuse in the AFDC population and to 		investigate the rate of substance-related impairment in this population. 		Substance-related impairment is categorized as either "significant impairment," 		which may preclude participation in training or education activities, or "some 		impairment," which may require treatment concurrent with these activities. The 		report finds that (1) 4.9 percent of female AFDC recipients and 5.2 percent of 		all AFDC recipients report significant substance-related impairment; (2) an 		additional 10.6 percent of female AFDC recipients and 11.2 percent of all 		recipients report some impairment resulting from substance use; and (3) AFDC 		recipients have higher rates of substance use and substance-related impairments 		than the general population, but the vast majority of substance users and 		substance-related impaired people do not receive AFDC.

<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 127 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This report presents illustrative, candidate sets of 		outcome indicators for Child Welfare and Child Health Services, as well as 		recommendations to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to further 		develop outcome indicators. Indicators in the area of child health include (1) 		increasing the number of insured pregnant women and insured children; (2) 		increasing access and reducing barriers to services; (3) coordinating and 		simplifying programs and systems; (4) establishing quality standards; (5) 		implementing public health education; and (6) increasing the numbers of women 		and children receiving appropriate services. The report also indicates end 		goals for children's health. The child welfare outcomes goals are grouped in 		the areas of safety, permanency, child development, and customer service. These 		goals relate to home-environment safety; permanent placement for children; 		school-based performance and age-appropriate growth and behavior; and State-, 		child-, and family-level satisfaction with services. The recommendations 		presented in the report are clustered around the major elements that should be 		included in a plan for a departmentwide or operating divisionwide performance 		measurement process. These elements are (1) establishing high-level policy and 		working committees to oversee the effort; (2) undertaking comprehensive 		implementation; and (3) providing training and technical assistance to 		programs.

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Report to Congress on Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing</i> 		</p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 128 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This report was prepared in response to the Violent 		Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which requires that HHS prepare 		an analysis of the increases in nonmarital births. A Department working group 		was formed of staff from ASPE, NCHS, and NICHD. The report examines the trends 		in, consequences of, and causes of out-of-wedlock childbearing. The report 		finds that (1) in 1993, nearly one-third of all births occurred outside of 		marriage; (2) less than one-half of nonmarital births were first births, but 		teenagers account for about one-half of all nonmarital first births; (3) 		nonmarital birth rates are highest during the ages of 18-29, and tend to be 		higher among disadvantaged and less-educated women and women in urban areas; 		(4) the proportion of nonmarital pregnancies that ended in abortion declined 		from 60 percent to 46 percent between 1980 and 1991; and (5) the consequences 		and causes of nonmarital births are difficult to determine because most of 		these parents are disadvantaged before the birth. The report examines the role 		of welfare; economic opportunities; neighborhood influences; individual and 		family characteristics; and attitudes, values, and norms in the increase in 		nonmarital births.

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Review of Family Preservation and Family Reunification 		Programs</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 129 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This report describes the state of the family 		preservation field and examines in greater depth the characteristics and 		operations of family preservation programs that are potential sites for future 		outcome evaluation. The report looks at placement prevention programs in 26 		States. Of these States, 22 have one or more statewide models (Colorado, 		Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, and Oregon use two family preservation models). 		Four of the 26 states do not have a specific program model; they make funds 		available to counties and allow the counties determine their own models. The 		report also analyzes these family preservation programs' characteristics, 		including (1) program models; (2) referral sources; (3) referral practices, 		including definition of imminent risk, decisionmaking processes, and exclusion 		criteria; (4) program maturity; (5) service providers; and (6) program 		statistics. The report also discusses family reunification programs. There were 		26 such programs on the State and county levels in 15 of the 26 States 		contacted. Reunification programs that are part of a more general family 		preservation approach indicate that only a small percentage of cases served are 		reunification cases. These programs generally provide aftercare services and do 		not differentiate between preservation and reunification cases. (Final report 		82 pages, plus appendixes.) </p>

<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 130 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> The Simulation of Trends in Employment, Welfare, and 		Related Dynamics (STEWARD) model was developed to inform the debate on welfare 		policy by simulating policy options that reflect several key questions: How 		will policies intended to encourage work affect the duration of welfare 		dependency? How will education and training programs reduce the duration of 		welfare receipt? How will AFDC costs and caseloads change as a result of 		reforms, and in what time frame? This report describes the STEWARD model, 		including (1) its development; (2) its unique features; (3) the kinds of policy 		options it can model; (4) the concept of the model; (5) how the concept is 		translated into an operational model; (6) the sources of key empirical 		estimates; (7) an overview of the impact measures routinely presented in the 		model output tables; and (8) the model database. The report describes three 		scenarios that are simulated by STEWARD: (1) a baseline case that simulates 		welfare caseloads, dynamics, and costs for a baseline period (here, 1992) under 		actual policies in effect at the time; (2) what welfare caseloads and costs 		would have been had the policy changes that have been enacted recently been 		implemented in the baseline year; and (3) what welfare caseloads and costs 		would be if welfare reform policies were enacted on top of current policies.

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Sources of Support for Young Latina Mothers</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 131 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> In 1992, the total Latina fertility rate was 3.04 		births per woman, compared with 1.94 for all non-Latina women. Since 1980, 		Latina total fertility has risen by about 20 percent, and teen Latina birth 		rates have increased by 30 percent. These figures contrast sharply with 		fertility rates of less than 7 percent for all non-Latinas since 1980 and 6 		percent for non-Latina teens. This report examines the support strategies used 		by young Latina mothers in the United States in order to identify Latina 		subgroups in greatest need of additional support. Using data from the 1990 		census, the report considers (1) the young mother's living arrangements and (2) 		how she supports herself and her child (through employment and public 		assistance). The report finds that (1) Puerto Rican mothers are less likely to 		be married or to be living with parents or other adults and are more likely to 		be living in poverty and receiving welfare; (2) Cuban mothers have the highest 		household incomes and the lowest rates of receiving welfare; (3) Mexican and 		Central and South American mothers are similar to Whites in terms of their 		marriage patterns and living arrangements, but have much higher poverty rates; 		(4) foreign-born mothers are considerably more likely than their U.S.-born 		counterparts to use family or kin resources, and they appear to use this 		strategy rather than welfare; and (5) the most vulnerable mothers are teens 		raising children alone.

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Substance Abuse Among Women and Parents</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 132 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This report uses data from the 1991 National Household 		Survey on Drug Abuse and the 1991 Drug Abuse Warning System to examine the 		prevalence of substance abuse by women of childbearing age and by parents. The 		report also examines the number of children potentially at risk because of 		parental drug abuse. The report finds that (1) 5.7 percent of women age 15-44 		years with children living in their households report past-month illicit drug 		use, compared with 11.2 percent of women in the same age bracket without 		children living in their homes, and the rates for men show similar patterns; 		(2) approximately 6 million children (9 percent) under age 18 have parents who 		have used illicit drugs in the past month, most commonly marijuana; (3) 		substance abuse varies little by urban/suburban/rural residency; (4) the 		prevalence of drug abuse among parents shows similar demographic patterns, as 		does drug use in the general population; (5) 4 percent of mothers and 13 		percent of fathers report consumption of 5 or more alcoholic drinks at one time 		on at least 3 occasions in the past 30 days; and (6) children of drug-using 		parents tend to be younger than children overall--20 percent of children of 		both past-year and past-month drug users are under 3 years old, whereas 17 		percent of all children are in this age group.

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Systematic Thinking About Government Programs for 		Children With Disabilities: Size, Participation, Benefits, and Expenditures</i> 		</p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 133 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> According to one source, about 4.5 million children in 		the United States have a disability. Furthermore, measures of the prevalence of 		disabilities among children and adolescents have been growing over time, 		possibly because of changes in data collection, increased survival of low 		birth-weight infants and children with terminal chronic illnesses; increased 		responsiveness to programs that provide assistance; and greater parental, 		educational, and medical awareness and detection of disability in children. 		This report attempts to provide a better understanding of how various Federal, 		State, and local programs serving children with disabilities have evolved and 		how they fit together. The report contains information on the participation, 		benefits, and expenditures of major programs serving this population. The 		report finds that (1) at the Federal level, the largest programs for children 		with disabilities are Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid; (2) 		participation in SSI has increased 150 percent since 1989, and, since SSI 		recipients are automatically eligible for Medicaid in most States, the number 		of children with disabilities receiving Medicaid has also increased; (3) the 		largest State and local program serving this population is special education, 		which provides educational and other services (speech therapy, counseling, and 		physical therapy, among others); and (4) data on this population is limited and 		hampers policymakers' ability to serve the population.

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Child Support Payment Patterns Among AFDC Mothers in 		Massachusetts and Implications for TRIM2</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 134 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> AFDC and the Federal Child Support Enforcement Program 		(Title IV-D) are closely linked. In fact, the Title IV-D program was originally 		established to stem escalating AFDC costs. Two surveys, the Current Population 		Survey and the Survey of Income and Program Participation collect data on child 		support collections. However, these self-reported data are subject to 		limitations endemic to this kind of information. This report presents an 		analysis of data collected on the State level (in this case, Massachusetts) for 		a random sample of at least 2,400 AFDC cases covering 12 consecutive months and 		having at least 1 month in which child support was due during 1993. The sample 		was reduced to 2,364 cases because of data limitations for some cases. The 		report presents analyses of these data by ethnic/racial group; marital status 		and education of the mother; and amount of child support due, the amount paid, 		and the percent of amount due that was paid. The report then considers the 		implications of these analyses for the Transfer Income Model-Number 2 (TRIM2) 		microsimulation model. It describes how TRIM2 models child support awards and 		payments, and how Title IV-D/AFDC data might be used for TRIM2 validation and 		improvement. The report concludes that State-level Title IV-D/AFDC data provide 		a rich source of information on the child support characteristics of families 		receiving AFDC, and that additional analyses of State Title IV-D/AFDC data 		could prove very useful for validating and improving the child support 		simulation procedures in the TRIM2 model.

<p> <b>TITLE:</b> <i>Use of Administrative Data Kept by States To Study the 		Duration of Program Participation</i> </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT NUMBER:</b> 135 </p>
<p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> This study assesses whether administrative data kept 		by States can be used to study the duration of program participation in the 		AFDC, food stamps, medical assistance, and Title IV-D programs. The need for 		longitudinal data is compounded by recent efforts to reform welfare that limit 		the duration of a welfare spell to 24 months. Two types of data may be 		obtainable: retrospective data that are currently available, including case 		histories; and prospective data that are assembled as events occur. Of 15 		States contacted, 4 (California, Georgia, New York, and Texas) were selected 		for the collection of detailed information on their respective data systems. 		The report finds that California and Texas offer the best possibilities for 		collecting retrospective data, while New York and California offer the best 		possibilities for collecting prospective data. The report offers two options 		for assembling longitudinal data about program participation on the State 		level: (1) asking States to produce these files themselves and providing them 		the funding to do so and (2) asking States to provide administrative data in 		whatever form it exists to a third party, who will assemble the longitudinal 		files. The report considers the positive and negative aspects of each of these 		options and concludes that the second option is better from a research 		standpoint. Under this option, data are more likely to be usable to address 		relevant policy questions and to make State comparisons. Furthermore, economies 		of scale are expected to make this option more cost-effective over time. The 		report notes that if neither option is considered viable, California and Texas 		have data available that may be examined, but these data lack information about 		all programs. Finally, the report cautions that new longitudinal data will not 		be available for at least 9 months from the date of funding. </p>
