<p><b>TITLE: <i>The Status of 		Biomedical Research Facilities 1996</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Since 		1986, the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health 		(NIH) have collected and reported to the Congress biennial information on the 		quantity and quality of biomedical research space. This report describes 		findings from the 1996 Survey of Scientific and Engineering Research Facilities 		at Colleges and Universities. The survey collected data from colleges and 		universities with research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures exceeding 		$50,000, from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) with any 		R&amp;D expenditures, and from a sampling of academic and nonprofit research 		organizations that received extramural research funding from NIH. The report 		found that (1) institutions performing biomedical research devoted 		approximately 67.4 million net assignable square feet to this work; (2) roughly 		half of survey respondents classified their medical science research space 		and/or biological science research space as inadequate; (3) expenditures to 		construct, renovate, and repair biomedical research space declined for the 		first time since NSF and NIH began collecting data; (4) the largest proportion 		of new construction was funded by State and local governments, while almost 		half of all institutions funded their own repair/renovation projects; and (5) 		36 percent of all institutions with biomedical research space reported repair 		renovation projects that had to be deferred because funds were not available. 		In addition, the survey reported that HBCUs: (1) comprised 12 percent of the 		Nation's research-performing institutions, but contained only 1.8 percent of 		the national biomedical research space; (2) reported that 8 percent of their 		biomedical research space needed major repair/renovation to be used 		effectively; (3) have experienced a steady decline in new construction funding 		since the first survey in 1986 which reported expenditures of $42 million, to 		$0.2 million in 1994-5.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluation of 		the National Research Service Award Research Training 		Programs</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		project had several objectives. First, it conducted an evaluation design study, 		developing a detailed plan for a comprehensive evaluation of career outcomes of 		pre- and post-doctoral trainees and fellows and of the National Research 		Service Act (NRSA) programs in which they have participated. The evaluation 		developed recommendations promoting approaches that are successful in order to 		improve the return on Federal investment in research training. The second 		objective of the project was to characterize the nature and quality of the 		training actually experienced by the present and former trainees and fellows 		and to differentiate between a good training program and simply having good 		trainees. The project's third objective was to tap the perceptions of National 		Institutes of Health (NIH) staff, present and former NRSA trainees and fellows, 		and university employees about the nature and impact of the training program. 		The study developed performance indicators so that future evaluations may be 		based on data that are consistent across separate awards. The final report for 		this study will not be available until the Evaluation of NIH Post-doctoral 		Trainees and Fellows is completed in the summer of 1998. See PIC ID No. 		6285. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>National 		Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Article Citation and Patent Reference Study: 		An Analysis of Article Citations and Patent References to Journal Articles 		Supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood 		Institute</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		primary objective of all National Institutes of Health (NIH) activities is to 		improve the health of the American public. However, it is generally impossible 		to demonstrate the impact of basic research in terms of reductions in disease 		mortality or morbidity. Therefore, alternative measures must be relied upon. 		The objectives of this project were to (1) introduce the concept of examining 		patents as an additional measure for assessing the impact of NIH-supported 		research; (2) develop a methodology to use patents in evaluation research; and 		(3) apply this methodology to a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 		(NHLBI) project in order to compare the outcomes for individual research 		project grants (R01s) funded under a Request for Applications (RFA) with 		individual research project grants funded from unsolicited applications. The 		methods, data bases, software, and results of this project will be used by 		other Institutes, Centers, and Divisions to evaluate their own funding 		mechanisms. The project examines the impact of NHLBI grants during the period 		1982 through 1994 with respect to the number of biomedical research articles 		associated with grant programs, the number of subsequent citations to these 		articles, and the number of patent references to the original articles. The 		report finds that (1) about 12,500 grants resulted in over 90,000 research 		articles cited in over 2 million later articles; (2) 3,000 of the original 		articles are referred to in over 1,000 patents; (3) half of all cited articles 		are cited no more than 12 times over the 14-year period studied, although a few 		were cited over 1,000 times each; (4) two-thirds of articles referenced in 		patents appeared only once, although 3 articles are each referenced in over 20 		patents; and (5) new RFAs result in higher than normal numbers of citations, 		but lower than normal number of patent references. (Final report: 11 pages, 		plus appendices.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Rare Diseases 		Clinical Research Data base</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The Rare 		Disease Clinical Research Data base (RDCRD) has been established by the Office 		of Rare Diseases (ORD), Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health 		(NIH). NIH made a commitment to the rare disease community and to the Congress 		to develop a mechanism for identifying and monitoring rare disease research 		supported by the NIH. The data base is similar in format to the Physician Data 		Query (PDQ) System of the National Cancer Institute. The International Cancer 		Information Center of NCI provided assistance in the development of the data 		base. Contact was made with 520 principal investigators and the 75 General 		Clinical Research Centers managers to determine those clinical trials in active 		states. The ORD retrieved 291 protocols from ongoing clinical trials to be 		included in the data base. Information from these protocols has been placed in 		abstracts and will be available from ORD's home page on the Internet. This 		development activity will continue, and the next two phases will include the 		development of information from clinical trials receiving support from the 		voluntary patient support organizations and the pharmaceuticals and 		biotechnology industries. ORD will continue to seek information from newly 		supported clinical trials receiving support from NIH. Information on specific 		rare diseases is difficult to locate; and, in many cases, the public, 		confronted with penetrating the NIH information system, reported difficulties 		gaining access to it. The RDCRD will eliminate this problem by providing an 		easy-to-use interface between the user and the data base information system. 		The data base contains up-to-date information that is easily accessible to a 		diverse user population. This information will facilitate patient and physician 		access to this information and lead to improved recruitment of patients with 		rare diseases or conditions into NIH-sponsored clinical trials.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>The National 		Survey of Laboratory Animal Use, Facilities, and 		Resources</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report summarizes the results of the survey conducted by the National 		Institutes of Health (NIH) on animal-based research for fiscal year (FY) 1993. 		NIH is responsible for oversight of the nationwide infrastructure required to 		pursue basic biomedical and behavioral research including laboratory animals, 		as well as the resources and facilities required to ensure their availability, 		appropriate use, and humane care. This study updates information gathered in 		the last national survey conducted in 1978. For FY 1993, the report finds that 		(1) of the 626 respondents, roughly half were academic institutions, and half 		consisted of research laboratories, independent hospitals, and government 		agencies; (2) there is a total census of approximately 2.5 million animals; (3) 		facilities reported acquiring 8.3 million animals, of which 29 percent were 		acquired through the facilities' own breeding; (4) respondent facilities made 		approximately 9 million vertebrate animals available for research, education or 		training, and testing, and animal species were used predominantly for research; 		(5) among directors of animal care and use programs, 74 percent had a 		doctoral-level degree; (6) among respondent facilities, 34 percent reported 		having space in need of renovation, 15 percent reported having space in need of 		replacement, and enclosed animal housing was the category most frequently cited 		as in need of replacement; and (7) the 559 respondents who provided cost 		information spent $521 million on animal care and reported that their costs had 		increased since FY 1991 by 25 percent. This report contributes to the 		understanding of the effects of Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, 		and policies enacted to ensure humane care and to regulate the supply and cost 		of laboratory animals.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Promoting Safe 		and Effective Genetic Testing in the United States: Final Report of the Task 		Force on Genetic Testing</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Genetic 		testing is the analysis of human DNA, RNA, chromosomes, proteins, and certain 		metabolites in order to detect heritable diseases. The Task Force on Genetic 		Testing was created by the NIH-DOE Joint Working Group on Ethical, Legal, and 		Social Implications of Human Genome Research (ELSI Working Group) to review 		genetic testing in the United States and to design policies to minimize the 		potential negative effects of genetic testing. Their final report recommends 		that (1) an advisory committee be established on genetic testing in the Office 		of the Secretary to implement the Task Force recommendations and to determine 		which genetic tests require stringent scrutiny; (2) protocols for the 		development of genetic tests that can be used to predict future disease in 		healthy people receive the approval of an institutional review board (IRB) when 		the intention is to make the test readily available for clinical use; (3) test 		developers submit their validation and clinical utility data to external 		reviewers as well as to interested professional organizations in order to 		permit informed decisions about their routine use; (4) the newly created 		genetics subcommittee of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Advisory Committee 		consider the creation of a specialty in genetics that would encompass all 		predictive tests that satisfy criteria for stringent scrutiny; (5) curricula on 		genetics be incorporated into medical school and residency training; (6) 		hospitals and managed care organizations require evidence of competence before 		permitting providers to order predictive genetic tests or counsel about them; 		and (7) physicians have access to accurate information to enable them to 		diagnose rare diseases, to know where to turn for assistance in clinical and 		laboratory diagnosis, and to locate laboratories that competently test for rare 		diseases.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>National 		Cancer Institute: Characterization of User Population and User Satisfaction of 		the PDQ Data base-Documentation for Tracking System</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This study 		examines the user population and users' satisfaction with the Physician Data 		Query (PDQ) data base. PDQ was originally targeted to physicians only, but the 		information included in the data base was recognized to be of value to the 		larger community of nurses, researchers, health educators, and librarians, as 		well as patients, their families, and friends. PDQ is distributed to these 		audiences by the original on-line services, CD-ROM, facsimile, hard copy, and 		electronic networks, including the Internet. The users surveyed for the study 		include both primary users, or those who access the PDQ data base to fulfill 		their own research needs, and secondary users, who only conduct searches for 		others. The report finds that (1) the data base is widely and repeatedly used 		and is highly regarded; (2) physicians, other health care professionals, and 		librarians/information specialists predominate among the user population; (3) 		patients and their families and friends are also recipients of the PDQ 		information, even when the National Cancer Institute (NCI) toll-free 		information center phone service is excluded; (4) users consistently see PDQ as 		an authoritative and dependable source of cancer information; (5) no sections 		of the data base are negatively regarded or go unused; and (6) many users share 		the information they access through PDQ with others. Several recommendations 		are developed as a result of this report. The report recommends that NCI's 		International Cancer Information Center should (1) establish formal licensing 		structures to strengthen its ability to require access to users from the 		vendors, (2) repeat this survey within three years, (3) consider creating a 		CD-ROM version of the data base on its own in order to reduce costs to 		consumers, and (4) work with distributors and intermediaries to develop 		mechanisms for gathering data on user access.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Bridges to the 		Future: Program Evaluation</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In 		February 1992, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) and 		the National Institutes of Health Office of Research on Minority Health 		announced the implementation of the Baccalaureate and Doctoral Bridge programs. 		The objective of the Baccalaureate Bridge program is to facilitate the 		transition of minority students at two-year colleges into colleges with 		baccalaureate degree programs in the sciences. The Doctoral Bridge program 		seeks to facilitate the transition of students into Ph.D. programs when they 		complete the M.S. degree. Two program outcomes that are particularly relevant 		to the goals of the Bridges program were examined in this study: (1) the 		transition of students from two-year to four-year institutions, or from M.S. to 		Ph.D. programs; and (2) the retention of students in the educational pathway 		both prior to and after making the transition from one institution to another. 		Although the quantity and quality of the comparison data is not high, rates of 		transfer among Bridges students appear to be higher than rates among other 		students. Success in completing the baccalaureate degree among those students 		who have transferred is high, and is comparable to the rate found among other 		minority students in an evaluation of the NIGMS Minority Access to Research 		Careers program. At the baccalaureate level, approximately 70 percent of the 		students are majoring in such fields as biology, chemistry and biochemistry, 		molecular biology, and microbiology. From the current data, it is difficult to 		develop good estimates of the eventual outcomes of participants in the Doctoral 		Bridges program. The early cohorts of students were small. Of the 21 students 		in the first two cohorts, about half have transferred to a doctoral program. 		While the rate of Bridges student attrition from graduate programs is below the 		national average, it is still too soon to predict their rate of completing 		their doctoral programs. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Academic 		Research Instruments and Instrumentation Needs in the Biological 		Sciences</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report examines the fourth cycle of a national instrumentation survey 		concerning scientific research instruments and the academic units in which they 		are found for a range of scientific fields. Conducted in 1994, the survey 		analyzes data from two distinct populations of institutions. The first 		population consists of 318 institutions performing more than $3 million in 		research and development (R&amp;D) in 1991. The second population consists of 		44 historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) that reported R&amp;D 		expenditures in 1994. The study, in results generalized to the first group, 		finds that in 1993 (1) expenditures for biological research instrumentation 		totaled $283 million; (2) Federal funding as a percent of total funds for the 		purchase of biological research instrumentation declined from 48 percent in 		1983 to 39 percent: NIH was the single largest Federal funding source providing 		$85 million; (3) 67 percent of respondents reported an increase in 		instrumentation needs between 1992 and 1994; (4) the price tag for the three 		highest priority research instruments was $363 million; (5) 20,978 research 		instruments in the biological sciences had a purchase price of $20,000 or more; 		and (6) principal investigators report that only 28 percent of the biological 		instruments were state-of-the-art in meeting researchers' needs. For HBCUs, the 		study finds that (1) the purchase price of research equipment in 1993 was $4.9 		million, of which 48 percent was spent on maintenance, repair, and operation 		costs of the instrumentation; (2) Federal funding provided 85 percent of 		funding, $4.2 million, to purchase research instrumentation, and NIH was the 		largest source of funds; and (3) 65 percent of respondents reported inadequate 		research equipment.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>A Study to 		Determine the Changes of Physician Prescribing of Antimicrobial Agents, 		Omeprazole, and H<sub>2</sub>-Receptor Antagonists for Peptic Ulcer Disease Two 		Years Following the NIH Consensus Conference on </i>Helicobacter 		pylori</b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This study 		evaluates physicians' prescribing patterns for the treatment of peptic ulcer 		disease (PUD). Its particular focus is whether recommendations of a February 		1994 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference 		advocating the use of antimicrobial agents for peptic ulcer patients with 		<b><i>Helicobacter pylori</i></b> infection were coincident with a change in 		physician prescribing patterns. The study uses computerized Pennsylvania 		Medicaid administrative data from January 1993 through February 1996 to 		evaluate prescribing patterns in the year prior and the two years following the 		NIH conference (12,737 patient records in all). Seven major therapeutic drug 		classes were analyzed: antimicrobial agents, H<sub>2</sub>-receptor 		antagonists, antisecretory agents, bismuth subsalicylate, sucralfate, 		misoprostol, and antacids. The report finds that (1) only 10 percent of 		prescriptions contained an antimicrobial agent, while 62 percent were for an 		H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist only; (2) the two- and three-drug regimens 		recommended by the NIH conference were infrequently prescribed (1.1 percent and 		0.9 percent, respectively); (3) younger and non-white PUD patients were more 		likely to receive a prescription for antimicrobial agents than older and white 		patients; (4) duodenal ulcer patients were more likely than non-duodenal ulcer 		patients to receive an antimicrobial prescriptions; and (5) the prescription of 		antimicrobial agents for the treatment of PUD significantly increased from 7 		percent to 14.2 percent over the study period, while prescriptions for 		H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists significantly decreased. The report 		concludes that, while there were increases in the prescription of antimicrobial 		agents to treat PUD over the study period, these could not be directly 		attributed to the NIH conference. Physicians do not appear to be using national 		recommendations. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Toxicology and 		Environmental Health Information Resources: The Role of the National Library of 		Medicine</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report examines the utility and accessibility of the National Library of 		Medicine's (NLM) Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program 		(TEHIP). The TEHIP program encompasses 16 online data bases that contain 		bibliographic and factual information on environmental contaminants, including 		chemical properties, carcinogenicity, exposure levels, adverse health effects, 		emergency treatment protocols, and Federal regulations. The report notes that 		Federal appropriations for the TEHIP program have remained relatively constant 		over the past 29 years. However, the program's reimbursements from other 		agencies for collaborative projects have fluctuated. The report also notes that 		the TEHIP data base represents only a small subset of the many data bases 		containing information related to toxicology and environmental health. With 		this in mind, the report recommends that NLM consider expanding its traditional 		library services by organizing and cataloging the full spectrum of online 		toxicology and environmental health information resources. The report also 		recognizes that the health professional community does not have homogenous 		information needs and that there is wide variation in access to online data 		bases and other information resources. It recommends that the TEHIP program 		should set priorities that would allow efforts to be focused on those data 		bases that meet the information needs of the greatest number of health 		professionals and that NLM's training and outreach efforts be increased to 		improve awareness of the TEHIP program. The report notes that access to the 		data bases and difficulties in navigating the user interfaces are the two 		primary factors limiting use of the TEHIP data bases. The report also provides 		recommendations on programmatic issues and future directions for the TEHIP 		program. (Final report: 139 pages, plus appendices.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluation of 		the International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups (ICBG)</i></b> 		</p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report evaluates the International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups (ICBG) 		program. Funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science 		Foundation, the ICBG is a program designed to protect human health, advance the 		conservation of biologically diverse ecosystems, and promote sustainable 		economic development through the search for drugs to control diseases of 		concern to both developed and developing countries. Since 1993, the program has 		funded five individual cooperative biodiversity groups around the world. The 		study design attempts to (1) accommodate the varied and nonstandard 		implementations of the ICBG concept, (2) obtain broad coverage in terms of 		respondents, (3) maximize response rates and data quality, (4) minimize burden 		on ICBG Group Leaders and other respondents, and (5) incorporate cost and time 		efficiencies wherever possible. Among the benefits for source countries, the 		report finds (1) that scientific capacity has been developed through training 		and equipment, (2) development of economic activities, (3) equitable financial 		return and the protection of intellectual property rights of source-country 		people, and (4) the potential sustainability of the individual ICBG projects is 		one of the strengths of the overall program. The report recommends that the 		ICBG program (1) develop systems of technical assistance based on a combination 		of outside expertise and lessons learned across programs; (2) improve 		communications among the ICBGs; (3) consider developing a cross-ICBG data base 		that includes work being done in collection, extractions, and drug development 		techniques; and (4) bring in the expertise of social scientists and 		source-country legal experts to the ICGB to ensure that the consensus-building, 		benefit sharing, and economic goals of this project are achieved as well.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Finding the 		Balance: Report of the National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research 		Program (IRP) Planning Committee</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute of Mental Health 		(NIMH) must be positioned to make scientific advances crucial to easing the 		burden of mental disorders. This report represents an active effort by the NIMH 		IRP Planning Committee to help the program make these advances. The Committee 		evaluated the rationale for the program's continuance, as well as its strengths 		and weaknesses. It solicited confidential letters from almost 1,000 IRP 		scientists and staff and met with National Institutes of Health (NIH) 		leadership, the IRP's past and present leadership, and advocacy organizations. 		It found strong justification for the continued existence of the IRP, as long 		as the research it produces is of the highest quality. The Committee also 		offered recommendations to revitalize the IRP. The report finds that (1) stable 		scientific leadership is crucial to revitalizing IRP science, thus the program 		must recruit a Scientific Director for the program; (2) the overall quality of 		IRP science has declined from its previous place at the top of the scientific 		endeavor-while there are some areas of research brilliance, some research is of 		lesser quality, according to members of the Board of Scientific Counselors and 		intramural and extramural scientists; (3) recruitment and retention of talented 		scientists is essential, but over the past five years, the program has 		recruited from outside of NIH only one of its four newly-tenured scientists; 		(4) the quality of the program's intramural training efforts is uneven; (5) the 		program should address the fact that post-doctoral fellows have difficulty 		competing for positions when they leave NIH due to a lack of sufficient 		grantsmanship and teaching experience; and (6) NIMH's IRP's clinical research 		program needs to be sustained and revitalized. </p>
