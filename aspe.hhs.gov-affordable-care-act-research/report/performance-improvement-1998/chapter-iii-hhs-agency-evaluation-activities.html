    <p>Each of the 11 agencies of 		the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Office of the Assistant 		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (OASPE), and the Office of Public Health 		and Science (OPHS) in the Office of the Secretary maintains its own evaluation 		program--including the functions of evaluation planning and policy review, 		quality assurance through technical review, project coordination and 		management, dissemination of reports, and utilization of results. This Chapter 		provides an agency-by-agency summary of the evaluation activities. Each summary 		begins with an overview of the relevant evaluation program, describing its 		philosophy, policies, and procedures. Next is an overview of the major 		evaluations completed in fiscal year (FY) 1997 and the evaluations that are 		currently in progress. Abstracts and contact persons for all evaluations 		completed in FY 1997, organized by agency, are presented in Appendix A.

              <p><b>MISSION: To promote the 		economic and social well-being of families, children, individuals, and 		communities.</b></p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation 		Program</i></b></p>
<p>The Administration for 		Children and Families (ACF) administers a broad range of entitlement and 		discretionary programs, including income maintenance (Temporary Assistance for 		Needy Families [TANF]); child support; children and family services (Head 		Start, Child Welfare, Family Preservation and Support, and youth programs); 		four block grants; and special programs for targeted populations, such as the 		developmentally disabled, immigrants, and Native Americans.</p>
<p>The objectives of ACF's 		evaluations are to furnish information on designing and operating effective 		programs; to test new service delivery approaches capitalizing on the success 		of completed demonstrations; to apply evaluation data to policy development, 		legislative planning, budget decisions, program management, and strategic 		planning and performance measures development; and to disseminate findings of 		completed studies and promote application of results by State and local 		governments.</p>
<p>ACF actively engages with 		other Federal agencies, State and local policy and program officials, national 		organizations, foundations, professional groups and practitioners, and 		consumers to stay current on emerging issues affecting its programs and to 		identify questions for evaluation studies. Systems changes and how they affect 		vulnerable populations, particularly children, are of primary concern. The 		movement toward devolving responsibility for health and human services to State 		and local organizations--in particular, the Personal Responsibility and Work 		Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996--offer both tremendous 		opportunities and unprecedented challenges in redefining and implementing 		services for families. Evaluation study designs are negotiated carefully with 		the States and other interest groups. Studies often are funded as joint 		ventures with Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation and 		other Federal agencies and foundations. Such collaborations permit large-scale 		efforts that are better informed and more representative of varying 		perspectives. Proposals are reviewed by multidisciplinary experts. Work groups 		of various kinds are used to monitor the progress of projects and to advise on 		design refinements and the presentation of findings. </p>
<p><b><i>Summary of Fiscal 		Year 1997 Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p>ACF's evaluations are 		linked closely to its two strategic goals:</p>
<ul><li> To measurably improve 		  the economic independence and productivity of families by reforming the welfare 		  system and by stimulating the changes in attitude and behavior necessary to 		  achieve results; and</li>
<li> To increase the number 		  of children, youth, and families who have improved health, development, and 		  well-being and live in stable communities.</li>
</ul><p>During FY 1997, ACF 		completed 19 evaluations--4 pertaining to the economic independence and 		productivity of families, and 15 related to the healthy development of children 		and families.</p>
<p><b><i>Economic Independence 		and Productivity of Families</i></b> </p>
<p><b><i>LEAP: Final Report on 		Ohio's Welfare Initiative to Improve School Attendance Among Teenage 		Parents--Ohio's Learning, Earning, and Parenting Program </i></b>(6668), 		highlighted in Chapter II, found that (1) even the initial implementation of 		LEAP was a considerable achievement as an unprecedented statewide effort 		requiring new linkages between county welfare and education systems; (2) the 		program achieved smooth operations after implementing a sophisticated statewide 		public assistance computer system; and (3) to a large extent, LEAP met its 		initial goals by significantly increasing school enrollment and attendance for 		in-school teens and dropouts (these outcomes were directly linked to the 		incentives and sanctions provided); (4) in general, the impacts on school 		completion and employment were more positive for teens who were still in school 		when they were identified as eligible for the program (initially-enrolled 		participants) than for dropouts who returned to school; and (6) LEAP increased 		the employment rates for initially-enrolled teens and had positive impacts on 		their earnings during the first 2 years of the 4-year followup. 		</p>
<p><b><i>Responsible 		Fatherhood: An Overview and Conceptual Framework</i></b> (5981) found that 		fathering, even more than mothering, is influenced by contextual forces in the 		family and the community. A father in an adversarial relationship with the 		mother is at risk of becoming an irresponsible father, as is a father who lacks 		adequate employment and income. Responsible fathering can be fostered by 		positive changes in cultural, economic, institutional, and interpersonal 		influences. The report contends that fathering programs should involve a wide 		range of interventions, including (1) involving the mother where feasible and, 		for unmarried fathers, the families of origin; (2) promoting collaborative 		co-parenting; (3) emphasizing critical transitions, such as the birth of a 		child and divorce of the parents; (4) dealing with employment, economic issues, 		and community systems; (5) promoting father-to-father learning; and (6) 		promoting the visibility of committed and collaborative marriage. By developing 		a theoretical underpinning to guide empirical research, program development, 		and program evaluation, this project is intended to help inform policymakers 		about what is necessary to enable a father to support and nurture a 		child. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Self-Sufficiency 		Project Implementation Manual: Lessons Learned from Eight Years of Office of 		Community Services Demonstration Partnership Programs </i></b>(4336.4), 		featured in Chapter II, summarizes lessons learned during eight years of 		Demonstration Partnership Program (DPP) projects. DPP's purposes have been to 		stimulate the development of innovative approaches to increasing the 		self-sufficiency of the poor, to test and evaluate these new approaches, and to 		encourage their replication through dissemination of project results and 		findings. These projects were designed to strengthen the ability of grantees to 		integrate, coordinate, and redirect activities through community partnerships 		that promote maximum self-sufficiency among low-income individuals and families 		who rely on or are at risk of relying on public assistance. The report divides 		the projects into five program areas: (1) case management and family 		development, (2) micro-enterprise and self-employment, (3) minority males, (4) 		homelessness, and (5) youth at risk. Generic models for establishing effective 		community-based programs are presented, and materials for program evaluation 		are elaborated. For each of the five program areas, general lessons learned are 		presented, followed by specific lessons learned pertaining to project design, 		project start-up, project operations, and project evaluation. The project 		implementation manual was designed as a step-by-step guide to the successful 		design, implementation, and evaluation of self-sufficiency projects by 		community action agencies, community-based organizations, and local community 		program planners. It is also meant to serve as a critical reality check for 		legislators and policymakers as they strive to design laws and programs that 		will use scarce resources more effectively to foster self-sufficiency and build 		sustaining capacity within low-income families and communities. 		</p>
<p>The <b><i>Arkansas Prenatal 		and Postnatal Paternity Acknowledgment Project</i></b> (6221) used five basic 		models: (1) basic in-hospital paternity acknowledgment with a genetic testing 		option; (2) prenatal and multiple postnatal opportunities to acknowledge 		paternity; (3) interstate paternity acknowledgment transfer project (i.e., 		parents from one State traveled to another State, gave birth, and signed 		paternity acknowledgments in that State); (4) home-visiting nurse program; and 		(5) alternative parental support program, which abates or reduces child support 		payments for young fathers who participate in opportunities to increase 		parental responsibility. First, the study found that mothers, identified by 		child support staff to be uncooperative in establishing paternity, stated that 		they did not want to establish paternity because either the child's father was 		not involved and that the father gave the mother money already, or that the 		mother did not know where the father was living. By the end of the project, 		13,688 paternity acknowledgments had been received, and the ratio of paternity 		acknowledgments to unmarried births ranged from 48 percent in 1995 to 56 		percent for the first 3 months of 1996. The study also found that 38 percent of 		the acknowledgments were matched to children in the Arkansas child support data 		base, and 27 percent of these had closed by September 1996. Payments had been 		received on only 16 percent of matched cases. </p>
<p><b><i>Healthy Development 		of Children and Families</i></b> </p>
<p>The <b><i>Descriptive Study 		of the Head Start Health Component</i></b> (5849) describes health screening, 		examination, referral, treatment, and followup procedures across the four 		health domains of medical, dental, nutrition, and mental health. The 		researchers reviewed the case records of 1,200 4-year-old children enrolled in 		a national sample of 40 randomly selected Head Start programs and interviewed 		parents regarding their child's health status and health service utilization 		patterns. Through interviews with appropriate Head Start personnel, 		descriptions were obtained on Head Start program staffing patterns and staff 		training, the use of community health resources, and barriers to providing 		health services. </p>
<p>The <b><i>First Progress 		Report on the Head Start Program Performance Measures</i></b> (6693) is the 		first program assessment using performance measures to promote accountability 		through the assessment of program quality and outcomes. It describes the 		development of the performance measures, noting their focus on outcomes rather 		than on processes. The outcomes that will be measured concern how well the 		children in the program do, rather than on such things as teacher credentials. 		The Head Start program also has in place a series of Program Performance 		Standards-- which define program activities--while the Program Performance 		Measures define program results. The report describes the background of the 		Program Performance Measures development, including the conceptual model and 		data sources. The report includes an account of how the Head Start program will 		gather data for the measures and establish a "feedback loop" for policy and 		resource decisionmaking. The report concludes that the performance measures 		will provide a snapshot of the Head Start's program performance at a given 		point in time and will allow the program to compare its performance to the 		past. At the national level, it will allow the program to determine how well it 		is doing through the production of periodic national Head Start progress 		reports. This first report will serve as a benchmark against which future 		performance can be measured and furnishes program accountability information to 		be used in appropriate decisions. </p>
<p>The <b><i>National Study of 		Protective, Preventive, and Reunification Services Delivered to Children and 		Their Families</i></b> (3874) assessed the numbers of children and families in 		the child welfare system who are receiving protective, preventive 		reunification, out-of-home care, and/or aftercare services. It also obtained 		national data on the number, types, and dynamics of the services provided. Case 		record abstracts were completed on a nationally representative sample of 3,000 		children and their families served by public child welfare agencies. A 		subsample was followed for a 9-month period. These findings were compared with 		findings from a previous study, the 1977 National Study of Social Services to 		Children and Their Families. The study found that (1) between 1977 and 1994, 		there was a dramatic decline in the number of children receiving child welfare 		services, reflecting the evolution of the child welfare system from a 		broad-based social services system to one primarily serving abused and 		neglected children and their families; (2) the child welfare system has not 		evolved into an in-home family-based system from a foster care system, as had 		been envisioned by the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980; (3) 		foster care drift remains a problem, with more than one-third of the children 		in foster care remaining there for more than 18 months; (4) minority children, 		particularly African-American children, are more likely to be in foster care 		placement than to receive in-home services, even when they have the same 		characteristics and problems as white children; and (5) kinship care does not 		explain the dramatically longer stays in foster care for African-American and 		Hispanic children compared to white children. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Examination of 		Special Needs Adoption in New York State--Phase III Report: Subsidized 		Adoptions in New York State, 1989-1993 </i></b>(4380.1) was initiated in order 		to pilot a statewide data collection system for special needs adoptions. The 		study analyzed information on the characteristics of adopted children and their 		adoptive families, looking at procedural issues and the nature and amount of 		subsidy payments provided to the adopted child. This was done for the entire 		population of children being placed in New York by public and private agencies. 		The Phase III report, one of five phase reports, contains a descriptive 		analysis of statistics on the number of children placed between 1989 and 1993 		in New York State, the level of this support, and the nature of the children's 		special needs. The report found that (1) 12,858 new adoption subsidies were 		approved in New York State during the study period; (2) 62 percent of children 		receiving an adoption subsidy in the State qualified because they were hard to 		place; (3) personality or behavioral problems were the most prevalent reason 		for a child's classification as handicapped (about one-fourth of children 		qualified for a subsidy had physical handicaps or severe medical conditions); 		(4) more male than female children were adopted with a subsidy in New York 		State; and (5) about one-half of all special needs children are placed in 		adoptive homes headed by a single mother. </p>
<p>Eleven evaluations 		addressed the issue of child maltreatment. First, <b><i>Child Maltreatment 		1995: Reports from the States to the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data 		System</i></b> (5387.4) found that (1) in 1995, more than 1 million children 		were identified as victims of abuse or neglect (a rate of 15 per 1,000 		children); (2) about 80 percent of the perpetrators of child maltreatment were 		the parents of the victims, while another 10 percent were other relatives and 		about 2 percent were people in other caretaking roles; (3) 52 percent of 		victims suffered from neglect, about twice as many as were subjected to 		physical abuse, the next most frequent kind of maltreatment,(25 percent); (3) 		about 13 percent of victims were sexually abused; (4) more than half of all 		victims were 7 years of age or younger, while about 26 percent younger than 4 		years old (about 21 percent of victims were teenagers); (5) the majority of 		victims of neglect and medical neglect were younger than 8 years old, while 		most victims of other forms of maltreatment were older than 8 years old; and 		(6) 45 States reported that 996 children were known by the child protection 		services (CPS) agency to have died as a result of abuse or neglect--most of 		these deaths were children 3 years of age or younger. The report also found 		that (1) CPS agencies investigated nearly 2 million reports alleging 		maltreatment of about 3 million children (a rate of 43 per 1,000 children); (2) 		reports were received from professionals (53 percent), family members (19 		percent), friends and neighbors (9 percent), and anonymous sources (19 		percent); and (3) nationally, about 36 percent of investigations resulted in a 		disposition of either substantiated or indicated maltreatment, while 58 percent 		of allegations were not substantiated. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation of Nine 		Comprehensive Community-Based Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Programs: 		Cross-Site Evaluation Report</i></b> (5851) is a synthesis of the site 		evaluations that were part of ACF's comprehensive community-based child abuse 		and neglect prevention programs. The purposes of the study were (1) to design 		and implement a process and impact evaluation of nine comprehensive 		community-based child abuse and neglect prevention projects; (2) to provide 		technical assistance to the nine projects in meeting the requirements of the 		evaluation; and (3) to aid the programs in designing and implementing their own 		internal program evaluations. The evaluation was conducted in three phases over 		a 3-year period. The nine projects had up to ten service components, many of 		which differed across the programs. Therefore, individual experimental designs 		were developed for each service component. Process and impact data were 		collected across programs and through a series of studies conducted in each 		site. All grantees were aided in refining their evaluation and research plans. 		The report provides a context for understanding the experiences of the nine 		projects. A literature review, an examination of study methodology, the 		projects' implementation experiences, an accounting of the study findings, and 		policy recommendations are offered. The report found several program elements 		vital to the success of the projects, including (1) an emphasis on community 		involvement and ownerships, (2) employing a positive approach, (3) starting on 		a small scale, and (4) implementing a strong evaluation and using it as a 		program management tool. The report recommends that the National Center on 		Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN) implement several strategies to enhance the 		success of these kinds of projects, including (1) focusing future grant 		programs on more narrowly defined target populations, (2) stressing the 		importance of community involvement, and (3) providing grantees with a research 		framework and priorities delineating key research questions on child 		maltreatment and requiring grantees to implement appropriate process and 		outcome evaluation designs. </p>
<p>Described below are the 		results of the individual evaluations of the nine comprehensive community-based 		child abuse and neglect prevention programs. <b><i>Preventing Child Abuse and 		Neglect: A Case Study of Family Care Connection</i></b> (5851.3) describes a 		replication in several high-risk communities of a preexisting program in 		Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, using community-based parent education to 		improve parent-child relationships. Family Care Connection (FCC) expanded 		services at an existing drop-in center and established four centers in three 		more at-risk communities. The centers provided such services as respite care, 		child development, recreation, education, and counseling. An evaluation found 		that (1) 279 parents had graduated from the parenting classes from September 		1989 through June 1991, and that these graduates reported that they would be 		less likely to use physical punishment with their children; (2) the rate of low 		birthweight babies decreased after program implementation in two communities; 		and (3) FCC was successfully established as an institution in the communities 		through aggressive pursuit of funding and by using staff that were hired and 		paid by "partner agencies." The report concludes that FCC achieved notable 		success in institutionalizing its services in the communities in which it 		established drop-in centers under the NCCAN grant. FCC carefully selected 		community agencies as partners, and established personal contacts and 		networking connections with agencies and organizations in its target 		communities. </p>
<p>The report of 		<b><i>Preventing Child Abuse and Neglect: A Case Study of Families First in 		Fairfax</i></b> (5851.1) found that (1) the program being operated in Fairfax 		County, Virginia, at the end of the grant period differed substantially from 		the one originally proposed: a number of child abuse prevention strategies 		attempted during the first two years were ultimately discontinued; (2) the 		greatest barrier to program implementation during the first two years was a 		lack of specificity on how to achieve the program's mission; (3) during the 		last two years, program development was dynamic and yielded many effective 		strategies that were made permanent at the end of the demonstration period; (4) 		the demonstration program fostered a growth in parenting programs, family and 		early infant health care programs, neighborhood resource centers, and 		directories of services made available to ethnic minority populations; (5) the 		program also encouraged increased collaboration and information-sharing between 		the agencies and organizations working in the area of child abuse and neglect 		prevention; and (6) the biggest problems during the 5-year demonstration period 		were frequent leadership changes and staff turnover. </p>
<p>The report, 		<b><i>Preventing Child Abuse and Neglect: A Case Study of Community Coalition 		Acting for Positive Parenting</i></b> (5851.2), developed by Temple 		University's Center for Social Policy and Community Development, found that the 		project (1) affected three different groups: the community, child abuse 		professionals, and the University, allowing members of each group to learn from 		members of other groups and fostering an expanded community cooperation; (2) 		sparked the institutionalization of community-based efforts to support families 		and inform the community about its role in preventing child abuse; (3) created 		a community-based planning and development council or community board through 		which key leaders can both receive and disseminate information; (4) shifted its 		attention away from child abuse and neglect to a more positive, family-support 		approach by fostering Family Life Festivals, library programs, and parent-child 		activities, which reduced parental isolation; (5) using community-based 		providers as agents for prevention activities enabled the program to attract 		more of the target population; and (6) universities that have experience 		working with social issues facilitate program implementation and lend 		legitimacy to community-based efforts. </p>
<p><b><i>Preventing Child 		Abuse and Neglect: A Case Study of Community Lifelines Program</i></b> (5851.4) 		describes a program developed by the Family Life Development Center of Cornell 		University in collaboration with the government and human service agencies of 		Chemung County, New York. The program was designed to alleviate community 		conditions that lead to isolation, poor self-image, and economic stress, 		thereby reducing some underlying causes of child abuse and neglect. Community 		Lifelines Programs (CLPs) were responsible for various program initiatives in 		the city of Elmira and the rural Van Etten/Spencer school district. The 		initiatives included Parent Partner Programs (PPPs), parent support groups, 		activities encouraging better parent-child communication, and family support 		programs. The report describes the community, the grantee agency, the program 		design and changes over time, barriers to program implementation, and 		strategies used to overcome these barriers. It also describes the program 		effects and efforts to institutionalize CLP components. The report finds that 		the Elmira PPP was very successful, as was the CLP in Van Etten/Spencer. In 		Elmira, the PPP fostered better relationships between schools and parents, 		between parents, and between parents and children. In Van Etten/Spencer, 		several initiatives succeeded, including a program for parents of teenagers 		(Parent Lifelines), an after-school program, and a playgroup. However, several 		other initiatives had little impact or started too late in the demonstration 		period to be measured. These included the Family Portraits component, the 		Family Connections Room, and Food Stamps Outreach. The public awareness 		campaign launched in conjunction with CLP was successful and useful, according 		to a reader survey. </p>
<p>The report of the project 		<b><i>Preventing Child Abuse and Neglect: A Case Study of PARE (Physical Abuse 		and Neglect Reduction Effort) </i></b>(5851.5), developed by the Exchange Club 		Center for the Prevention of Child Abuse in Carolina, Puerto Rico, discusses 		the environmental factors and indicators of social disruption associated with 		increased risk for child abuse and neglect in Puerto Rico. It provides a 		comprehensive overview of all aspects of the PARE program design and 		operations, as well as evaluation findings. PARE provided intervention 		strategies in an effort to stop future child abuse while preserving the family. 		PARE was designed to be family-oriented and to emphasize self-help and 		volunteer action. The demonstration model emphasized interventions directed 		towards the individual, the family, and the community, as well as cultural 		factors. The report describes several interventions, including (1) an 		interagency task force, (2) a public awareness campaign, (3) respite centers, 		(4) a life skills curriculum, (5) an educational curriculum for prenatal 		clinics, (6) a parent aid program, and (7) a parent laboratory. The report 		finds that (1) the development and implementation of three respite centers 		pioneered new concepts and approaches to providing secondary prevention; (2) 		702 volunteers provided support services and served as role models; (3) the 		program gained the support of the community, government officials, public and 		private agencies, the business community, and the media; and (4) the public 		awareness campaign was broadcast throughout Puerto Rico and reached a large 		segment of the population. The report concludes that PARE increased child abuse 		awareness in Puerto Rico, but that more work needs to be done before child 		abuse prevention becomes a priority for leaders and politicians on the 		island. </p>
<p><b><i>Preventing Child 		Abuse and Neglect: A Case Study of North Lawndale Family Support Initiative 		</i></b>(5851.6) describes a project developed by the Greater Chicago Council 		of the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse to test the efficacy of a 		model that advocates comprehensive prevention strategies aimed at both the 		community and its residents. The model includes community education, parent 		education, parent support groups, school-based prevention services for 		children, and therapeutic services for abused children and their families. The 		evaluation found that (1) the most successful components of the North Lawndale 		Family Support Initiative (NLFSI) were the advisory council, the community 		needs assessment, public awareness, and life skills training; (2) the least 		effective components were the parent education program, the parent support 		groups, and therapeutic care--this ineffectiveness was due to inadequate 		program design, local implementation difficulties, and the grantee's perception 		that NCCAN required more direct services; (3) the NLFSI benefitted from stable 		and credible staff that had already established themselves in the community 		before the program's implementation; (4) although staff possessed strong 		outreach skills which served them well in the public awareness campaign, but 		lacked the skills and background needed to implement direct services; and (5) 		the NLFSI lacked a clearly defined or effectively developed relationship with 		its grantee Agency and had difficulty in being acknowledged as a full-fledged 		member of the community, due to its situation on the campus of a community 		college located at the edge of the target community. The report also discusses 		barriers to program implementation and efforts to institutionalize the program, 		and includes several recommendations in key areas. </p>
<p>The report, 		<b><i>Preventing Child Abuse and Neglect: A Case Study of Dorchester 		CARES</i></b> (5851.7), describes a collaborative project of the Massachusetts 		Committee for Children and Youth, Inc., Federated Dorchester Neighborhood 		House, and, by the end of the demonstration period, several other 		collaborators. The model was designed to demonstrate that through 		collaboration, advocacy, resource development, education, and services, a 		community can create opportunities for families to increase their social 		networks and become more independent and self-sustaining. The report found that 		(1) Dorchester CARES staff stressed that it was not an agency or a program, but 		rather a collaborative comprised of member agencies and staff who thought of 		themselves as a process; (2) the project reflected an ecological approach that 		combined a psychiatric model and a sociological model (the first was directed 		toward a "sick parent" and stressed therapy and education, while the second was 		aimed at the "sick society" and stressed educational and political strategies); 		(3) over the demonstration period, the program improved family functioning to 		provide a more nurturing environment for children's development; (4) the 		program created opportunities for family members to become more independent and 		self-sustaining and for community members to work together to achieve common 		goals; (5) the CARES family support program worked by proactively encouraging 		social networking, increasing nurturing values and skills, and empowering 		parents to carry out their caregiving roles; and (6) the program was 		successfully duplicated in several other neighborhoods and was 		institutionalized in Dorchester. </p>
<p><b><i>Preventing Child 		Abuse and Neglect: A Case Study of Maine Families</i></b> (5851.8) describes a 		collaboration between the urban Cumberland County Child Abuse and Neglect 		Council (CCCANC) and the rural Franklin County Children's Task Force (FCCTF). 		Other local community, school, and service organizations joined the two county 		organizations to identify and address the needs of children and their families. 		CCCANC implemented a school family center, a media program, a public library 		discussion series, a teenage parent day care and support center, a drop-in 		laundry program, a parents' speaker and support group, and a parent education 		program in a low-income housing development. FCCTF implemented a summer reading 		program, a resource directory, a parent education program for Head 		Start-eligible families, parent cooperative support and education groups, and a 		parent mentoring and home visitation program. In both counties, the project 		supported community events to reduce the isolation of families and to encourage 		a sense of support and togetherness. The Maine Families Project evaluation was 		primarily a qualitative assessment of the reactions of program participants and 		leaders. Major findings were that (1) the project was guided by an effort to 		structure interventions based upon what parents said they needed, rather than 		on what project staff or other agency staff believed they needed; (2) focus 		groups revealed that few parents believed that they were doing an effective 		parenting job, and most felt isolated from support and in need of information 		and assistance; (3) the project emphasized involving business and industry in 		designing and implementing community programming; and (4) collaboration is 		enhanced by using a businesslike approach. </p>
<p><b><i>Preventing Child 		Abuse and Neglect: A Case Study of I CARE </i></b>(5851.9) describes a project 		developed by the Ohio Research Institute on Child Abuse and Prevention to model 		a prevention program in direct response to the needs and existing resources of 		the target community in Columbus, Ohio. The conclusions and recommendations 		were that (1) a prevention model containing all the components specified for 		this demonstration would be difficult, if not impossible, notwithstanding an 		annual budget of $200,000; (2) although community-based programs cannot correct 		all the societal problems leading to child abuse and neglect, it should be 		aware of their effects; (3) an interdisciplinary task force from the community 		should be considered mandatory; and (4) the uncertainty of future funding is a 		major obstacle for demonstration or pilot programs. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluations in 		Progress</i></b> </p>
<p>ACF has 71 evaluations in 		progress, 43 of which relate to the economic independence and productivity of 		families and 28 to the healthy development of children and 		families. </p>
<p><b><i>Economic Independence 		and Productivity of Families</i></b> </p>
<p>Policymakers and program 		operators recognize that job loss among newly employed welfare recipients is a 		major barrier to the more general goal of increasing the rate at which 		recipients obtain employment and leave welfare. A high proportion of welfare 		recipients who become employed lose their jobs and return to public assistance, 		often within a few months. The four-site <b><i>Post-Employment Services 		Demonstration</i></b> (5974) addresses this important aspect of a comprehensive 		welfare-to-work strategy. Demonstrations in Riverside, California; Chicago, 		Illinois; Portland, Oregon; and San Antonio, Texas; are providing job retention 		and re-employment services to recently employed Job Opportunities and Basic 		Skills Training (JOBS) program participants randomly assigned to receive 		additional services, which will be provided regardless of continued AFDC 		receipt. Each site will enroll approximately 500 participants. 		</p>
<p>The<b><i> Home Visiting 		Services Demonstration</i></b> (5980) evaluation is assessing the effectiveness 		of the Home Visiting Services Demonstration in three sites--Chicago, Illinois; 		Dayton, Ohio; and Portland, Oregon--in which first-time teenaged parents on 		AFDC are required to participate in the JOBS program. Those randomly assigned 		to receive the treatment are assigned a paraprofessional home visitor. The 		demonstrations are testing whether adding weekly home visitor services to 		mandatory JOBS programs will result in a substantial strengthening of the 		effectiveness of JOBS programs in helping young mothers better support 		themselves and their children while promoting positive parenting and reductions 		in repeat childbearing. </p>
<p>The<b><i> Prenatal and 		Early Childhood Nurse Home Visitation 		Program--Replication/Dissemination</i></b> (6757) project allows for data 		collection and evaluation of an initiative to replicate and disseminate the 		nurse home visiting model. The model has been tested through randomized trials 		and found to be effective in improving outcomes for mothers and their children 		on a number of important outcome measures, including (1) educational 		attainment, (2) employment, (3) welfare dependency, (4) parenting attitudes, 		and (5) subsequent pregnancies. The Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile 		Justice and Delinquency Prevention funded a grant to support technical 		assistance and training to replicate the model in selected Weed and Seed sites. 		This project supports the evaluation component of the initiative to test the 		effectiveness of the replication process within normal operating 		environments. </p>
<p>The <b><i>New Hope 		Project</i></b> (5982) is assessing the effect of subsidizing work for 		individuals and families that are currently poor. The project offers 		participants assistance in finding a job, or finding a community service job if 		they are unable to obtain employment in the private sector after 8 weeks. Wage 		subsidies are provided to assure an income above the poverty level. 		Participants are also offered access to affordable health insurance and child 		care. The offer is designed to be flexible according to individual 		circumstances. Benefits are phased out as earnings increase to make a smooth 		transition. </p>
<p><b><i>Capitalizing the 		Bridge from Welfare to Independence</i></b> (CBWI) (6755) is designed to expand 		the employment and training services provided by Goodwill Industries by 		constructing new centers in four counties in southwest Florida and six parishes 		in southeast Louisiana. Once constructed, the centers are expected to be 		self-supporting (i.e., no need for continuing public support) by utilizing the 		business activity and payroll generated by the donated goods 		business. </p>
<p><b><i>Analyzing the 		Employment and Wage Patterns of Welfare Recipients</i></b> (6756) will describe 		the employment and wage patterns of welfare recipients using data from the 		National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and from the evaluation of the 		Post-Employment Services Demonstration, which operated in California, Illinois, 		Oregon, and Texas. While many studies have looked at the dynamics of welfare 		receipt and the reasons people leave welfare, few studies have focused on 		employment patterns among welfare recipients or wage profiles of welfare 		recipients who obtain employment. The project will address the circumstances of 		welfare recipients who find jobs, the employment and wage patterns of welfare 		recipients who find jobs, and what accounts for welfare recipients' employment 		and wage patterns. </p>
<p>The<b><i> Ohio Works First 		Evaluation</i></b> (6758) is an assessment of the Ohio Works First Program, 		which is designed to help families obtain employment and become 		self-sufficient. It includes provisions for completing a self-sufficiency 		contract, more generous earned income disregards, a 36-out-of-any-60-month time 		limit, and whole family sanctions. The evaluation focuses on the following 		topics: implementation of the core set of services; variations across counties 		in program design and service delivery; policy changes affecting recipients' 		attitudes and behaviors toward work participation; the response and reaction of 		local officials to the new policies and governance structure under welfare 		reform; the effects on recipients' participation in work activities; the 		effectiveness of work participation activities in increasing employment levels 		and self-sufficiency; the most effective components of work participation 		activities; differences among population groups affected by the program; the 		groups most at risk of exceeding the time limit; and the impact of specific 		policy provisions (e.g., time limits and sanctions). </p>
<p>The <b><i>Examination of 		State Diversion Programs</i></b> (6759) project is gathering information from 		all States on the policies and practices that constitute diversion programs 		and/or activities designed to divert Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 		(TANF) applications. More detailed case studies will be conducted in five to 		seven States in order to more fully document actual implementation and 		operation of the diversion policies and activities. A major focus of the study 		will be on examining linkages between Medicaid enrollment and diversion 		programs/activities. The study also will examine whether and how local 		communities and institutions, particularly traditional safety net providers, 		are affected by diversion programs or activities. The project will address the 		following issues: (1) how State diversion programs or activities are being 		conceived, structured, and implemented; (2) the effects of these 		programs/activities on participants, particularly with respect to Medicaid 		enrollment; (3) how local community institutions are affected, particularly by 		changes in Medicaid enrollment rates; and (4) whether strategies for monitoring 		changes in Medicaid enrollment rates can be developed based on existing 		data. </p>
<p>The<b><i> Evaluation of 		Community-Based Job Retention Programs</i></b> (6760) is divided into two 		phases. The first phase consists of a detailed implementation analysis and 		short-term outcome findings for approximately 700 participants (employed TANF 		recipients) receiving various mixes of job retention and post-employment 		services through five community-based neighborhood service organizations in 		Pittsburgh that received funding from the Pittsburgh Foundation (referred to as 		the GAPS program). A common set of services will be provided, but within the 		context of somewhat different existing service delivery systems among the 		community-based organizations. The second phase, in the second and third years 		of the project, will include State-funded job retention programs in addition to 		the GAPS projects. Issues addressed will include the post-employment services 		most instrumental in helping newly employed TANF recipients maintain 		employment, the organizational features important to successful delivery of job 		retention services, and the appropriate duration of services. 		</p>
<p>The <b><i>Family Investment 		Program (FIP)</i></b> (6761) project continues the evaluation of a welfare 		reform demonstration combining program changes designed to ease a family's 		transition from welfare to work with strict requirements that recipients 		participate in developing and executing a social contract, the Family 		Investment Agreement (FIA), under Iowa's employment program. The FIA details 		the steps a family will take to become self-sufficient and sets a time frame 		for doing so. Families opting not to develop an FIA or not following through 		with the self-sufficiency plan outlined in the agreement are placed on a 		6-month Limited Benefit Plan, which leads to the complete loss of cash 		assistance for the following 6-month period. </p>
<p>The<b><i> State Welfare 		Reform Evaluation Track 2</i></b> (6762), complementing a separately funded 		evaluation being completed on Iowa's Family Investment Program (FIP), consists 		of a study of repeat Limited Benefit Plan (LBP) assignments and a study of 		post-employment services. The study of repeat LBP assignments will gather 		information on why cases are reassigned, how reassigned cases are affected by 		the immediate cessation of cash assistance in a second LBP, and the time 		pattern of their return to cash assistance. The study of post-employment 		services will describe and compare standard and enhanced services and assess 		their contribution to a client's progress toward self-sufficiency and off cash 		assistance. It will also document processes for developing, implementing, and 		delivering post-employment services. </p>
<p>Neighborhood variation in 		the availability of public and private social services throughout Los Angeles 		County early in the process of welfare reform will be examined in the 		<b><i>Neighbors, Service Providers, and Welfare Reform in Los Angeles 		County</i></b> (6763) project. The project will also study how agencies are 		adapting to the current and anticipated changes in demand for their services as 		a result of welfare reform. The focus of the inquiry will be specifically on 		services directed toward children and families. </p>
<p>The<b><i> Welfare 		Restructuring Project (WRP)</i></b> (6764) continues the evaluation of a 		welfare reform demonstration in Vermont. A key feature of the demonstration is 		a time limit that requires some adult recipients to participate in community 		work experience after 15 months (for two-parent families) or 30 months (for 		single-parent families) of receiving cash assistance. Other policies of the 		project include asset and disregard changes, which require minor parents with 		temporary disabilities to participate in rehabilitation and training 		programs. </p>
<p><b><i>Achieving Change for 		Texans</i></b> (6765) is the evaluation of Texas' original welfare reform 		demonstration. It consists of a policy on recipient responsibilities for 		immunization of children, school attendance, and adhering to a personal 		responsibility agreement; a policy on differential benefit time limits based on 		work experience and the need for education; several policy options for 		individual development accounts and fill-the-gap budgeting; and a one-county 		pilot offering a check for $1,000 in lieu of regular TANF with no reapplication 		for benefits for one year. The major study questions are as follows: How does 		the differential time limit work, taking into consideration work experience and 		education for setting the limit's duration? Is TANF-One-Time an effective way 		to help people with temporary needs without making them recipients? Will 		personal responsibility measures help TANF recipients become self-sufficient 		faster? Can policies designed to promote and reward work help the process of 		self-sufficiency? </p>
<p>The<b><i> Evaluation of 		Arizona Employing and Moving People Off Welfare and Encouraging Responsibility 		Program (EMPOWER)</i></b> (6818) project will address whether there are 		significant differences between experimental and control groups with respect 		to: (1) income and employment, (2) program participation, (3) program duration, 		(4) family structure (including fertility) and stability, (5) children's 		well-being, and (6) employer health benefit provisions. </p>
<p>The<b><i> State Welfare 		Reform Evaluation Project</i></b> <b><i>(Jobs First) </i></b>(6819), initiated 		in Connecticut, will look at the following program outcomes: work and earnings; 		welfare receipt and costs; job-retention and recidivism; family composition and 		stability; the well-being of children; child support and other sources of 		income; family income and poverty status; the use and perceived quality of 		program services and child care; material hardship; and attitudes toward work, 		welfare, and the Jobs First program. The implementation and operation of the 		program will be explored to determine how, and how well, it was integrated with 		other agencies, including staff training, changes in office culture, and 		changes in case management. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Florida Family 		Transition Program (FTP) Evaluation Project</i></b> (6820) will address the 		following questions: Is the Family Transition Program (FTP) program being 		implemented as intended? How do program staff across all components of FTP 		achieve the multiple goals implicit in the program model? How do welfare 		recipients respond to the new package of rules and services? Who reaches the 		time limits? What happens prior to and at the point when time limits are 		reached, and after benefits are terminated? Does FTP increase the rate at which 		welfare recipients participate in and complete various education and employment 		activities? Does FTP lead to increases in employment and earnings? Does FTP 		reduce welfare receipt? Is FTP cost-effective? </p>
<p>In Illinois, the<b><i> 		Youth Employment and Training Initiative (YETI)</i></b> (6821) is studying 		whether interventions that focus on inner-city youth from welfare families 		(1,000 students in 3 high schools randomly assigned to a treatment or a control 		group) will help participants complete high school, obtain and hold regular 		jobs, avoid the pitfalls of substance abuse or early parenthood, and achieve 		economic self-sufficiency. The process study centers on whether such a program 		can be effectively implemented and operated in inner-city schools. A 		cost-benefit analysis will determine the cost-effectiveness of YETI for 		government, participants, and the general public. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Indiana Welfare 		Reform Evaluation Project </i></b>(6869) continues the evaluation of the 		Indiana Manpower Placement and Comprehensive Training Program waiver 		demonstration now operating under TANF. The study will examine the following 		questions: Was the reform successfully implemented? In what ways does the new 		program differ from its predecessor? What organizational characteristics, 		service features, and aspects of the demonstration environment determine its 		impacts? How do these reforms impact benefit payments, income, 		self-sufficiency, children's well-being, and family stability? What are the 		consequences of the changes on the size and composition of the welfare caseload 		under TANF? What trends should the State expect in levels of benefit payments 		and services needed? What happens to individuals after they leave welfare, 		especially those who reach the time limit? What are the impacts of time limits? 		How has welfare reform affected welfare entry? </p>
<p>The<b><i> Maryland Family 		Investment Program Evaluation</i></b> (6823) is a statewide process study to 		examine and document front-line assessment and allocation practices in the 		State's 24 local jurisdictions. The research questions to be addressed are as 		follows: How much discretion do county-level workers have in assessing clients 		and directing them to services that are likely to address their needs? How does 		worker discretion vary from one county to another? How do county management 		differences influence assessment practices? How do county front-line assessment 		practices and differences affect welfare service delivery? Do assessment 		practices appear to be appropriate to clients' situations and clearly directed 		to desired TANF outcomes (e.g., successful employment placement before a time 		limit is reached) and other measures of family well-being? </p>
<p>An eight-county (four urban 		and four rural), 17,000-case (randomly assigned to treatment or control group) 		evaluation of the <b><i>Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP) 		</i></b>(6824) is attempting to answer the following major research questions: 		What are the effects of financial incentives in employment and welfare receipt? 		What is the effect of mandatory case management in combination with increased 		financial incentives? What is the effect of case management services timing? 		What is the extent of client understanding and participation in MFIP? What is 		the nature of services being provided and the interactions between clients and 		staff? What are the net costs of the program from a variety of 		perspectives? </p>
<p>The <b><i>Minnesota 		WorkFIRST Program (Track 2)</i></b> (6825)<b> </b>project is a comparative 		evaluation of Minnesota's WorkFIRST with the Minnesota Family Investment 		Program and STRIDE services (MFIP-S). WorkFIRST uses a rapid labor force 		attachment strategy versus MFIP-S (the State's TANF program), which represents 		a progressive labor force attachment model. The project will address the 		following questions: Will the WorkFIRST program have a greater impact on moving 		first-time applicants into employment and promoting long-term self-sufficiency 		or will the concept of "make work pay" strategy of the MFIP-S programs prove 		more effective in moving people off welfare? Is WorkFIRST more effective in 		preventing first-time applicants from becoming dependent on public assistance? 		Do tough sanctions and vendor payment reinforce the WorkFIRST message of 		personal responsibility? </p>
<p>The<b><i> Evaluation of the 		Employment First Program</i></b> (6826) project in Nebraska includes an impact 		study featuring a random assignment experiment in Omaha of 4,800 recipient and 		2,250 applicant cases, and a subsample of 2,000 randomly assigned cases that 		will be interviewed in a survey. A process study will be conducted in four 		sites, including Omaha and Lincoln and will include interviews with a subsample 		of 180 cases 3 months from the date of initial assignment to determine 		understanding of the program. Another subsample of 350 cases will be used to 		collect data not available from the State's data system. The case manager study 		will begin with a case manager background information questionnaire supported 		by client outcomes data. High-performing case managers will be identified and 		interviewed to determine the components of their success. </p>
<p>The <b><i>New Hampshire 		Employment and Training Program Process and Outcome Study</i></b> (6827) will 		examine the planning, funding, and implementation of the State's welfare reform 		program and its different components at the State and local levels. This study 		will examine the following questions: What are the allocated funding levels for 		planning and ongoing program operation? What are the reactions to, and effects 		of, the various sorts of interagency collaborations around which the program is 		designed? What activities has the State conducted to promote culture change 		among the staff, clients, and community partners? What has been the reaction to 		the up-front diversion and employment aspects of the program? How are staff 		implementing assessment and program assignment procedures? Overall, what do the 		assessment procedures help discover about client barriers and needs? What are 		the outcomes of measures such as employment rates, length of employment, total 		earned income, child support collection, total family income, and 		savings? </p>
<p>The <b><i>Impact Study of 		the New Hampshire Employment Program</i></b> (6828) will involve a pre-post 		non-experimental design consisting of comparisons between baseline and 		post-implementation cohorts, caseload modeling techniques, and a pre-post time 		series analysis of trends on selected welfare-related aggregate measures. 		Answers will be sought to the following questions: Does New Hampshire's welfare 		reform program have an impact on State welfare case dynamics, including exit 		rates, length of benefit receipt, and recidivism? Does the program have an 		impact on welfare caseloads compared to forecasted caseload values such new 		welfare case openings, case closings, denials and withdrawals, "child only" 		cases, earned income cases, and benefit payments? Does the program affect 		welfare-related measures such as foster care placements, child abuse and 		neglect, homelessness, paternity establishments, and child support 		collections? </p>
<p>Data gathered in eight 		counties in the <b><i>Evaluation of the North Carolina Work First 		Program</i></b> (6829) will be used to address several questions: To what 		extent can the observed differences in client outcomes between counties be 		attributable to variations in local economic conditions and unemployment rates? 		To what extent are the intercounty differences attributable to other contextual 		factors such as variations in health coverage or demographics of the local 		population? What political and organizational factors may have affected the 		results for each county? What are the outcomes of Work First in terms of 		indicators for self-sufficiency, welfare costs, levels of work activity 		participation, family structure and stability, and child health and 		well-being? </p>
<p>In North Dakota, the 		<b><i>Training, Education, Employment, and Management (TEEM) Project</i></b> 		(6830) will continue the evaluation of the TEEM project, which consolidates 		TANF and the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) into a single 		cash assistance program. The TEEM project includes social contracts, increased 		work incentives, sanctions, raised asset limits, and incentives for family 		stability and marriage. The study will look at the following questions: How are 		policies, services, and program rules implemented? How are families and county 		staff affected by the new policies and programs, and does this vary by 		subpopulation (e.g., ethnicity) within and between the counties? What are the 		components of the TEEM screening system? What barriers to employment are 		addressed? How do client participation rates in welfare programs, including 		employment/training programs and the Child Support Enforcement program, change 		with the implementation of TEEM? How well does TEEM serve clients with special 		needs (such as disabled clients, clients with disabled children, and clients 		with substance abuse or domestic violence problems)? </p>
<p>The<b><i> Virginia 		Independence Program</i></b> (6831) project, an evaluation of TANF 		implementation, will study the following policy topics: diversionary 		assistance, family caps, compulsory school attendance, paternity establishment, 		minor parent residency, required immunizations, savings accounts, 2-year time 		limits, personal responsibility agreements, expanded earned income disregards, 		transitional Medicaid, and child care benefits. The major research questions 		are as follows: What happens to families after they reach the time limit? What 		are the effects of post-employment and job-retention services offered by the 		State? What are the implications of the growing number of child-only cases the 		State is finding on its welfare rolls? What are the issues around players and 		localities where unique innovations have been introduced in the State? How does 		diversionary assistance work in a limited number of localities? What are the 		dynamics of the Virginia caseload over time, under the TANF regime? Are there 		social health indicators for TANF recipients other than those required by law 		that would help the State keep abreast of developments as they affect the 		caseload? </p>
<p><b><i>Welfare-to-Work: 		Monitoring the Impact of Welfare Reform on American Indian Families with 		Children</i></b> (6832) is being conducted in Arizona. The State was selected 		because it has the largest population of American Indians living on 		reservations and because the 21 reservations differ on a variety of dimensions. 		The research questions that will be addressed are as follows: What are the 		demographic, social, and economic characteristics of Indian families with 		children on welfare? What are the reservation-based or individual barriers to 		raising the skills and employment potential of Indian parents on welfare? How 		have the tribal councils prepared themselves to deal with the consequences of 		welfare reform? How are tribes who plan to administer TANF independently 		positioning themselves to undertake this task? Will the benefits and outcomes 		to families vary significantly depending on whether TANF is administered by the 		State or the tribe? What strategies are time-limited parents using to attain 		independence? What proportion of those losing eligibility shift to Indian 		general assistance programs? </p>
<p>The <b><i>Assessing 		Effective Welfare-to-Work Strategies for Domestic Violence Victims and 		Survivors in the Options/Opciones Project</i></b> (6833) will document the 		needs of battered girls and women on welfare and will identify those strategies 		successfully employed to eliminate violence and to provide alternatives to 		welfare. The research will focus on services provided through Options/Opciones 		in partnership with the Illinois Department of Public Aid in one community of 		North Lawndale. Questions to be addressed are as follows. What are the 		successful strategies that battered women on welfare use to become economically 		self-sufficient? What are the service needs of battered girls and women on 		welfare? Which problems serve as the major welfare-to-work barriers for 		battered girls and women? What combination of services is needed to address the 		domestic violence and welfare-to-work issues, and in what order? Did these 		services lead to labor market participation, and for what percentage of women 		and under what time frame? What are the characteristics of girls and women who 		successfully remove themselves from situations containing domestic violence? 		What are the characteristics of the girls and women who successfully enter the 		labor force versus those who do not? </p>
<p>The purpose of the<b><i> 		Welfare Reform Studies and Analyses (Rural TANF) (</i></b>6834) project is to 		conduct an in-depth process evaluation of family response to the implementation 		of welfare reform in three remote rural counties of northeastern Washington 		State: Stevens, Ferry, and Pend Oreille. Eighty families (40 experimental and 		40 comparison) will be interviewed 5 times within 16 months. The families will 		be selected from the 340 households currently participating in the 		Comprehensive Child Development Program and who are also enrolled in TANF and 		eligible to participate in Washington's Work First program. This study will 		look at several questions: How do families formulate and act upon strategies to 		attain economic self-sufficiency in an environment of scarcity? What is the 		relationship of a family's social network to its effectiveness in formulating 		strategies and successfully carrying out a plan to implement them? How do the 		actions of community agencies and organizations carrying out the tasks of 		welfare reform respond to family strategies? </p>
<p>The <b><i>Jobs-Plus: 		Community Revitalization Initiative for Public Housing Families</i></b> (6835), 		a 7½-year demonstration program, is aimed at dramatically increasing 		employment, earnings, and job retention among working-age residents, a large 		percentage of whom are on public welfare or are at risk of dependency. Aside 		from Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and ACF, the demonstration is 		supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and three other foundations. The 		program supports the planning, development, implementation and evaluation of 		locally-based approaches to providing saturation-level employment opportunities 		and supportive services for working-age residents of family housing 		developments in seven cities. It incorporates a combination of state-of-the-art 		employment, training and supportive services; financial incentives (occasioned 		by the welfare reform and new public housing policies); and rigorous efforts to 		rebuild and strengthen the community in support of work. </p>
<p>The purpose of the 		<b><i>Management-Focused Welfare Reform Evaluation Data Access and Policy 		Manual Development</i></b> (6836) is to develop (1) a software package that 		organizes public assistance evaluation data into readily accessible formats 		that can be continually accessed and used for timely and responsive 		decisionmaking; (2) a policy analysis manual that assists users in 		understanding how to read and apply continually accessed outcome or impact data 		to program or policy decisions; and (3) technical documentation for systems 		personnel and regular users. The manual will assist the user in bridging the 		gaps between what outcomes and impacts may appear in the sample, what this 		information suggests, caveats in interpreting the results, and ultimately, what 		program or policy responses should be considered. </p>
<p>The<b><i> Welfare Policy 		Typology Project</i></b> (6837) is laying the groundwork for a data base-- 		containing key information about State welfare policies (including TANF), 		State-funded maintenance-of-effort programs, and federally-funded child care 		assistance programs--that would be available to the public, probably through 		the Internet. With the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work 		Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996, there are few, if any, strict 		Federal requirements for welfare programs, and States are not required to 		report their policies in any detail, let alone in a uniform format. This will 		make research on the effects of welfare reform somewhat problematic, because 		researchers will not have a ready source of information on State policies. 		Without a standard compilation and classification of State welfare policies, 		different researchers are likely to classify policies in different ways, making 		cross-study analysis virtually impossible. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Wisconsin Pay for 		Performance/Self-Sufficiency First Evaluation</i></b> (6838) project will 		complete an impact evaluation of a statewide work-focused welfare reform 		demonstration. Within a research site, current public assistance recipients and 		new applicants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group subject 		to the Pay for Performance/Self-Sufficiency First (PFP/SSF) provisions, or a 		control group subject to the regular program rules according to the State's 		approved AFDC/Medicaid State Plans and approved Food Stamp Plan of Operations. 		Several questions will be addressed: Do the program policies improve employment 		rates, length of employment, amount of earned income, hours worked per month, 		child support collections, total family income, and accumulated savings? Do 		these policies affect public assistance participation and program costs? Does 		the program affect participation in employment and training activities? Do 		these program rules and policies affect marriage and separation rates and use 		of foster care? Does the demonstration affect the incidence of reported child 		abuse and neglect and health insurance status of children? </p>
<p>The<b><i> Partner and 		Father Involvement in the Lives of Low-Income First-Time Mothers and Their 		Children</i></b> (6839) project is investigating the role that fathers and 		partners play in improving the material, emotional, and developmental 		well-being of low-income women and children. The study consists of a set of 		intensive secondary analyses using data from three longitudinal randomized 		experiments of a prenatal and infancy home visitation program serving 		first-time mothers from various ethnic and racial groups. Research questions to 		be addressed are as follows: What is the natural history of father and partner 		involvement in the lives of low-income women and children? What is the impact 		of a prenatal and early childhood home visitation program on partner and father 		involvement? What is the impact of partner and father involvement on women's 		life course development (e.g., welfare, dependence, subsequent pregnancies, and 		mental health)? What is the impact of father and partner involvement on 		children's health and development (e.g., child abuse and neglect, intellectual 		development, and antisocial behavior)? </p>
<p>The <b><i>Evaluation of Los 		Angeles Jobs-First GAIN</i></b> (6840) project will examine the results of 		changing Los Angeles GAIN, a human resource-focused welfare-to-work program, 		into Los Angeles Jobs-First GAIN, a labor force attachment strategy. Data 		collection will be primarily from administrative records, with a 2-year survey 		of approximately 250 experimental and control group cases. The following 		research hypotheses are expected to be confirmed. It will be possible to 		convert a large, diverse, mature, education-focused welfare-to-work program to 		a Work First program. The new program will produce earnings and recipient 		changes of greater magnitude than the original program. The new program will 		produce earnings increases and welfare reductions with much smaller 		expenditures per enrollee than its predecessor. Having profited by experience, 		Jobs-First GAIN will produce equal or better results than previously evaluated 		Work First programs. Jobs-First GAIN can effectively operate on a large scale, 		serving a diverse welfare population. The program will quickly move many 		recipients into jobs, thereby minimizing the number who reach the TANF time 		limit unemployed. Finally, the programs' economies of scale will achieve 		savings for government budgets. </p>
<p>The principal objective of 		the<b><i> Front-Line Management and Practice Study </i></b>(6841) is to 		evaluate whether front-line workers are implementing the welfare goals and 		policies established by the States. Using the local TANF office as the unit of 		analysis, researchers will execute an in-depth process/implementation study 		relying on observable variables such as assessment processes, allocation of 		client services, allocation of paid and unpaid work, enforcement of 		work-related policies, delivery of information, orientation of individual 		worker practice, office level practices, and implicit messages or 		signals. </p>
<p>The ACF Office of Community 		Services (OCS) is supporting evaluations of grantees funded under the<b><i> Job 		Opportunities for Low-Income Individuals (JOLI) Program</i></b> (6430). 		Assistance is provided to grantees for developing project designs and 		evaluation plans. For example, the <b><i>Bridgeport Artisan Center</i></b> is 		creating jobs and enterprise opportunities for low-income artisans in the 		inner-city and surrounding neighborhoods of Bridgeport, Connecticut, an 		Enterprise Community. Another example is Avenues (Avenidas), a project of the 		Mi Casa Resource Center for Women in Denver, Colorado, which trains low-income 		persons--primarily women--for jobs and apprenticeships in highway construction 		and maintenance. OCS will evaluate the impact of the demonstrations and 		disseminate the project results to Congress and other interested 		parties. </p>
<p>During FY 1997, OCS 		initiated several reports on evaluation results of projects funded under the 		<b><i>Demonstration Partnership Program </i></b>(6883). One report will contain 		summaries of eight Demonstration Partnership Program (DPP) projects focused on 		various facets of case management in the delivery of social services. A second 		report will focus on youth at risk and minority males. A third report will 		summarize projects in the area of micro-enterprise and self-employment, and 		homeless individuals and families. In addition, OCS will be examining 21 DPP 		projects, funded in FY 1994, that are in the final stages of their 		evaluations. </p>
<p>ACF also has three projects 		addressing child support enforcement. The first project, the <i><b>Study of the 		Impact of the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) Program on Avoiding Costs to 		Public Programs</b> </i>(6842) will include (1) a literature review on CSE and 		cost avoidance and an annotated bibliography; (2) a small conference on cost 		avoidance consisting of experts from State and Federal government, academia, 		and the private sector; (3) an assessment of national micro-simulation models 		to study the impacts of the CSE program; and (4) an assessment of State 		administrative data capacity for measuring cost avoidance. </p>
<p>The second project, 		<b><i>Evaluation and Reporting on State Access and Visitation Grant 		Programs</i> </b>(6843), will help define data elements to report on and 		evaluate State Access and Visitation Grant Programs. The project will also 		assist States in implementing data elements and reporting as part of the 		monitoring requirement. </p>
<p>The third project, 		<i><b>Partners for Fragile Families</b> </i>(6844), is an assessment of a 		program to assist low-income young fathers to work with the mothers of their 		children to share the legal, financial, and emotional responsibilities of 		parenthood and improve the child support system's interaction with the fathers 		of fragile families. The National Center for Strategic Non-Profit Planning and 		Community Leadership in Washington, D.C., will offer technical assistance to 		service providers in public agencies and community-based organizations, 		facilitate dialogue and information exchange among public and private 		partnerships; and identify models and promote public and private 		partnerships. </p>
<p><b><i>Healthy Development 		of Children and Families</i></b> </p>
<p>ACF has eight studies under 		way that address Head Start issues. The <b><i>Early Head Start Research and 		Evaluation National Study</i></b> (3570) is evaluating the effectiveness of the 		Early Head Start program in 15 diverse communities in 13 States and the 		District of Columbia. The study is examining child, family, staff, and 		community outcomes in a sample of 3,400 children and their families who were 		randomly selected for program and comparison groups while the mothers are 		pregnant or until the children are 12 months old. Assessments of the children, 		families, and child-care environments will made when children are 14, 24 and 36 		months of age. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Profiles of Head 		Start Families: Development of a Head Start Family Information System</i></b> 		(3869) project will (1) provide a national description of Head Start family and 		child characteristics using family-level data, (2) identify Head Start child 		and family service needs and services received within a given program year, and 		(3) provide for the regular reporting of data over time so as to permit 		analyses of changes in Head Start family and child 		characteristics. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Evaluation of the 		Head Start/Public School Early Childhood Transition Demonstration</i> 		</b>(4393) project is assessing the effectiveness of providing comprehensive, 		continuous, and coordinated services to Head Start families and children from 		the time of Head Start enrollment through the third grade in public school. 		Working in concert with local evaluators, the contractor is developing a set of 		common data collection instruments to be used across all sites. The project is 		providing data regarding the effectiveness of the Transition Project models in 		maintaining gains by children and families while in Head Start. The evaluation 		and demonstrations were mandated by the Head Start reauthorization legislation. 		Other studies completed during the ten years prior to 1992--notably the Head 		Start Transition Study and Developmental Continuity--did not provide 		information on services extended to children after they left Head 		Start. </p>
<p>All 41 Family Service 		Center Demonstrations are being evaluated through a consortium of local 		evaluators under the<b><i> Evaluation of the Head Start Family Service Center 		Demonstrations</i></b> (4394) project. The contractor is providing 		coordination, technical assistance, and analysis on common data elements across 		sites to yield a coordinated and integrated summary of process and impact 		evaluations conducted by local evaluators. This consortium approach is ensuring 		a consistent and technically sound method for evaluating these demonstrations 		of how Head Start can collaborate with community programs to meet the needs of 		Head Start families dealing with problems such as illiteracy, substance abuse, 		and unemployment. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Study of the 		Characteristics of Families Served by Head Start Migrant Programs</i></b> 		(4974) is documenting and describing the implementation of 26 Head Start 		Migrant programs, providing a profile of Head Start migrant families in the 		main migratory streams and generating information on unique issues related to 		serving migrant families through Head Start programs. It is also documenting 		the availability and coordination of services for Head Start families during 		their migration. Finally, it will provide a national estimate of the number of 		eligible migrant children versus the number of those children being served by 		the Migrant Head Start programs. Findings from the study will be used to inform 		future policy decisions on Head Start migrant programs, as well as the new 		Early Head Start program for infants and toddlers. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Evaluation of 		Head Start Family Child Care Homes</i></b> (4975) project is assessing the 		effectiveness of the 18 Head Start Family Child Care (FCC) Homes demonstration 		projects funded by the Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) in 		FY 1992. The project is assessing the quality of Head Start services provided 		in FCC homes with regard to Head Start Program Performance Standards. The 		project is comparing services delivered in FCC homes to those delivered in Head 		Start centers. Children are randomly assigned to the experimental and control 		groups. Data is being collected on the cognitive, socio-emotional, and physical 		development of the two cohorts of children participating in the 		study. </p>
<p>The<b><i> Descriptive Study 		of Head Start Bilingual/Multicultural Program Services </i></b>(5845) aims to 		identify the number, geographic distribution, and sociodemographic 		characteristics of the Head Start-eligible population for different cultural 		and linguistic groups by region and nationally. It will describe the bilingual 		and multicultural children currently served by the Head Start program. The 		range of bilingual and multicultural services provided by the Head Start 		program nationally will be compiled using existing data and a survey of all 		Head Start programs. Finally, the project will assess the service models, staff 		training approaches, community partnerships, and administrative plans and 		processes of 30 Head Start programs that have developed innovative methods for 		addressing the unique program needs of one or more of the diverse cultural and 		linguistic groups. </p>
<p>A 3-year<i> <b>Descriptive 		Study of Families Served by Head Start</b></i> (6331) will provide crucial 		policy-relevant information on a nationally representative sample of families 		served by Head Start in 40 programs across the country. Through a survey and 		more intensive case study methods, the project will chart family demographics, 		strengths, needs, expectations, and experiences within Head Start programs, as 		well as programmatic efforts to join in partnership with 		families. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Evaluation of the 		Comprehensive Child Development Programs</i></b> (3868) is an assessment of the 		effectiveness of the first group of 21 Comprehensive Child Development Program 		grantees. In particular, the study will examine (1) the longitudinal impact of 		each program model on the development of the participating children and their 		parents, (2) the effectiveness of the programs in achieving their stated 		objectives, and (3) the impact of related programs on the delivery of 		services. </p>
<p>The <b><i>National Study of 		Low-Income Child Care</i> </b>(6845) is studying the low-income child care 		market in 25 communities in 5-7 States with a substudy to examine the 		license-exempt family care market in 5-7 neighborhoods drawn from these 		communities. It will provide essential information to help inform the issues 		surrounding subsidized child care and its implementation by the States, with 		particular reference to the provisions in the Personal Responsibility and Work 		Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 over time. It will further 		examine how significant shifts in welfare policy and programs affect the child 		care market for welfare recipients and the working poor at the community level. 		It will study the impact of subsidies on the types, amounts, and quality of 		child care available; children's child care placements; and family 		decisionmaking. Additionally, it will report on the largely unknown 		license-exempt family care market for both preschool and after-school 		cohorts. </p>
<p>In the <b><i>Role of Child 		Care in Low-Income Families' Labor Market Participation</i></b> (6846), 		optional research designs to identify and address child care services needed by 		parents to succeed at work will be developed. A series of stand-alone working 		papers will be prepared that critically evaluate relevant research related to 		child care and labor force attachment and that develop the rationale for the 		factors included in the research designs. Priority outcomes to be incorporated 		in the research designs include employment, welfare participation, children's 		development, family well-being, and child-care quality. </p>
<p>The<i> <b>Child Impact 		Studies</b></i> (6847) project will augment welfare reform demonstration 		evaluations in five States (Connecticut, Iowa, Minnesota, Indiana, and Florida) 		to assess the effects of different welfare approaches on children's well-being. 		The project adds detailed data on children to these evaluations. At each site, 		treatment groups subject to welfare reform policies will be compared with 		control groups subject to former AFDC policies. Child outcome data, focusing on 		ages 5-12, will be collected through surveys and administrative records. The 		study will address two questions. What are the effects of alternative 		approaches to welfare reform on child well-being, including school achievement, 		behavioral problems, and health status? What intervening mechanisms--such as 		quality and regularity of the home environment, child care arrangements, and 		parental employment and income-- will affect these outcomes? </p>
<p>Three projects address the 		issue of homelessness. The first, <b><i>Evaluation of the Impact of 		Homelessness on ACYF Programs</i> </b>(4396), will conduct site visits and 		collect information from service providers for the homeless, administrators, 		and representatives of local service delivery networks in 40 communities. The 		project will examine programs supported by ACYF, but will also review 		non-ACYF-sponsored programs. In addition, the project will conduct a 		small-scale longitudinal study of homeless people and the impact of services 		upon them. Five local programs serve as case studies. The results of the review 		will focus on key strategies for increasing the effectiveness of ACYF programs 		and on measures to help reduce people's risk of homelessness. 		</p>
<p>The second, 		<b><i>Evaluation of the Transitional Living Program for Homeless Youth</i> 		</b>(4397), will examine the number and characteristics of homeless youth 		served by this program. The project will examine the effectiveness of the 		transitional living program in alleviating the immediate problems of homeless 		youth and its success in preparing homeless<b> </b>youth for self-sufficiency 		and in helping them decide upon future education, employment, and independent 		living. The ability of the program to strengthen family relationships and to 		encourage intrafamilial problem solving through counseling and developing 		self-sufficient skills will be assessed. </p>
<p>The third, <b><i>Evaluation 		of Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs--A Follow-Up Study</i> </b>(4361), will 		examine the impact and effect of the Runaway and Homeless Youth (RHY) shelter 		program on youth and review the policy, program, and service delivery issues 		that impede or facilitate RHY shelter goals. The study will obtain information 		from 23 sites on runaway and homeless youth shelters and services and assess 		the impact and effect of the RHY program from the perspective of program 		administrators and service providers. It will identify the policy, program, and 		service delivery issues that influence whether or not RHY shelter goals are 		met. </p>
<p><i><b>Factors Related to 		Gang Membership Resistance</b> </i> 		(5042.1) is studying gangs from two 		contrasting Los Angeles communities--one with higher-than-average Hispanic and 		African-American gang activity, and the other with lower-than-average gang 		activity. The project is designed to increase understanding of how youth in 		urban areas with high levels of street gang activity avoid gang involvement. 		The project will compare gang members with youth who do not belong to a gang in 		different urban settings, such as a community with high gang activity versus 		one with low gang activity. Individuals and community variables and 		characteristics in the contrasting sites will be analyzed. </p>
<p>In <b><i>Prevention of 		Foster Care Placement of Children at Risk for Domestic Violence</i></b> (4378), 		the Family Advocate Project (FAP) is building on existing programs operated by 		the Family Intervention Center of the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, which 		provide medical and psychosocial evaluations to battered women and their 		children. The project is studying 150 mothers assigned to either a study or a 		control group. Study-group mothers receive intensive services in the areas of 		counseling, housing assistance, and legal, health care, and social services. 		The project is looking at ways to alleviate the emotional trauma of battered 		women and explore whether the provision of support services to increase 		self-esteem and coping skills can prevent out-of-home placement or reduce the 		length of time children spend in foster care. </p>
<p>The <b><i>National Child 		Welfare Research Center: University of Chicago</i></b> (4390.1), located in the 		Chapin Hall Center for Children, is conducting research on the following 		issues: (1) research and management uses of computerized child welfare data; 		(2) service and policy issues concerning in-home and community-based care; (3) 		the uses, consequences, and costs of in-home care; and (4) ways to apply 		knowledge and research about child development to children's policies. The 		Center holds conferences and sponsors a child development fellowship in 		conjunction with the Society for Research on Adolescence. Publications will 		include research syntheses, a training manual, and a report on national data 		issues. </p>
<p>The<i> <b>National Child 		Welfare Research Center: University of California at Berkeley</b></i> (4390.2), 		located in the School of Social Welfare, will conduct projects to examine (1) 		child abuse and child welfare; (2) family preservation and maintenance; (3) 		foster care and adoption; (4) drug and AIDS-affected children; and (5) the 		organization, financing, and evaluation of child welfare services. The center 		serves as a knowledge-building and information-disseminating resource for 		improved child welfare services. </p>
<p>The <b><i>National Study of 		Outcomes for Children Placed in Foster Care with Relatives</i></b> (5846) is 		examining the outcomes for and associated costs of children and families in the 		various configurations of relative foster care compared to the configurations 		of non-relative foster care. Information obtained in an initial nine-State 		survey is being used to design a national study on the outcomes of children 		placed in relative foster care compared to the outcomes for those placed in 		non-relative foster care. </p>
<p>The aim of <b><i>How 		Decisions to Change the Case Plan Goal Are Initiated</i> </b>(6848) is to 		conduct a 3-year study of children entering State custody as infants that will 		identify factors that facilitate or delay changes in the case plan goal leading 		to permanency. Data will be collected through in-depth interviews with 		caseworkers responsible for selected cases. Products of this study will include 		three major reports and policy and practice recommendations for facilitating 		permanence for children entering State custody as infants. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Factors Related 		to the Quality of Family Foster Care</i></b> (6849) study seeks to determine 		the quality of the foster care experience and the factors that influence it, 		based on data collected on a sample of 500 families whose children spent time 		in foster care in Wayne County (Detroit) Michigan during 1993. The study 		examines the relationship between agency and service characteristics (e.g., 		private versus public agency, caseload size, staff turnover, continuity of case 		services, provision of family preservation services, and use of kinship care) 		and the quality of foster care. Five aspects of foster care will be assessed: 		the health and well-being of the child while in care, incidence of maltreatment 		in care, family continuity, number of placements by type, and duration of care 		and recidivism. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Assessing the 		Quality of Foster Family Care: An Initiative for the Integration of Research 		and Practice</i></b> (6850) project aims to fill the gap in the literature on 		foster family care by examining the individual characteristics of foster 		parents across domains, as well as the environmental characteristics of the 		home. Participants (240 families) will be drawn from the pool of foster parents 		and children in Maryland's Prince George's and Montgomery counties. The project 		will examine the following questions: (1) Does the current pool of foster 		parents possess the characteristics to meet the needs of the foster child 		population? (2) What is the appropriate role of relative foster homes? (3) How 		does ethnicity relate to other characteristics of foster family 		homes? </p>
<p><b><i>Project REFRESH: 		Research and Evaluation of Foster Children's Reception into Environmentally 		Supportive Homes</i> </b> 		(6851) seeks to discover the effect of the everyday occurrences in 		foster family homes. Research indicates that foster children aged 9-18 may 		perceive themselves as outsiders to their foster families. Some birth children 		in foster families perceive a foster child as an intruder. Many foster 		caregivers have difficulties balancing parenting and caregiving roles, which 		impacts quality, duration, and level of birth and foster children's care. 		Assessment tools and evaluation protocols are needed to examine factors 		affecting quality and satisfaction with care in kinship/non-kinship placements. 		The major research goal of this 3-year study by Oregon State University is to 		develop a model to assess a child's integration into a foster 		family<b>.</b> </p>
<p>The purpose of the 		<b><i>Evaluating Quality of Out-of-Home Care in Kinship Foster Families</i> 		</b>(6852)<b> </b>project is to identify criteria for assessing the quality of 		out-of-home care provided to children in kinship care homes and to develop 		objective items that use these criteria to effectively measure the quality of 		kinship care. Instruments to be developed by the University of Illinois-Urbana 		will measure the quality of the kinship family home, contextual factors related 		to kinship family functioning, and indicators of child functioning in the 		home. </p>
<p>Two studies address issues 		of family preservation and family support. The first, the <b><i>National 		Evaluation of Family Support Programs</i> </b>(5848), is a comprehensive review 		of what is currently known about family support programs and their effects. The 		project will include several studies to fill gaps in understanding about family 		support programs and their effects, and to synthesize the results with the 		results of the earlier review. The review conducted in the first year will 		guide the formulation of a research strategy for the remaining four years of 		the project. Up to ten program evaluations will be designed and 		implemented. </p>
<p>The second, the 		<b><i>Family Preservation and Family Support Services (FP/FS) Implementation 		Study</i></b> (5975), examines the FP/FS implementation process across States 		and communities and among different stakeholders over time. It examines the 		process broadly over all 50 States, and in depth in 10 States and 20 		communities. The first component of the study analyzes and synthesizes 		first-year applications and examines State planning and use of FP/FS funds, 		e.g., the nature of the planning process, the involvement of various 		stakeholders, and decisions about fund allocation. The study will assist ACYF 		in its joint planning efforts with States by providing feedback on States' 		progress in implementing FP/FS legislation. </p>
<p>The purpose of the 		<b><i>National Longitudinal Study of Children and Families in the Child Welfare 		System </i></b>(6748) is to describe the outcomes experienced by children and 		families who come to the attention of the child welfare system, and to gain an 		understanding of the factors, including system-level and service factors as 		well as child and family characteristics, that contribute to those outcomes. A 		nationally representative sample of 6,000 children will be sampled upon entry 		into the child welfare system. Data will be collected during the first year 		after entry and at three annual followup interviews. Information will be 		obtained from the children and their caregivers, caseworkers, and other child 		welfare agency personnel and service providers.</p>

              <p><b>MISSION: To foster the 		development of services to help older persons maintain their 		independence.</b> </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation 		Program</i></b> </p>
<p>The Administration on Aging 		(AoA) is the Federal focal point and advocate agency for older persons and 		their concerns. The AoA administers key Federal programs mandated under various 		titles of the Older Americans Act. These programs help vulnerable older persons 		remain in their own homes by providing supportive services. Other programs 		offer opportunities for older Americans to enhance their health and to be 		active contributors to their families, communities, and the Nation through 		employment and volunteer programs. The AoA works closely with its nationwide 		network of regional offices and State and Area Agencies on Aging to plan, 		coordinate, and develop community-level systems of services that meet the 		unique needs of individual older persons and their caregivers. The AoA 		collaborates with Federal agencies, national organizations, and representatives 		of business to ensure that, whenever possible, their programs and resources are 		targeted to the elderly and coordinated with those of the network on 		aging. </p>
<p>As the responsibilities of 		this nationwide network of State and Area Agencies on Aging continue to grow, 		it is essential that they have the necessary information to meet these 		responsibilities. </p>
<p>The overall evaluation 		priorities of the AoA are to support studies that provide information on the 		following: </p>
<ul><li> The success of existing 		  program implementation in meeting the goals of the Older Americans 		  Act;</li>
<li> The design and 		  operation of effective programs; and</li>
<li> Issues relevant to 		  policy development, legislative planning, and program 		  management.</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Summary of Fiscal 		Year 1997 Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p>Although there are no major 		evaluations to report during FY 1997, AoA initiated an evaluation of the 		Supportive Services and Senior Centers provisions of the Older Americans Act 		(Title III-B). These provisions provide home- and community-based services 		(HCBS) for which all elderly persons are eligible, with particular attention to 		older persons in greatest economic or social need. Most home- and 		community-based services fall under three broad categories: access services, 		in-home services, and other community-based services. Access services include 		care coordination, transportation, outreach, and information and assistance. 		In-home services include personal caregivers, homemakers, chores, and telephone 		reassurance. States and local communities decide on the mix of services these 		funds provide through State and area plans for which public participation is 		required. In FY 1995, the last year for which complete data are available, the 		Title III-B Program ($306,711,000) provided services to approximately 6,050,000 		persons. </p>
<p>A basic operating principle 		of the Older Americans Act is to provide funds through States to local 		governments and community organizations with Federal assistance and leadership, 		but which is flexible enough to address local community needs. This approach is 		consistent with current legislative trends in establishing intergovernmental 		funding relationships. There is substantial anecdotal evidence that this 		flexible decentralized approach has worked very well in fostering the 		development of HCBS appropriate to diverse States and communities. However, the 		diversity of the States, communities, service programs, and resource inputs, 		the long time frame for development, and the general nature of the outcomes 		sought (comprehensive coordinated HCBS systems) make it difficult to evaluate 		progress related to Title III-B. State Program Report (SPR) data are a 		necessary starting point in describing results from Title III-B. But the SPR 		shows only the output of the services funded and does not illuminate the 		developmental effects of the aging network funded through Title III-B. Under 		provisions of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993, it is 		appropriate for AoA to evaluate the outcome results from Title III-B despite 		the conceptual and methodological difficulties. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluations in 		Progress</i></b> </p>
<p>Given the evolving roles of 		AoA and State and Area Agencies on Aging and the continued (and projected) 		growth of the Nation's elderly population, AoA's evaluation efforts will 		continue to focus on effective program planning and service delivery, as well 		as on continued monitoring of the program's effectiveness in addressing the 		goals of the Older Americans Act. During FY 1997, AoA initiated a study to plan 		an evaluation of the Supportive Services and Senior Centers provisions of the 		Older Americans Act (Title III-B) (6855). Through this project AoA will 		identify the conceptual and methodological issues in the evaluation and will 		develop an approach to this evaluation. The evaluation is expected to develop 		outcome measures with broad applicability, which can be used repeatedly over 		time. It is anticipated that the actual evaluation will begin early in FY 		1999. </p>
<p>Evaluation is an important 		part of the AoA program, and a number of evaluation activities are currently 		under way, although not on a national level. Many State and Area Agencies on 		Aging are conducting evaluations of their Older Americans Act service programs. 		These studies generally focus on such issues as the needs of the target 		population, the quantity and quality of services delivered, and the impact of 		the services on the older person. Results are used to better design and target 		Older Americans Act services. Regional offices of the AoA also conduct 		assessments of the States' needs for training and technical assistance. 		Finally, demonstration projects funded by the AoA have evaluation components to 		enable them to assess their progress in meeting the objectives of their 		demonstrations. </p>

              <p><b>MISSION: To generate and 		disseminate information that improves the health care system.</b> 		</p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation 		Program</i></b> </p>
<p>The Evaluation Program 		within the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) is used to 		respond to three types of information needs: </p>
<ul><li> The need to determine 		  the Agency's effectiveness in meeting its long-term goals and 		  priorities</li>
<li> The need to improve the 		  efficiency of the Agency's program performance through internal evaluations; 		  and</li>
<li> The need to respond to 		  critical Agency and departmental concerns via "fast-track" or quick-turnaround 		  assessments.</li>
</ul><p>To address these needs, 		evaluation components are built into virtually all major AHCPR programmatic 		activities and a wide variety of "freestanding" projects are undertaken as 		needs are identified. Among the evaluation mechanisms used by the Agency are 		targeted evaluation studies undertaken through contracts or grants; efforts to 		obtain feedback from "customers" on the usefulness of AHCPR research efforts, 		including such mechanisms as focus groups and surveys; and feedback from 		AHCPR's User Liaison program (which provides information and technical 		assistance to State policymakers, health departments, and officials). 		Information gathered from AHCPR's evaluation-related activities will be used in 		the annual performance plans developed in response to the Government 		Performance and Results Act starting in FY 1999. </p>
<p>All "freestanding" 		evaluation activities undergo two levels of review. First, brief evaluation 		proposals are developed by staff and undergo review by affected senior 		managers. Those proposals approved by senior managers are submitted for review 		by the administrator. The administrator evaluates proposals for policy 		relevance, priority, cost effectiveness, and timeliness. Those that receive the 		administrator's approval are then methodologically developed and centrally 		reviewed for technical merit, including technical feasibility, costs, and 		relation to ongoing evaluation activities. </p>
<p><b><i>Summary of Fiscal 		Year 1997 Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p><b><i>Outcomes and 		Effectiveness Research in the Private Sector</i></b> </p>
<p>To help clarify AHCPR's 		future priorities in outcomes and effectiveness research (OER) and to provide 		insights regarding future opportunities for public-private partnerships in this 		area, AHCPR undertook an analysis and evaluation of private-sector OER 		activities (6385). The study found that a wide variety of private-sector 		organizations report performing OER, often for the purposes of monitoring 		health care performance against certain standards, e.g., accreditation 		standards. In addition, private-sector organizations conduct OER primarily to 		improve their strategic and financial positions. More specifically, health 		product companies usually focus their OER efforts on new drugs and devices, 		while less attention is given to other health care interventions, particularly 		those that are not new or those that are used primarily for traditionally 		underserved or vulnerable populations. AHCPR has supported the development and 		validation of many of the research tools used in private-sector OER. The report 		found little evidence of a redundant effort between publicly and privately 		supported OER and reinforced the need for public support for continued 		methodologic development in OER. </p>
<p><b><i>Informatics</i></b> </p>
<p>Drawing upon research 		previously performed in the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom, a recent 		study reported that informatics tools and decision aids affect patient 		decisionmaking about medical screening and treatment (6376). More specifically, 		researchers found that patients who use informatics tools are more satisfied 		with the decisionmaking process and have more knowledge of treatment 		alternatives than patients who do not use the tools. The researchers recommend 		that the effects of informatics tools on a full range of outcomes be assessed 		(e.g., patient-provider communication, treatment selection, health behavior, 		clinical and health status outcomes, and health care costs). It is important 		that factors influencing patient use of informatics tools be identified as well 		as the cost-effectiveness of different types of patient informatics 		tools. </p>
<p><b><i>Quality 		Measurement</i></b> </p>
<p>As part of its effort to 		measure and improve quality of care, AHCPR completed two related evaluations of 		CONQUEST--the Computerized Needs-Oriented Quality Measurement System (5961.1 		and 5961.2). CONQUEST is a prototype software system for collecting and 		evaluating clinical performance measures, and organizing them into a 		classification scheme that presents essential information in a standard format. 		The two evaluations identified short-term, intermediate, and long-range 		strategies for CONQUEST's continued development. While finding CONQUEST 1.0 to 		be a good starting point, the evaluations recommended that future versions of 		CONQUEST be expanded to include more measures, more conditions, and more detail 		on measure construction/specifications. In addition, the evaluations indicated 		that CONQUEST should be modified to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. 		Many of the recommendations were incorporated into CONQUEST 2.0. 		</p>
<p><b><i>Managed Care 		Organizations</i></b> </p>
<p>To help determine the 		extent to which AHCPR and other organizations will be able to analyze data from 		managed care organizations (MCOs), AHCPR completed work on a project to 		determine the feasibility of creating a managed care encounter-level data base 		(6374). The rapid growth of managed care is changing the ability of health 		services researchers and policy analysts to answer fundamental questions about 		access, utilization, cost, and quality of care. Data that were previously 		produced as a "by-product" of the fee-for-service system are either no longer 		available or vary in comprehensiveness and accuracy. One major finding of this 		study was that MCO data bases vary substantially in the availability and 		comprehensiveness of encounter-level data and in the ability to link these data 		with administrative and financial data. MCOs increasingly view their 		information systems, and the data they store, as proprietary, and there are a 		number of disincentives for MCOs to share their data. In addition, there are no 		industrywide definitions and reporting standards. Despite these barriers, MCOs 		are interested in exploring ways to work with Federal agencies to facilitate 		the availability of data for the purposes of research. </p>
<p>AHCPR has used the study 		findings to 1) identify future opportunities for public-private partnerships; 		2) solicit feedback from multiple constituents on models that the Agency could 		employ to facilitate improvements in, and accessibility of, encounter-level 		data; 3) assess current AHCPR supply-side data initiatives (e.g., Healthcare 		Cost and Utilization Project); 4) formulate a longer-term encounter-level data 		strategy; and 5) inform and support related activities in the Secretary's 		Quality Initiative and the President's Commission on Consumer Protection and 		Quality. </p>
<p><b><i>Dissemination 		Evaluation</i></b> </p>
<p>AHCPR conducted a customer 		survey to determine satisfaction with its publications and their dissemination 		(6375). The effort found that AHCPR's monthly newsletter, <b><i>Research 		Activities</i></b>, is well-received as it is currently 		written, presented, and distributed. A large percentage of readers keep the 		publication as a reference source and would prefer to continue to receive the 		publication in hard copy format, rather than via the World Wide Web (where it 		is also currently available). Overall, the survey results showed that the 		publication has a relatively loyal following. The study also found that AHCPR's 		patient/consumer guides are most frequently requested by phone and delivered in 		a timely manner. In addition, recipients are pleased with the services of 		AHCPR's publications clearinghouse and had very positive reactions to many of 		the guides' different features. This information will be used as performance 		data in AHCPR's Government Performance and Results Act Plan and will serve as a 		baseline for any future surveys fielded to determine satisfaction with changes 		made to <b><i>Research Activities</i></b>. During FY 1997, AHCPR also completed 		projects on evaluating minority health services research training activities 		(6384), identifying private sector organizations as potential research partners 		(6386), developing a workplan for preparing an inventory of performance 		measures currently being used or considered by HHS agencies (6691), and 		evaluating AHCPR's small conference grant program (6692). </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluations in 		Progress</i></b> </p>
<p><b><i>Grant Application and 		Review Processes</i></b> </p>
<p>AHCPR is conducting an 		evaluation of its grants (large and small) application receipt and review 		processes (6696). The evaluation includes a combination of qualitative and 		quantitative techniques that will document the extent to which changes made to 		the grants application submission and peer review processes have resulted in 		improved efficiency and effectiveness from the perspectives of applicants, 		reviewers, and Agency staff. </p>
<p><b><i>Data Collection 		Evaluation</i></b> </p>
<p>AHCPR is undertaking a 		project to assess the usefulness to policymakers and researchers of 		AHCPR-supported major data collection efforts, such as the Medical Expenditure 		Panel Survey, the Health Care Cost and Utilization project, and the HIV Cost 		and Services Utilization Survey. More specifically, it will examine methods to 		improve survey operations and timely data release. The study will examine how 		other Federal agencies, as well as private foundations, conduct various aspects 		of their large-scale surveys (6383). </p>

              <p><b>MISSION: To prevent 		exposure and adverse human health effects and diminished quality of life 		associated with exposure to hazardous substances from waste sites, unplanned 		releases, and other sources of pollution present in the 		environment.</b> </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation 		Program</i></b> </p>
<p>The Agency for Toxic 		Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) was created as a Federal agency by the 		Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 		more commonly known as Superfund legislation. ATSDR was created to implement 		the health-related sections of CERCLA and other laws that protect the public 		from hazardous waste and environmental spills of hazardous substances. ATSDR 		relies heavily on strong working relationships with tribal, State, and local 		organizations; private, nonprofit, and community-based organizations; and other 		Federal agencies to implement critical environmental health programs. As part 		of the public health assessment process, ATSDR recommends actions that can be 		taken to reduce or mitigate the risks of adverse health effects from exposures 		to toxic substances to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and State and 		local governments. </p>
<p>The ATSDR evaluation 		program is coordinated with the agencywide strategic planning process, which 		was started in March 1996 to implement requirements of the Government 		Performance and Results Act (GPRA). ATSDR's strategic goals and its annual 		performance plan are the result of an interactive process that reflects a 		long-term commitment by Agency staff to develop stronger relationships among 		external clients and stakeholders, to assess products and services using 		relevant data, and to improve our processes and systems for more efficient 		accomplishment of ATSDR's mission. The following strategic questions are 		important to the Agency: </p>
<p> FACE="WP MathA"&gt;  		How should ATSDR evaluate the public health needs of its 		stakeholders and involve those stakeholders in the Agency's program planning, 		implementation, and evaluation? </p>
<ul><li> How should ATSDR's 		  roles in assessment, science, health promotion, and service be implemented to 		  meet the needs of its stakeholders and to achieve its 		  mission?</li>
<li> How does ATSDR ensure 		  that it has the authorities and resources necessary to address the public 		  health needs of its stakeholders?</li>
<li> How should ATSDR 		  evaluate the public health impact of its products and 		  services?</li>
</ul><p>Effectively focusing 		ATSDR's programs on these issues enables the Agency to understand stakeholders' 		needs, address its mandates, and evaluate its programs so that ATSDR 		operations, management, products, and services can be improved. 		</p>
<p>ATSDR receives its funds 		from the Hazardous Substance Trust Fund/Superfund appropriations rather than 		Public Health Service appropriations; therefore, ATSDR does not receive a 		1-percent evaluation set-aside. Nevertheless, the new planning system provides 		the basis for measuring ATSDR performance and for making systematic 		improvements a part of its internal evaluation activities. </p>
<p>An example of such 		"in-house" evaluation activities through ATSDR resources is the Evaluation 		Working Group. This group was formed to develop a long-term strategy for 		site-specific evaluations to better assess the outcomes and impact of ATSDR 		activities at hazardous waste sites. The Methyl Parathion Evaluation Workshop 		was established to allow coordination between and continue work being 		accomplished by ATSDR, the EPA, and State and local agencies when responding to 		the illegal spraying of homes and businesses with methyl parathion, an 		agricultural pesticide. The workshop's intended purpose is to discuss 		approaches and reach a consensus on the best way to document the activities in 		the methyl parathion program. </p>
<p><b><i>Summary of Fiscal 		Year 1997 Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p>In FY 1997, ATSDR (1) 		developed an agencywide inventory of evaluation activities, (2) conducted an 		assessment of its site-specific evaluation needs, and (3) developed a guidance 		document for State cooperative agreement evaluation activities. These 		activities and information enabled ATSDR to assess why certain public health 		actions or decisions may or may not be working effectively. These activities 		also allowed for the identification of program strengths and weaknesses and 		suggestions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public health 		actions. </p>
<p>A number of States 		collaborated with ATSDR to develop a guideline for assessing the impacts and 		outcomes of site-specific health education activities. The documents described 		in the following paragraphs are the results of this collaborative effort. These 		tools will allow cooperative agreement participants to assess the overall 		improvement in public health as a result of site-specific health education 		activities and demonstrate the cooperative agreement program's 		effectiveness. </p>
<p><b><i>Site-Specific Outcome 		Measurement Guidelines for ATSDR Cooperative Agreement States </i></b>(6853.1) 		provides guidelines for assessing the impacts and outcomes of site-specific 		health education activities. <b><i>Evaluation of State Capacity 		Building--Program Announcement #607</i>,</b> published in the <b><i>Federal 		Register</i>,</b> was also developed collaboratively by ATSDR staff members and 		State partners to assist in the overall evaluation of the effectiveness of the 		capacity building effort occurring in participating States. The evaluation also 		includes an assessment of ATSDR activities by State cooperative agreement 		personnel. </p>
<p>Next, ATSDR developed the 		document, <b><i>Did We Make a Difference? ATSDR's Framework for 		Community-Focused Evaluation</i></b> (6853) to provide guidance and information 		on how to conduct evaluations of ATSDR's site-specific programs and 		activities. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluations in 		Progress</i></b> </p>
<p>ATSDR has a number of 		ongoing evaluation activities. In addition to conducting traditional evaluation 		studies, ATSDR's commitment to viewing evaluation as an integral part of 		program planning is exemplified in the following activity now in 		progress. </p>
<p><b><i>Hazardous Substances 		Emergency Events Surveillance</i></b> (6854). This evaluation of ATSDR's 		Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) program is based on 		the ability to measure the sensitivity and reliability of the system. 		Sensitivity is measured by the ability of the system to receive notification of 		events involving hazardous substances meeting the HSEES case definition. 		Reliability is measured by the ability of the system to receive uniformly 		recorded data from the 13 State health department partners. </p>
<p>To address the sensitivity 		of HSEES, ATSDR provides to each participating State health department a list 		of events involving hazardous substance releases that occurred in their State 		during the previous quarter and that were reported to one of two national data 		bases--the Department of Transportation's Hazardous Materials Information 		System or the EPA's Emergency Response Notification System. This activity 		provides the State partners with a mechanism to detect whether there were (1) 		incidents reported to one of the national data bases that were not reported to 		HSEES, (2) incidents reported to HSEES but not reported to one of the national 		data bases, or (3) incidents reported to both HSEES and a national data 		base. </p>
<p>To address the reliability 		of HSEES, ATSDR mails to participating State health departments each quarter a 		report describing a case study involving the release or threatened release of 		one or more hazardous substances. State health department partners review the 		case study and complete a hard-copy data collection form, which is returned to 		ATSDR. Then ATSDR compares the responses on these forms to each other and to 		ATSDR's preferred responses. </p>

              <p><b>MISSION: To promote 		health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and 		disability.</b> </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation 		Program</i></b> </p>
<p>The Centers for Disease 		Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts evaluation studies designed to provide 		information essential for CDC's 11 strategies to achieve its 		mission: </p>
<ul><li> Conduct public health 		  research, including epidemiology, laboratory, behavior, and social 		  sciences.</li>
<li> Develop and implement 		  ongoing evaluation of scientific research.</li>
<li> Assure that scientific 		  information is communicated effectively to the general 		  public.</li>
<li> Develop and implement 		  public health information systems for monitoring and promoting the health of 		  the Nation.</li>
<li> Deploy 		  multidisciplinary teams to detect and investigate health 		  threats.</li>
<li> Develop and implement a 		  system for establishing CDC scientific and programmatic 		  priorities.</li>
<li> Routinely evaluate the 		  effectiveness and cost of CDC programs.</li>
<li> Demonstrate the value 		  of investment in health prevention.</li>
<li> Collaborate with 		  diverse partners.</li>
<li> Design, implement, and 		  evaluate prevention programs based on community needs.</li>
<li> Prepare the public 		  health leaders (present and future) through training in management and public 		  health science.</li>
</ul><p>CDC places high priority on 		evaluations to answer policy, program, and strategic planning questions related 		to the goals and objectives of <b><i>Healthy People 2000</i></b>. Performance 		improvement studies, such as those focusing upon the development of indicators 		consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), are of 		particular interest and import to the Agency. With the support of 1-percent 		evaluation funds, the GPRA planning process began at CDC in FY 1995 and is 		continuing. CDC's commitment to performance measurement is exemplified by this 		year's requirement that each project proposal be linked 		to one of CDC's strategic goals. These goals were identified through the GPRA 		strategic planning process. </p>
<p>On an annual basis, the 		Director of CDC provides guidance to the various Center, Institute, and Office 		Directors on 1-percent evaluation activities. This memorandum generally 		includes information about (1) types of studies to be carried out with 		1-percent evaluation funds, (2) the format for submitting proposals, and (3) a 		timeline for selection. Each proposal undergoes multiple levels of review<i>. 		</i>Initial review is conducted by staff within the Office of Program Planning 		and Evaluation. Subsequent reviews are completed by the Office of the Assistant 		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. Study authors are provided with 		comments, questions, and recommendations made by reviewers. In addition to 		providing their responses, authors are given the opportunity to revise their 		proposals at this time. </p>
<p>A panel of CDC evaluators, 		scientists, and program managers is convened to review and rank proposals. 		Review criteria include (1) relevance to prevention effectiveness, (2) relative 		importance of the public health problem being addressed, (3) probability that 		the proposed project will accomplish its objectives, and (4) extent to which 		other CDC programs will benefit from this project. Results from the review 		panel are presented to the Director of CDC for final funding 		decisions. </p>
<p>Finally, staff within the 		Office of Program Planning and Evaluation work closely with program staff to 		ensure development of a clear statement of work for selected projects. Prior to 		initiation of procurements, a final ad hoc review of the project's statement of 		work is completed. </p>
<p><b><i>Summary of Fiscal 		Year 1997 Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p>A total of 22 evaluation 		projects were completed in FY 1997. These studies are of four types: program 		evaluations, data policy and surveillance studies, development of performance 		measures, and assessments of specialized aspects of proposed or existing 		programs. </p>
<p><b><i>Program 		Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p>Six program evaluations 		were completed in FY 1997. These included an evaluation of the programmatic 		impact of CDC's 1-Percent Evaluation Program (6581 and 6581.1), an evaluation 		of suicide interventions in three Native American communities (5504), an 		evaluation design for the Business Responds to AIDS (BRTA) Program (6277), and 		an evaluation of the National Laboratory Training Network (NLTN) (5507). These 		studies represented three types of evaluations: informational, process, and 		outcome. For example, one of the studies looked at the design of BRTA, which 		was initially undertaken to help businesses create and implement comprehensive 		HIV/AIDS workplace programs, but also included questions that could help track 		trends in worksite policies, screening programs, and health promotion 		activities. In addition, one evaluability assessment that focused on CDC's 		Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal Cord Injury program (6338) was 		completed. </p>
<p><b><i>Data 		Policy/Surveillance Studies</i></b> </p>
<p>Four data 		policy/surveillance studies were completed in FY 1997. Two of the studies 		addressed reporting issues. For example, one study was conducted to ascertain 		whether the codes for International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 should 		be modified to allow for greater specificity for morbidity use (5503). A second 		study in this reporting category evaluated data collected on birth records 		completed by multiracial and Hispanic women to see how they interpret the race 		question on the birth certificate (5918). Finally, two other studies addressed 		the area of surveillance, looking at the effectiveness of CDC surveillance for 		drug-resistant <b><i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i></b> and the feasibility of 		developing a public health surveillance plan to assess current community public 		health. (6580, 6580.1) </p>
<p><b><i>Development of 		Performance Measures</i></b> </p>
<p>In keeping with the 		congressional intent of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 		1993, one study was conducted in FY 1997 to support development of strategic 		planning at CDC (5928). This report offers a record of CDC's experience in its 		early implementation of GPRA by documenting the process, summarizing key 		findings, and making recommendations for strategies and approaches for the 		ongoing implementation of GPRA at CDC. </p>
<p><b><i>Assessments of 		Specialized Aspects of Proposed or Existing Programs</i></b> </p>
<p>Eleven studies relating to 		discrete aspects of current or proposed programs were completed in FY 1997. Two 		of these projects were assessments of the Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) 		prevention programs supported by the CDC (6579, 5348). One project was a 		comparative case study of local-level syphilis prevention efforts, while the 		other assessed the feasibility of parallel STD surveillance systems currently 		operated by CDC. Additionally, two studies were conducted to assess the effects 		of HIV prevention activities: (1) through HIV Community Planning to learn how 		community planning is confirming, enhancing, and changing HIV prevention 		programs (5927); and (2) through the Prevention Marketing Initiative, which is 		aimed to influence behaviors that contribute to the sexual transmission of HIV 		among young people below 25 years of age (6337). Another study looked at CDC's 		efforts to link health promotion and disease prevention research to public 		health practice (6535). </p>
<p>Three studies focused on 		issues related to women. The first of these studies identified and investigated 		factors that place women at risk for an abusive relationship and, in turn, how 		women can protect themselves from further violence during and after the 		relationship (6515). The second study focused on presenting successful 		strategies used by grantees of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early 		Detection Program (NBCCEDP) to reach women in need of mammography screening, 		especially low-income, underserved, and uninsured women (6273, 6273.1). The 		information will be shared with grantees in order to describe how various 		programs and interventions have reached marginalized populations. This 		information will also be useful for private sector and other organizations that 		are working to provide prevention services to hard-to-reach 		groups. </p>
<p>Two additional studies 		measuring the effectiveness of particular programs and activities were 		completed during FY 1997. These studies involved an evaluation of the National 		Immunization Survey (6477) and the Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation 		(FACE) Program (5506.1). Finally, another activity focused on the first phase 		of a national study designed to profile the relationship between youths' access 		to tobacco and the contextual variables that define communities' policies, 		attitudes, and activities regarding youth and tobacco (6474). 		</p>
<p><b><i>Evaluations in 		Progress</i></b> </p>
<p>CDC's evaluation studies in 		progress during FY 1997 consisted of four types: program evaluations, data 		policy and surveillance studies, development of performance measures, and 		assessments of specialized aspects of proposed or existing 		programs. </p>
<p><b><i>Program 		Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p>Nine program evaluations 		are currently in progress. Included are evaluations of the C. Everett Koop 		Community Health Center (CHIC) (6709), diabetes control programs (6584), the 		Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) (5923, 5923.1), evaluation of teen 		pregnancy interventions (6274), lead poisoning prevention training (6702), 		sexually transmitted disease (STD) partner notification (6711), impact of the 		Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) (6335), and CDC's Prevention 		Centers Program (5919). The study of the C. Everett Koop Community Health 		Center is a process evaluation that will look at the effectiveness of the 		center to serve as a national physician-based model. This will be accomplished 		by assessing (1) the effectiveness of the CHIC products and services from the 		users' perspective; (2) the use of the products and services, as well as 		barriers to their use; (3) the effectiveness of collaborative arrangements with 		nonprofit organizations, corporations, libraries, government agencies, and 		voluntary health agencies; and (4) the effectiveness of the products and 		services, such as quality of resources. </p>
<p>By contrast, the remaining 		studies in this category are outcome evaluations. The evaluation of 		CDC-supported, State-based diabetes control programs seeks to develop and 		implement an evaluation strategy to improve capacity for uniform assessment of 		States' progress in reducing the burden of diabetes on an evolving health 		system. </p>
<p>Similarly, the evaluation 		of CDC's Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) will ascertain whether the 		program has achieved its objectives, which are to train public health 		professionals in applied epidemiological skills, to promote the sustainability 		of autonomous FETPs, and to develop a global network of national 		programs. </p>
<p>The evaluation of teen 		pregnancy interventions will assess and test the adolescent pregnancy 		prevention initiatives in 13 cities within the United States. This project will 		involve the development and testing of efficient, systematic, and durable 		approaches to translating evaluation findings and program experiences of the 13 		communities into changes in program interventions in demonstration and 		replication communities. </p>
<p>The last of the outcome 		evaluations involves the development of a systematic evaluation of notification 		to sexual partners of individuals who are diagnosed with sexually transmitted 		diseases. This project seeks to ascertain whether the substantial investment of 		State, Federal, and local health care dollars is decreasing disease prevalence 		or incidence when partners are notified. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation of Data 		Policy and Surveillance Systems</i></b> </p>
<p>Ten studies are under way 		that relate to data management or reporting systems. Seven studies include 		evaluations of the U.S. Standard Certificates (6699), medical certification 		process for death certificates (4230), pregnancy-related violence (6712), 		Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) embryo lab procedures (6716), use of 		data from Immunization Information Systems (IIS) (6713), evaluation of data 		uses of the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance 		(NETSS) and the Public Health Laboratory Information System (PHLIS) (6332), and 		the Urban Health Systems Sentinel Network (6276). In addition, three surveys 		are being conducted to evaluate guidelines for preventing perinatal HIV 		infection (6279), assess immunization knowledge and practice of primary care 		providers in the U.S. (5930.1), and inform the public about skin cancer (6710). 		The Skin Cancer National Survey examines the knowledge, attitudes, and 		behaviors of parents regarding skin cancer and the protection of their children 		from the sun. Results from this survey will enable CDC to design and distribute 		pertinent health messages about sun exposure. </p>
<p>The overall objective of 		the U.S. Standard Certificates evaluation is to examine the birth, death, and 		fetal-death information currently obtained from State vital registration 		programs to determine if relevant and high-quality data are being collected for 		State and national decisionmaking. The assessment will also consider what 		changes should be made to the standard certificates to improve their 		utility. </p>
<p>The other two evaluations 		are examining the use of survey instruments in data collection. In the area of 		pregnancy-related violence, a national population-based survey will be 		conducted of administrators and clinical providers in family planning programs. 		Information gained in the survey will be used to develop recommendations for 		the development of clinical guidelines. Similarly, since CDC is responsible for 		developing a model certification program for ART embryo laboratories in the 		United States, a survey will be conducted on the laboratories currently using 		ART to provide an enumeration of those procedures and practices. 		</p>
<p>Finally, at this point in 		the development cycle of the Immunization Information Systems (IIS), an 		assessment is being conducted on how the IIS data are used. The objectives of 		this project are to (1) assess how IIS data are used to assess public clinic 		and private provider performance and to identify structural and functional 		barriers to using the data; (2) assess how IIS data are used to assess 		community-based immunization coverage; (3) assess how IIS data are used to 		monitor the impact of changing recommendations in immunization schedule and the 		health care delivery system; and (4) promote the development of immunization 		registries. </p>
<p><b><i>Development of 		Performance Measures</i></b> </p>
<p>Four ongoing projects 		involve the development of performance measurement systems. One of these 		projects, Development and Implementation of Strategic Planning at CDC, seeks to 		gather and analyze information that supports a comprehensive, unified, and 		data-driven strategic and performance planning framework for the CDC (6275). 		Three other projects focus on the development of indicators that will be used 		to assess HIV prevention efforts in the community, management and operational 		aspects of HIV community planning, and the coordination of multiple HIV 		prevention programs (5518, 6278, 6707). </p>
<p><b><i>Assessment of 		Specialized Aspects of Proposed or Existing Programs</i></b> </p>
<p>Fifteen specialized studies 		relating to discrete aspects of current or proposed programs are in progress. 		These wide-ranging studies include evaluations of the development of a public 		health surveillance plan (5925), a feasibility study of Pap screening in STD 		clinics (6705), dental treatment and health status differences attributable to 		water fluoridation (6334), and the effectiveness of Group B streptococcal 		disease prevention guidelines (6333), still other studies assess the public 		health impact of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 		(NIOSH) health hazard evaluation program (5922), tuberculosis outreach worker 		activities (5502), elder care groups (6708), small business interventions 		(6336), the <b><i>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</i> (<i>MMWR</i>)</b> 		recommendations for the use of bike helmets (6700), coordinated tobacco control 		efforts (6714), CDC's technical assistance to local health departments on 		violence prevention (5929), the efficacy of different types of 		vancomycin-resistant enterococci (6703), and HIV-related projects (6701, 6704, 		6715, and 6706). </p>
<p>With the goal of complete 		eradication of tuberculosis by the year 2000, one of the studies focuses on an 		evaluation of tuberculosis outreach worker activities. Specifically, the 		project will (1) identify how these workers accomplish their tasks, (2) assess 		the quality of outreach workers' interactions with clients and supervisors, and 		(3) evaluate the amount of time spent on various research 		activities. </p>
<p>Many of the studies being 		conducted hope to provide the public with better information for all age 		groups. For instance, the elder care focus group study was undertaken in order 		to obtain data that will be used to produce an elder care health and safety 		handbook in the United States. One study focuses on the safety of our youth, as 		well as adults, with a desire to develop updated recommendations and guidelines 		for the use of bicycle helmets. In addition, an evaluation of tobacco control 		efforts will continue by looking at the impact and the relative cost 		effectiveness of tobacco control programs. </p>
<p>Several HIV 		prevention-related projects are in progress. Projects are being conducted to 		develop community indicators for HIV, to administer PCP prophylaxis for women 		and persons in underserved communities, to evaluate the current HIV technical 		assistance (TA) network, and to determine how the next iteration of TA could be 		improved. Finally, a study to determine the feasibility of developing a 		demonstration project to assess identification and screening of women at high 		risk of HIV infection is in progress. The community indicators study will 		identify (1) cultural and social-structural characteristics of communities that 		are associated with HIV/AIDS risk behavior and prevention efforts; (2) 		theories, assumptions, or hypotheses that explain the causal role of community 		characteristics; and (3) measures or indicators that could be used to assess 		changes in those characteristics that support sustained individual behavior 		change and community prevention efforts. This information will be used to 		support community-level research on HIV/AIDS prevention. </p>
<p>The goal of evaluating the 		CDC HIV Technical Assistance Network is to provide CDC staff who are 		responsible for planning the next iteration of a TA network and stakeholders of 		the current CDC-supported TA network with valuable information that can be 		used<b> </b>to develop and strengthen the existing TA model. </p>

              <p><b>MISSION: To protect and 		promote public health through food, drug, medical device, and cosmetic 		regulation.</b> </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation 		Program</i></b> </p>
<p>The evaluation program of 		the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues to be aligned with the 		Agency's policy, its program and strategic planning initiatives, and the goals 		of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). Since GPRA and the 		reorientation of all government managers toward performance management, the 		responsibility for program evaluation has shifted from traditional specialized 		staff offices and contractor studies to managers of all FDA programs. In 		addition, FDA managers are identifying further opportunities to involve their 		customers in the design and testing of alternative ways of doing business. Both 		performance-based goals and customer participation also impact FDA's response 		to the needs of small businesses and enhance the participation and performance 		of small businesses. </p>
<p>One element of FDA's 		strategic framework is called external leveraging. The goal here is to augment 		the ability of external stakeholders to manage FDA-regulated risk. FDA's 		evaluation program illustrates the implementation of this goal with a number of 		studies under way or completed during FY 1997 that illustrate the strategies 		that FDA is using to accomplish this goal. One strategy is the fostering of an 		industry quality assurance program, where FDA will establish protocols to guide 		firms, certify their approaches, and audit industry practices. A current 		example of this quality assurance is the Mammography Quality and Standards Act 		(MQSA), which monitors the administration of mammography practices. The 		following reports are based on evaluations of mammography activities: the 		<i><b>Mammography Quality Standards Act: Second Annual Government Entity 		Declaration Program Audit,</b> </i>and the<i> <b>Economic Impact Analysis of 		Regulations Under the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992</b></i><b>.</b> 		In addition, the Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) has 		implemented the<i> <b>Survey of Current Hazard Assessment Quality Control 		Points (HAACP) Practices of the Food Industry</b></i><b>.</b> While excluding 		seafood, this survey originated as a result of the Seafood HAACP Program, 		another FDA-fostered quality assurance program. </p>
<p>Other CFSAN evaluations, 		both completed and in progress, are clearly in line with FDA's objective of 		communicating risk associated with FDA-regulated products. These studies are 		directly linked to the President's National Food Safety Initiative, which will 		involve a collaboration between FDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 		the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Centers for Disease Control 		and Prevention (CDC) in order to assure safety and quality of our food supply. 		Special emphasis will be placed on microbial hazards, which account for 90 		percent of the confirmed food-borne outbreaks, 6.5 to 33 million illnesses, and 		9,000 deaths in the U.S. annually. Since food-borne chemical hazards often 		present chronic rather than acute health threats, specific estimates of their 		impact on health and the economy are not readily available. Finally, data 		collected from the FDA's <b><i>Safe Alert Survey</i></b> will demonstrate how 		well the Agency is communicating risk associated with medical devices to the 		medical community. </p>
<p><b><i>Summary of Fiscal 		Year 1997 Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p>Prescription Drug User Fee 		Act </p>
<p>The Prescription Drug User 		Fee Act (PDUFA) has demonstrated that the Agency and industry, by combining 		their resources and working together, can achieve the levels of performance the 		American people deserve. The fifth and final report completed in November 1997 		demonstrates that the successes reported in FY 1996 have been confirmed and 		surpassed. PDUFA has resulted in more and better applications filed which can 		be accepted immediately, reviewed, and approved more quickly (6079.2). Nearly 		all applications now go directly into the review process, with "applications 		refused" approaching the vanishing point. There are substantially more 		approvals on first review, which demonstrates that submission quality is a key 		factor in achieving timely approvals. Another indication of improved submission 		quality is the dramatic increase in the percentage of submissions that are 		ultimately approved faster. By working to meet the PDUFA's stringent review 		goals, new products are getting on the market at an unprecedented pace without 		compromising safety. </p>
<p><b><i>Product Review 		Performance Report</i></b> </p>
<p>In FY 1997, FDA completed 		its first annual report analyzing performance in reviewing applications for 		human drugs, biological products, medical devices, food and color additives, 		and veterinary drugs (6731). Responding to legislation (such as PDUFA) as well 		as to requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA has 		developed clear performance goals for reviewing new product applications. 		Setting these goals has provided a valuable management tool for identifying 		performance expectations, assessing achievements, and meeting the requirements 		of GPRA. The report finds that (1) for most categories of products, FDA 		performance has improved since FY 1993; (2) the greatest improvements in 		performance have occurred for product reviews covered by PDUFA; (3) significant 		progress has been made in reviewing applications for medical devices; and (4) 		on-time performance for reviews of non-PDUFA applications should be 		improved. </p>
<p><b><i>Assessment of the 		Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992 (MQSA)</i></b> </p>
<p>Under this statute, FDA is 		charged with ensuring that accessibility to quality mammography services is 		maintained for all facilities performing mammographies. This program is FDA's 		second major user-fee, performance-oriented, GPRA-style initiative. During FY 		1997, Eastern Research Group, Inc. completed an economic analysis of FDA's 		final rule under MQSA working under contract to the Office of Planning and 		Evaluation (OPE), Economics Staff. The purpose of the cost-benefit analysis was 		to predict the impact of the proposed standards on the costs of providing 		mammography. The results of their analysis are presented in the report 		entitled, <i><b>Economic Impact Analysis of Regulations Under the Mammography 		Quality Standards Act of 1992</b> </i>(6080). The results of this analysis will 		be used by FDA's managers to develop a performance-oriented regulatory policy 		that will be coordinated with existing customers. OPE's Economics Staff 		developed a model for estimating health outcomes to a patient population at 		various levels of mammography quality. </p>
<p><b><i>Quality Standards 		Act: Second Annual Government Entity Declaration Program Audit and the Economic 		Impact Analysis of Regulations Under the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 		1992</i></b> </p>
<p>FDA's Division of 		Mammography Quality and Radiation Programs requested an audit of the MQSA 		Government Entity (GE) Declaration Program (6730). The audit was undertaken by 		the Division of Planning, Analysis, and Finance. The goals of the audit were to 		notify facilities that they will be held accountable for their 		self-certification of fee exemption and to determine the rate of compliance 		with the program. Based on the results, the auditors concluded that the GE 		Declaration Program appears to be quite effective. Several recommendations were 		made based on the findings of the audit. First, the results should be published 		to allow the impact of the audit to reach most of the facilities. This would 		discourage any future misrepresentations and demonstrate that FDA will exercise 		its authority. Second, the sample size of future audits should be smaller and 		should contain a larger portion of those facilities claiming fee exemption 		based solely on funding from the CDC. Finally, the MQSA contractor should 		continue to examine each GE Declaration form to ensure that it identifies the 		body operating the facility. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation of Device 		Performance in the Determination of Substantial 		Equivalence</i></b> </p>
<p>Many diagnostic medical 		devices that reach the market are based on diagnostic agreement with some 		device already on the market that targets the same attribute. Agreement is 		often assessed by side-by-side testing of the same subjects or specimens, even 		if the true disease status is unknown. If each new test is compared with the 		most recent predicate, what would be the effect on device performance over 		time? Would it deteriorate, remain the same, or improve? FDA produced an 		analysis that addressed these questions using statistical measures of 		sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values (6734). When a new test was 		found to be equivalent to the current predicate, it became the new predicate. 		After 50 new predicates were found, a forecast procedure was applied to the 		sequence of 50 performance parameters in order to evaluate the long-term 		trend. </p>
<p><b><i>Center for Food 		Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) Evaluation</i></b> </p>
<p>During FY 1997, three 		evaluations relating to food issues were completed by the Economics Branch in 		CFSAN's Division of Market Studies. The first, <b><i>Preliminary Investigation 		into the Morbidity and Mortality Associated with the Consumption of Fruit and 		Vegetable Juices</i></b> (6858), assessed the population risk from the 		consumption of fruit and vegetable juices. The main risks studied were 		microbial pathogens. Two studies evaluated regulation of the seafood industry: 		<b><i>Cost of Restrictions on Gulf Oyster Harvesting for Control of</i> 		Vibrio<i> </i>vulnificus<i>-Caused Disease</i></b><i> </i>(6856), an economic 		impact analysis of alternative remedies for controlling <b><i>Vibrio</i> 		<i>vulnificus</i></b>-related illnesses in the Gulf States oyster industry, and 		<b><i>Health Transfers: An Application of Health-Health Analysis to Assess Food 		Safety Regulation </i></b>(6857), an evaluation tool based on the first study's 		methodology that can be used to measure economic versus health costs of public 		health decisions. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluations in 		Progress</i></b> </p>
<p>FDA currently has a broad 		range of evaluations in progress which, as in previous years, are based upon 		the two driving forces relating to GPRA goals: performance management and 		customer participation (with particular focus on small businesses). The 		following are examples of FDA evaluations in progress during FY 		1997. </p>
<p>Although PDUFA ends in FY 		1997, FDA and the pharmaceutical and biological prescription drug industry have 		negotiated re-enactment beyond FY 1997. Reauthorization of the collection of 		user fees under the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (enacted in 		November 1997) will continue to enhance the review process of new human drugs 		and biological products (6079.3). The PDUFA program serves as a model for 		reinventing government, with the Congress, FDA, the industry, and consumer 		groups working together to provide the necessary resources, set performance 		goals, and hold the Agency accountable. Revenues generated from the fees paid 		by the pharmaceutical and biological prescription drug industries will continue 		to be dedicated to improving and expediting the prescription and application 		review and approval process. The legislation reauthorizing PDUFA for FY 1998 		was critical in ensuring uninterrupted service to U.S. customers. 		</p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation of 		Influenza Virus Vaccines in High-Risk Patient Categories</i></b> (4355) is 		intended to ensure public health by investigating the reactogenicity and 		immunogenicity of influenza virus vaccines. The information will be critical to 		making accurate recommendations for the selection of new strains of the 		influenza virus vaccine to be used in the United States. </p>
<p><b><i>Nationwide Evaluation 		of X-Ray Trends (NEXT)</i></b> (4984) is a collaborative program conducted 		jointly between FDA and State radiation control agencies. The study estimates 		the radiation dosage from diagnostic x-ray examinations using data collected 		from previous NEXT surveys of different types of x-ray examinations. The data 		are used by public health and professional organizations in setting 		policy. </p>
<p><b><i>Food Labeling and 		Package Survey (FLAPS)</i></b> (5711) was implemented by the FDA in 1977 to 		produce a data base containing label and package information obtained from a 		sample of food products from the processed packaged food industry. FLAPS data 		enable FDA personnel to keep abreast of market responses to food labeling rules 		via changes in product package labels. </p>
<p><b><i>FDA Penalty Reduction 		Program for Small Businesses</i></b> (6461) reviews pre-existing and revised 		policies related to monetary penalties for noncompliance with FDA regulations, 		evaluates the scope of small businesses that qualified (or failed to qualify) 		for the program, and assesses the total amount of penalty reductions or 		waivers. The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) 		required FDA to create a program or policy that specifies the circumstances 		under which the Agency may reduce or waive the penalties levied against small 		business entities for noncompliance. The final report for this project is 		anticipated in March 1998. </p>
<p><b><i>FDA Inquiries 		Assistance Program for Small Businesses</i></b> (6462) is FDA's response to the 		SBREFA requirement to establish a program to respond to inquiries and to help 		small businesses and other small entities apply FDA rules. The report on this 		project is anticipated in March 1998. </p>
<p>During FY 1998, FDA will 		continue to implement the requirements of the <i><b>Mammography Quality 		Standards Act of 1992 (MQSA)</b> </i>(6080.1). FDA requested an increase in 		MQSA authorized inspection fees over the FY 1997 level. Continuing 		implementation of the MQSA requirements is essential to ensure that women 		receive quality mammography from facilities that maintain a high standard of 		safety and accuracy. The primary emphasis of this program for FY 1998 will be 		to continue to ensure that all facilities meet the quality standards and that 		deficiencies previously identified through annual inspections are corrected. In 		FY 1998, Federal and State personnel will continue to conduct annual 		inspections of 10,000 facilities and certifications of 6,000 facilities, and to 		provide training for new inspectors. The fees will be used to pay for the costs 		of the inspections. </p>
<p><b><i>Review of Therapeutic 		Agents as an Antimicrobial Adjunct in Treatment of Sepsis</i></b> (6736) is a 		technique used in the drug approval process. No therapeutic agent has yet been 		identified that shows either a clinical benefit or an alternative that is 		superior to standard care. FDA faces many challenges in designing clinical 		trials that demonstrate efficacy. These are due to the heterogeneity of patient 		populations, poor understanding of the pathophysiology of acute sepsis, and no 		uniformly-accepted standard of care in these international trials. Intensive 		efforts have been undertaken by FDA to propose the optimal trial design and 		prospective analysis plans. This analysis of failed sepsis trials is being 		conducted by FDA to achieve better clinical trial results for the evaluation of 		adjunctive sepsis therapy in the future. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Real-Time PMA 		Supplement Program Evaluation</i></b> (6732), implemented by the Office of 		Device Evaluation (ODE), has evolved as a result of the Medical Device Review 		of the Premarket Approval (PMA) Applications program. FDA has reduced review 		times and backlogs for medical device applications. But, in order to achieve 		mandated goals, continued improvement is needed. FDA requested an increase in 		funds for FY 1998 in order to improve the quality and timeliness of its review 		process for Class III PMA applications and PMA supplements. These applications 		involve the highest-risk devices that require full clinical investigations of 		safety and efficacy. An increase in funding will facilitate FDA in allocating 		more resources to the PMA process without sacrificing performance gains made in 		the 510(k) program. It is projected that FY 1998 will be the first year of this 		enhancement effort, and FDA expects a 15 percent increase in PMA workload 		during FY 1997 and FY 1998 due to requests for reclassifications and 		submissions of required preamendment PMAs. Given these additional resources, 		FDA will attempt to limit the increase in pending PMAs at the end of FY 1998 to 		5 percent. FDA has defined specific review performance goals for Class III 		applications that should be achieved by the end of FY 1998 with the additional 		resources. </p>
<p>The<i> <b>Safe Alert 		Satisfaction Survey</b></i> (6733) will determine the impact of the safety 		alert and public health advisory on the behavior and knowledge of the public. 		The collection of these data is an important step in determining how 		effectively FDA is communicating risk to the public. </p>
<p><b><i>Survey of Current 		Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Practices of the Food 		Industry</i></b> (6866) is a two-part survey that will yield information that 		will be used to estimate the HACCP-related practices of the food industry 		(except seafood, meat, and poultry), and a model that will be used to estimate 		the marginal costs of firms to comply with HACCP. </p>
<p><b><i>Economic 		Characterization of the Dietary Supplement Industry</i></b> (6867) will provide 		a detailed analysis of the dietary supplement industry, including a description 		of the types of firms producing and marketing dietary supplements, and will 		create a relational data base that will link firms to products. 		</p>
<p><b><i>Estimating the 		Benefits of Various Kinds of Food Standards</i></b> (6865) will categorize food 		standards by type of food and function and to estimate consumers' valuations of 		those functions. </p>
<p><b><i>Harmonizing 		Nutritional Goals and Food Processing</i></b> (6864) is a paper to be given at 		the "Towards Convergence on the Dietary Guidelines, Research and Policy Needs 		in the Nutrition, Health, and Agricultural Sectors" conference on April 30, 		1998. </p>
<p>The<i> <b>Impact of Tobacco 		Initiative on Youth</b></i><b> </b>(6890) is a project in which Office of 		Planning and Evaluation staff are currently designing a sample questionnaire to 		facilitate data collection on tobacco use. The survey responder will determine 		whether the tobacco initiative has had any positive impact on the propensity of 		youth to use these products. In August 1996, President Clinton approved FDA's 		final rule for regulating tobacco products. The President's Tobacco Initiative 		demonstrates a collaborative effort to thwart major public health risk with the 		objective of decreasing tobacco use over the next 7 years. FDA is working with 		the States to conduct unannounced compliance checks of retail establishments 		that sell tobacco products. FDA will rely on Federal and State agencies to 		monitor retailer compliance with the new regulations and track the degree of 		success in decreasing tobacco use by youth. </p>

<p>The research arm of the 		Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)--the Office of Strategic Planning 		(OSP)--performs, coordinates, and supports research and demonstration projects 		(through intramural studies, contracts, grants, and waivers) to develop and 		implement new health care financing policies and to provide information on the 		impact of HCFA's programs. The scope of HCFA's research and demonstration 		activities embraces all areas of health care: cost, access, quality, service 		delivery models, and financing approaches. OSP's research responsibilities 		include evaluations both of the ongoing Medicare and Medicaid programs and of 		demonstration projects testing new health care financing and delivery 		approaches. These projects address four major themes. </p>
<ul><li> <b><i>Monitoring and 		  Evaluating Health System Performance: Access, Quality, Program Efficiency and 		  Costs</i></b>--HCFA's research program produces information and descriptive 		  statistics on the infrastructure of the health system, on populations of health 		  care users, and on service and expenditure patterns; examines differences in 		  costs, quality, and access to care; and assesses the effects of HCFA programs 		  on beneficiary health status.</li>
<li> <i><b>Improving Health 		  Care Financing and Delivery Mechanisms: Current Programs and New 		  Models</b>--</i>HCFA 		  performs research and demonstrations to develop and test new payment and 		  delivery models intended to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of 		  Medicare. OSP's evaluations of these demonstration projects provide 		  policymakers with information about their impact.</li>
<li> <b><i>Meeting the Needs 		  of Vulnerable Populations</i></b>--HCFA's research and evaluation program 		  includes projects that develop new approaches to improve access to 		  cost-efficient and appropriate health services for vulnerable 		  populations.</li>
<li> <b><i>Information to 		  Improve Consumer Choice and Health Status</i></b>--Improving beneficiaries' 		  knowledge and ability to make informed health care choices, both in the health 		  plans they select and in the services they use, is part of HCFA's commitment to 		  improving communication of information to beneficiaries. OSP examines 		  variations in the use of services and treatments and the impact of new 		  information tools and technologies in making health care decisions and 		  improving beneficiaries' health status.</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Summary of Fiscal 		Year 1997 Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p>During FY 1997, HCFA 		completed 21 evaluations, which are briefly described below. </p>
<p>In, <b><i>Access to 		Physicians' Services for Vulnerable Beneficiaries: Impact of the Medicare Fee 		Schedule</i></b> (6301), HCFA evaluated the effect of the physician fee 		schedule on a beneficiary's access to care. Six different strata of 		beneficiaries were selected based on the relative size of the payment change 		under the fee schedule compared to the earlier payment scheme. The project 		examined the use of services, outcomes of services, and the change in the 		beneficiary's financial liability. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Impact of the 		Medicare Fee Schedule on Teaching Physicians</i></b> (6666) was started because 		of four concerns: (1) teaching physicians perform more high-technology 		procedures and less primary care, which could result in disproportionate net 		loss for these practices; (2) teaching hospitals and medical schools tend to be 		located in large urban areas, where the Geographic Practice Cost Index portion 		of the payment is lower; (3) customary charges for teaching physicians may be 		higher than the areawide historical payments calculated for fee schedule 		transition; and (4) a number of academic medical practices had not signed 		Medicare participation agreements. For this study, 720 hospitals were selected, 		including all U.S. academic medical centers. The results indicated that there 		is no evidence that teaching physicians have been adversely affected by the 		Medicare Fee Schedule. </p>
<p><b><i>1995 Influenza 		Immunizations Paid for by Medicare: State and County Rates</i></b> (6615) is a 		data book tied to the program begun in 1993 to stimulate the provision of flu 		vaccine to Medicare beneficiaries. It provides information about National, 		State, and county rates of vaccination in fee-for-service settings (managed 		care beneficiaries could not be counted because their encounter data are not 		reported). </p>
<p>The Department was 		legislatively required to report to the Congress on the relative quality of the 		care in the Medicaid program. HCFA's <b><i>A Study of the Appropriateness, 		Process of Care, and Outcomes of Medical Care for Medicaid Patients</i></b> 		(6302) examined the necessity, appropriateness, and effectiveness of selected 		medical treatments and surgical procedures for Medicaid patients. It assessed 		the variation that exists in the rate of performance of selected treatments and 		procedures on Medicaid beneficiaries for small areas within and among States. 		It determined that there are underutilized, medically necessary treatments and 		procedures for which failure to furnish could have an adverse effect on health 		status. The study had two phases. The first used extant data in HCFA to examine 		patterns of utilization for over 160 different conditions and procedures. It 		found that, for all conditions combined, utilization was higher in the Medicaid 		population and that the differences were higher for medical than for surgical 		conditions. Within Medicaid, medical conditions showed somewhat more small-area 		geographic variation than did surgical conditions. For all conditions combined, 		the Medicaid population tended to exhibit more small-area geographic variation 		than did the non-Medicaid population, but the pattern was not consistent across 		States. In the second phase, data were abstracted from medical records at 118 		hospitals in California, Georgia, and Michigan for a selected series of index 		diagnoses: pediatric asthma, hysterectomy, and complicated labor and delivery. 		Five indicators were developed to assess the level of quality. In general, 		Medicaid women and children were treated in public hospitals, teaching 		hospitals, and hospitals with large bed capacities. The appropriateness of the 		decision to hospitalize was comparable between Medicaid and the 		privately-insured. And, once hospitalized, they received a similar level of 		care. Most importantly, the outcomes of care were essentially similar between 		the two payer groups, although the Medicaid patients were more severely ill. As 		a result, there were differences in outcomes that were not related to the 		inpatient quality of care provided. The inpatient care for the Medicaid 		patients was considered adequate and comparable with care received by 		privately-insured patients. </p>
<p><i><b>Evaluation of the 		Medicaid Uninsured Demonstrations</b> </i> 		(6298) assesses three demonstrations 		conducted in the States of Maine, South Carolina, and Washington. These 		demonstrations, implemented in response to a Congressional mandate under 		section 4745 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, tested the 		effect of allowing States to extend Medicaid coverage to low-income families. 		The project examined the ability of the Medicaid programs to enroll significant 		numbers of eligible persons, looking particularly at the conditions under which 		eligible persons and their families are willing to participate in such 		programs, given their scarce financial resources. The evaluation also looked at 		the ability of the programs to induce adequate levels and the willingness of 		employers to participate in the programs. </p>
<p>The Inspector General of 		the Department conducted a demonstration of improved methods for the 		investigation and prosecution of fraud and abuse. The <b><i>Evaluation of the 		Effectiveness of the Operation Restore Trust Demonstrations</i></b> (6311) 		examined whether this more concentrated effort, rendered through the 		demonstration's partnership model, had a relatively greater impact on health 		industry fraudulent behavior than the same efforts conducted separately. 		Operation Restore Trust (ORT) involved a targeted set of initiatives that 		focused on a few States, a few areas of the Medicare benefit, and a few 		standard operating procedures (especially, failures to coordinate among the 		most central agencies and to exploit available data resources). The evaluation 		concluded that ORT turned around certain troubling trends of the early 1990's 		and has brought new vigor to government efforts to combat health care fraud and 		abuse. ORT had important effects across the full spectrum of organizations it 		sought to affect, and even had some important effects on organizations over the 		boundaries of the demonstration (e.g., Medicare contractors) that were not so 		directly orchestrated by the ORT initiative. </p>
<p><b><i>Assessing the 		Viability of All-Payer Systems for Inpatient Hospital Services</i></b> (6594) 		explored the feasibility and possible structure of alternative approaches to 		developing such a system. It looked at the practicality of adapting or 		extending Medicare's Prospective Payment System to other payers. Two analyses 		were conducted to determine (1) whether diagnosis-related group-based payment 		rates for Medicare and non-Medicare patients should be adjusted based on 		hospital characteristics, and (2) alternative approaches in defining the 		Medicare standardized prospective payment rate. Current Medicare standardized 		prospective payment rates are based on the mean adjusted cost for a given 		category of hospital; high-cost hospitals are penalized under the assumption 		that their costs reflect presumed inefficiency. It developed hospital-specific 		measures of inefficiency and then excluded the costs of inefficient hospitals 		from the calculation of standardized payment rates. The conclusion was that a 		frontier cost function model approach is superior to the current system and can 		result in substantial program savings. </p>
<p><b><i>Monitoring and 		Evaluation of the Medicare Cataract Surgery Alternate Payment 		Demonstration</i>: <i>Final Evaluation Report</i></b> 		 (6295) assisted HCFA in tracking the 		3-year demonstration that tested the concept of a single global Medicare 		payment for outpatient cataract procedures. The payment amount represented the 		cost for physician, facility, and intraocular lenses. The evaluation found that 		the project was reasonably successful in encouraging provider flexibility and 		in managing the bundle of services. There was ample anecdotal evidence that the 		cost-effectiveness incentives were working; e.g., cost reduction efforts by 		surgeons in the techniques and time required to perform the surgery and actions 		to standardize the intraocular lenses and other supplies and materials. Once 		operations began, government activities related to pricing were greatly reduced 		and limited to simple verification and payment of the global fee. The evaluator 		was not able to measure appropriateness, but in terms of quality control and 		utilization review, the demonstration was successful in that the outcomes were 		unchanged. The project offered some insights into the strengths and weaknesses 		of particular incentives in encouraging providers to participate. However, it 		provided only limited new information on the factors that influenced 		beneficiaries to participate. </p>
<p>HCFA completed an 		evaluation on the implementation of ambulatory patient groups (APGs) under the 		title, <b><i>Toward a Prospective Payment System for Outpatient Services: 		Implementation for Outpatient Services-- Implementation of APGs by State 		Medicaid Agencies and Private Payers.</i></b> (6320) The focus of this study 		was the Medicaid outpatient prospective payment system that groups patients for 		payment purposes rather than paying on a cost basis. These groups are similar 		in concept to diagnosis-related groups, which form the heart of Medicare's 		prospective payment system for inpatient care. It involved a case study of 		Iowa's implementation of the APG system and an analysis of the reimbursement 		methodology. All six payers that had operational experience tailored their APG 		systems to their own priorities and markets. They all implemented the system 		without major incident. The payers reported success in reducing outpatient 		costs where that was the immediate goal, and they believe the system encourages 		higher-cost facilities to reduce costs and rewards lower-cost facilities. The 		views of providers were more mixed. Though they reported generally adequate 		overall payment, they also viewed the system as complex, could not calculate 		expected payment, and often let their computer systems group related claims 		rather than consolidating them prior to submission, as was the intent of the 		system. No evidence was found of much behavioral response by providers, but 		that could change if the system is implemented by a large payer such as 		HCFA. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Second Update of 		the Geographic Practice Cost Index: Final Report</i></b> (6611) was produced 		and is scheduled to be fully phased in by January 1, 1999. One-half of the 		total change will be implemented in 1998. A comparison between the 1997 and 		1999 Geographic Practice Cost Indexes (GPCIs) shows that (1) there is no change 		between the physician work GPCI or the non-physician employee wage index of the 		practice expense GPCI, except that they are reweighted with 1994 county 		relative value units; (2) the office rental index of the practice expense GPCI 		is updated with FY 1996 Fair Market Rents (from the Department of Housing and 		Urban Development); (3) county rental adjustment factors are eliminated for all 		metropolitan areas (except for the New York City Primary Metropolitan 		Statistical Area); (4) the malpractice GPCI is updated with 1992, 1993, and 		1994 premium data, and specialty premiums are weighted by national relative 		value unit proportions rather than allowed charges; (5) there is no change in 		the GPCI cost shares, which measure the share of the various inputs in total 		practice revenues; and (6) the county relative value units used to weight 		averages to county input prices for each Fee Schedule Area are updated from 		1992 to 1994. The project determined that the changes in the Medicare Fee 		Schedule resulting from implementation of this GPCI update will be less than 		2.5 percent for each Fee Schedule Area. </p>
<p>The <i><b>Payment of 		Pharmacists for Cognitive Services: Results of the Washington State C.A.R.E. 		Demonstration Project</b> </i>(6528) is a report on a demonstration project 		called Cognitive Activities and Reimbursement Effectiveness (C.A.R.E.). It is 		operated under the premise that (1) direct reimbursement for cognitive services 		would remove financial barriers associated with the pharmacists' provision of 		these services; and (2) that this change would result in more consultations, 		with a subsequent impact on costs and outcomes from drug therapy. Data were 		drawn from three groups of approximately 100 pharmacies in the State of 		Washington. The project found that (1) pharmacists who received a financial 		incentive consistently reported higher cognitive service intervention rates 		than did those who did not receive financial incentives; (2) about half of all 		documented service problems were for patient-related matters (about one-third 		were for drug-related problems, about 17 percent were for prescription-related 		problems, and the residual 1.4 percent were for non-drug problems); (3) a drug 		therapy change occurred as a result of 28 percent of all pharmacist cognitive 		services; (4) for each cognitive service that was associated with any type of 		drug therapy change, the average downstream drug cost savings was about $13.05 		(but these savings varied by type of drug therapy); and (5) the demonstration 		generated savings of about $78,000 in Medicaid prescription drug expenditure 		over the 18-month period. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Consequences of 		Paying Medicare HMOs and</i> <i>Health Care Prepayment Plans (HCPPs)</i></b> 		(6314) compared the cost effectiveness of such plans to fee-for-service (FFS) 		and health maintenance organizations (HMOs), which operate on a risk basis. The 		main question examined in this study was whether HCFA payments would have 		increased or decreased had these organizations remained risk contractors. The 		evaluator found that costs to HCFA increased substantially under the cost 		programs, HMO, and Health Care Prepayment Plan (HCPP). Furthermore, most of the 		cost-based plans were found to have favorable selection. Total dollar losses to 		HCFA for 1993 due to the cost, HMO, and HCPP programs were estimated to be $185 		million relative to fee-for-service, and $4 million relative to risk-based 		payments. Dropping the seven plans that converted to risk or dropped out of 		Medicare since 1993 would have resulted in estimated losses of $210 million 		compared to FFS, and $90 million compared to risk contracting. 		</p>
<p>The <b><i>Costs and 		Consequences of Case Management for Medicare Beneficiaries: Final 		Report</i></b> (6291) studied the appropriateness of providing case management 		services to beneficiaries with catastrophic illnesses and high medical costs. 		It tested case management as a way of controlling costs in the fee-for-service 		sector. The target conditions and case management protocols differed in each 		site, though all three generally focused on increased education regarding 		proper patient monitoring and management of the target chronic condition. All 		three sites anticipated reduced hospitalizations and medical costs compared to 		the beneficiary control groups. The evaluation found that (1) the projects 		successfully identified and enrolled populations of Medicare beneficiaries 		likely to have much higher than average Medicare reimbursements during the 		demonstration period; (2) each project met with unexpectedly low levels of 		enthusiasm for the demonstration from beneficiaries and their physicians; and 		(3) despite high levels of satisfaction among the high-cost, chronically ill 		beneficiaries who eventually participated, the projects failed to improve 		client self-care or health, or reduce Medicare spending. Comparisons of health 		status, functional status, and expenditures between the control and 		intervention groups showed no improvements resulting from the case management 		intervention. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Validation of 		Nursing Home Quality Indicators Study</i></b> (6612) developed a system by 		which a series of indicators could be used, in conjunction with claims data, to 		monitor quality of care in nursing facilities. Fifty such indicators were 		developed and validated. The indicators focused on three broad problem areas: 		adverse outcomes, lack of therapy, and inappropriate pharmaceutical treatments. 		The indicators were designed to be used in an automated system to continuously 		monitor the quality of care provided. The study found that (1) it is possible 		to base such indicators on Medicaid and Medicare claims data; (2) as a whole, 		the indicators were better at predicting the absence of a quality issue 		(suggesting that the negative finding represented the lack of a quality concern 		in a specific nursing home); and (3) using covariant diagnoses was useful to 		adjust for the risk of a resident receiving an indicator tag. 		</p>
<p>The<i> <b>Evaluation of the 		Community Nursing Organization Demonstration Interim Evaluation Report</b></i> 		(6306) examined a set of demonstration projects that tested a capitated, 		nurse-managed system of care. It was designed to promote timely and appropriate 		use of community health services and to reduce the use of costly acute care 		services. More than 5,400 beneficiaries were enrolled in the four Community 		Nursing Organization (CNO) demonstration sites. The evaluation report covers 		the first 15 months of operations. The applicants have been healthier and more 		independent, on average, than the general Medicare population in their 		respective market areas. Analyses of measures of death, physical functioning, 		and satisfaction with care detected no statistically significant differences. 		Analysis of a subsample of persons who were impaired in Activities of Daily 		Living indicated that members of the CNO treatment group were more likely to 		improve (or less likely to deteriorate further) than members of the control 		group. An even stronger result, in the same direction, was found for 		individuals who were limited in Instrumental Activities of Daily 		Living. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Evaluation of the 		Utah Prepaid Mental Health Plan</i></b> (6293) focuses on a demonstration 		project in which three mental health centers provided services to all Medicaid 		beneficiaries in their catchment areas (these areas included over 50 percent of 		all Utah Medicaid beneficiaries). It was expected that this program would 		control the cost inflation and improve patient outcomes in mental health 		services. The study examined (1) the organizational and financial 		characteristics and their evolution over time, (2) the impact on the 		organization of service delivery and use of services, and (3) the financial 		impact on providers and the Medicaid program in Utah. The development of the 		demonstration proceeded fairly smoothly, albeit somewhat more slowly than 		planned. Three centers chose to enter the demonstration and eight chose to not 		join. Several changes in the program's environment affected the development 		during the initial 3 years. There were general expansions in children's 		programs, day treatment programs, and case management. The community mental 		health centers began to focus staff attention on ways to increase the 		efficiency with which discharges from the hospital were managed and on the way 		outpatient services were delivered--all while maintaining quality of care. The 		results suggest that the demonstration reduced expenditures on acute inpatient 		care by reducing admissions, without significant effects on outpatient 		expenditures and visits. Financial impact was possible in that the 		demonstration altered the way in which Medicaid funds flowed to the 		participating community mental health centers and it redefined their 		responsibilities with respect to the provision of services. In addition, there 		were relatively few financial differences between contracting and 		non-contracting community mental health centers. Thus, the decision to 		participate appears to have had a null effect on the site's financial 		performance. The payments to the participating sites were less than estimated. 		In the second method of looking at payments to the sites, there were savings on 		inpatient care, which were partially offset by increases in outpatient care for 		a net overall savings. The overall estimates of total program savings showed 		this same pattern of inpatient savings, diminished by outpatient increases. 		However, these estimates are very sensitive to the methods used to project 		trends. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Limited-Service 		Hospital Pioneers: Challenges and Successes of the Essential Access Community 		Hospital/Rural Primary Care Hospital (EACH-RPCH) Program and Medical Assistance 		Facility (MAF) Demonstration</i></b> (5200.1) concerned a legislatively 		mandated attempt to assist States in maintaining access to health care services 		in rural areas. The program awarded grants to several States to develop rural 		health plans, establish rural health networks, and create a limited service 		alternative for communities that could no longer support a full-service 		hospital. These limited service providers and other health care providers were 		organized into rural health networks. This evaluation examined the development, 		implementation, and early operating experience of the program. In addition, it 		looked at a forerunner program, the Montana Medical Assistance Facility 		Demonstration. It found that these limited service hospital models occupy a 		niche in rural health care system by permitting an alternative for outright 		closure. However, there were considerable limitations to participation. The 		financial benefits varied by facility, depending on such things as cost 		structure, provider supply, and patterns of use in the specific community. It 		found that program flexibility and the linkage of primary care services to 		developing networks was essential. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Comparative Study 		of the Use of EPSDT and Other Preventive and Curative Health Care Services by 		Children Enrolled in Medicaid: Final Project Synthesis Report</i></b> (6236.7) 		included (1) a description of the Medicaid program in the four study States 		(Michigan, Georgia, Tennessee, and California) and these States' responses to 		the 1989 legislative changes relating to children's and Medicaid coverage and 		also to the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program; 		(2) an analysis of the impacts of the State's responses on participating 		providers and enrolled children; and (3) an assessment of the national context. 		The States' efforts to increase provider participation in Medicaid and EPSDT 		were successful in increasing provider participation and average caseloads 		among all types of providers (except for dentists in Michigan). However, the 		increased supply may not have been adequate to meet the increased demand 		because the ratios of Medicaid children to participating providers and 		percentages of counties with provider shortages rose from 1989 to 1992 in all 		four States. Only 42 to 54 percent of Medicaid children were recommended to 		have preventive care visits and, of these, only 36 to 59 percent made such 		visits. Compared with other low-income children, Medicaid coverage did increase 		service use and improved access to illness-related care. However, Medicaid 		children had very low completion rates for age-appropriate 		immunizations. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Evaluation of the 		Demonstration to Improve Access to Care for Pregnant Substance Abusers</i></b> 		(6297) sought to evaluate project effectiveness in (1) outreach and assessment; 		(2) expansion, integration, and coordination of program services; and (3) 		improvement of client case management. The evaluator examined the effects of 		access to prenatal care and substance abuse treatment services on the health of 		drug-addicted pregnant women and birth outcomes of their infants. The 		evaluation showed that the number of abusers enrolled in the demonstrations was 		low relative to all pregnant substance abusers in the area, since women were 		reluctant to be identified. The project found higher enrollment rates in States 		that implemented broad-based outreach efforts, and that higher levels of 		participation and greater retention in substance abuse treatment resulted in 		higher-birthweight infants. </p>
<p><b><i>An Evaluation of 		Implementation of the Medicaid Community Supported Living Arrangements (CLSA) 		Program in Eight States</i></b> (6304) was designed to test the effectiveness 		of developing a continuum of care concept as an alternative to the 		Medicaid-funded residential services provided to individuals with mental 		retardation and related conditions. The program served individuals who are 		either living in the community independently, with their families, on in homes 		with three or fewer other individuals receiving the same services. These 		services were provided in eight States between fiscal years 1991 and 1995. By 		the end of the program, only 73 percent of the expected number of individuals 		were receiving services in the Community Supported Living Arrangement (CSLA), 		and the expenditures were only 58 percent ($38.4 million) of the amount 		authorized. </p>
<p>The<i> <b>Impact of Report 		Cards on Employees: A Natural Experiment</b></i> (6312) sought to determine 		whether the dissemination of information about health plans to consumers (who 		choose health plans within a managed care competition framework) would 		influence their knowledge of plan characteristics, attitudes toward the plans, 		or choice of plan. Investigators found that report cards had no effect on 		employees' knowledge of health plans, their attitude about quality of health 		plans, or their choices in selecting a managed care health plan. The study did 		find that health plan characteristics (such as price) were strongly related to 		health plan choice. The investigators suggest that consumers do not seem to be 		influenced by the information in any of the ways measured in this 		study. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluations in 		Progress</i></b> </p>
<p>HCFA currently supports 19 		evaluation projects in progress, 13 of which are scheduled to be completed in 		FY 1998. These projects provide information for continued monitoring of the 		Medicare and Medicaid programs and assess the impacts of HCFA's Medicare and 		Medicaid demonstration projects. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Evaluation of 		Medicare SELECT</i></b> (5966.3) examines a pilot Medicare supplemental 		insurance product under which full Medigap benefits are paid only when services 		are provided by the plan's provider network. Case studies, primary surveys, and 		administrative data (claims) analyses are conducted. The analytical portion of 		the project compares cost and use of Medicare and supplemental services, 		selection effects, beneficiary satisfaction, and physician practice patterns to 		other Medigap options. To date, the evaluation has found no health status 		differences or quality of care received by SELECT and non-SELECT beneficiaries. 		In addition, there were no differences in overall satisfaction levels between 		these populations. Premiums for SELECT policies were almost always cheaper than 		the same company's own standard Medigap policy for any age group. In two out of 		three years examined, SELECT policies were generally more expensive for older 		beneficiaries when compared to community rated policies. Medicare costs 		generally increased as a result of Medicare SELECT. The costs increased in five 		States, decreased in three States; and were not affected in three other States. 		Since the States studied were not chosen to be representative of the Nation, 		their experience is not necessarily indicative of a national program. 		Consequently, the effect of SELECT on Medicare program expenditures appears to 		be mixed at best. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Medicare 		Participating Heart Bypass Center Demonstration Extended Evaluation</i></b> 		(5985.5) continues to study the feasibility of a negotiated, all-inclusive 		pricing arrangement for coronary artery bypass graft surgery while maintaining 		high-quality care. The project looks for any net cost savings to the Medicare 		program, any volume increases at the demonstration sites, the aspects of the 		demonstration that were attractive to beneficiaries and referring physicians, 		and whether the quality of care at the sites was equivalent to that provided 		prior to the demonstration. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Medicare HMO 		Evaluation</i></b> (6294) updates the findings of an earlier study of Medicare 		risk health maintenance organizations. That study found that Medicare paid 5.7 		percent more for plan enrollees than would have been spent under 		fee-for-service. The current study looks at disenrollment, beneficiary 		satisfaction, quality of care, and selection and savings. </p>
<p>The <i><b>Evaluation of 		Medicaid-Managed Care Programs with 1915(b) Waivers</b> </i>(6290)<i> </i>will 		provide information on the extent to which various features of the managed care 		waiver projects contribute to the ability of the Medicaid program to deliver 		cost-effective care to eligible populations. </p>
<p><b><i>Maximizing the 		Effective Use of Telemedicine: A Study of the Effects, Cost Effectiveness, and 		Utilization Patterns of Consultation via Telemedicine</i></b> (6303) is a 		comprehensive evaluation of HCFA's telemedicine demonstration projects. The 		project assesses alternative payment options for the providers of telemedicine 		services, such as fee-for-service, facility payments, or capitation. Objective 		measures of the cost of telemedicine services in different clinical settings 		are used, both from the payer's and the physician's perspective. Provider and 		patient satisfaction, utilization measures (e.g., physician visits, 		hospitalizations or rehospitilizations, and frequencies of complications or 		comorbidities), and the effect of telemedicine on practice patterns are 		included. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Drug Utilization 		Review Evaluation Contract</i></b> (6296) is examining the impacts of 		retrospective and prospective review, which included the payment of pharmacists 		for cognitive services. Demonstrations of on-line prospective drug utilization 		review (DUR) in Iowa and of cognitive service by Washington State pharmacists 		provided the primary data for evaluation. This evaluation looks at the two 		types of DUR program effects in preventing adverse drug-related events by 		incorporating and analyzing the program participants' pharmaceutical and 		medical information. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Evaluation and 		Technical Assistance of the Medicare Alzheimer's Disease Demonstration</i></b> 		(6305) is being conducted to determine the effectiveness, cost, and impact on 		health status and functioning of providing comprehensive in-home and 		community-based services to beneficiaries with dementia. Two models of care 		will be studied. Both include case management and an extensive package of 		services not presently covered under Medicare, such as adult day care, 		homemaker/personal care services, companion services, and caregiver education 		and training. The models are differentiated by the intensity of the case 		management provided to beneficiaries and their families and by the monthly 		amount of Medicare payments for project services. The purpose of the evaluation 		is to measure the cost and effect on the beneficiaries' functional level and 		institutionalization rate, as well as its impact on caregiver burden and 		stress. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation of Phase 		Two of the Home Health Agency Prospective Payment Demonstration</i></b> (6308) 		examines the second phase of a program designed to test the effectiveness of 		using prospective payment methods to reimburse Medicare-certified home health 		agencies (HHAs). In this demonstration a per-encounter payment method is being 		tested. The study looks at the effects of this payment method on HHAs 		operations, service quality, and expenditures. It also analyzes the 		relationship between patient characteristics and the cost and utilization of 		home health services. </p>
<p>The<i> <b>Examination of 		the Medicaid Expansions for Children</b></i> (6300) uses enrollment and 		expenditure trends to ascertain the impact of the 1989 program changes. It will 		look at target population penetration, and the impact of State policies (and 		the eligibility group) on enrollment, expenditures, and utilization of 		services. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Project 		Demonstrating and Evaluating Alternative Methods to Assure and Enhance the 		Quality of Long-Term Care Services for Persons with Developmental Disabilities 		through Performance-Based Contracts with Service Providers</i></b> (6310) tries 		to determine whether and how well the implementation of new approaches to 		quality assurance--with outcome-based definitions and measures of quality--will 		replace input and process measures of quality in this population 		group. </p>
<p>In future years, several 		other evaluations are expected to be completed. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Evaluation of the 		Medicare Choice Demonstration</i></b> (6292) assesses the feasibility and 		desirability of new types of managed care plans for Medicare. These plans can 		be integrated delivery systems and preferred provider 		organizations. </p>
<p>HCFA is conducting 		demonstrations testing the payment of skilled nursing facilities on a 		prospective basis for Medicare and Medicaid services. Medicare currently 		reimburses such facilities on a retrospective cost basis. This demonstration 		uses a case-mix classification system (called Resource Utilization Groups) to 		classify patients and establish payment rates. The <b><i>Evaluation of the 		Nursing Home Case-Mix and Quality Demonstration</i></b> (6307) seeks to 		estimate specific behavioral responses to the prospective payment and to test 		hypotheses about aspects of such responses. The main goal of the project is to 		estimate the effects on the health and functioning of the nursing home 		residents, their length of stay, and use of health care services; on the 		behavior of the facilities; and on the level and composition of Medicare 		expenditures. </p>
<p>The State of Delaware is 		experimenting with its Medicaid program. The State believes that by enrolling 		Medicaid children in a managed care system, it will benefit from a higher level 		of coordinated care and reduced costs. The <b><i>Evaluation of the 		Demonstration Entitled Delaware Health Care Partnership for Children</i></b> 		(6288) is examining this project. </p>
<p>HCFA is sponsoring a wide 		variety of waiver-based demonstrations that give States the opportunity to 		experiment with their Medicaid programs. As these demonstrations begin, HCFA 		will undertake examinations of their impact. The<i> <b>Evaluation of the Oregon 		Medicaid Reform Demonstration</b></i><b> (6166), the<i> Evaluation of the State 		Medicaid Reform Demonstrations</i></b> (in Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Tennessee) 		(6289), and the <b><i>Evaluation of the State Medicaid Reform 		Demonstrations</i> </b>(in Kentucky; Los Angeles County, California; Minnesota; 		New York; and Vermont) (6289.1) are three such projects. More evaluations will 		be initiated as more State demonstrations are begun. </p>
<p>In 1977, the Congress 		authorized a new type of provider, the Rural Health Clinic, which must be 		located in a rural health professional shortage area, medically underserved 		area, or Governor-designated shortage area and must make use of mid-level 		practitioners. Rural Health Clinics are reimbursed on a cost basis by the 		Medicare and Medicaid programs. Their numbers have been growing at a relatively 		rapid rate. The<i> <b>Evaluation of Rural Health Clinics</b></i> (6299) 		examines the reasons for this growth, the impact on access to care for these 		rural populations, and the costs to the Federal government and 		States. </p>
<p>The<i> <b>Evaluation of the 		Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly Demonstration</b></i> (6309), 		known as PACE, examines replications of a unique model of managed care service 		delivery for very frail community-dwelling elderly, most of whom are dually 		eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and all of whom are assessed as being 		eligible for nursing home placement. The core services include adult day health 		care and multidisciplinary team care management through which all health and 		long-term care services are arranged. The evaluator is looking at the 		demonstration sites before and after assumption of financial risk to see if the 		replicates are cost effective relative the current Medicare and Medicaid 		services. They are also looking at the decision to enroll in order to 		understand how PACE enrollees differ from the eligible beneficiaries who choose 		not to enroll. </p>

              <p><b>MISSION: To improve the 		Nation's health by assuring equitable access to comprehensive, quality health 		care for all.</b> </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation 		Program</i></b> </p>
<p>The purposes of the Health 		Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) evaluation program are to enhance 		strategic and performance planning, strengthen budget and legislative 		development, and improve program management. The Agency's evaluation priorities 		are to develop and support performance measurement, assess program 		implementation, and conduct crosscutting policy analysis and 		research. </p>
<p>Performance measurement 		includes technical and training activities to strengthen the Agency's capacity 		to assess program performance, as well as studies to assess program outcomes. 		These activities, mandated by the Government Performance and Results Act 		(GPRA), will provide data for ongoing program monitoring and evaluation and for 		developing annual performance plans and reports. HRSA completed a study in 		September 1995 to establish a performance measurement baseline for all 		operating programs, with the intent of specifying valid and useful indicators 		and measures for all programs by September 1998. Over the past three years, 		HRSA has made significant progress in performance management, such as in 		strengthened linkages among strategic planning, evaluation, and budget 		decisionmaking. </p>
<p>Assessment of program 		implementation includes a broad range of efforts to assist the Agency in 		adjusting program development and management as the priorities of the Executive 		Branch and the Congress change. HRSA programs are entering into new 		arrangements for delivering services, providing health professions education, 		and encouraging the development of systems reform. </p>
<p>Crosscutting policy 		analysis and research<i> </i>includes efforts to build capacity and conduct 		studies to clarify the environmental shifts affecting HRSA programs and to 		improve HRSA's ability to document performance and impact through better 		measurement tools and data sources. The term, "crosscutting," refers to issues 		that bear on the programs of two or more HRSA Bureaus, such as trends in 		numbers and characteristics of the uninsured, and the viability of the health 		safety net. Development of this capacity at the Agency level began in FY 1997; 		work in FY 1998 and beyond will build on this foundation. </p>
<p>HRSA is striving to improve 		the quality of evaluation products. Potential approaches for this initiative 		include (1) an increase in the level and amount of technical assistance 		available to staff across the Agency; (2) expansion in the proportion of work 		done intramurally or with short-term help from individual experts; (3) 		encouragement of HRSA staff to participate in evaluation courses offered by 		local universities; and (4) establishment of an external evaluation advisory 		committee to consult on evaluation strategies in terms of content, approaches, 		and dissemination. Evaluation capacity is being strengthened first in the 		central evaluation unit, with the intent of making similar improvements in 		evaluation resources of the Bureaus in the future. </p>
<p>HRSA is continuing to place 		a major emphasis on dissemination of findings and information about the 		utilization of study results. A broader dissemination strategy, including an 		assessment of opportunities for using electronic media more effectively, will 		also be an important component of the quality improvement activities now under 		development. </p>
<p><b><i>Summary of Fiscal 		Year 1997 Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p>Studies related to the 		three key areas of HRSA's mission are described first, followed by crosscutting 		projects. </p>
<p><b><i>Eliminating Barriers 		to Care</i></b> </p>
<p>One significant study, 		<b><i>Exploratory Evaluation of Rural Applications of Telemedicine</i></b> 		(5749), provides national baseline data on the status of telemedicine in health 		care for rural populations. The project included a mail survey of all 		non-Federal hospitals located outside metropolitan areas in the summer of 1995, 		plus a short survey of hospitals doing only teleradiology and a longer survey 		of hospitals applying telemedicine for purposes beyond radiology. The major 		findings were that (1) rural telemedicine is in the early stages of development 		but is rapidly expanding; (2) telemedicine networks are complex, with an 		average of four "spoke sites," two hubs, and four facilities that provided and 		received consults; and (3) Federal and State grants and support from hospitals 		are common sources of direct funding, but fewer than 25 percent of hub 		facilities had negotiated payment with insurance carriers and many had not 		begun negotiations. Study results have been used in forming the FY 1997 		guidelines for the Rural Telemedicine Grant Program, in part to encourage the 		use of telemedicine in community settings. As requested, early findings were 		shared with congressional staff, who then specified priority areas in the 		authorizing legislation. The report was distributed to Federal agencies funding 		telemedicine, to State Offices of Rural Health, and through the World Wide Web. 		Finally, findings are informing the design of a common telemedicine evaluation 		instrument for HRSA grantees and for consideration by other Federal 		sponsors. </p>
<p>Another study relating to 		access is <b><i>Institutional Factors That Influence the Likelihood of 		Living-Related Kidney Transplant Operations--Phase II</i> </b>(4917.1). The 		purpose of this project was to determine (1) the willingness to conduct, and 		frequency with which the transplant community does conduct, kidney transplants 		from living-related donors; (2) the medical and non-medical institutional 		factors influencing the likelihood that transplant professionals will suggest 		and conduct such transplants; and (3) the circumstances and conditions under 		which a transplant team that does not encourage these transplants would refer a 		patient to another transplant center for evaluation. One finding was that over 		half of kidney transplant centers lacked patient education materials about live 		kidney donors. A summary report has been sent to all kidney transplant centers. 		In addition, discussions have been held with groups such as the National Kidney 		Foundation about ways to apply the findings, such as through development of 		educational materials for national distribution. </p>
<p>In the health professions 		area, a major statistical study produced a technical and an analytic report; 		the title of the latter is <b><i>The Registered Nurse Population, March 1996: 		Findings from the National Sample of Registered Nurses</i></b> (6367). A 		contractor prepared the sampling design and conducted the survey, which is the 		most comprehensive source of statistics on registered nurses (RNs) with current 		licenses to practice in the United States. The survey resulted in a data base 		of information on 29,950 nurses, which was then analyzed by HRSA staff. The 		report provides information on the number of nurses; their educational 		background and specialty areas; their employment status, including type of 		employment setting, position level and salary; their geographic distribution; 		and their personal characteristics, including gender, race and ethnicity, age, 		and family status. HRSA is using the study products to guide nursing education 		programs, to prepare biennial reports to Congress on characteristics of the RN 		population, and for projecting the supply and demand for nurses at a national 		level. The data base and analytic report have been shared with the nursing 		community, which looks to the Department to maintain and update this data 		base. </p>
<p><b><i>Eliminating 		Disparities in Health Status</i></b> </p>
<p>Another major quantitative 		effort was the <b><i>Community Health Center User and Visit Study: Survey 		Methodology Report</i> </b>(5737). This project gathered, for the first time, 		nationally representative data about Community Health Center (CHC) users and 		the services provided to them. The study had two components: (1) personal 		interviews with 1,932 patients selected randomly from a representative sample 		of 48 CHCs, and (2) data extraction from 2,878 medical records concerning 		randomly selected encounters during 1994 at the same centers. Data on users 		were gathered in a manner to permit comparison with results from the National 		Health Interview Survey. Similarly, information from the visit (encounter) 		survey will be compared with results from the National Hospital Ambulatory 		Medical Care Survey. The CHC data are being analyzed to answer questions on 		such topics as the race and ethnicity of users, health-risk behaviors 		presented, most prevalent diagnoses, services utilized, and the extent of 		monitoring of compliance with treatment prescribed for chronic conditions. In 		addition, the data are being reviewed to form a profile of CHC visits in 		comparison with studies of the general population in terms of conditions, 		diagnoses, type of provider seen, and disposition. Analysis of data from the 		initial surveys continues intramurally, as well as through a current study 		noted below. </p>
<p><b><i>Assuring Quality of 		Care</i></b> </p>
<p>A major concern in recent 		years has been the spread of tuberculosis (TB) among persons with HIV/AIDS. 		<b><i>Examining Relationships Between HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis Programs in 		Title I Eligible Metropolitan Areas</i></b> (6359) was designed (1) to 		determine the extent to which Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency 		(CARE) Act grantees were giving guidance to providers on TB screening and 		prophylactic and therapeutic regimes, and (2) to describe models of 		collaboration between HIV and TB control programs within Eligible Metropolitan 		Areas (EMAs). The study found that TB services varied across EMAs and across 		care settings within them. As of 1995/1996, Federal and State funding policies 		and staffing patterns hampered collaboration between HIV and TB programs. 		However, the study identified mechanisms to promote TB-HIV services 		collaboration, fostered in some places by outbreaks of TB and 		multidrug-resistant TB. HRSA has used the results to inform Title I program 		guidance and to develop the training and technical assistance plan for FY 1998. 		The report has been sent to Title I grantees and to the Centers for Disease 		Control and Prevention (CDC) TB control grantees. Results were also presented 		at the 1995 International AIDS conference in Vancouver, Canada, and in 		September 1997 at the CDC conference entitled, "Issues for HIV and TB 		Co-Infected People." </p>
<p>The increasing adoption of 		managed care by public insurance programs, such as Medicaid, has raised 		concerns about whether capitated reimbursement affects quality of care provided 		to people with chronic illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, or with other special health 		care needs. One way to address these concerns is to create risk-adjusted 		capitation rates to provide equitable reimbursement for the care of patients 		with costly illnesses, an approach several States had proposed or implemented 		by 1997. In May of last year, HRSA convened an invited conference to examine 		issues surrounding risk adjustment for HIV/AIDS, in collaboration with other 		HHS organizations (the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Planning and 		Evaluation and the Health Care Financing Administration), the Henry J. Kaiser 		Family Foundation, and the National Academy of State Health Policy. The 		<b><i>HIV Capitation Risk Adjustment Conference Report </i></b>(6894) presents 		perspectives of participants (representing persons living with HIV/AIDS, 		providers, managed care organizations, and States); methodological issues; and 		research needs. Conference findings have been used in technical assistance to 		States on coordinating CARE Act programs with managed care. HRSA has 		distributed the report to all CARE Act grantees and State Medicaid 		directors. </p>
<p><b><i>Crosscutting 		Issues</i></b> </p>
<p>One recently completed 		study concerned managed care and its relevance for vulnerable populations. The 		<i><b>Availability of Primary Care Services Under Medicaid Managed Care: How 14 		Health Plans Provide Access and the Experience of 23 Safety Net Providers and 		Their Communities</b> </i>(6366) examined strategies used by health maintenance 		organizations (HMOs) to generate access to health care services for Medicaid 		enrollees, who often live in inner-city and rural, underserved areas. The 		project also explored the implications of these strategies for overall access 		in underserved areas and for existing care providers. Third, the study 		considered how these strategies affect traditional Medicaid providers in the 		community. The study concluded that Medicaid managed care has had an overall 		positive effect on the availability of primary care to low-income residents in 		the 14 communities, and that traditional safety net providers have not had to 		reduce services. But the future viability and range of services of public 		sector-supported providers might be endangered in a more competitive health 		system. The findings will be useful to policymakers concerned with the 		provision of care for vulnerable populations, providers in underserved areas, 		and those attempting to assure an adequate supply of health personnel. The 		study has been noted in the professional press and will be referenced in a 		journal article now under preparation. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluations in 		Progress</i></b> </p>
<p>Projects in progress are 		presented first according to HRSA's three mission goals; crosscutting projects 		follow. </p>
<p><b><i>Eliminating Barriers 		to Care</i></b> </p>
<p>Begun in September 1994, 		the <b><i>Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Community Health Centers: 		Implementation Phase</i></b> (5736) is describing CHC delivery model(s), 		measuring<i> </i>the impacts of the model(s), and identifying factors that 		contribute to the observed impacts. The study is examining the experience of 		CHC users and non-users in both fee-for-service and managed care arrangements 		though a sample of 50 CHCs in 10 States. The project has three components: (1) 		an analysis of utilization and expenditures, based on HCFA State Medicaid 		Research Files for eight States; (2) an analysis of outcomes and content of 		care for four conditions (otitis media, asthma, hypertension, and diabetes) 		based on CHC medical records and the literature on medical treatment norms; and 		(3) a description of CHC delivery systems using primary data collection (a mail 		survey) and secondary sources. The analysis of utilization and expenditures is 		addressing casemix and differences between exclusive and regular CHC 		users. </p>
<p><i><b>Effectiveness of the 		National Health Service Corps</b> </i> 		(6357) is examining the various 		mechanisms for training and recruiting providers, placing them in underserved 		areas, and retaining them in primary care and service to vulnerable 		populations. The project includes mail surveys of three random samples: (1) 		National Health Services Corps (NHSC) alumni clinicians; (2) current NHSC 		clinicians; and (3) administrators of sites staffed with NHSC clinicians. (Some 		of the sites are CHCs and others are free-standing.) The study also involves 		review of secondary data on individual NHSC participants, sites that are 		eligible for NHSC assignees, characteristics of designated shortage areas, and 		site vacancies available for assignment of obligated scholarship 		providers. </p>
<p>In another critical policy 		area, HRSA is conducting a study entitled <b><i>Enrollment, Utilization and 		Cost-Forecasting Models for Use in State AIDS Drug Assistance Programs</i></b> 		(6806). This study is exploring the effect of the introduction of protease 		inhibitors on medical service utilization for use in State AIDS Drug Assistance 		Programs (ADAP). During 1996, five protease inhibitors became available; this 		class of drugs has been shown to have superior outcomes in treating HIV. 		However, although pharmaceutical interventions represent a sizeable portion of 		the cost of care for HIV-infected patients, the efficacy of these drugs has not 		been shown outside of controlled clinical trials. This study is using 		client-specific data from a geographically diverse population to identify 		personal factors that may modify the link between the introduction of protease 		inhibitors and services use. </p>
<p><b><i>Eliminating 		Disparities in Health Status</i></b> </p>
<p>The <b><i>National 		Evaluation of the Healthy Start Program</i></b> (5610) continues as a 		longitudinal study of the development, implementation, and outcomes of the 		comprehensive maternal and child health delivery systems at the original 15 		Healthy Start sites, which were funded initially as 5-year demonstration 		projects. A sixth year was added in FY 1996. This study includes an assessment 		of changes in the health status of pregnant women and infants across the sites. 		The study was designed to answer four questions: Did the Healthy Start 		initiative succeed? If so, why? If not, why not? What would be required for a 		similar intervention to succeed in other settings? The study includes both 		process and outcome components. Findings from both will contribute to analyses 		bearing on replication of successful approaches for reducing infant mortality, 		and on improving program effectiveness in general. Study results will be used 		to guide the development and implementation of Healthy Start projects funded 		subsequently, and will be widely shared with the public health community for 		application in settings funded under other auspices. </p>
<p><b><i>Analysis of CHC User 		Survey: Selected Conditions</i></b> (6805) is assessing portions of the survey 		data from the Community Health Center User and Visit Study (see PIC ID No. 		5737). The purpose is to describe the self-reported process of care and outcome 		measures for CHC users with certain conditions: hypertension, high serum 		cholesterol, diabetes, asthma, and pregnancy. The analysis includes the 		demographic characteristics, income and educational levels, health status, and 		activity limitations of these patients as compared with (1) CHC users without 		the selected conditions, and (2) the general population. Data on the general 		U.S. population will be from the National Health Interview Survey and the 		National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Findings will be used, in 		part, to determine whether care provided at CHCs is appropriate and conforms to 		the specifications of<i> <b>Healthy People 2000.</b></i> </p>
<p><b><i>Assuring Quality of 		Care</i></b> </p>
<p>One of HRSA's critical 		concerns is cultural competence of care. A study begun in FY 1997,<i> 		<b>Development and Refinement of Tools for Monitoring Cultural Competence in 		Managed Care</b></i> (6817), is analyzing successful experiences of managed 		care organizations in California in meeting the needs of culturally and 		linguistically diverse Medicaid populations. A second purpose of this study is 		to plan for the validation of tools for measuring cultural competence among 		individual providers. The new study builds on <b><i>Tools for Monitoring 		Cultural Competence in Health Care</i></b> (6352), which was completed in FY 		1996. </p>
<p><i><b>Direct Support for 		Conduct of Evaluation Studies at Selected CARE Act Pilot Sites</b> 		</i>(6807) is 		providing assistance to six Title I and Title II grantees in analyzing data 		sets and developing models to assure the effectiveness of their primary care 		and supportive services. These local studies constitute a first step in 		developing future "sentinel" studies to create a picture of the national impact 		of these CARE Act programs. These initial projects include three types: (1) 		examining the association of CARE Act-funded services with clinical and other 		outcomes for patients with HIV; (2) developing models to assess the effects of 		managed care on fund allocations and service delivery; and (3) developing and 		pilot testing models to analyze the effectiveness of Title II care consortia in 		evaluating needs, setting priorities, and delivering services. 		</p>
<p>In addition to studies 		relating mainly to one mission area, HRSA has ongoing projects focused on the 		capacity of two HRSA Bureaus to measure performance across the organization. 		The first of these projects, which concerns the Maternal and Child Health 		Bureau (MCHB), is the <b><i>MCHB GPRA Maturity Project</i></b> (6811). This 		study, building on a series of program-specific efforts, is providing 		coordination of performance measurement activities to produce coherent 		performance data for the Bureau as a whole. The project also provides technical 		assistance in working with grantees and others to promote acceptance and 		implementation of performance measures throughout the maternal and child health 		community, and training for MCHB program staff in the ongoing use of 		performance measures. The intent is to complete the development of a fully 		operational performance management system. </p>
<p>A Bureau of Health 		Professions (BHPr) project also illustrates the use of evaluation to develop 		performance measures that encompass all Bureau programs. <b><i>Development of 		BHPr's Comprehensive Performance Monitoring System</i></b> (6800) is helping 		the Bureau implement its monitoring system. In preparation for meeting GPRA 		requirements, BHPr has developed goals, outcomes, and indicators with respect 		to workforce quality, supply, diversity, and distribution. This project, begun 		in FY 1997, is using a data collection instrument that was tested through an 		earlier pilot study to begin nationwide implementation of the data collection. 		The study includes technical assistance to applicants and grantees in gathering 		the required data and completing the data collection instrument. This project 		will involve grantees for the first time in submitting data electronically 		using the new instrument. The study includes development of software, training 		in its use for Bureau staff and grantees, and a help desk to provide ongoing 		technical assistance during implementation of the reporting system. The study 		will also include an evaluation of the data collection instrument and 		electronic implementation, the training and technical assistance, and the 		quality of data collected. Results of the project will be used to determine 		whether changes are needed in the current approach for collecting and analyzing 		program data, and will be shared with the public through an article in a 		professional journal. </p>
<p><b><i>Crosscutting 		Issues</i></b> </p>
<p>Through <i><b>Managed Care 		and the Safety Net Providers</b> </i>(6815), HRSA is examining the impact of 		Medicaid managed care on the fiscal and operational viability of safety net 		providers in primarily ambulatory and primary care settings. Among the types of 		providers to be included are Community and Migrant Health Centers, Maternal and 		Child Health programs, Ryan White CARE Act grantees, and rural health centers. 		A key topic being explored is the effect of a more competitive, market-oriented 		health care system on capacity to serve vulnerable populations. Policy and 		program interventions to deal with possible shortfalls will be 		identified. </p>
<p>A collaborative effort with 		NCHS, <i><b>Person-Place Approximations and Utilization vs. Health Status 		Analysis of the National Health Interview Survey</b> </i>(5614) is addressing 		three questions: (1) What common characteristics are shared by communities with 		problems in access to health care? (2) Can these characteristics/ 		</p>
<p>problems be measured 		directly, or through good proxies from data that can be easily obtained? (3) 		What is the appropriate aggregation of geographical units to use in describing 		small areas? The intent is to gain a better understanding of the ways in which 		the characteristics of particular areas influence the behavior of respondents 		to the National Health Interview Survey in order to use the knowledge for 		predicting access problems in small areas for the entire U.S. 		population. </p>
<p>Finally, <b><i>HRSA 		Crosscutting Community Case Studies</i></b> (6814) is examining the nature, 		extent, and impact of the interaction of HRSA programs in selected "sentinel" 		communities in order to determine whether inflows of HRSA resources at the 		local level combine in a mutually reinforcing way, operate independently, or 		work at cross-purposes. This project builds on two ongoing studies sponsored by 		other organizations. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is developing baseline 		information for tracking changes in the health care market in 12 metropolitan 		statistical areas. The other project, sponsored by the HHS Office of Disease 		Prevention and Health Promotion, is addressing how market-driven changes are 		affecting the level of effort of public health departments in providing ten 		essential public health services. Sites for the HRSA study are three urban 		communities (Boston, Cleveland, and Phoenix) in the Johnson Foundation study. 		This project is HRSA's first attempt to test a methodology for measuring the 		interactions and collective impacts of the Agency's programs on communities, 		which can then to used for conducting prospective and long-term 		evaluations. </p>

              <p><b>MISSION: The mission of 		the Indian Health Service, in partnership with American Indian and Alaska 		Native people, is to raise their physical, mental, social, and spiritual health 		to the highest level.</b> </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation 		Program</i></b> </p>
<p>The goal of the Indian 		Health Service (IHS) is to assure that comprehensive, culturally acceptable, 		personal and public health services are available and accessible to American 		Indian and Alaska Native people. The importance of evaluation in supporting 		this goal has increased significantly in recent years and includes American 		Indians and Alaska Natives as the primary stakeholders in defining the purpose, 		design, and execution of evaluations. The stakeholders use the end product of 		the evaluations, and are typically the population or groups most likely to be 		affected by the evaluation findings. The IHS has formally adopted the 		principles of a responsive evaluation practice to address the needs and 		concerns of American Indians and Alaska Natives. </p>
<p>The evaluation program of 		the IHS is managed by the Office of Public Health, Staff Office of Planning, 		Evaluation, and Research (OPH-SOPER), which provides national leadership and 		consultation for IHS and Area Offices on strategic and tactical planning, 		program evaluation and assessment, public health and medical services, research 		agendas, and special public health initiatives for the Agency. The OPH-SOPER 		serves as the principal advisory office on issues of national health policy and 		coordinates the following four evaluation functions. </p>
<ul><li> <i><b>Health Program 		  Evaluations</b>--</i> 		  Collect and analyze information useful for assisting IHS officials in 		  determining the need for improving existing programs or creating new programs 		  to address health needs.</li>
<li> <i><b>Policy 		  Analysis</b>--</i> 		  Conduct analyses when a change in the IHS health service delivery 		  system must be considered, when issues emerge in an area where no policy 		  currently exists, or when current policies are perceived as inappropriate or 		  ineffective.</li>
<li> <b><i>Health Services 		  Research</i></b>--Undertake analyses of the organization, financing, 		  administration, effects, and other aspects of the IHS delivery of health 		  services.</li>
<li> <i><b>Special Studies 		  and Initiatives</b>--</i> 		  Conduct studies and prepare special reports required by Congress in 		  response to pending legislation or policies, often using a roundtable, whenever 		  an issue or a health problem requires immediate action and it is unclear what 		  type of action should be taken.</li>
</ul><p>The evaluation needs of the 		IHS service components are coordinated by OPH-SOPER using two major types of 		short-term studies: policy assessments and program evaluation studies. The IHS 		policy assessments contribute to decisionmaking about budget, legislation, and 		program modifications and include background information to support the 		Agency's initiatives. Evaluation studies are focused at the program level, or 		Area Offices, and focus on specific program needs. </p>
<p>Each year OPH-SOPER selects 		high-priority health care and management studies for funding through the 		submission of proposals to headquarters and Area Offices. These proposals are 		reviewed and rated by a panel of subject-matter experts, evaluation experts, 		and IHS staff for concurrence with IHS strategic goals, objectives, and 		priority areas. The proposals are then prioritized and forwarded to the IHS 		Director, who reviews the projects that are recommended for funding and 		determines the respective funding levels. </p>
<p><b><i>Summary of Fiscal 		Year 1997 Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p>During FY 1997, IHS 		completed two major evaluation projects. </p>
<p>The<i> <b>Evaluation of the 		Impact of the Alaska Tribal Health Compact on Programs and Services in the 		Anchorage Service Unit, Alaska Area</b></i> (6407) project is the first 		research to systematically evaluate the perceptions of a wide range of 		beneficiaries, officials, and employees of the IHS and the tribal system 		regarding the Alaska Tribal Health Compact, Title III Self-Governance 		Demonstration Project. There are almost 200 federally recognized tribes in a 		single Areawide Compact, organized via 13 separate consigners, each of which 		has its own Annual Funding Agreement. Seven of these consigners are in the 		Anchorage Service Unit, which is one of nine Service Units in the Alaska Area. 		The evaluation concludes that more village representatives have seen either no 		change or have seen a negative change in in-village services than those who 		have seen a positive change. The perceptions of the officials and employees of 		the Alaska Native Medical Center and the Alaska Area Native Health Service have 		revealed problems in staff morale and shifts in workload resulting from Compact 		consigners transferring patients to the Alaska Native Medical Center who were 		previously treated outside the Anchorage Service Unit. These changes are 		considered as having a negative impact on the Anchorage Service Unit. The 		"microcosmic" view from the Ahtna Region indicates that there is a distinct 		difference in the perception of those who are participating in the Compact and 		those who are not. The analysis of the village respondent data, comparing the 		information that came from the Title III villages with the information from the 		Title I villages, further solidified the conclusion that individuals in 		villages that are not served by a Compact consigner hold a consistently more 		negative view than those who live in villages that are served by a Compact 		consigner. </p>
<p>The<i> <b>Prior Trauma Care 		of Intoxicated Patients as a Predictor of Subsequently Fatal Injury</b></i><b> 		</b>(6451) study was undertaken to identify intervention opportunities that are 		the result of nonfatal, alcohol-related injury contacts in emergency 		departments and clinics that could, over time, decrease alcohol-related injury 		deaths in the IHS area in Billings, Montana. The concept was to determine the 		frequency of injury treatment recidivism, both alcohol- and non-alcohol 		related, and further to determine if patterns can be established to suggest 		that injury death is predictable based on those previous nonfatal contacts. The 		findings indicate a high degree of recidivism and a strong correlation between 		nonfatal incidents and eventual injury death. This study further reveals that 		there is a high prevalence of alcohol in nonfatal injury-related incidents 		among this cohort. There appears to be a strong relationship between repeated 		episodes of nonfatal injury with alcohol as a contributing factor and 		subsequently fatal events among this cohort. These nonfatal episodes should 		serve as warning signals and opportunities for alcohol intervention strategies 		to take place. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluations in 		Progress</i></b> </p>
<p>The IHS currently has 		several major evaluations under way in the following general areas: the IHS 		Resource Requirement Methodology (RRM), aftercare services provided by IHS 		regional treatment centers, and effectiveness of alcohol and substance abuse 		services for American Indian and Alaska Native women. The IHS also has a number 		of smaller evaluations in progress at several area offices. </p>
<p>The <i><b>Elderly 		Wellness</b> </i>(6452) study focuses on collecting data to determine if 		providing health care and health promotion services specially designed for the 		elderly will increase their use of these services and ultimately improve their 		health status. Comprehensive care remains an unmet need for the elderly. Recent 		reviews show that less that 50 percent of the elderly population residing in 		the Fort Peck Service Unit (Billings, Montana, Area Office) has had a health 		care visit of any kind in the last two fiscal years. </p>
<p>The<i> <b>Cross Sectional 		Evaluation of the Prevalence of Childhood Obesity Among American Indians in the 		Aberdeen Area</b> </i>(6859)<i> </i>studies the trend in the prevalence of 		diabetes among American Indians in the Aberdeen, South Dakota area over a 		10-year period. Findings suggest that not only are diabetes prevalence rates 		increasing, but the gap is widening between Aberdeen, South Dakota area rates 		and national IHS rates. This study will establish baseline rates of childhood 		obesity and will facilitate early intervention efforts among 100 schools 		attended by Indian children. Obesity is the most important risk factor for 		diabetes in American Indian communities. The study results will be used by 		service unit directors and their staff (diabetes coordinators, public health 		nurses, and nutritionists) to assess their progress toward the <b><i>Healthy 		People 2000</i> </b>objectives and the Aberdeen Area Clinical Objectives to 		determine childhood obesity prevalence and plan primary prevention 		programs. </p>
<p>The <i><b>Evaluating the 		Effects of Medical Nutrition Therapy on Patient Outcomes Among Native Americans 		with Newly Diagnosed Type II Diabetes Mellitus</b> </i>(6746) study will 		evaluate the effectiveness of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) on 		clinical/behavioral outcomes of American Indians/Alaska Natives with newly 		diagnosed Type II diabetes. The evaluation will include the creation of a 		uniform methodology for collecting nutrition-oriented outcome data that is 		consistent among participating tribes, IHS service units, and urban programs. 		The outcome data will be analyzed to determine differences in the type and 		amount of MNT provided with regard to patient outcomes. They will also be 		linked with current clinical data from the IHS Diabetes Program that identifies 		continuous quality and performance improvement and measures. The analysis will 		also describe individual cases in which MNT has contributed to improved 		patients perceived quality of life. </p>
<p>The purpose of the 		<i><b>Evaluation of IHS Capacity for Epidemiologic Surveillance</b> </i>(6745) 		is to determine the epidemiologic surveillance capacity of the 		Indian/Tribal/Urban (I/T/U) health system and to make recommendations for 		improving the capacity to meet the needs of the IHS and its stakeholders. The 		IHS health care environment is undergoing unprecedented change; reorganizing, 		consolidating, and downsizing are part of the overall restructuring of services 		to its customers. Limited resources will be available to conduct epidemiologic 		surveillance, and the I/T/U health system will become more reliant on local 		capacity. The evaluation will be designed to collect data from a representative 		sample of IHS direct service providers, P.L. 93-638 contracts, self-governance 		compacts, and urban programs to determine the availability of epidemiological 		useful data and the capacity to perform disease surveillance and epidemiologic 		analyses of data at the local level. </p>
<p>The objective of the 		<i><b>Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Indian Health Service Alcohol and 		Substance Abuse Treatment Programs, Phase I</b> </i>(6744) is to evaluate the 		effectiveness of aftercare and continuing care services provided to youth and 		adult patients who have received treatment for alcohol and substance abuse at a 		primary treatment facility, a regional treatment center, or other IHS-funded 		program. The study will examine the availability, accessibility, acceptability, 		and cost of community-based followup services, as well as the potential for 		coordinating and integrating these services with the other aspects of alcohol 		and substance abuse treatment, such as detoxification, residential treatment, 		and halfway houses<b><i>. </i></b>The purpose of Phase I is to develop a 		methodology to assess the effectiveness of the IHS-sponsored 		aftercare/continuing care program to meet the needs of tribal and urban 		programs<b><i>. </i></b>Phase II will include a national assessment to measure 		the outcomes of aftercare and continuing care services attained by 		patients/clients of alcohol/substance abuse treatment programs in a 		representative sample of Indian communities that have IHS-sponsored alcohol and 		substance abuse programs. The study will include recommendations and an 		implementation plan to improve aftercare/continuing care services in Indian 		communities. </p>
<p>In the early 1970s, the IHS 		formulated the Resource Requirements Methodology (RRM) as a management tool to 		provide a comprehensive, systematic, and uniform process for estimating the 		level of resource requirements necessary to provide adequate health care to IHS 		customers and to assist in the allocation of unearmarked resources. To reaffirm 		the purpose of the RRM, a 1995 study determined the validity and accuracy of 		the present methodology for use in today's health care environment. The study 		findings support the need to update the current methodology to meet the future 		program demands of the IHS. The <i><b>Resource Requirement Methodology 		Update</b> </i>(6450) will include a complete revision and documentation of the 		RRM and will consist of the following phases: (1) Update Staffing Criteria and 		Modules, (2) Formulate Needs Assessment Cost Model, and (3) Needs Assessment 		Model Training. </p>
<p>The <i><b>Evaluation of 		Indian Health Service-Supported Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment Program 		for American Indian/Alaska Native Women</b> </i>(6201) is part of a four-phase 		evaluation of alcohol and substance abuse services for adult American Indian 		and Alaska Native women in alcohol and other drug treatment centers that are 		funded by the IHS. Phases I and II of this study were completed; a report was 		prepared in December 1995. The primary objectives of this project are to assess 		and measure the treatment services provided; to describe the organization and 		provision of substance abuse treatment and aftercare services available for 		adult American Indian and Alaska Native women; and to identify common 		strengths, problems, and recommendations for improvement<b><i>. </i></b>Phase I 		of this effort focused on designing the study, and Phase II collected 		descriptive data on the women who use IHS-sponsored substance abuse treatment 		centers<b><i>. </i></b>Phase III will be a prospective client outcomes study, 		and Phase IV<b><i> </i></b>will consist of an evaluation of the efficacy of 		IHS-funded treatment centers. </p>
<p><b><i>Development of a 		Health Services Research Agenda for American Indian and Alaska Native 		Populations </i></b>(6153)<i>. </i>The IHS and the Agency for Health Care 		Policy and Research co-sponsored a health services research conference as a 		first step in a long-term agenda-setting process to identify the most important 		health services research issues facing American Indian and Alaska Native 		communities and their health care systems over the next 5 to 10 years. The 		health services research agenda is intended to promote collaboration between 		American Indians and Alaska Native organizations, tribal and urban health 		systems, medical communities, foundations, and government agencies to increase 		communications and produce research information on health program services for 		American Indian and Alaska Native patients. The health services research agenda 		is also intended to provide a forum for discussing health care reform changes 		that are creating new directions in the Indian health care 		system. </p>
<p>Malignant neoplasm survival 		rates for well-defined American Indian populations are scarce. Although a 		national cancer surveillance system is in place, information relevant to Native 		Americans in the Northern Plains is not available. The <i><b>Evaluation of 		Available Cancer Surveillance Systems for Montana Native Americans and 		Correlates of Decreased Cancer Survival Among Native Americans in Montana</b> 		</i>(5944) will examine the utility of the IHS Resource and Patient Management 		System and the Montana Central Tumor Registry as a cancer surveillance system 		for the Native Americans in Montana. The results of this evaluation may 		determine the current level of cancer detection and treatment for Montana 		Native Americans compared to non-Native Americans in the same region. The 		development of health promotion and disease prevention activities requires an 		efficient surveillance system and knowledge of the current deficiencies and 		strengths of the current system. A better understanding of the sites of late 		stage cancer at diagnosis will help providers direct education and early 		detection efforts to Montana Native Americans. </p>
<p>The <i><b>Study of the 		Interaction of Persons Treated for Alcoholism with the Health Care Delivery 		System</b> </i>(6742) will evaluate the results of alcohol treatment for 		American Indians who abuse alcohol, focusing on the overall health care 		delivery system. The evaluation design and methodology will be developed and 		applied to the population served by the Crow Agency Service Unit. Data 		retrieval, audit instruments, and analytical strategies will be piloted for two 		years. </p>

              <p><b>MISSION: To sponsor and 		conduct medical research that leads to better health for all 		Americans.</b> </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation 		Program</i></b> </p>
<p>The National Institutes of 		Health (NIH) generates scientific knowledge that leads to improved health. This 		is done by conducting medical research in its intramural laboratories and by 		supporting research in universities, medical and health professional schools, 		and other health research organizations. NIH fosters the widespread 		dissemination of the results of medical research, facilitates the training of 		research investigators, and ensures the viability of the research 		infrastructure. The NIH Evaluation Program is an integral part of how NIH 		sponsors and conducts medical research. </p>
<p>The complexities and 		challenges of evaluating and assessing fundamental science have become more 		widely recognized as science agencies have begun implementation of the 		Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). The GPRA stresses the use of 		evaluation to develop measures for reporting on program results. However, 		measures for evaluating the results of fundamental science have limitations. 		These are discussed in the March 1997 General Accounting Office report, 		<b><i>Measuring Performance: Strengths and Limitations of Research 		Indicators</i>.</b> The report compares private versus public research and 		discusses the strengths and limitations of indicators used to measure research. 		The NIH evaluation program is addressing these challenges as part of its 		strategy for implementing the GPRA. </p>
<p><b><i>Philosophy and 		Priorities</i></b> </p>
<p>The NIH Evaluation Program 		provides information to assist the NIH Director and Institute, Center, and 		Division (ICD) Directors in determining whether NIH goals and objectives are 		being achieved and to help guide policy development and program direction. 		Evaluations are planned and conducted from two sources of funds: 1-percent 		set-aside evaluation funds used to fund trans-NIH projects, and ICD program 		funds used for program evaluations for use by various committees, working 		groups, task forces, workshops, conferences, and symposia to assist the ICD in 		program management and development. This approach ensures that planning and 		priority setting specific to the mission of each ICD are fully developed and 		implemented and that there is central leadership for developing crosscutting 		initiatives and promoting collaboration among the ICDs. </p>
<p>NIH's major evaluation 		priority areas fall within three broad program areas: basic research, research 		training and career development, and facilities maintenance. These broad 		program areas form the basis for the strategies and activities that NIH 		undertakes to achieve the goals identified in the GPRA planning 		process. </p>
<p><b><i>Policies and 		Operations</i></b> </p>
<p>A distinguishing feature of 		the NIH Evaluation Program is the utilization of a variety of evaluation 		strategies that include the use of national advisory councils, boards of 		scientific counselors, consensus development conferences, and ad hoc committees 		that help to chart scientific directions and select the most promising research 		to support. </p>
<p>A two-tier system is used 		to review project requests that will use 1-percent evaluation set-aside 		funding. The first tier involves a review and recommendations by the NIH 		Technical Merit Review Committee (TMRC) on the technical aspects of project 		proposals and whether a project fits within HHS guidelines for use of the 		set-aside fund. The second tier involves the NIH Evaluation Policy Oversight 		Committee (EPOC), which considers TMRC recommendations, conducts policy level 		reviews, and makes final funding recommendations to the NIH Director or his 		designee. </p>
<p><b><i>Summary of Fiscal 		Year 1997 Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p>Completed evaluations 		addressed a cross-section of the NIH research program, training, and career 		development. Three of the NIH evaluations completed are highlighted 		below. </p>
<p>A blue-ribbon panel of 		experts, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Intramural Research 		Program Planning Committee (IRPPC), was charged with evaluating and, as 		necessary, redefining the role of the Intramural Research Program (IRP) in 		fulfilling the mission of the NIMH. The IRPPC report, <i><b>Finding the 		Balance: Report of the National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research 		Program (IRP) Planning Committee</b> </i>(6697),<b><i> </i></b>provided the 		NIMH Director and Scientific Director with tools for fundamental renewal of the 		IRP. For example, the IRPPC recommended the consolidation of the Neuroscience 		Center of St. Elizabeth's Hospital with the NIMH IRP program at the Bethesda 		campus. Such a consolidation will provide better access to the special 		facilities the Bethesda campus offers, more opportunities for collaboration, 		and better access to patients. </p>
<p>Insuring a strong 		scientific infrastructure-- </p>
<p>with a suitable talent base 		of highly qualified, highly trained, and diverse investigators capable of 		yielding the scientific discoveries of the future--and excellent research 		facilities is essential for medical progress. To increase the number of 		underrepresented minorities entering careers in biomedical research, the 		National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) established two 		"bridges" programs to encourage minority students to go beyond the associate 		degree to obtain the bachelor's degree, or beyond the masters degree to obtain 		a doctorate. NIGMS established an Electronic Student Tracking and Reporting 		system to capture the information needed to assess the educational outcomes of 		students participating in the Bridges Program. The results from this 		evaluation, <i><b>Evaluation of the Bridges to the Future Program</b> 		</i>(6093), indicated relatively high rates of transfer from 2-year to 4-year 		institutions, or from M.S. to Ph.D. programs, when compared to national norms. 		As a result, NIGMS is continuing support of this program. </p>
<p>To examine how research 		results translate into practice, <b><i>A Study to Determine the Changes of 		Physician Prescribing of Antimicrobial Agents, Omeprazole, and 		H<sub>2</sub>-Receptor Antagonists for Peptic Ulcer</i></b><i> <b>Disease Two 		Years Following the NIH Consensus Conference on </b></i><b>Helicobacter 		Pylori</b> (6284) was designed to evaluate the effect of the consensus 		conference in prescribing patterns of physicians for the treatment of peptic 		ulcer disease (PUD), focusing on prescriptions for antimicrobial and 		antisecretory agents and H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists. In particular, the 		study focused on whether the recommendations of a February 1994 NIH Consensus 		Development Conference advocating the use of antimicrobial agents for PUD 		patients with <b><i>H. pylori</i></b> infection were coincident with a change 		in physician prescribing patterns. The study revealed that two years after the 		highly publicized conference on the eradication of <b><i>H. pylori</i>,</b> 		antimicrobial agents were not widely prescribed for the treatment of PUD within 		the Pennsylvania Medicaid population. The need to eradicate <b><i>H. pylori</i> 		</b>to reduce and, ultimately, eliminate the recurrence of PUD in association 		with the findings of this research suggest that physicians in this specific 		population do not appear to be using national recommendations based on 		state-of-the-art information and clinical studies pertaining to PUD, as 		presented by the NIH. Restricting the study to Medicare patients limits its 		generalizability and could be related to issues of equity and quality of care 		for a disadvantaged population. If findings indicate significant cost savings 		associated with the use of the NIH recommended drug regimens in the treatment 		of PUD, this approach could be applicable to other populations. 		</p>
<p>Other NIH evaluations were 		completed on the following topics: the status of biomedical research facilities 		(3562.2); National Research Service Award Research Training Programs (5571); 		the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) article citation and 		patent references study (5577); the Rare Disease Clinical Research Database 		(6043); laboratory animal use, facilities, and resources (6048); promoting safe 		and effective genetic testing (6090); user satisfaction of the Physician Data 		Query data base (6092); research instrumentation needs (6121); toxicology and 		environmental health information resources (6534); evaluation of the 		international cooperative bio-diversity groups (6641); and the Federal 		Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics (6652). </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluations in 		Progress</i></b> </p>
<p>NIH has over two dozen 		evaluation projects in progress, as listed in Appendix B. Several of the major 		evaluations, soon to be completed, are summarized below. </p>
<p>An ongoing study that will 		provide information in the research program area is the <b><i>Surgeon General's 		Report on Oral Health</i> </b>(6861). This study will provide information on 		how the public health elements of education, daily preventive self-care, and 		collaboration between individuals and their care providers can help produce a 		high level of health in a particular area. In spite of tremendous oral health 		progress throughout the last five decades, data demonstrate that results are 		distributed unevenly across populations. There still remain populations and 		communities with devastating levels of oral, dental, and craniofacial diseases. 		This report will identify specific steps that individuals and communities can 		take to improve their oral health status. </p>
<p>Another study under way in 		the research program area is a project titled,<i> <b>Evaluation of 		Simplification of the Human Resources Management System at the National 		Institutes of Health</b></i> (6862)<i>. </i>The Secretary has designated NIH as 		a pilot project for a period of 5 years to simplify personnel management and 		personnel administration policies and procedures. The main platform for the 		evaluation is the delegation of human resources management requirements and 		responsibilities; the long-range thrust is to strengthen NIH management and 		integrate human resources management into strategic planning. The evaluation 		seeks to determine the linkage between the impact of the human resources 		management delegations and the achievement of major NIH goals, such as 		advancing research to improve health and prevent disease. </p>
<p>An ongoing study that will 		provide information in the research training and career development area is, 		<i><b>Study of National Needs for Biomedical and Behavioral Research 		Personnel</b> </i>(6860). This congressionally-mandated study determines the 		overall national need for research personnel in the biomedical, behavioral, and 		clinical sciences; and assesses the efforts of the National Research Service 		Awards (NRSA) programs in ensuring an adequate supply of qualified 		investigators. Earlier studies have included recommendations concerning both 		the number of NRSA research training positions needed in the future and the 		importance of systematic program monitoring and assessment. These 		recommendations have been used by NIH in formulating program priorities and 		budget requests, and by the Congress during the appropriations process. For 		example, it is not uncommon for congressional appropriations reports to cite 		the number of positions recommended by this study and to appropriate funds 		accordingly. </p>
<p>In the facilities area, NIH 		collaborates with the National Science Foundation (NSF) to assess the condition 		of existing facilities and identify needs for new and refurbished research 		facilities nationwide. Since its inception in 1988, the biennial <i><b>Survey 		of Scientific and Engineering Research Facilities at Colleges and 		Universities</b> </i>(6863), prepared jointly by NIH and NSF, has provided 		considerable data on the amount, condition, and capital project activity by the 		Nation's research-performing institutions. For example, the <i><b>1996 Status 		of Biomedical Facilities</b> </i>reports that 47 percent of all biomedical 		research-performing institutions classified the amount of biological science 		research space as inadequate, and 51 percent indicated that they had an 		inadequate amount of medical science research space. </p>

              <p><b>OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT 		SECRETARY FOR PLANNING AND EVALUATION</b> </p>
<p><b>MISSION: To provide 		analytical support and advice to the Secretary on policy development and assist 		the Secretary with the development and coordination of departmentwide program 		planning and evaluation activities.</b> </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation 		Program</i></b> </p>
<ul><li> The Assistant Secretary 		  for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) functions as a principal advisor to the 		  Secretary on policy development and, in this capacity, conducts a variety of 		  evaluation and policy research studies on issues of national importance. ASPE 		  also is responsible for departmentwide coordination of legislative, planning, 		  and evaluation activities. In its evaluation coordination role, ASPE has the 		  following tasks:</li>
<li> Provide annual guidance 		  to all HHS agencies and staff offices regarding evaluation priorities, 		  procedures, and review requirements.</li>
<li> Review evaluation 		  priorities proposed by HHS agencies, providing advice about the focus or method 		  of proposed projects and identifying opportunities for collaboration, and 		  effective use of resources.</li>
<li> Prepare planning and 		  summary reports on evaluation activities as required by 		  Congress.</li>
</ul><p>Through the departmental 		evaluation planning process, ASPE has the capacity to identify crosscutting 		program or policy issues of particular concern to the Secretary and specific 		program and policy areas not covered by the HHS Agency evaluation plans. In 		these instances, ASPE initiates evaluations or collaborates with the agencies 		to conduct evaluations or policy assessments. For example, in recent years, 		ASPE has initiated projects to develop cost estimates for health financing 		issues in general, and specifically for the Medicare and Medicaid programs; the 		effects of managed care expansion on public health infrastructure; 		welfare-to-work approaches; long-term care alternatives; and studies evaluating 		alternative services for children at risk of harm from drug abuse, crime, child 		abuse, and other pathologies. </p>
<p>Another continuing 		evaluation objective of ASPE is to support and promote the development and 		improvement of data bases that HHS agencies and ASPE use to evaluate health 		care programs and health trends. For example, ASPE has been the major initiator 		in collaboration with the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers 		for Disease Control and Prevention of the first comprehensive survey of people 		with disabilities in the United States. The first component of these new data 		was completed in FY 1996, and national prevalence data on disability are now 		available. The ASPE co-chairs and provides support to the HHS Data Council, 		which is charged with integrating key national surveys, such as linking health 		status indicators with indicators of well-being. The Department needs more 		comprehensive data sources to assess anticipated transformations in health and 		human services. </p>
<p>Finally, ASPE uses 		evaluation funds to promote effective use of evaluation-generated information 		in program management and policymaking. The latter is accomplished through the 		dissemination of evaluation findings and other activities, such as providing 		technical assistance to agencies in the development of performance 		measures. </p>
<p><b><i>Summary of Fiscal 		Year 1997 Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p>During FY 1997, ASPE 		completed a wide range of studies and reports on many issues, providing 		information useful to the Secretary and the HHS divisions for program planning 		and budget and legislative development. </p>
<p><b><i>Health 		Policy</i></b> </p>
<p><b><i>Market Barriers to 		the Development of Pharmacotherapies for the Treatment of Cocaine Abuse and 		Addiction Final Report</i></b> (6694) presents an analysis of the market 		barriers to development of pharmacotherapies for substance abuse and addiction, 		particularly for abuse of and addiction to cocaine. The study examined the 		development of pharmacotherapies for cocaine abusers in light of the size of 		the potential market, market penetration estimates, and the basic relationships 		between price, market size, and revenues. The report outlines several critical 		market barriers that must be taken into account. The substance abuse treatment 		market relies heavily on State and Federal reimbursement. Most substance abuse 		treatment services are subsumed under the mental health benefits of entitlement 		programs, and drug companies are reluctant to rely upon this kind of 		reimbursement in an age of shrinking budgets for mental health 		services. </p>
<p><b><i>Public Health 		Laboratories and Health Systems Change</i></b> (6458) explored how the 		relationships among public health laboratories, managed care organizations, and 		other stakeholders in the laboratory services market have recently changed and 		the implications of these changes for Federal and State governments. The 		dynamic health care environment is posing many new challenges for public health 		laboratories. Changes in both the public and private sectors have made it 		increasingly difficult for public health laboratories to fulfill their mission. 		In the private sector, managed care and independent laboratories are expanding; 		hospital-based laboratories are consolidating; and private sector laboratories 		are experiencing rapid technological change, both in a clinical sense and in 		information processing. In the public sector, public health laboratories are 		experiencing a redefinition of the public health safety net, with greater 		reliance on managed care to address public health needs and shrinking budgets 		as State coffers have decreased. </p>
<p><b><i>Assessment of 		Performance Measures for Public Health, Substance Abuse, and Mental 		Health</i></b> (6177). ASPE formed the Panel on Performance Measures and Data 		for Public Health Performance Partnership Grants (PPGs) to examine the 		state-of-the-art in performance measurement for public health and to recommend 		measures that could be used to monitor the PPG agreements to be negotiated 		between each State and the Federal Government. Performance measures were 		identified in ten public health areas: chronic diseases, sexually transmitted 		diseases (STDs), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, tuberculosis 		(TB), mental health, immunization, substance abuse, sexual assault, 		disabilities, and emergency medical services. More than 3,200 measures were 		proposed to the panel through various outreach efforts. The panel used the 		following four guidelines to assess the measures: (1) the measure should be 		specific and result oriented; (2) the measure should be meaningful and 		understandable; (3) data should be adequate to support the measure; and (4) the 		measure should be valid, reliable, and responsive. The panel found that many 		Federal efforts to collect health-related data provide national rates, but many 		do not collect data that provide State-level rates, and that much State-level 		data may not be comparable. </p>
<p><b><i>Information Needs 		Associated with the Changing Organization and Delivery of Health Care: Summary 		of Perceptions, Activities, Key Gaps, and Priorities</i></b> (6388) reports on 		unmet needs for supply-side information (information provided by health care 		suppliers and insurers) on the health system, focusing on helping HHS identify 		how information needs associated with a changing health care system are 		perceived by a wide variety of user groups and constituencies. Based on 		information gathered from over 50 individuals and from a review of relevant 		literature and Web sites, the report examines perceived gaps, their causes, and 		the activities generated in response to those perceptions. The report 		identifies 23 ongoing efforts within the private sector, States, and 		foundations to address these gaps, and studies 11 of these more thoroughly. The 		study concludes that private sector stakeholders and States cannot alone 		sufficiently address supply-side information needs, giving importance to 		Federal leadership and convening functions. </p>
<p><i><b>State Regulatory 		Experience with Provider-Sponsored Organizations: Final Report</b> 		</i>(6628) describes 		the experience of selected State governments in regulating provider-owned 		health care delivery systems that accept insurance risk for the provision or 		arrangement of health care services (provider-sponsored organizations, or 		PSOs). The States included in the study are California, Colorado, Illinois, 		Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington. The report finds 		that the two models that States use to regulate the activities of PSOs 		contracting directly with purchasers of health care (e.g., employers) are (1) 		licensing the organizations as they would a nonprovider-owned entity, and (2) 		creating a separate licensing category for risk-assuming PSOs. The study found 		that the States vary considerably in their regulation of PSOs that assume risk 		from self-funded, ERISA-exempt employer plans, and concludes that since State 		policy toward PSOs is still in the early stages of development, the lessons to 		be learned by Federal policymakers are limited. </p>
<p><b><i>Establishing an 		Analytical Framework for Measuring the Role of Reinsurance in the Health 		Insurance Market</i></b> (6573). Reinsurance is widely used by underwriters of 		health benefits to limit their risk exposure. Reinsurance contracts can be 		structured in many ways, and insurers can use reinsurance to limit their risk 		for an individual contract or exposure, for a group of contracts or exposures, 		or for a whole portion of the insurer's business. This report presents a 		limited analytical study of the level of risk borne by reinsurers in three 		markets: the indemnity insurance market, the managed care market, and the 		self-insured employer benefit plan market. The purpose of the study is to 		determine to what extent these data can be used to measure the role of 		reinsurance in the various markets and to suggest ways whereby better 		assessments of reinsurance might be made. The report was generally unable to 		identify either data sources or existing research allowing quantification of 		the risk being ceded to reinsurers in the three markets. While a substantial 		amount of information is available about reinsurance in indemnity (non-HMO) 		health insurers, the data are aggregated in ways that make it difficult to 		specifically identify transactions related to primary health insurance offered 		to groups and individuals. </p>
<p><i><b>A Framework for 		Assessing Insurer Responses to Health Care Market Changes</b> 		</i>(6572). Where 		once a few large commercial carriers dominated the market with fee-for-service 		plans, there are now dozens of plans in most markets. In highly competitive 		markets, plans and carriers develop more sophisticated strategies and 		arrangements to identify and retain target markets. To better 		</p>
<p>integrate government 		programs and develop public policy, the variations and rationales for insurers' 		business strategies need to be better understood. This project developed an 		analytical framework for analyzing insurer behavior, responses to insurance 		market reforms, and the likely impact of insurer behavior on the availability 		and cost of insurance. </p>
<p><b><i>Deriving State-Level 		Estimates From Three National Surveys: A Statistical Assessment and State 		Tabulations</i></b> (6380)<i>. </i>HHS programs are rapidly changing their 		focus from the national to the State level. Federal roles and responsibilities 		traditionally played by HHS will be dramatically altered. Recent events bear 		this out. Landmark legislation eliminating entitlement to Aid to Families with 		Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits and block granting it to the States was just 		passed. States have vast new flexibility to administer Medicaid as the result 		of the 1115 waivers. The basic data needed to address departmental policy and 		research issues have typically come from major, national, Federally-sponsored 		population-based surveys, which are designed to provide national (not State) 		estimates. This project focused on three major Federal surveys--the Survey of 		Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the Current Population Survey (CPS), 		and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)--selected for their widespread 		applicability, use, and potential for analyzing policy issues. The purpose of 		this project was to (1) understand the statistical issues involved in 		addressing policy and research questions at the State level with national 		survey data; (2) assess the current capabilities of these three major surveys 		to provide answers to these questions at the State level; and (3) present 		options for obtaining valid reliable State-level data from relatively minimal 		enhancements and changes to survey design. </p>
<p><i><b>Improving Health in 		the Community: A Role for Performance Monitoring</b> </i> 		(6583) draws on lessons from a number of 		current community health efforts to outline the elements of a community health 		improvement process, discusses the role that performance monitoring can play in 		this process, and proposes tools to help communities develop performance 		indicators. The report finds that a community health improvement process (CHIP) 		can be an important tool for developing a shared vision and supporting a 		planned and integrated approach to improving community health. The report 		suggests that a CHIP should include two principal interacting cycles based on 		analysis, action, and measurement. The first is a problem identification and 		prioritization cycle; the second is an analysis and implementation 		cycle. </p>
<p><b><i>Privacy and Health 		Research: A Report to the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services</i></b> 		(6605) identifies privacy issues surrounding research on personally 		identifiable health data, paying special attention to the international 		aspects; reviews the ethical, legal, and general social context surrounding the 		privacy and confidentiality of health data; describes relevant 		privacy-protection practices and problems, and identifies emerging issues; 		analyzes the implications of the new European Union Data Privacy Directive and 		related policy and legal changes; and recommends policy approaches and 		technical processes for ensuring that the privacy of individuals is respected. 		The report examines four major groups of issues that are growing rapidly in 		scale and complexity, and that must be urgently attended to: (1) secondary uses 		of data and data linking, (2) research on private-sector health data, (3) 		cybersecurity, and (4) genetic privacy. The international flow of data, new 		health data privacy laws in Europe, the United States' new Health Insurance 		Portability and Accountability Act, and the need for dialogue between the 		United States and Europe are also examined in detail. </p>
<p><b><i>Disability, Aging and 		Long-Term Care Policy</i></b> </p>
<p><b><i>State Assisted Living 		Policy: 1996</i></b> (4719.3) describes assisted living facilities as an 		expanding source of supportive housing and services that represent a new model 		of long-term care. Consumer choice and control are central to assisted living 		models, which seek to allow consumers to control key features of their living 		environments and to direct their own receipt of services. This study reviews 		policies on assisted living and board and care in each of the 50 States. One of 		the major difficulties associated with assisted living is the lack of a common 		or standard definition of this kind of care. The report provides specific 		information about policies in each State. </p>
<p><i><b>The Role of Home and 		Community-Based Services in Meeting the Health Care Needs of People with AIDS: 		Literature Review</b> </i> 		(6418.1) provides an overview of the 		literature (published since 1991) describing the delivery and financing of 		home- and community-based services for people with AIDS. The review draws 		inferences from literature on the provision of these services to these elderly 		for their potential application to the AIDS population. </p>
<p><i><b>Consumer-Directed 		Personal Assistance Services: Key Operational Issues for State CD-PAS Programs 		Using Intermediary Service Organizations</b> </i> 		(6728). This project examined approaches 		and solutions for implementing consumer-directed service models for the 		delivery of home and community-based personal assistance services (PAS) for 		persons with disabilities. It addressed issues in this area arising from 		regulatory compliance requirements as well as issues concerning potential tort 		liability faced by payers, consumers, and providers of these services. The 		project included case studies of up to 20 programs that use a variety of 		intermediaries and the services they provide; meetings with Federal officials 		to identify and discuss tax and labor regulations affecting PAS providers and 		consumers; and development of model contracts of Federal regulations and 		requirements in clear, simple, and accurate terms. </p>
<p><b><i>Human Services 		Policy</i></b> </p>
<p><i><b>Evaluating Two 		Welfare-to-Work Program Approaches: Two-Year Findings on the Labor Force 		Attachment and Human Capital Development Programs in Three Sites</b> 		</i>(6576.1) 		examines the relative strengths and limitations of particular versions of the 		labor force attachment (LFA) strategy and human capital development (HCD) 		strategies. It includes the findings from one part of a multi-year, 7-site 		evaluation and draws on the advantages of a unique experimental design 		implemented in three sites: Atlanta, Georgia; Grand Rapids, Michigan; and 		Riverside, California. The evaluation had its origins in the Family Support Act 		of 1988, which marked a major shift in the philosophy of welfare by 		establishing a system of mutual obligation--between government and 		recipients--within the AFDC entitlement structure. The report is part of a 		larger study called the National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies 		(formerly known as the JOBS Evaluation). It contains an analysis of the 		implementation, participation patterns, and costs of the two types of programs 		operated in each site and an assessment of the effectiveness of the LFA and HCD 		program approaches in promoting employment and reducing welfare. 		</p>
<p><b><i>Setting the Baseline: 		A Report on State Welfare Waivers</i></b> (6651). The Personal Responsibility 		and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 eliminated the 		entitlement to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and replaced it 		with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a block grant that States 		can use to provide cash and services to low-income families with children. This 		report is one in a series designed to provide baseline information on the AFDC 		program as it existed prior to enactment of the new law. The report focuses on 		the waivers of AFDC requirements that were granted to States in the years 		preceding enactment of PRWORA. It provides an overview of the types of waivers 		that States requested and received, and provides details on specific State 		policies. </p>
<p><i><b>Approaches to 		Evaluating Welfare Reform: Lessons from Five State Demonstrations</b> 		</i>(6050). Prior to 		the enactment of PRWORA, many States obtained waivers from AFDC and Food Stamp 		Program rules in order to implement welfare reform. Between 1993 and 1996, the 		Clinton administration approved waivers for 43 States. This project examined 		waiver demonstration projects in five States (California, Colorado, Michigan, 		Minnesota, and Wisconsin). Four of the five States used an experimental 		evaluation design, while the fifth State used a quasi-experimental evaluation 		design. The report addresses issues in five areas: (1) the choice between an 		experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation design, (2) sample design, (3) 		implementation of experimental evaluations, (4) data collection, and (5) 		analytical methods. </p>
<p><b><i>Implementing Welfare 		Reform Requirements for Teenage Parents: Lessons from Experience in Four 		States</i></b> (6228)<i>. </i>Federal welfare policy requires minor custodial 		parents receiving cash assistance to attend school and to live with their 		parents or in an adult-supervised setting. These requirements were established 		as part of the PRWORA, which created the program for Temporary Assistance for 		Needy Families (TANF) and abolished the Aid to Families with Dependent Children 		(AFDC) program. This report summarizes lessons learned from the operational 		experiences in four States (Arizona, California, Massachusetts, and Virginia) 		that implemented waivers requiring school attendance and certain living 		arrangements under the AFDC program. </p>
<p><b><i>Determinants of AFDC 		Caseload Growth: Final Report </i></b>(5953)<i>. </i>This project examined the 		dynamics of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) caseload growth and 		analyzed the effects of economic, demographic, and programmatic changes at the 		State level on States' AFDC caseload from the early 1980's to the present. The 		project addressed the interaction of these factors by analyzing the economic, 		demographic, and programmatic factors simultaneously. Compared to earlier 		studies of AFDC caseload determinants, many of which are outdated, this study 		focused much more on State-level indicators, and included a more comprehensive 		set of economic, demographic, and programmatic factors. </p>
<p><i><b>Indicators of Welfare 		Dependence and Well-Being: Interim Report to Congress</b> 		</i>(6634)<i>. 		</i>The Welfare Indicators Act of 1994 directed the Secretary of Health and 		Human Services to conduct a study to determine which statistics would be most 		useful in tracking and predicting dependence on three means-tested cash and 		nutritional assistance programs: Aid to Families with Dependent Children 		(AFDC), Food Stamps, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Enactment of the 		PRWORA of 1996 makes this task even more important. The report recommends two 		kinds of indicators: indicators of dependence, self-sufficiency, and family 		conditions; and indicators of child achievement, health, and well-being. In 		most cases, the recommended indicators should be tabulated separately for 		children, male non-elderly adults, female non-elderly adults, and other 		important population subgroups wherever possible. To measure dependence, 		self-sufficiency, and family conditions, the report recommends that indicators 		reflect points on a continuum, from total dependence to complete 		self-sufficiency. </p>
<p><b><i>Iowa's Limited 		Benefit Plan </i></b>(6390)<i>. </i>Iowa's Family Investment Program (FIP) 		replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in 1993. FIP 		participants who are able-bodied and not caring for young children--yet who do 		not develop and carry out a Family Investment Agreement (FIA)--are sanctioned 		with assignment to the Limited Benefit Plan (LBP). Some clients may also choose 		LBP over FIP. LBP originally provided 3 months of benefits at FIP levels, 		followed by 3 months of reduced levels and 6 months of no cash benefits; the 		program was later changed to eliminate the original 3-month period. At the end 		of the 6-month period, the client can reapply for FIP, but must meet its 		requirements. This report presents findings from a study of the original LBP, 		showing how families enter the LBP and how their well-being changes after 		benefits are cut. It examines records for over 4,200 cases assigned to LBP 		records during 6 months in 1994 and 1995, a survey of 137 cases whose cash 		benefits were terminated, and case studies of 12 LBP families. The authors note 		that there are several features of the LBP program that mitigate against 		extreme deprivation when cash assistance has been terminated, and that the 		absence of these safeguards in a national welfare reform program could result 		in extreme hardship for many families. </p>
<p><b><i>Family and Children's 		Social Services Policy</i></b> </p>
<p><b><i>Informal and Formal 		Kinship Care</i></b> (6016). A growing number of States prefer to place 		children who have been removed from their homes of origin in the home of a 		relative. This practice is known as kinship foster care and it is a growing 		component of family foster care. It comprises between one-third and one-half of 		all foster care days provided in the States with the largest foster care 		populations. This study uses several data sources to examine the 		characteristics of informal kinship care arrangements and how they compare with 		those initiated through or subsidized by the State child welfare system. It 		considers national patterns, examines living arrangement patterns by State for 		1990, compares formal and informal kinship care in four States, and uses data 		from Illinois to provide a more focused picture of kinship care. 		</p>
<p><i><b>Trends in the 		Well-Being of America's Children and Youth: 1997</b> </i> 		(6170.1). This is the second edition of 		an annual report on the well-being of children and youth in the United States. 		The report's purpose is to provide the policy community, the media, and all 		interested citizens with a statistical overview describing the condition of 		children. The report focuses on trends in the well-being of children and youth 		in 5 areas: (1) population, family, and neighborhood; (2) economic security; 		(3) health conditions and health care; (4) social development, behavioral 		health, and teen fertility; and (5) education and achievement. 		</p>
<p><i><b>Efforts by Child 		Welfare Agencies to Address Domestic Violence: The Experiences of Five 		Communities</b> </i> 		(6155). Historically, child protective services and domestic violence 		services have not been closely linked. However, child welfare agencies across 		the country are beginning to consider how families in their child protection 		caseload are affected by domestic violence and are re-examining their policies 		accordingly. This report documents how child welfare agencies in five 		communities (Massachusetts; Michigan; San Diego County, California; Hilo, 		Hawaii; and Oregon) are attempting to integrate domestic violence concerns into 		their services. The communities were chosen for study because they are 		extending their services well beyond educating staff in domestic violence 		concerns. The report includes a discussion and evaluation of approaches to 		addressing domestic violence within child welfare agencies; the role of the 		larger community in preventing domestic violence; and more complex policy 		questions, such as whether a child's witnessing of domestic violence is itself 		abusive. </p>
<p><i><b>Evaluability 		Assessment of Responsible Fatherhood Programs</b> </i> 		(6159). Responsible fatherhood programs 		provide fathers, particularly those who are young, unmarried, and unemployed, 		with the support and skills to become active participants in their children's 		lives. An increased interest in fatherhood programs and a lack of information 		on their accessibility and effectiveness led to this evaluability assessment. 		The study visited five fatherhood program sites to assess the readiness of the 		programs for outcome evaluation and to determine the evaluation process and 		mechanisms necessary for a full evaluation. </p>
<p><i><b>Chapin Hall Center 		for Children at the University of Chicago: Administrative Data Guide</b> 		</i>(6389). This 		report is a guide to administrative data resources on health, social services, 		and related programs available through the Chapin Hall Center for Children at 		the University of Chicago. Each data section in the guide provides an overview 		of a particular data set. Included is information to assist the researcher in 		interpreting the data sections. The guide was designed for use by an audience 		of informed policy analysts in order to consider what data are available to 		answer particular policy questions. ASPE will use the guide to better design 		short-turnaround analyses on a variety of topics of current policy 		interest. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluations in 		Progress</i></b> </p>
<p>ASPE's evaluations in 		progress cover a broad range of program and policy areas. In health policy, 		ASPE is concentrating its efforts in the four areas described 		below. </p>
<p><b><i>Studying Changes in 		Health and Human Services Programs</i>.</b> 		 America's health care system is 		undergoing rapid and dramatic change. States are using a variety of laws (e.g., 		the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and PRWORA of 1996), as well as Medicaid and 		welfare policy waivers to make substantial changes to their welfare and health 		financing and delivery programs. In this area, ASPE's goal is to put into place 		mechanisms to assess the impact of such legislative changes, the interactive 		effects of waivers and changes in the law, and the effects of the rapidly 		changing private sector environment. ASPE is supplementing ongoing private 		sector and foundation efforts to create a baseline of health information at the 		State level with projects that will help define key measurements and themes 		with which to monitor the effect of both program changes and changes in the 		environment. For example, ASPE has projects under way to examine child health 		insurance patterns (6721) and innovative State strategies (6729) to insure 		children. </p>
<p><b><i>Understanding Private 		Sector Changes</i>.</b> 		 In recent years, rapid changes to health care in the private sector 		have transformed the landscape of health financing and service delivery 		systems. ASPE's goal is to understand the private sector environment in which 		HHS programs operate and to be able to describe and monitor ongoing changes. A 		better understanding of how the private sector works and the dynamics of these 		changes are essential to developing Federal policy. For example, ASPE is 		currently managing projects to evaluate the effects of "direct-to-consumer" 		advertising on consumer knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors concerning 		prescription drugs (6343) and innovative coverage of health promotion, clinical 		preventive services, and other coverage issues in the private sector 		(6347). </p>
<p>.<b><i>Improving Data and 		Analytic Capability.</i></b> Current projects that focus on describing, 		evaluating, and analyzing information to develop estimates for the 		decisionmaking process require resources for data collection and analytic 		capability. An actuarial services contract, for example, supports a wide range 		of analyses, including cost estimates related to legislation. In addition, the 		rapid evolution of the delivery system has created information gaps that need 		to be addressed in a comprehensive way. ASPE has several projects that are part 		of the HHS "Data Initiative," an effort to fill gaps in the data needed to 		analyze and monitor the health and well-being of the population, particularly 		given recent policy changes in HHS programs. This effort focuses on the need 		for State-level data, better linkages between health data and human service 		data, data on the impact of policy changes on the well-being of low-income 		children, and data on health care providers and the supply of employer-provided 		fringe benefits. For example, ASPE is exploring the linkage of data files from 		the National Health Interview Survey and the Survey of Income and Program 		Participation (6419) to be used in program evaluation. This effort emphasizes 		making better use of existing data. </p>
<p><b><i>Agency Related 		Priority Studies</i>.</b> 		 ASPE continues to collaborate with various HHS agencies on program 		evaluation and technical assistance. As resources continue to shrink, the need 		to develop and share information on program efficiency and effectiveness 		assumes even greater importance. For example, ASPE is working on a number of 		projects with the Public Health Service (PHS) agencies regarding the food 		additive review process (6342), Indian health programs (6345), and the role of 		enabling services in the provision of health care (6750). These continue a 		tradition of joint projects with both the PHS agencies, as well as with HCFA on 		Medicare and Medicaid payment policies such as a study of managed delivery 		systems for Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities and chronic illnesses 		(6391). </p>
<p>In the area of disability, 		aging, and long-term care issues, ASPE is focusing its efforts in several 		areas. </p>
<p><b><i>Disability, Aging, 		and Long-Term Care Trends</i>.</b> 		 ASPE has current projects to assess the 		profound demographic changes brought about by the aging population and the 		implications of these changes for active aging and health, long-term care, and 		retirement policies for the next century. ASPE is looking at the implications 		of disability for the Nation's health, long-term care and personal assistance, 		welfare, income security, housing, transportation, educational, civil rights, 		and employment policies. For example, one project is examining two large claims 		data sets to assess the health and long-term care expenditure patterns of 		children with disabilities (5758). Another project is reviewing information on 		how health insurance coverage and the particular provisions of health care 		policies are related to employment by people with disabilities. The review will 		consist of an examination of the available research literature on the 		relationship of health care coverage and employment among people with 		disabilities (6240). </p>
<p><b><i>Promoting Active 		Lifestyles and Maximum Independence</i>.</b> 		 More seniors and individuals with 		disabilities can and should be able to expect to lead active and productive 		lifestyles of their own choosing and direction than ever before in history. 		There is increasing evidence that disability rates among the elderly are 		falling. New advances in technology, the availability of personal assistance 		services in the community, and the stimulus of new civil rights are empowering 		individuals with disabilities to live independent lives. Through policy 		analysis and research and demonstration functions, ASPE is identifying what is 		known and what remains to be learned about how to assist children and adults 		with the full range of disabilities to become contributing members of their 		families, communities, and the Nation (6719). </p>
<p><b><i>Managed Care and 		People with Disabilities</i>.</b> 		 Managed care can provide unique 		opportunities, but it also has potential pitfalls for people with disabilities. 		ASPE has projects in progress to determine the impact of managed care on 		access, quality, and satisfaction for people of all ages who experience 		disabilities (6398). Of particular interest are two policy issues: (1) there is 		a concern about the impact of extending Medicaid managed care to the 		SSI-eligible disabled population, (2) the impact of managed care on elderly 		persons with physical and cognitive impairments needs to be examined. 		Evaluation of a comprehensive program for capitating acute and long-term care 		services for children with disabilities will be initiated. </p>
<p><b><i>Assisted 		Living</i>.</b> ASPE 		has commissioned a national study of assisted living, or the residential 		settings that combine adapted housing, assistive technologies, personal 		assistance, and other supportive services for persons with disabilities 		(4719.5). Assisted living is considered an important component of services to 		the aging American population and an effective response to the rising costs of 		nursing home care. </p>
<p>The following projects are 		focused on human services issues. </p>
<p><i><b>Moving Welfare 		Recipients to Work.</b> </i> 		ASPE continues to work with the Administration for Children and 		Families (ACF) to conduct a comprehensive, multi-year study of the different 		strategies designed for moving people off welfare and into employment, looking 		particularly at the cost-effectiveness of different approaches. The evaluation 		will address questions about the long-term effects of different welfare reform 		approaches, including whether any approach significantly improves the economic 		circumstances of the most disadvantaged recipients (6576.3) and the effects of 		welfare-to-work programs on the children of welfare recipients (6576.4). ASPE 		has also funded a project to look at one-stop shopping models for 		welfare-to-work programs (6891) and a project to examine the impact of local 		labor markets on welfare-to-work transitions (6892). </p>
<p><b><i>Measuring the 		Outcomes of Welfare Reform. </i></b>ASPE recently initiated a project to look 		at the impact of employment on AFDC recipients in Wisconsin (6727), comparing 		the characteristics and outcomes of two groups of women who have left the AFDC 		program. In collaboration with ACF, HCFA, the Immigration and Naturalization 		Service, and the Department of Agriculture, ASPE is now studying the impact of 		welfare reform on the economic and health status of immigrants, their 		communities, and the organizations that serve them (6747). ASPE has also funded 		a study in New Jersey to look at changes in family well-being and family coping 		strategies following benefit sanctions (6893). </p>
<p><b><i>Welfare Reform 		Implementation Issues</i>. </b> 		ASPE has several projects examining human service delivery policy 		questions related to the implementation of welfare reform. As welfare programs 		require employment or participation in work-related activities, a better 		understanding of the low wage labor market is critical. ASPE has commissioned a 		series of papers to summarize and interpret the results of previous research on 		the low-wage labor market (6717). ASPE will examine the relationship between 		domestic violence and welfare reform (6724) by looking at implementation of the 		TANF Family Violence Option, changes in child support enforcement programs, and 		the use of good cause waivers for battered women. Evidence suggests that some 		battered women seek employment and child support while others need specialized 		assistance in addressing the abuse of partners. A third example is ASPE's study 		of child health and development programs in the context of welfare reform 		(6754). This project will identify and present profiles of promising Federal, 		State and/or community-based health and human services programs believed to be 		enhancing the health and development of children in the context of welfare 		reform. </p>
<p><b><i>Child 		Support</i>.</b> 		ASPE will examine the impact of a change in child support review and 		modification policy under PRWORA (6749). The law prior to the enactment of 		PRWORA required that all AFDC child support cases be reviewed every 3 years and 		adjusted if the child support award was inadequate. PRWORA made review and 		modification in TANF cases optional. A number of States may discontinue review 		and modification in TANF cases. This project will provide estimates of the 		financial impacts to the Federal and State governments, or how such a 		discontinuance would impact on child support offsets to cash assistance 		payments. In addition, the financial impacts on families are to be estimated, 		paying particular attention to those who have left the welfare 		rolls. </p>
<p><i><b>Family Preservation 		Services.</b> </i> 		ASPE and ACF are now examining the following types of family 		preservation programs: placement prevention services aimed at preventing 		children from entering substitute care; broader family preservation services 		that may be less intensive and of longer duration than placement prevention 		services; and reunification services to speed the return of children to their 		homes after entering substitute care (5337.2). Measures of program success will 		include prevention of placement of children into substitute care (for 		pre-placement services), successful reunification (for reunification services), 		improved child behavior, improved family functioning, and reduction of the 		recurrence of child abuse and neglect. </p>
<p><i><b>Teen Pregnancy.</b> 		</i>ASPE is 		coordinating several efforts with HHS agencies to develop and evaluate 		strategies to reduce teen pregnancy. The first project is part of the National 		Strategy to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, aimed at furthering our knowledge about 		teen pregnancy prevention programs and the process of building and 		strengthening partnerships to reduce teen pregnancy and provide a positive 		future for youth (6725). ASPE will provide information and tools to help 		communities develop teen pregnancy prevention programs and partnerships. Next, 		ASPE will conduct a project on understanding and preventing abusive intimate 		relationships among adolescents (6751). It will examine the issue through a 		literature review; analysis of newly available data from the National 		Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the National Survey of Family Growth, 		and other surveys; identification of data needs; focused discussion groups; a 		summary of promising approaches to prevention and intervention; and 		recommendations for further research, policy, and discussion. Finally, ASPE has 		two teen pregnancy prevention efforts that target young men. First is a project 		to develop a research and policy information strategy to inform regional, 		State, and local policy officials and community-based organizations serving 		children and youth of the program models--primarily directed at boys and young 		men-- that can be implemented to help teenagers avoid premature sexual activity 		and unintended pregnancies (6766). Second, there is a project is to identify 		abstinence-based pregnancy prevention programs that target boys or both boys 		and girls (6726). It will use a framework to assess and summarize the state of 		the field and provide the information in a format useful to State, local, and 		community policymakers. States and communities have shown interest in providing 		services and programs for boys and young men, but have also expressed 		frustration that they do not have access to information about what strategies 		have been tried, if they have been successful, and how they can access funding 		for the development and operation of these programs. </p>

              <p><b>MISSION: To provide 		advice on public health and science to the Secretary of Health and Human 		Services, to provide executive direction to program offices within the Office 		of Public Health and Science (OPHS), and, at the direction of the Secretary, to 		coordinate crosscutting public health and science initiatives in the 		Department.</b> </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation 		Program</i></b> </p>
<p>The Office of Public Health 		and Science (OPHS) provides advice, policy and program coordination, and 		leadership in the implementation, management, and development of activities 		related to public health and science, as directed by the Secretary. OPHS helps 		HHS conduct broad-based public health assessments to better define public 		health problems and solutions. It assists other components of HHS in 		anticipating future public health issues and problems and helps ensure that HHS 		designs and implements appropriate approaches, interventions, and evaluations 		that will maintain, sustain, and improve the health of the Nation. OPHS 		provides leadership and policy recommendations on population-based public 		health and science and, at the Secretary's direction, leads or coordinates 		initiatives that cut across agencies and operating divisions. In addition, OPHS 		communicates and interacts, on behalf of the Secretary, with national and 		international professional and constituency organizations on matters of public 		health and science. Finally, OPHS's unique role allows it to use its resources 		to link important HHS programs or fill gaps in areas needing better policy 		formulation and coordination. </p>
<p>In keeping with its role 		within the Department, OPHS has developed an evaluation plan that avoids 		duplication of efforts that might more appropriately and effectively be 		undertaken by operating divisions of HHS or by the Assistant Secretary for 		Planning and Evaluation (ASPE). Thus, the FY 1998 evaluation strategy for OPHS 		focuses on public health and science issues that cut across multiple interests 		of the operating divisions, and requires a coordinated approach to achieve the 		most effective results. In addition, OPHS will continue its commitment to carry 		out every project proposed as part of this year's strategy in collaboration 		with relevant operating divisions. </p>
<p>OPHS conducts evaluations 		requested of the Secretary by Congress that are most appropriately managed by 		staff with medical or health science credentials, and that cannot be assigned 		to an operating division. Further, evaluations will be conducted to support the 		Surgeon General and the Assistant Secretary for Health in their respective 		roles as the Nation's top doctor and senior advisor for public health and 		science to the Secretary. These roles include the responsibility to assist the 		Secretary in developing a policy agenda for the Department to address major 		population-based public health, prevention, and science issues and to provide 		leadership and a focus for coordination of population-based health, clinical 		preventive services and science initiatives that cut across operating 		divisions. In addition, OPHS will conduct evaluations specific to the needs of 		the programs operated from the offices located within OPHS, such as Women's 		Health, Minority Health, Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, International 		Health, and Emergency Preparedness. A portion of the evaluation funds will be 		made available to the ten HHS Regional Health Administrators. 		</p>
<p><b><i>Summary of Fiscal 		Year 1997 Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p>In FY 1997, OPHS completed 		five evaluations in an effort to track the impact of the transformation in the 		Nation's health care system on underserved and vulnerable populations or to 		improve OPHS program performance. Studies completed this year will better 		inform the public health and science communities concerning the return on their 		investment of scarce public health resources and will help shape future budget 		decisions. </p>
<p>In an effort to quantify 		investments made by the various levels of government in essential public health 		services--both personal health services and population-based services--OPHS 		worked with State and local public health, mental health, substance abuse, and 		environmental agencies in nine States to define, measure, and monitor pubic 		health expenditures (6194). Using the essential services framework, the study 		concluded that expenditures could indeed be determined. Some rather surprising 		conclusions were reached concerning the source of the largest portion of public 		health expenditures, indicating that more than 2 out of every 3 dollars spent 		on essential public health services went for personal health services and that 		only 1 percent of the total health care expenditures went for population-based 		health services. </p>
<p>OPHS funded development of 		a study to identify the types of information and data necessary to successfully 		protect and monitor the human health hazards of environmental incidences 		(6322). The study concluded that the Federal government could help State and 		local public health agencies in environmental surveillance by assuring 		integration of public health, environmental health, and environmental 		protection agencies' information. However, any information system developed 		must be evaluated based on its usefulness to State and local agencies that 		respond to adverse effects to human health arising from exposure to 		environmental hazards. </p>
<p>In FY 1997, OPHS asked 		stakeholders in the <b><i>Healthy People 2000</i></b> process to evaluate the 		framework of national health goals and disease prevention objectives in 		anticipation of the development of the <b><i>Healthy People 2010</i></b> plan 		(6491). By reviewing the successes and failures of the <b><i>Healthy People 		2000</i></b> benchmarks, OPHS hoped to make this national framework of 		performance indicators on health status more results-oriented. In general, 		participants in the various forums liked the overall structure and content of 		the <b><i>Healthy People 2000</i></b> document, although some recommended 		reducing the size of the document for <b><i>Heathy People 2010</i> </b>and 		encouraged the use of new communication avenues for this valuable assessment 		tool, making it available to a wider range of professionals and community 		leaders. Both health care purchasers and managed care providers agreed that the 		number of objectives should be reduced to permit adequate focus on a limited 		number of problem areas. </p>
<p>Using resources made 		available through the HHS Regional Health Administrators, one study examined 		the health and well-being of women in the State of Washington (6684). Through a 		broad coalition of health care providers, researchers, and activists, as well 		as focus groups of women from diverse geographical areas, economic levels, and 		social strata, the report concluded that in general, women in Washington State 		are living longer and enjoy a better standard of living than women elsewhere in 		the United States. Although access to health care overall was relatively good, 		the report indicated that elderly women, those with less than a high school 		education, and poor women were less likely to use mammography and have regular 		Pap smears. The report will be used to provide recommendations for addressing 		several problem areas for Washington women's health. </p>
<p>Finally, in a continuing 		effort to evaluate program effectiveness, the Office of Minority Health 		concluded an analysis of sponsored program offices at Historically Black 		Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) (6246). The evaluation determined that grant 		funds and technical assistance had achieved the program aims begun in 1992 to 		increase the involvement of HBCUs in health and social service programs funded 		by the Public Health Service and other Federal agencies. On campuses where 		sponsored program offices were funded, there was an increase in proposal 		submissions and awards. The report indicated a continuing need to invest in 		both programmatic and administrative infrastructure. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluations in 		Progress</i></b> </p>
<p>In reviewing evaluation 		projects for FY 1997, OPHS gave highest priority to efforts aimed at tracking 		the enormous transformation occurring in the Nation's health care system. The 		shifting emphasis on managed care presents new dilemmas about how to ensure 		that, in the quest to control cost, overall quality of care is not unduly 		compromised. Ensuring a workforce that is properly trained and fully capable of 		performing essential public health services in this dynamic health care 		environment is a task that OPHS must, at a minimum, also monitor. Monitoring 		this entire process presents new challenges to HHS, OPHS, and their partners in 		the public health community. </p>
<p>The FY 1997 OPHS evaluation 		plan emphasized the need for a strong foundation for public health in the 		21st<sup></sup>century. Priorities focused attention on (1) the information 		systems and workforce that comprise the Nation's public health infrastructure 		and that are necessary to effectively provide the essential services of public 		health; and (2) the impact of managed care arrangements on the resources 		available for this infrastructure and on the health of all Americans, 		especially those most vulnerable. In support of broader HHS efforts to improve 		departmental programs, OPHS evaluations also reflect the assessment of various 		programs and activities funded through PHS. </p>
<p>Several studies were 		continued from previous years. The Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels, 		appointed by the President, continued its evaluation of factors relevant to 		Food and Drug Administration regulation and possible legislation of label 		claims and statements for dietary supplements as requested by Congress (6193). 		The National Academy of Sciences also continued its study of dietary reference 		intakes (6323). In the area of program improvement, OPHS continued supporting 		an evaluation of a new model of coordinating and integrating HIV prevention and 		primary care services among high-risk populations (6321), an evaluation of the 		Minority Health Resource Center (6244.1), and the assessment of the efficiency 		and effectiveness of the Office of Minority Health's Bilingual/Bicultural 		Service Demonstration Grant Program (6247). In the area of communication, OPHS 		is designing and evaluating applications of interactive communications for 		consumer health information and examining the utility and impact of timed 		dissemination of public health information from PHS agencies (6327). OPHS 		continued its support of a study to identify evaluations of school health 		programs and make available to school boards, administrators, health personnel, 		and health educators an updated compilation of methodologically sound studies 		of these programs (6198). </p>
<p>In an effort to track the 		impact of managed care arrangements on the health care system, OPHS 		collaborated in a broader study of health systems change (being funded by the 		Robert Wood Johnson Foundation) to track changes in the public health sector in 		12 randomly selected communities over a 4 year period (6325). OPHS also 		developed a research agenda to address gaps in scientific knowledge related to 		cultural competence in health care and linking measures to outcomes (6675), and 		assessed managed care organizations serving racially/ethnically diverse 		communities to determine the extent and nature of linguistically and culturally 		appropriate services (6674). When completed, the study will analyze and report 		the range of services being provided, identify best practices and model 		approaches, and explain the community and organizational factors conducive to 		providing linguistically and culturally appropriate services. 		</p>
<p>In FY 1997, OPHS undertook 		a project in cooperation with the United Kingdom that examines efforts to 		address the health concerns of racial and ethnic minorities in the two 		countries and, for six issue areas, conducts comparative analyses of strategies 		and approaches to identify strengths and limitations, best practices, lessons 		learned, and future areas for collaboration. For each of the six issues, a 		paper incorporating these comparative analyses into an integrated piece 		suitable for publication is forthcoming (6676). </p>
<p>In a continuing effort to 		improve the usefulness of <b><i>Healthy People 2000</i></b> objectives, OPHS 		worked with States and localities to determine their ability to assess health 		trends in their communities (6488). Although <b><i>Healthy People 2000</i></b> 		has driven the development of some surveillance and data systems at the 		national level, the usefulness of this information is dependent on State and 		local ability to measure objectives locally. Information from this study will 		be used to develop objectives for <b><i>Healthy People 2010</i>,</b> in an 		effort to make them more usable for local performance and health assessment. In 		this area, OPHS is also assessing linguistically and culturally appropriate 		community health promotion programs in local health departments to gather the 		baseline data necessary to support the review of <b><i>Healthy People 2000</i> 		</b>objectives (6798). </p>
<p>The balance of the ongoing 		evaluation projects funded by OPHS were conducted on a regional basis, 		examining programmatic impact in significant Presidential or departmental 		priority areas or in vulnerable or special populations. Specifically, four 		studies examined effectiveness of services in the area of women's health: 		preventive health screening among older women (6677), breast and cervical 		cancer screening in Region X (6682), averted pregnancies and associated cost 		savings in Region X (6683), and a retrospective study of the preventive health 		practices of former Title X (Family Planning) clients (6685). Other studies are 		looking at the impact on public health services of an increased migrant 		population in northwest Arkansas (6687) and evaluating the impact of the loss 		of Federal funds in the AoA and ACF programs on the Freely Associated States 		(6688). Studies reviewing activities concerning Presidential or departmental 		priorities include an evaluation of an immunization education program for child 		care centers (6680), a study of males who father children born to teenagers 		(6681), an assessment of Region IX programs to promote positive images in girls 		ages 9-14 (6689), and an analysis of local capacity to respond to the health 		and medical consequences of welfare reform (6686). One project is evaluating 		the community-based public health practice training program 		(6678). </p>

              <p><b>MISSION: To improve the 		quality and availability of prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation services 		for substance abuse and mental illness.</b> </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation 		Program</i></b> </p>
<p>The Substance Abuse and 		Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is committed to evaluating its 		overall programs and individual grant projects to assess the effectiveness of 		prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation approaches and systems of care; the 		accountability of Federal funds; and the achievement of SAMHSA's programmatic 		and policy objectives. </p>
<p>To the greatest extent 		appropriate and feasible, SAMHSA encourages the use of comparable data elements 		and instruments across its evaluations in order to work toward a comprehensive 		evaluation system and to minimize respondent burden. </p>
<p>SAMHSA conducts grant 		programs under a variety of legislative authorities. These authorities can 		generally be grouped into two types: (1) services and (2) knowledge development 		and application (KDA). The evaluation required for a particular grant program 		is dependent on the type and purpose of the program. SAMHSA evaluates each of 		its service programs so as to provide information to program managers about the 		accountability of Federal funds. In addition, the evaluations of KDA programs 		will generate new knowledge to lead the field in the development of policies 		that improve services. </p>
<p>The two types of grant 		programs (service delivery and KDA) represent the two facets of SAMHSA's 		mission. SAMHSA's leadership in the field depends on the successful interaction 		of these two facets. Through KDAs, SAMHSA must identify effective approaches to 		prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. Through service delivery funds, 		SAMHSA must provide incentives to the field to implement effective approaches. 		Major emphases of SAMHSA's mission are to develop, identify, and disseminate 		effective strategies and systems for prevention, treatment, and 		rehabilitation. </p>
<p>SAMHSA is implementing an 		integrated model of evaluation and planning. Strategic planning identifies 		priorities, such as managed care, that drive the development of grant programs 		and evaluations. In compliance with the Government Performance and Results Act 		(GPRA), SAMHSA is improving performance management by identifying annual 		performance objectives and measures. The formulation of programmatic and 		evaluation priorities includes consultation with SAMHSA, Center Advisory 		Councils, and with other experts in the fields of evaluation and service 		delivery. Early and continuous coordination of program planning and evaluation 		design will result in the articulation of program objectives that may be 		evaluated. Evaluations will demonstrate the extent to which the grant programs 		have achieved their overall objectives, and SAMHSA will translate these results 		into information that can be used for program and policy development. The 		strategic planning and policy development processes will then use these results 		to refine SAMHSA's priorities and performance objectives. </p>
<p>This evaluation policy will 		help SAMHSA achieve its goal of continually informing policy and program 		development with knowledge culled from past performance. In this way, SAMHSA 		can best serve its customers by enhancing the quality of publicly-funded 		substance abuse and mental health services. </p>
<p>In compliance with the 		Public Health Service (PHS) guidelines for the technical review of evaluations, 		SAMHSA has established a standing committee of PHS staff who are evaluation 		specialists. Representatives of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for 		Planning and Evaluation serve as ex officio members of the committee. The 		SAMHSA evaluation officer is the committee chair. The committee does not 		generally review the evaluation proposals of individual grantees; rather, it 		reviews proposals for broader, more comprehensive evaluations, such as the 		cross-project evaluations of grant programs. </p>
<p>Evaluation project 		proposals are generally prepared by SAMHSA program staff in the various 		Centers. The standing committee reviews each proposal on the following 		criteria: clarity of evaluation objectives and research questions, 		appropriateness and feasibility of the specifications for evaluation design and 		methods, appropriateness of the plans for dissemination of results, and use of 		previous relevant evaluations and existing program data systems. Each proposal 		must clearly state the relationship of the evaluation to SAMHSA's overall 		policies, priorities, and evaluation program. </p>
<p><b><i>Summary of Fiscal 		Year 1997 Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p>During FY 1997, SAMHSA 		completed six evaluations. A summary of the resulting reports 		follows. </p>
<p>The <b><i>NTIES: National 		Treatment Improvement Evaluation Study: Final Report</i></b> (5346.1), 		highlighted in Chapter II, was a comprehensive assessment of the results of 157 		three-year demonstration grants and cooperative agreements funded by the Center 		for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) beginning in 1990-91. These grants were 		intended to improve alcohol and drug treatment in selected target cities with 		severe substance abuse problems, among critical populations such as minority 		groups and women, and among persons in the criminal justice system. Based on a 		final sample of 6,600 clients who entered treatment, the results showed a 		substantial reduction in the selling of drugs and the commission of violent 		crimes, high-risk sexual behaviors related to HIV transmission, medical visits, 		homelessness, and inpatient mental health visits. Results also showed a 		substantial increase in employment. </p>
<p>The<i> <b>CSAT 		Demonstration: Evaluation of Job Corps Drug Treatment Enrichment 		Program</b></i> (4523) was a 4-year demonstration project sponsored by CSAT and 		put in place within the Department of Labor's Job Corps program. The Drug 		Treatment Enrichment Program (DTEP) was implemented in four experimental Job 		Corps Centers. These were matched with four control centers that provided the 		standard Job Corps Alcohol and Other Drugs of Abuse program. The evaluation 		found that DTEP students reduced marijuana and crack or cocaine use following 		their Job Corps experience significantly more than did the students in the 		control groups. DTEP students were less likely to engage in moderate or 		extensive use of marijuana or to use other drugs, but no differences were found 		for alcohol abuse. DTEP students were less likely to report selling or helping 		to sell drugs after Job Corps. No differences between DTEP and controls were 		found for other criminal activities. DTEP improved students' mental health. 		DTEP students with mental health problems experienced a significantly higher 		job placement rate after Job Corps than did control students, although the 		program had no effect on job placement rates of students without mental health 		problems. DTEP appeared to have no significant positive effect on duration of 		stay in Job Corps or on overall educational and vocational gains. The final 		report makes recommendations regarding the integration of DTEP into Job Corps 		and other related policy implications. </p>
<p>The Center for Substance 		Abuse Prevention (CSAP) released the findings of a demonstration evaluation, 		<b><i>Evaluation of Model Projects for Pregnant and Postpartum Women and Their 		Infants</i></b> (5674). The evaluation assessed the effectiveness of the 		demonstration program in enhancing services coordination and in increasing the 		availability and accessibility of substance abuse prevention services delivered 		to clients. The study also documented the effectiveness of program models in 		decreasing alcohol and drug use among substance-abusing women, and enhancing 		the healthy development of their children. Ten projects funded by CSAP in 1992 		were selected to participate in the evaluation. Data collected by the grantees 		were used for cross-site analyses. The major evaluation finding was that from 		intake to delivery, the treatment group members reported significantly lower 		use of marijuana, crack, and other illicit substances than comparison group 		members. These differences, however, were not significant by the 6-month 		postpartum followup assessment. Overall, treatment and comparison group members 		gave birth to infants with similar birth-related outcome characteristics. 		However, when the history of the mother's use of crack was taken into account, 		treatment babies had significantly higher birth weights than the babies in the 		comparison group. </p>
<p>CSAP also conducted a 		<i><b>Report on the CTS National Evaluation</b> </i>(4514.1). The training 		system included the development and delivery of more than 30 curricula to more 		than 10,000 participants. Recipients included community teams, health 		professionals, State administrators, and volunteers engaged in prevention 		activities. The report found that the training system was innovative in several 		important respects. It focused on community coalitions and associations of 		health professionals that are responsible for planning and delivering 		prevention services, rather than concentrating on target populations. Curricula 		were developed quickly in response to emerging issues in the field. The 		training system had a continuing commitment to quality control and continual 		curricular improvement. </p>
<p>CSAP has completed 		<i><b>Findings from the Evaluation of the Faculty Development Program, Volume 		I: Final Report</b> </i>(4510). This program offers training to faculty members 		from schools of medicine, nursing, and social work, and from graduate 		psychology programs. The purpose of the development program was to enhance 		research, teaching, and clinical practices on issues of alcohol, tobacco, and 		other drugs (ATOD). The evaluation found that faculty fellows, after 		participating in the program, reported (1) spending significantly more time on 		ATOD-related activities, (2) conducting more ATOD research, (3) incorporating 		more ATOD information in courses, (4) joining ATOD professional organizations, 		(5) increasing ATOD teaching or clinical skills, (6) producing more ATOD 		publications, and (7) making more ATOD presentations at conferences and other 		events than they had prior to their participation in the program. 		</p>
<p>The Center for Mental 		Health Services (CMHS) produced <b><i>Final Report: Review of the CMHS Mental 		Health Care Provider Education in HIV/AIDS</i></b> (6695). The program supports 		the provision of state-of-the-art training targeted to (1) traditional mental 		health care providers (psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, and social 		workers); (2) other first-line providers of mental health care services 		(primary care physicians and medical students); and (3) nontraditional 		providers of such services (clergy or alternative health care workers). The 		goal of the program was to improve access to appropriate and adequate mental 		health services for people living with HIV/AIDS and for their families and 		partners. The evaluation found that training participants increased their 		knowledge about the mental health aspects of the disease, their willingness to 		serve HIV-infected individuals, and their confidence that they could do so 		effectively. The recommendations of the report stressed the need for training 		in the mental health aspects of HIV/AIDS throughout the country, especially as 		affected areas and populations change over time. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluations in 		Progress</i></b> </p>
<p>SAMHSA currently has major 		evaluation projects under way in two areas. First, CSAT's <b><i>National 		Evaluation Database Service</i></b> (5994) is providing centralized data 		management and analysis for the evaluation of several large demonstrations 		targeted to special populations, including female, adolescent, criminal 		justice, culturally distinct, and rural populations. The service represents 		part of an evaluation strategy that builds upon prior findings, and which seeks 		to identify a set of consistent evaluation questions that apply across similar 		substance abuse treatment programs targeted to special populations. The service 		has identified data elements to provide uniform information across sites so 		that comparisons of effectiveness could be made. </p>
<p>Second, CSAP is conducting 		a<i> <b>National Evaluation of the Community Partnership Demonstration 		Project</b></i> (4997). This project was designed to identify successful 		prevention and partnership strategies and common inhibitors to forming 		successful partnerships and prevention programs. This impact evaluation has 		focused on assessments of short-term outcomes specific to each interview site, 		long-term outcomes reliant upon uniform surveys, and community-wide indicators 		of alcohol and drug abuse across several sites. Data have been collected 		through a questionnaire administered in schools and a telephone survey for 		adults. </p>
<p>Other evaluations in 		progress are looking at services integration for homeless persons with chronic 		mental illness (4980.1), effects of managed care on substance abuse treatment 		outcomes (6454), evaluation of substance abuse treatment improvement protocols 		(6737), long-term effects of drug abuse treatment (6738), and an evaluation of 		opioid treatment program accreditation (6739). </p>
