<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		project tracked the activities and effects of research conducted under the 		Medical Effectiveness Treatment Program (MEDTEP). Using secondary data sources 		such as newspaper and journal articles, the project collected information on 		the products of Agency for Health Care Policy and Research-sponsored medical 		effectiveness research and the diffusion of these findings into other sources. 		A bibliography entitled "Publications of the Patient Outcomes Research Teams 		(PORTS): PORT and PORT II Projects" provides information about publications 		arising from each PORT, listed by the condition that each addressed. Also 		included is information about the grant or contract number, project title, name 		and institution of the principal investigator, project start and completion 		dates, and a brief description of the project. A second bibliography entitled 		"Medical Treatment Effectiveness Program Research Projects: 1989 through 1995" 		presents a comprehensive list of MEDTEP research projects. Projects are 		categorized under Clinical Studies, with subcategories; Guideline 		Implementation and Evaluation; and Methods and Measures. Within each category, 		projects are in alphabetical order by the name of the principal investigator. 		PORT and PORT II projects are marked. As in the first bibliography, there is 		information about grant or contract number, project title, name and institution 		of the principal investigator, project start and completion dates, and a very 		brief description of the project. For those projects that have been completed, 		executive summaries and final reports may be available through the National 		Technical Information Center.

<p><b>TITLE:</b> <b><i>Final 		Report on Changes Needed in CONQUEST's Software Based 		Programs</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT:</b> This 		report provides the results of an evaluation of the CONQUEST data base in order 		to determine the best short-term, intermediate, and long-range strategies for 		its continued development. Three important findings emerged from this study. 		First, Microsoft Access was judged to be the best platform (out of 13 		alternatives) for CONQUEST in the short and immediate terms. Furthermore, many 		opportunities exist to improve CONQUEST over the short and immediate terms. 		Problems identified by users can be corrected by minor enhancements, error 		corrections, and superficial changes. More substantial changes are also needed, 		including restructuring of the data base and rewriting of the queries and 		Access Basic code that perform the underlying CONQUEST search and retrieval 		operations. Finally, the report determines that the best long-range strategy 		for disseminating CONQUEST information to the broadest possible audience over 		the widest variety of platforms is via World Wide Web. This finding also lists 		the advantages of using the Internet, describes the labor and equipment needed, 		and estimates that the project would be a multi-year effort costing more than 		one million dollars. The report concludes that moving CONQUEST in its current 		form to another stand-alone data base is not desirable. Investments in software 		should be limited to necessary, cost-effective changes. Further development of 		the data base should be designed based on the findings of this report, which 		should also be used in the selection of a new implementation platform.

<p><b>TITLE:</b> <b><i>Final 		Report on Changes Needed in CONQUEST 1.0's Structure and Classification 		Scheme</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT:</b> This 		report presents the findings of an evaluation of the structure and 		classification scheme of CONQUEST 1.0. The evaluation identified changes needed 		to enhance the use and effectiveness of the data base's structure and 		classification scheme for codifying clinical performance measures and 		conditions. The evaluation addressed three broad questions: (1) how does the 		current application of CONQUEST 1.0 compare with its intended use; (2) what are 		the impediments to potential users; and (3) which structural and classification 		scheme improvements are needed in the Condition and Measures data bases? The 		report finds that the data base is used as intended. Users access it to learn 		which processes and outcomes to measure for particular conditions, to compare 		and select clinical performance measures, and to find measures related to 		practice guidelines. The report also finds that the data base must be kept 		current and comprehensive in order for it to be of use. Advanced and mid-level 		users would like additional types of measures, particularly measures on 		satisfaction with care and access. They would also like more functional status 		measures and clinical measures for non-acute settings. In regard to the 		structure of the data base and the classification scheme, (1) many performance 		measures lack enough similarities to be grouped into batches, (2) the quality 		of the match between conditions and measures designed for them should be 		improved, (3) most searches for clinical performance measures for specific 		conditions returned at least one measure that was not well-matched, (4) codes 		for clinical events may be too broad, (5) the condition list presented to users 		should be broadened, and (6) users would like additional information about the 		performance measures. The report also includes several recommendations to 		improve the quality of the data base. See also PIC ID Nos. 5961 and 5961.1. 		(Final report: 16 pages, plus appendices.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Assessment of 		the Feasibility of Creating a Managed Care Encounter-Level Data 		base</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT:</b> The rapid 		growth of managed care in recent years is transforming the Nation's health care 		system. In the process, it is also changing the ability of health services 		researchers and policy analysts to answer fundamental questions about access, 		utilization, cost, and quality of care. Data produced as a "byproduct" of the 		fee-for-service system (including plan-, provider-, person-, and 		encounter-level data) are either no longer available or vary in 		comprehensiveness and accuracy. As a result, there is widespread public and 		private interest in managed care organizations' (MCOs') ability to collect 		encounter-level data and in the development of an encounter-level data base 		that could be used for the purposes of research. This report (1) identified 		models that the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) could employ 		to work with plans to facilitate the availability of data for research, (2) 		examines the availability and comprehensiveness of encounter-level data in MCO 		data bases, and (3) identifies the problems and challenges that might be 		encountered when trying to use or combine data from MCOs. Among key findings 		are that: (1) MCO data bases vary substantially in the availability and 		comprehensiveness of encounter-level data and the ability to link these data 		with administrative and financial data; (2) MCOs increasingly view their 		information systems and the data they store, as proprietary, and there are a 		number of disincentives for MCOs to share their data; (3) computer systems, 		which were originally touted as an inexpensive way to capture data, are 		technically complex and costly--problems exacerbated by the lack of 		industry-wide definitions and reporting standards; and (4) despite these 		barriers, MCOs are interested in exploring ways to work with AHCPR and other 		Federal agencies to facilitate the availability of data for the purposes of 		research.

<p><b>TITLE:</b> 		<b><i>Customer Satisfaction Survey of AHCPR Publications 		Recipients</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT:</b> The Agency 		for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) provides most information services 		to consumers through its Publication Clearinghouse. This report assesses 		consumer satisfaction with the content, format, and procedures for AHCPR 		publication distribution. The study statistically analyzes the results of a 		mail survey protocol for individuals who requested one of four patient/consumer 		guides: <b><i>Prescription Medicines and You</i>, <i>Understanding 		Incontinence</i>, <i>Early Alzheimer's Disease</i>, </b>and <b><i>You Can Quit 		Smoking</i>.</b> The report finds that respondents (1) find the guides of 		greater interest to elderly persons; (2) make 75 percent of their requests by 		telephone; (3) are pleased with the services of the Clearinghouse in 		distributing patient/consumer guides; (4) with access to the Internet (17 		percent) still prefer to order the guides by telephone; (5) order the guides 		for themselves (70 percent) and that two-thirds keep it for reference; (6) 		respond positively to different editorial and typographical features of the 		guides; (7) express little interest in making any of the nine suggested changes 		to the guides; and (8) are satisfied overall with the guides, and that the 22 		percent who are not satisfied cite insufficient information. Although the 		diversity of the four guides makes generalizations difficult, the report 		concludes that (1) due to the large number of phone requests, AHCPR should give 		Clearinghouse staff information about the contents of the patient/consumer 		guides in order to provide better customer service; (2) AHCPR should make no 		changes to the organization of the guides or how information is presented; and 		(3) AHCPR could pursue methods to identify and answer the questions and 		concerns of individuals who feel that the guides provide insufficient 		information.

<p><b>TITLE:</b><i> <b>Effects 		of Informatics Tools and Decision Aids to Help Patient Decision-making about 		Medical Screening and Treatment</b></i> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT:</b> This 		report identifies, evaluates, and synthesizes published and unpublished 		research on the effects of informatics tools and decision aids used to help 		patients make decisions about their screening and treatment. These tools 		provide treatment- and disease-specific information to patients in computerized 		or noncomputerized form. The report finds that few controlled studies have been 		conducted on the effects of these tools and aids. Most only consider effects on 		patient knowledge and satisfaction, and examine only a few treatment choices. 		Few studies have investigated the effects of tools on patient-clinician 		communications and health behavior and health outcomes. There are no 		comparative studies of the cost and effectiveness of different types of tools, 		and the studies that have been done are of varying methodological quality. 		Despite these limitations, certain conclusions can be drawn. For example, (1) 		studies suggest that the use of informatics tools can increase patients' 		knowledge of treatment alternatives, and patients report that they like these 		tools; (2) limited evidence suggests that tools influence treatment selection; 		(3) greater attention to rigorous controls, adequate sample size, and 		standardized measurement is crucial; (4) use of tools by patients can be 		limited, especially if there are operational barriers to their use (such as a 		requirement for a second visit); (5) patients who use informatics tools 		generally increase their knowledge of treatment alternatives, but the 		comparative effectiveness of different types of tools in increasing knowledge 		has not been well assessed; (6) some trials find that patients who use tools 		are significantly more satisfied with the decisionmaking process than others 		and that these patients ask their physicians more questions; and (7) scattered 		evidence suggests that these tools can improve health outcomes by increasing 		patients' adherence to treatment regimens.

<p><b>TITLE:</b><i> 		<b>Diagnostic Accuracy in Primary Care: Review of the Literature on Five 		Chronic Conditions--Final Report</b></i> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT:</b> This 		report presents the findings of an iterative literature search and analysis on 		diagnostic errors and inefficiencies in primary care for five clinical 		conditions: cutaneous melanoma, breast cancer, heart failure, depression in 		children, and pediatric asthma. The report points out several gaps in the 		health services and the clinical knowledge base. It also suggests that these 		gaps can be addressed by a comprehensive research agenda on primary care, which 		can be used by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research for future 		research agendas on each of the specific conditions. Specific research issues 		include the extent of inaccurate (missed, erroneous, or delayed) diagnoses, and 		the causes of such deficiencies; the health and monetary consequences of 		diagnostic errors and inefficiencies; and the effectiveness of interventions 		aimed at preventing or overcoming the problems.

<p><b>TITLE:<i> </i>Evaluation 		of AHCPR Minority Health Services Research Training 		Activities</b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT:</b> This 		report reviews Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) initiatives 		in health services research training to determine the degree to which they have 		increased minority participation in health services research. It examines two 		types of initiatives: (1) pre- and post-doctoral training provided through 		National Research Service Award grants; and (2) supplementary funding made 		available to individual AHCPR grantees for the purpose of providing training to 		individual minority candidates or investigating an area related to minority 		issues in health services. The report finds that AHCPR has been somewhat 		successful in increasing minority participation in health services research 		training. It identified five criteria that are necessary for program success: 		recruitment, leadership, networking, mentoring, and building a community of 		scholars. The best practices of successful non-Federal programs were identified 		as (1) developing sufficient infrastructure to support training, (2) providing 		sufficient financial support to attract the brightest trainees, and (3) 		providing necessary support for faculty mentors involved in the program.

<p><b>TITLE:</b> 		<b><i>Outcomes and Effectiveness Research in the Private 		Sector</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT:</b> This 		project analyzed and evaluated private sector activities in performing outcomes 		and effectiveness research (OER). It was intended to help clarify the Agency 		for Health Care Policy and Research's (AHCPR's) future priorities in outcomes 		and effectiveness research, and to provide insights regarding future 		opportunities for public-private partnerships in this area. The project 		reviewed the published literature and other documentation, conducted telephone 		interviews, conducted case studies, and hosted an expert panel with private 		sector OER leaders. The study finds that (1) organizations reporting OER 		activities include large insurers, managed care organizations, health product 		companies, employer groups, associations, and foundations; (2) private sector 		organizations conduct OER primarily to improve their strategic and financial 		positions; (3) private sector OER does not overlap considerably with 		government-sponsored OER; (4) health product companies usually focus their OER 		efforts on their new drugs and devices, while less attention is given to other 		health care interventions, particularly those that are not new or those used 		primarily for traditionally underserved or vulnerable populations; (5) although 		provider organizations increasingly conduct a variety of activities involving 		outcomes measurement, including some OER as defined in the report, much of the 		outcomes measurement is for monitoring health care performance against certain 		standards (for instance, in the case of accreditation and quality assurance); 		and (5) AHCPR has supported the development and validation of many of the 		research tools used in private sector OER. The study concludes that 		government-sponsored OER can continue to address certain major topics that are 		not covered by the private sector, and can continue to advance research tools, 		training, and other aspects of OER that will benefit private sector 		efforts. </p>

<p><b>TITLE:</b> 		<b><i>Partners in Research: Identifying Common Interests</i></b> 		</p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT:</b> The Agency 		for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) undertook this project to develop a 		methodology for systematically matching research interests of private sector 		organizations with its own in order to identify potential research partners. 		The methodology was developed in several stages: (1) a segmentation was 		developed to classify private sector entities by research focus; (2) a matrix 		identified promising overlap between private sector research and AHCPR research 		interests; and (3) sample profiles were developed for nine organizations in 		four health industry segments (pharmaceutical/biotechnology; 		manufacturing/suppliers; health information systems; and philanthropy). The 		profiles were created for Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, American Home 		Products, Medtronic, HCIA, HBO and Company, and the California Endowment. These 		profiles demonstrate how available sources of information on organizations can 		be tapped to provide a detailed background for screening these organizations to 		assess opportunities for research partnering. The methodology focused on 		publicly traded companies and private foundations, although it is recognized 		that attractive partnering opportunities exist with privately held companies 		and a variety of nonprofit organizations other than those with philanthropic 		missions. The report recommends that AHCPR more fully develop, and then 		maintain, a matrix of private sector organizations with research interests 		overlapping its own research portfolio. A deliberate strategy for undertaking 		one or more collaborative research activities in each cluster should be 		undertaken in order to provide further experience in the development and 		management of successful research partnering. Considerations should be given to 		soliciting input from a cross-section of companies in the various health care 		market sectors when planning new research initiatives.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Performance 		Measurement Inventory Phases II &amp; III Workplan</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT:</b> The 		Performance Measurement Workgroup of the U.S. Department of Health and Human 		Services (HHS) Managed Care Forum requested an inventory of performance 		measures (i.e., clinical, population, and system) currently being used, under 		consideration for use, or being developed for use by HHS agencies for 		regulating, monitoring, comparing, and/or evaluating health care services and 		systems of care. The inventory, which will be created in a CONQUEST-compatible 		format, will be used to identify opportunities for better coordination and 		improved efficiency, and to prepare recommendations concerning the direction 		and coordination of departmental activities in regard to performance 		measurement. Ideally the project will include one or more non-HHS agencies, 		such as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or the U.S. Department of 		Defense. The project includes three phases: Phase I is workplan development, 		Phase II is pilot testing of the data collection instruments and instructions, 		and Phase III is data collection and final report writing. As of October 1997, 		Phase I has been completed; a draft report for Phase II, which includes 		participation by the VA is in progress; and a task order for Phase III has been 		awarded and work is scheduled to begin in the near future.

<p><b>TITLE:</b> <b><i>Final 		Report: Small Conference Grant Program Evaluation</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT:</b> In 1991, 		the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) established the current 		Small Conference Grant Program. The program supports conferences, doctoral 		dissertations, and small research projects. Under the program, grants of 		$50,000 or less are awarded to nonprofit organizations to support conferences 		on issues relevant to health services research and to AHCPR's mission. In 		January 1996, AHCPR made revisions to streamline the program, which included 		the implementation of concept letter procedures. The concept letter saves time 		for both reviewers and applicants because only those conferences that are of 		interest to AHCPR move to the full review process. The report finds that (1) 		small grant conference procedures are efficient and result in conferences that 		meet AHCPR's goals, (2) the objectives of the conferences are being met, and 		(3) outcomes of the conferences are in accord with their stated purpose. The 		study recommends that (1) future grant announcements should set a realistic, 		experience-based time frame for both the review of concept letters and grant 		applications; (2) AHCPR consider instituting a time limit on application 		submission once the applicant has been notified of concept letter acceptance to 		help the agency develop a more realistic list of expected or pending 		applications; (3) AHCPR be more proactive in planning the dissemination 		strategy of a conference to increase the impact of a conference; and (4) in the 		future, AHCPR might consider lending its name, rather than its money, to 		conferences, as a way for the Agency to extend its reach without increasing 		funds to the program.

<p><b>REPORT TITLE: <i>Did We 		Make A Difference? ATSDR's Framework for Community-Focused 		Evaluation</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In 1994, 		the Environmental Health Policy Committee, part of the Public Health Service, 		recommended that all Federal agencies develop guidelines to establish outcome 		and impact data for use in the evaluation of their activities and products. 		This report outlines a framework for implementing community-focused evaluation, 		a program of activities undertaken to assess the outcomes and impacts of the 		Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) site-specific 		activities. The seven steps of the framework include (1) gathering community 		information, (2) defining the public health problem, (3) determining and 		implementing the public health action, (4) establishing evaluation goals and 		objectives, (5) developing outcome measures as indicators of success, (6) 		collecting and analyzing data, and (7) using feedback to improve public health 		actions. The report concludes that (1) ATSDR's community-focused evaluation 		framework provides a comprehensive, flexible, and timely approach to assess the 		short- and long-term effects of ATSDR's site-specific activities; (2) 		community-focused evaluation must be viewed as effective and taken seriously as 		a central part of responsible public health practice, and not merely as an 		activity to conduct if sufficient funds are left when the program is completed; 		(3) the collaborative and educational functions of evaluation create promising 		prospects for facilitating change because of their inherent emphasis on the 		interactive relationship between ATSDR and the community; and (4) ATSDR's 		community-focused evaluation program provides the Agency with the opportunity 		to communicate the value of its products and services to key stakeholders, 		while allowing for critical feedback to management and staff.

<p><b>REPORT TITLE: 		<i>Site-Specific Outcome Measurement Guidelines for ATSDR Cooperative Agreement 		States</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The Agency 		for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) developed this report to help 		State cooperative agreement personnel evaluate their efforts in the protection 		of public health. A number of States collaborated with ATSDR to develop 		guidelines for assessing the impacts and outcomes of site-specific health 		education activities. This report was prepared by a group of Federal and State 		ATSDR Cooperative Agreement staff and was intended for an audience of State and 		territorial personnel working under ATSDR Cooperative Agreement 607 auspices. 		The document deals with measurement of community members' response to the 		Agency's Superfund activities and includes a short section that evaluates the 		Agency's effect/influence on other agencies with each State. The community 		member section is divided into five possible areas of evaluation, which include 		measurements of knowledge, opinion, behavior, exposure, and health. The agency 		section has only one area of measurement, which is the opinion area. This area 		was selected in an attempt to measure the influence of ATSDR on environmental 		decision making and the subsequent protection of public health. This report is 		part of a set of tools that will allow cooperative agreement participants to 		assess the overall improvement in public health as a result of site-specific 		health education activities and to demonstrate the cooperative agreement 		program's effectiveness. </p>

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of Sexually 		Transmitted Disease (STD) Prevention provides financial and technical 		assistance to State and local agencies to support a range of prevention, 		research, policy development, and surveillance activities. Two parallel STD 		surveillance systems are currently operated by CDC, both of which rely upon 		regular, voluntary reporting of STD incidence by State and local agencies. Both 		systems are thought to suffer from less-than-complete reporting of STDs by 		diagnosing practitioners. Estimates of this underreporting range from 25 to 90 		percent. The focus of this project, therefore, was to design and pilot test a 		methodology for validating the STD data routinely collected, analyzed, and 		published by the Division. The study's main objective was to test the 		feasibility of using a provider-based survey (1) to quantitatively validate 		CDC's data on STD diagnoses, and (2) to assess the extent to which clinicians 		follow CDC's treatment guidelines for STDs. The study was designed to generate 		estimates of STD incidence through a survey of a random sample of STD data 		providers in four States, and to compare these estimates with State-reported 		STD incidence for the same time period. The report finds that (1) the four 		pilot States differ in terms of their STD data-gathering policies and 		practices, including which diseases are reported, how cases are defined for 		reporting purposes, how laboratory reporting is utilized, and which date 		information is recorded for each case; (2) syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia 		are reportable diseases in all four States, and in two States many additional 		diseases are reportable; (3) in two States, physicians must report diseases for 		them to be recorded, while in two others laboratory reports are sufficient; (4) 		STDs are considerably underreported by providers; and (5) most STD cases are 		seen by individual private practitioners.

<p><b>TITLE:<i> </i>Evaluation 		of ICD-10 for Morbidity Reporting in the United States</b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report evaluates (1) whether the International Classification of Disease 		(ICD)-10 is a significant improvement over the ICD-9; (2) whether these 		improvements warrant its implementation in the United States; (3) the 		modifications needed to improve its use for morbidity applications; and (4) 		whether there are any codes or concepts in ICD-9, but not in ICD-10, that 		should be considered for inclusion. The Technical Advisory Panel and project 		staff conclude that there are many strengths in ICD-10 in comparison with 		ICD-9. Many of the chapters contain a wealth of useful expansion in detail for 		which diagnostic information is typically available and which represent 		important clinical distinctions. These expansions will facilitate future 		specificity in statistical tabulations of diseases and conditions, provide some 		additional means for severity coding, and provide for enhanced applicability of 		the classification to primary care reporting. The logic and detail of ICD-10 		will also contribute to progress toward the computerization of medical records. 		Although a number of limitations in ICD-10 are identified, the recommended 		modifications will overcome most of them. Therefore, it is strongly recommended 		that the National Center for Health Statistics implement a revised version as 		soon as possible. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Suicide 		Intervention and Prevention: Evaluation of Community-Based Programs in Three 		American Indian Communities</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Suicide is 		the second leading cause of death for Native Americans aged 15 to 24. American 		Indian/Alaska Native young people are more likely to attempt suicide; to choose 		a highly lethal method, such as firearms or hanging; and to be successful at 		committing suicide. This report evaluates the local community-based suicide 		intervention and prevention programs of three geographically diverse American 		Indian tribes (the Jicarilla Apache Tribe, the Western Athabaskan Tribe, and 		the Northern Woodlands Tribe). In two tribes, suicide intervention efforts had 		been in place since 1989 and 1990, respectively; in the third, a suicide crisis 		in late 1992 precipitated community response. The report finds that (1) the 		local nature of the evaluation process opened itself to problems of diffuse 		authority and lack of focus on the evaluation process; (2) suicide prevention 		issues, tribal identity issues, and staffing issues took precedent over the 		actual evaluation activities; (3) a major recommendation arising from this 		study was to have process evaluation activities conducted by an external 		(non-community member) evaluator not supervised by local staff; (4) the 		Jicarilla Apache program represents a suicide prevention program in a very 		small, cohesive, and well-coordinated community response, which depends upon a 		staff model; (5) at the Western Athabaskan reservation, the prevention program 		used several special initiatives loosely coordinated with an existing 		Behavioral Health Services program using a staff model; (6) using a volunteer 		network, the Northern Woodlands tribe produced an excellent manual describing a 		grassroots community approach to suicide prevention; and (7) in all three 		tribes, attempted and successful suicide rates were reduced. The report 		concludes that the staff models used in the two small and centralized 		reservation communities were more successful than the diffuse, volunteer 		effort. (Final report: 120 pages.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE:<i> </i>Evaluation 		of the Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) Program: Phase II 		Final Report</b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) program of the National 		Institute for Occupational Safety and Health seeks to prevent workplace 		fatalities by identifying and investigating fatal occupational injuries and 		disseminating prevention strategies to those who can intervene in similar 		situations. Publications based on information from fatality investigations 		identify occupational hazards and prevention measures, and are disseminated to 		persons who can influence work conditions and information availability in 		related occupations and work settings. </p>
<p>This report (1) describes 		the dissemination of five recent FACE documents (4 tear-sheet Alerts and one 		monograph), (2) compiles users' assessments of their usefulness, and (3) 		identifies examples of prevention efforts and other impacts attributable to the 		documents. The report finds that (1) publications are generally considered 		technically accurate and focused on significant occupational hazards by users; 		(2) workers participating in focus groups see job-related chronic illnesses and 		nonfatal injuries as more significant than the risk of fatality, and are less 		convinced of tear sheets' relevance to them; (3) workers consider the tear 		sheets' recommendations accurate and appropriate, but are concerned by the 		inclusion of "common sense" recommendations; (4) the tear sheets' terminology 		and generally high literacy level may limit their usefulness to their target 		audiences; (5) the publications are generally disseminated by distributing them 		directly or by modifying them for inclusion in other informational materials; 		and (6) information from the publications is used to improve worker training, 		identify existing hazards, and improve safety standards. The report concludes 		that the FACE publications are a useful source of authoritative occupational 		safety information. The report includes several recommendations. See also PIC 		ID No. 5506.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Assessment of 		the National Laboratory Training Network</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		National Laboratory Training Network (NLTN) was established in 1989 to provide 		training in new methodologies and theoretical concepts for laboratory workers. 		This report assesses whether the NLTN has had a beneficial impact on public 		health by improving laboratory practice. Data were gathered through a series of 		surveys of local health department and physician office laboratory employees 		who participated in training, as well as comparison groups of those who did 		not. Other surveys of State training coordinators (STCs), laboratory 		inspectors, microbiology directors, microbiology program participants, and NLTN 		co-sponsors were also conducted. The report categorizes its findings in three 		groups, based upon the responses of (1) STCs, laboratory inspectors, and 		co-sponsors; (2) microbiologists; and (3) course participants and their 		comparison groups. The report finds that: (1) STCs felt supported in their jobs 		and used NLTN resources (88 percent were somewhat or very satisfied with NLTN 		services, and 90 percent were satisfied with programs); (2) laboratory 		inspectors often recommended training as a means to correct deficiencies, but 		only a small percentage used the NLTN as a training source; (3) co-sponsors 		rate relevance, quality, and currency of course content very highly; (4) 		microbiology directors rated NLTN fees, convenience, relevance, quality, 		currency of content, and pertinence of issues addressed favorably; (5) 		one-third of microbiology course participants instituted a change in practice 		as a result of training (80 percent rated quality and currency of content 		highly); and (6) course participants in the third group rated their training 		highly and most instituted changes or saw positive results subsequent to 		training. The report includes recommendations for further improving the NLTN. 		(Final report: 147 pages, appendices bound separately in Volume 		II.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Race Reporting 		on Birth Records by Multiracial Women: An Evaluation of Question Format 		Alternatives</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report examines the implications of changing the format of the race item on the 		birth record filled out for every birth in the United States at the location 		where the birth occurred. Procedures for filling out birth certificates vary 		from State to State and in some States, from hospital to hospital. To provide 		uniform information to the vital registration system, the Federal government, 		in cooperation with the States, developed the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live 		Birth that collects relevant information about the race and Hispanic origin of 		the parents, but not of the baby. This study (1) evaluates how women of 		multiracial and Hispanic backgrounds interpret the race question on the birth 		certificate; (2) evaluates experimental race questions, such as the use of a 		multiracial cue and the use of a "mark all that apply" format; and (3) learns 		more about the response processes that women use when answering questions about 		race. Nine States and the District of Columbia recruited 763 women to 		participate in this study. The study tests the effects of different questions 		on race, both in a mail and a followup telephone survey. The mother's 		self-reported race is compared with what she reported on the actual birth 		record. Further, for those residents with two children, the study compared 		consistency of race reporting between the last two birth records. The report 		concludes that (1) the number of women reporting more than one race increases 		when the race questions include a multiracial cue or "mark all that apply" 		format; (2) women who report more than one race are more likely to enter two 		specific races rather than a term like multiracial; (3) among the mothers whose 		parents who were two or more races, self-reports of race on the last two birth 		records are inconsistent 25 percent of the time; and (4) self-reports of race 		are different 40 percent of the time between the birth record and the standard 		version of the mail survey.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Management and 		Operational Impacts of HIV Prevention Community Planning: Lessons Learned at 		Mid-Course and Implications for Future Activities</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>HIV 		Prevention Community Planning, implemented in January 1994, represented a major 		policy change in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding policy. 		Prior to that time, State, territorial, and local health department grantees 		with prevention funds were required to spend most of their cooperative 		agreement funds on counseling and testing services. A new emphasis on planning 		through HIV Prevention Community Planning requires grantees to set their own 		HIV prevention priorities locally through a process that emphasizes input from 		the affected communities and relevant technical experts. This project broadly 		evaluated the policy impact of this new planning process on grantees' HIV 		prevention programs as demonstrated by budgetary and operational indicators. 		This is an issue of national importance, as the HIV prevention community 		planning process affects over $200 million dollars in HIV prevention funds 		across the country. This first phase of a two-phase project ascertained how 		community planning is confirming, enhancing, and changing HIV prevention 		programs. A methodology for obtaining information on the indicators for a 		retrospective study was also developed and piloted during this phase of the 		study. The report finds that (1) a prospective and iterative approach to 		planning, implementation, and assessment is the most valuable approach; (2) in 		a prospective approach, the baseline is the set of circumstances extant at the 		beginning of the process, and site-specific goals and objectives are developed 		and tracked; and (3) more detailed guidance addressing these issues could help 		operationalize this kind of approach. Finally, the report finds that the 		indicators offering the most promise are (1) correspondence between the 		community plan, proposed activities, and undertaken activities; (2) quality 		assurance for implementation; and (3) capacity building and infrastructure 		development.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>CDC's Early 		Implementation of GPRA: A Case Study--July 1995 to November 		1996</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) stresses the importance 		of government agencies' monitoring their results or outcomes in order to 		improve their management of associated processes and outputs. GPRA mandates 		that each agency produce a 5-year strategic plan and a 1-year performance plan 		by September 1997. This report offers a record of the experience of the Centers 		for Disease Control and Prevention in its early implementation of GPRA. It 		documents the process, summarizes key findings, and recommends strategies and 		approaches for the ongoing implementation of GPRA. The report finds that (1) 		implementation during the study phase did not proceed at the anticipated rate 		(instead of a fully developed strategic plan and pilot performance plans, most 		of the effort has concentrated on a strategic plan that is not yet 		drafted-little attention has been paid to the performance plans); (2) the role 		and responsibilities of the GPRA Implementation Team (GIT) evolved over the 		study period; (3) the GIT suffered from shifting membership, lack of continuity 		in meeting attendance, and an overall insufficient level of effort; (4) more 		effective and comprehensive planning and coordination was needed; and (5) 		despite the large amount of time and effort devoted to GPRA, the levels and 		types of commitment and resources fell short of what was needed. The report 		also concludes that insufficient momentum, commitment, and resources were a 		greater problem than ineffective planning; the process could have benefitted 		from greater executive staff involvement early on; and the process was often 		frustrating for participants. The report recommends that (1) organizational 		change efforts be unified under a high-level champion or team; (2) the Office 		of Program Planning and Evaluation's charge of implementing GPRA requirements 		be maintained; (3) the GIT be revamped; and (4) realistic budget be developed, 		requested, and executed. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Collaborating 		with Managed Care Organizations for Mammography Screening and Rescreening: 		Guidance for NBCCEDP Grantees</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Clinical 		trials show that mammography screening among women aged 50-69 years can reduce 		mortality from breast cancer by as much as 30 to 40 percent. Thus, more 		complete mammography screening coverage is needed throughout the Nation. This 		project was undertaken with a dual purpose: (1) to evaluate strategies used in 		the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) to 		reach women 50 years and older for the early detection of breast cancer; and 		(2) to assess potential partnership opportunities between public health and 		managed care organizations to increase the coverage of mammography screening. 		Currently, all States, the 5 territories, and 25 American Indian tribes are 		funded by the NBCCEDP to establish and manage comprehensive breast and cervical 		cancer screening services for women who are minorities, low-income, and age 50 		or older, a population that seeks mammography services less often than other 		women because of cost, knowledge, and other barriers. The report notes that the 		increased use of managed care organizations (MCOs) by State Medicaid programs 		offers new opportunities and incentives to build partnerships between NBCCEDP 		grantees and MCOs. The report finds that (1) because grantees give priority to 		women who are low-income, uninsured, racial minorities, or Native American, 		special attention must be paid to educating and building relationships with 		MCOs in outreach, case management, and followup; (2) both sectors will benefit 		from data partnerships and community collaborations; (3) most current MCO 		efforts in the area of breast and cervical cancer detection are data-driven and 		office-based; and (4) health plans target providers more than patients to 		increase their attention to the prevention effort. The report also addresses 		opportunities for collaboration, barriers to and facilitators of such 		collaboration, and strategies that programs might use to enhance screening 		efforts.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Reaching Women 		for Mammography Screening: Successful Strategies of National Breast and 		Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) 		Grantees</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This guide 		presents successful strategies used by grantees of the National Breast and 		Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) to reach women in need of 		mammography screening-in particular low-income women, underserved and uninsured 		women, and women from communities of color. This information is presented to 		help grantees reach these marginalized populations by sharing strategies that 		their peer grantees have found successful. This information will also be useful 		for private sector and other organizations that are working to provide 		prevention services to hard-to-reach groups. Five categories of strategies are 		examined: inreach, public education, outreach, policies and procedures, and 		coalition and partnership development. While all of these strategies are 		different, several common themes underlie them all: (1) organizations must 		consider broad partnerships to reach marginalized populations who, because of 		their complicated lives, may not seek out care for themselves; (2) aggressive 		outreach may be needed to work with agencies and individuals who are most 		frequently in contact with these populations; (3) organizations should consider 		their infrastructure, not just outreach, to bring women in (health care 		organizations or health plans with a designated group of clients will find 		inreach more effective than outreach in the short term); (4) while the natural 		tendency is to focus on the relationship between the direct caregiver 		(especially the physician) and the patient, women are more likely to return for 		rescreening and to comply with followup regimens if a welcoming atmosphere is 		created by the entire office; and (5) the successful strategies show that there 		are diverse resources available for programs, but that innovation is needed 		when developing partnerships.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluation 		Design for the Business Responds to AIDS (BRTA) Program</i></b> 		</p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Business Responds to AIDS program (BRTA) is a public-private initiative 		partnership undertaken by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 		Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention to help businesses create and implement 		comprehensive HIV/AIDS workplace programs. To better understand how worksites 		are engaged in health promotion efforts, the BRTA Program conducted a national 		probability survey (the BRTA Benchmark Survey) to track progress since 1992. 		This project conducts a secondary analysis of the BRTA Benchmark Survey in 		order to provide recommendations about future evaluation designs that rely 		heavily on national communication channels. While much of the survey addressed 		issues related to HIV/AIDS, a number of questions were included that help track 		trends in worksite policies, screening programs, and health promotion 		activities. Results from this survey were compared to those gathered in a 1992 		Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion survey of health promotion 		and disease prevention in the worksite. The report finds that (1) recent trends 		in worksite health promotion efforts seem to show increases in worksite 		policies, but no changes or decreases in classes or screening programs; (2) 		having a worksite policy may be less costly to implement than classes or 		screening programs (these policy interventions may also be more cost-effective 		than other types of interventions); and (3) the downward trend may result from 		some measurement bias introduced by asking questions about health promotion 		classes and screening programs only of those respondents to the BRTA Benchmark 		Survey who said they had had some health promotion program in the past 12 		months.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Case Studies 		of the Prevention Marketing Initiatives (PMI) Local Demonstration Site 		Projects: Experiences During Planning and Transition 		Phases</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Prevention Marketing Initiative (PMI) is a social marketing program intended to 		influence behaviors that contribute to the sexual transmission of HIV and other 		sexually transmitted diseases among young people below 25 years of age. PMI 		includes among its components locally funded demonstration sites, which combine 		community participation with social marketing and behavioral science 		methodology and theory in order to design, implement, and sustain viable 		prevention programs. The PMI case study gathered in-depth information at these 		sites to describe the experiences of program participants over a 2-year period 		spanning two major project phases: planning and transition to implementation. 		The study highlights participants' reflections on what was done to foster 		achievement of PMI's goals, as well as what could be avoided in the future. The 		qualitative information gathered will be used to contextualize quantitative 		evaluation data collected as sites move through the implementation phase of 		PMI. The report finds that PMI had the following effect: (1) increased 		collaboration among community organizations and individuals on HIV prevention; 		(2) increased youth involvement in planning HIV prevention activities after 		some initial floundering in this area; (3) there is some weak evidence of 		increased support for HIV prevention programs within the community; and (4) 		increased participants' knowledge of, and sensitivity to, social marketing 		methodologies. The report also makes several recommendations on two levels: 		those that can be applied to new PMI sites and to other community-based 		ventures and those that pertain to PMI in particular. A,ong these 		recommendations are (1) define and become familiar with the community, (2) 		learn to manage issues and be realistic, (3) maintain diversity and enforce 		rules, (4) be clear with the lead agency, and (5) have the staff in place to 		provide needed technical and management services.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluability 		Assessment of CDC-Funded Traumatic Brain Injury and Spinal Cord Injury 		Programs</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In 1988, 		the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) created the Disabilities 		Prevention Program (DPP) to reduce the incidence and severity of primary and 		secondary disabilities in the United States and to promote the independence and 		productivity of persons with disabilities. This report was commissioned to 		assess the feasibility of conducting an evaluation of the traumatic brain 		injury and spinal cord injury (TBI/SCI) programs funded through the DPP, the 		National Center for Environmental Health, and CDC. Interviews were conducted 		with Federal and State staff with a background or interest in DPP, external 		stakeholders, and with program staff in eight States. Interview data were used 		to prepare a logic model of State-level TBI/SCI programs, along with a set of 		measurable program components that match the activities and the objectives set 		forth in the logic model. The report finds that (1) there is a consensus among 		all stakeholders on the goals, activities, and objectives of the TBI/SCI 		capacity building programs' intended goals and on indicators that can be used 		to measure attainment; and (2) identifying the logic model and framework of 		measurable components for these programs offers many benefits. In order to 		strengthen CDC-State partnerships, the report recommends: (1) an appropriate 		balance in the partnership that allows States to be flexible but also provides 		parameters to ensure consistency; (2) the provision of regular, consistent 		feedback on State plans, activities, quarterly reports, and surveillance data; 		(3) grounding program design and decisions on valid data, whenever possible (in 		the absence of data, programs should proceed with a phased approach involving 		both the CDC and the States in the evolutionary learning process); and (4) the 		expansion of partnerships at the Federal, State, and community levels.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Community 		Context Study: Minors' Access to Tobacco</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		project represents the first phase of a national study designed to profile the 		relationship between youths' access to tobacco and the contextual variables 		that define communities' policies, attitudes, and activities regarding youth 		and tobacco. The results of the study have implications for local, State, and 		Federal policies and programs. The basic conceptual model postulates that 		community forces will initiate and/or enhance local enforcement efforts. 		Enforcement will affect vendor behavior, which will then restrict minors' 		access to-and thereby, use of-tobacco. To address the questions raised by the 		conceptual model, data collection and analysis for this project were conducted 		in three parts: (1) telephone interviews with tobacco vendors and community 		leaders, and purchase attempts in stores in 20 communities; (2) in-person 		interviews with community leaders in ten case-study communities; and (3) 		analysis of teen tobacco use data from the 1995 Youth Risk Behavior Study 		(YRBS), collected by CDC for the same 20 communities. The report finds that (1) 		adolescents have little difficulty buying cigarettes in retail outlets; (2) 		even in restrictive communities, some stores would sell tobacco to minors; (3) 		the most important deterrent of sales to minors is asking for proof of age; (4) 		the presence of tobacco sales warning signs is associated with a lower sale 		rate; (5) community support for tobacco control promotes merchant compliance 		with the law; and (6) even a perception of enforcement acts as a strong 		deterrent to selling tobacco to minors. The report recommends that (1) the 		study should be expanded as a followup to the 1997 YRBS in sampled communities, 		(2) a question about the location of sources of retail purchase should be added 		to the YRBS, and (3) the expanded community context study should be fielded as 		soon as possible.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Directions for 		Research on the National Immunization Survey: Final 		Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		National Immunization Survey (NIS) measures the immunization levels among young 		children in each State and in large metropolitan areas on a quarterly basis. 		This survey recently came under review, and questions about the cost of the 		survey and the utility of the data were raised. This report reviews the survey 		and develops a plan for determining whether less expensive methods could be 		used and still yield a statistically sound survey that meets the needs of the 		National Immunization Program. The report finds that (1) the NIS is a 		well-designed response to a very difficult set of goals posed by the Centers 		for Disease Control and Prevention; (2) dramatic cost reductions (i.e., 30 		percent or larger) could not be achieved without major changes in survey 		objectives or quality; (3) there is greater potential for cost savings in the 		area of data collection than in analysis, since the volume of the survey makes 		refined systems for data collection economically feasible; (4) the high data 		analysis costs for the survey are well justified; (5) the survey meets the need 		for monitoring trends at the national level and can also be used to identify 		Immunization Action Plan (IAP) areas with either very poor or outstanding 		immunization levels; and (6) the survey can differentiate the immunization 		rates for reasonably small demographic groups annually, and can be used to 		monitor immunization trends at the IAP level, but only on an annual or biennial 		basis. The report concludes that the relative emphasis on IAP-level statistics 		and on national statistics should perhaps be adjusted-in the justification of 		the survey, in the design of the household interview, and in the choice of 		statistics to publish. It recommends that the schedule for publication of 		IAP-level statistics be cut back to an annual schedule and that new 		publications on national statistics for domains of interest be developed to 		fill the publication schedule. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>In Her Own 		Words: A Focus Group Study of Risk and Protective Factors in Intimate Partner 		Violence</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This study 		was designed to provide insights into how African-American and Caucasian women 		in urban and rural settings perceive the factors that placed them at risk for 		an abusive relationship, as well as the factors that protected them from 		further violence during and after the relationship. The model used as the 		conceptual framework for the study (Prochaska's and DiClemente's 		Transtheoretical Model) depicts a sequence of five stages that culminate in 		lasting behavior change. Twenty-two focus groups were conducted in urban and 		rural areas in Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Oregon. One hundred and 		sixty-eight women participated in the study, ranging in age from 18 to 60; all 		had been out of their abusive relationships from 6 months to 24 years. The 		report finds that (1) the long-term effects of emotional and physical abuse are 		worse than the actual violence and resulting injuries themselves; (2) a wide 		range of psychologically and physically abusive acts were described by focus 		group participants, including abuse not only of themselves but also of children 		and of pets; (3) most focus group participants concluded that anything could be 		a trigger to violence, and that this realization was a significant contributor 		to the terror, fear, and desperation they felt in their relationships; (4) 		participants agreed that a number of problem behaviors, such as a history of 		violence at home, extreme charm, possessiveness, and explosive rage, are early 		warning signs of abuse; and (5) women describe the decision to leave the 		abusive relationship as the result of a breaking point. The report concludes 		that this study's findings should be validated in a national telephone survey 		of women's risk and protective factors for intimate partner violence.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Linking 		Research and Public Health Practice: A Review of CDC's Program of Centers for 		Research and Demonstration of Health Promotion and Disease 		Prevention</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In order 		to advance research in health promotion and disease prevention, the Centers for 		Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established a program of university-based 		Centers for Research and Demonstration of Health Promotion and Disease 		Prevention. The prevention research center (PRC) program began in 1986 with 		funding to three universities; in 1996, there were 13 PRCs. This report 		examines the extent to which the PRC program is providing the public health 		community with workable strategies to address major public health problems in 		disease prevention and health promotion. The report finds that (1) by forging 		links with academia, CDC has created a gateway for access to a cadre of 		well-trained, university-based researchers who could serve to inform and 		collaborate with the agency and the public health community regarding health 		promotion and disease prevention; (2) the PRC has made substantial progress in 		advancing the scientific infrastructure in support of disease and health 		promotion policy, programs, and practices; (3) each of the centers has made 		some contributions toward one or more of the goals of the program (research, 		dissemination, and developing connections with the community and public health 		practitioners); (4) there are substantial differences among the PRCs in the 		kinds of activities they have undertaken and the success realized (only a few 		have made substantial progress in all areas); and (5) CDC's management of the 		program has been creative in the face of limited resources relative to its 		mandate-dogged in pursuing the mandate over a 10-year period in a bureaucratic 		environment that was not created or structured for the management of 		university-based research programs, and skilled in enhancing a sense of 		community and networking among the funded centers in a time of disappointing 		funding levels.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Syphilis in 		the South: A Case Study Assessment in Eight Southern 		Communities</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		two-volume report presents the results of a comparative case study of 		local-level syphilis prevention efforts that are conducted as part of sexually 		transmitted disease (STD) prevention programs supported by the Centers for 		Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The case studies were conducted in eight 		communities in four Southern States: Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and 		Tennessee. The project investigated past and current responses of the public 		and private health sectors to a syphilis epidemic that occurred in the southern 		United States between 1990 and 1992. Study findings were developed around four 		key questions: (1) who is at greatest risk of syphilis infection and 		transmission, (2) what institutions are best able to reach those at greatest 		risk, (3) what are the barriers to syphilis prevention and control in 		communities, and (4) what innovative ways have been found to transcend these 		barriers? The report finds that (1) interviewees perceived African Americans to 		be the demographic group most at risk for infection and transmission of 		syphilis, especially those who exchanged sex for drugs, homeless people, and 		incarcerated individuals; (2) adolescent high-risk sexual behavior was of 		concern as a possible precursor to infection once practitioners reached their 		20s; (3) local health departments are the only community organizations focusing 		directly on syphilis and other STD control and prevention; (4) public health 		agencies assigned priority to disease control and engaged in few agency-based 		prevention activities, and schools were limited in their ability to be venues 		for STD prevention messages due to the local restrictions on sexually explicit 		materials in health education curricula; and (5) barriers to those at greatest 		risk of syphilis infection are cultural, programmatic, and political. 		Recommendations are offered in a manner designed to allow practical 		implementation. (Vol. I: 121 pages, plus appendices; Vol. II: 100 		pages.) </p>

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		three-volume report provides a systematic evaluation of the programmatic impact 		of 1-percent evaluation studies carried out by the Centers for Disease Control 		and Prevention (CDC) between 1990 and 1995. The study was also designed to 		elicit information about what the Office of Program Planning and Evaluation 		could do to enhance the impact of 1-percent evaluation studies. The study 		resulted in findings in three major areas: (1) the perception at CDC of 		evaluation in general, (2) the perception at CDC of the 1-percent process in 		particular, and (3) the programmatic impact to date of 1-percent evaluation 		studies at CDC. Among the findings were that: (1) although pressure for program 		accountability is mounting, evaluation still engenders anxiety among some CDC 		program staff-although these attitudes are changing slowly; (2) program staff 		are concerned that the 1-percent evaluation process in particular is 		unpredictable-staff do not know from one year to the next how much 1-percent 		funding they will receive, and the time allowed between the issuance of 		1-percent guidance and the deadline for submissions is perceived as too short; 		(3) despite numerous obstacles to implementation, nearly 70 percent of the 		recommendations developed in the evaluation studies examined for this report 		have been considered for implementation and about 50 percent have been 		implemented in some form; and (4) CDC evaluations have produced programmatic 		impact leading to changes in practices and procedures, activities, 		responsibilities, changes in full-time equivalents, budgets, organizational and 		administrative structures, and policy. Specific recommendations are made in the 		report and are arrayed according to project phases (study selection, design, 		implementation, recommendation, and dissemination stages).

During a process of reviewing nearly 50 CDC 		evaluations completed between 1990 and 1995 and about 40 additional studies in 		various stages of completion, it became apparent that these studies were 		important to CDC program staff in particular and to the field of public health 		in general. Many common themes ran through these evaluations: (1) the 		difficulties of monitoring the performance of public health programs; (2) the 		growing importance of community outreach and mobilization; (3) the evolving 		role of health communications in CDC's work; and (4) concerns over the impact 		of managed care on the public health sector. This directory includes both 		completed and in-process studies. Project summaries reflect a project's 		reported status as of August 1995.

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Fiscal 		year 1997 (FY 97) marks the fifth and final year of the implementation of the 		Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of 1992, which authorizes the collection 		of fees from the pharmaceutical industry in order to facilitate the Food and 		Drug Administration's (FDA's) timely review of human drug applications. The Act 		mandates that FDA prepare yearly reports for each fiscal year for which fees 		are collected. The fifth annual report, prepared in response to that mandate, 		covers FY 97 and reports on how well the FDA has accomplished the performance 		goals it established for FY 97. These performance-related goals were jointly 		established by the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry and fall into three main 		categories: (1) elimination of overdue backlogs, (2) building excellence into 		the review process, and (3) achievement of high performance. Seven goals were 		in effect for FY 97. The findings in the report show that the successes 		reported last year have been confirmed and surpassed. The report finds that (1) 		PDUFA has resulted in more and better applications filed, which can be accepted 		immediately and reviewed and approved more quickly; (2) nearly all applications 		now go directly into the review process (due to the increased quality of the 		applications, very few are refused); (3) there are more approvals on first 		review, which demonstrates that submission quality is a key factor in achieving 		timely reviews; and (4) the ultimate approval time for applications in the 		PDUFA years has dramatically decreased. While only a preliminary performance 		assessment of FY 97 is possible at this time, it is clear that the Act's 		stringent review goals have assured that new pharmaceutical products are 		getting onto the market at an unprecedented rate without compromising safety.

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The Food 		and Drug Administration (FDA) is charged with ensuring that accessibility to 		quality mammography services is maintained for all facilities performing 		mammographies in accordance with the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992 		(MQSA). Under this statute, the FDA is required to certify and annually inspect 		over 10,000 mammography facilities. Prior to the passage of the MQSA, FDA's 		oversight responsibility was limited to approving new mammographic processors, 		x-rays, and tubing. However, MQSA requires that facilities within its 		jurisdiction meet standards developed by the agency to ensure a reasonable 		level of quality in order to achieve certification by the agency. FDA is 		concerned that recent trends by third-party payers to attract payments for 		mammography services have severely limited the ability of facilities to absorb 		any cost increases caused by the quality standards. These cost increases, as 		well as excess capacity, may cause low-volume facilities to leave the industry. 		This project addresses these problems in two ways. First, it measures the 		effect of standards on patient access to mammography, especially in rural 		areas; second, it develops a cost model that will be used to predict the impact 		of proposed standards on the costs of providing mammography. The contractor 		reviewed records from over 10,000 facilities that had applied for accreditation 		and over 500 that had ceased operations. In the Spring of 1996, the contractor 		drafted the results of a cost-benefit analysis, which FDA managers will use to 		develop a performance-oriented regulatory policy that will be coordinated with 		existing customers. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Mammography 		Quality Standards Act: Second Annual Government Entity Declaration Program 		Audit</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The Food 		and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Division of Mammography Quality and Radiation 		Programs requested that the Division of Planning, Analysis, and Finance conduct 		an audit of the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) Government Entity (GE) 		Declaration Program. There are two main goals of the audit: (1) to notify 		facilities that they will be held accountable for their self-certification of 		fee exemption, and (2) to determine the rate of compliance with the program. A 		random sample of 90 facilities out of the 989 claiming GE status was selected 		for examination, and a random sample of 20 (out of 72) new GE facilities was 		also examined. The audit revealed that (1) only 3 of the 90 GE facilities had 		claimed GE status incorrectly, and only 1 of the 20 new GE facilities had 		claimed incorrect status; and (2) the 3 GE facilities (as well as the one new 		GE facility) that did not meet FDA's fee-exempt status claimed that exemption 		based on funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 		Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention Program, which is the least common way to 		claim fee exemption. Based on these results, the audit concludes that the GE 		Declaration program appears to be quite effective. It also suggests several 		recommendations based on the findings of the audit. These include that: (1) the 		results should be published to allow the impact of the audit to reach many, if 		not all, the facilities, to discourage any future misrepresentations, and to 		demonstrate that FDA will exercise its authority; (2) the sample size of future 		audits should be smaller and should contain a larger portion of those 		facilities claiming fee exemption based solely on funding from the CDC; and (3) 		the MQSA contractor in charge of billing should continue to thoroughly examine 		each GE Declaration form to ensure that it identifies the body operating the 		facility.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Product Review 		Performance Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This is 		the first annual report analyzing the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) 		performance in reviewing applications for human drugs, biological products, 		medical devices, food and color additives, and veterinary drugs. In the past, 		FDA has measured the length of review using measures that varied for different 		product categories, making it difficult to provide an agency-wide assessment of 		the FDA's performance. Responding to legislation such as the Prescription Drug 		User Fee Act of 1992 (PDUFA), as well as to requirements under the Federal 		Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA has developed clear performance goals for 		reviewing new product applications. Setting these goals has provided a valuable 		management tool for identifying performance expectations and assessing 		achievements, and for meeting the requirements of the Government Performance 		and Results Act of 1993. FDA has also developed performance measures and 		reporting conventions that can be used to report on product review performance 		consistently across product categories. The report looks at four different 		measures of the FDA's performance: (1) how often FDA is meeting statutory and 		nonstatutory time frames for review of each category of products, (2) the 		median length of time to approval for each product category, (3) the total 		number of products approved in each category, and (4) the number of 		applications for which an action was overdue at the end of the fiscal year 		(FY). It provides FDA's on-time performance for FY 1993, 1994, and 1995 and 		performance data for the other three categories for FY 1993 to 1996. The report 		finds that (1) for most categories of products, FDA has improved its 		performance since FY 1993; (2) the greatest improvements in performance have 		occurred for product reviews covered by PDUFA; (3) significant progress has 		been made in reviewing applications for medical devices; and (4) on-time 		performance for reviews of non-PDUFA applications should be 		improved. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluation of 		Device Performance in the Determination of Substantial 		Equivalence</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Many 		diagnostic medical devices that reach the market are based on diagnostic 		agreement with some device already on the market that targets the same 		attribute. Agreement is often assessed by side-by-side testing of the same 		subjects or specimens, even if the true disease status is unknown. If each new 		test is compared with the most recent predicate, what would be the effect on 		device performance over time? Would it deteriorate, remain the same, or 		improve? This analysis attempts to address these questions using statistical 		measures of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. A Monto Carlo 		simulation was used to study this question of "predicate (pre-Amendments or 		reclassified post-Amendments) creep." Contingency tables were randomly 		generated using a range of conditional probabilities and prevalence 		representing screening and confirmatory test data. When a new test was found to 		be equivalent to the current predicate, it became the new predicate. After 50 		new predicates were found, a forecast procedure was applied to the sequence of 		50 performance parameters in order to evaluate the long-term 		trend. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Cost of 		Restrictions on Gulf Oyster Harvesting for Control of </i>Vibrio 		vulnificus-<i>Caused Disease</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This study 		for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates the costs of a seasonal 		harvesting restriction on Gulf of Mexico oysters and a seasonal marketing 		restriction on the sale of Gulf oysters for raw consumption. These measures 		would control oyster-related illnesses in humans known to be caused by the 		bacterial species <b><i>Vibrio vulnificus,</i></b> which naturally occurs in 		estuarine waters and is a normal flora for oysters. During this study, the 1995 		Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference (ISSC) adopted a <b><i>Vibrio 		vulnificus</i></b> interim control plan for oysters and the report compares the 		costs of complying with the ISSC plan with FDA's suggested alternatives. The 		ISSC interim control plan (1) states that oysters must be under ambient 		refrigeration at 45 degrees Fahrenheit within a specified time if they are 		harvested from State waters that were the confirmed source for two or more 		<b><i>Vibrio vulnificus</i> </b>illnesses; (2) establishes action levels for 		growing areas within affected States; and (3) varies the time-to-refrigeration 		requirement according to the average monthly maximum water temperature. The 		report estimates the economic impact of alternative remedies for controlling 		<b><i>Vibrio vulnificus-</i></b>related illnesses and concludes that (1) the 		in-shell marketing restriction might have imposed large economic impacts on the 		Gulf oyster industry and other related sectors of the economy; (2) the ISSC 		time and temperature controls would have smaller aggregate economic impacts 		than the marketing restriction option but the distributional effects of this 		policy should be considered; and (3) the ISSC impacts are sensitive to specific 		assumptions about enforcement of the rule and types of responses, engendered by 		the regulated entities.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Health 		Transfers: An Application of Health-Health Analysis to Assess Food Safety 		Regulation</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Public 		health policy decisions usually focus on reducing a target risk. However, 		complying with regulations to reduce a risk is expensive. Because income 		influences health, Health-Health Analysis (HHA) was developed to compare the 		targeted reduction in mortality to the induced mortality from income losses. 		This study applies HHA to assess a potential Gulf oyster harvesting ban to 		control mortality from the consumption of oysters contaminated by <b><i>Vibrio 		vulnificus.</i></b> The report estimates the induced deaths using Anderson et 		al.'s estimate of economic losses and Keeney's estimate of the functional 		relations between income and mortality. The report shows that while a 7-month 		Gulf oyster harvesting ban might eliminate the estimated 17 oyster-related 		deaths annually, it may also cause as many as 12 income-loss-related deaths. 		The induced deaths occur principally among white males and black females. The 		report concludes that (1) HHA may give decisionmakers reason to pause 		considering the high costs of a harvesting ban and that consumption of raw 		oysters is completely voluntary; and (2) this illustration shows that HHA 		serves as a useful policy analysis tool.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Preliminary 		Investigation into the Morbidity and Mortality Associated with the Consumption 		of Fruit and Vegetable Juices</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Americans 		consumed 2.3 billion gallons of the major fruit and vegetable juices in 1995. 		Recent outbreaks of illnesses associated with the consumption of juices 		demonstrate their potential as a human health hazard. As part of the 		cost-benefit analysis for both the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point 		(HACCP) and labeling rules associated with fruit and vegetable juices, the 		Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition's working group was asked to 		investigate the morbidity and mortality associated with human consumption of 		juice drinks. The standard procedure for estimating human health benefits is to 		(1) estimate the baseline numbers of illnesses and deaths associated with the 		compound to be controlled, (2) estimate the likely reductions in those 		illnesses and deaths associated with various proposed control options, and (3) 		estimate the values associated with the reduced illnesses and deaths. This 		report estimates the baseline numbers of illnesses and deaths likely to be 		associated with the consumption of juice products. The study (1) describes 		juice products, (2) estimates juice consumption, (3) discusses production 		methods, (4) explains how hazards might be introduced into juice, (5) discusses 		evidence on illness from consuming juices, (6) describes human health effects 		caused by selected microbial pathogens, and (7) discusses the physical and 		chemical hazards associated with juices. Juices accounted for 447 		laboratory-confirmed cases of illness associated with microbial pathogens, 		according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outbreak data and U.S. 		Food and Drug Administration recall data from 1993 through 1996. The other 		hazards, mostly physical and chemical, that have been found in juices have been 		sporadic and associated with fewer cases than the microbial pathogens.

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Small 		communities in rural America are struggling to maintain health care resources 		in the face of increasing competition and a dwindling population and economic 		base. In response to the threatened survival of small rural hospitals, the 		Health Care Financing Administration has supported two initiatives to introduce 		innovative limited-service hospitals: the Essential Access Community 		Hospital/Rural Primary Care Hospital (EACH-RPCH) program, implemented in seven 		States; and the Medical Assistance Facility (MAF) demonstration in Montana. 		Both establish a new Medicare provider that is exempt from specific key 		requirements of participation, and both offer enhanced reimbursement. Other 		States have looked to these two programs as possible models for their rural 		communities. This report documents the evaluation of the EACH-RPCH program from 		its start in October 1991 through September 1994. The report assesses the 		implementation process, initial operating experience, and potential impact of 		the programs on access and cost as related to limited hospital service. The 		introductory chapter reviews the background of the EACH-RPCH and MAF programs, 		discusses the evaluation issues to be examined, and summarizes the evaluation 		methodology and data sources. Chapters II and III examine the development of 		networks and the shift to limited service licensure under the EACH-RPCH 		program. Chapter IV reviews the implementation and operation of the MAF 		demonstration. Chapters V and VI focus on the two programs' impact on access to 		care and mechanisms for quality assurance, respectively. The report concludes 		with Chapter VII, which assesses the impact of both programs on facility 		finances and the Medicare program. (Final report: 260 pages, plus 		appendices.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Comparative 		Study of the Use of EPSDT and Other Preventive and Curative Health Care 		Services by Children Enrolled in Medicaid: Final Project Synthesis 		Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report includes (1) a description of the Medicaid program in Michigan, Georgia, 		Tennessee, and California and these States' responses to the Omnibus Budget 		Reconciliation Act of 1989 provisions relating to children's and Medicaid 		coverage and on the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) 		program; (2) results of analyses of the impact of these responses on 		participating providers and enrolled children; and (3) an assessment of the 		national context through a review of the national survey data analyses. It 		finds that (1) State efforts to increase provider participation in Medicaid and 		EPSDT included recruitment activities, training in billing, and increased fees; 		(2) the States' efforts were successful in increasing provider participation 		and average caseloads among all types of providers, except for dentists in 		Michigan, which declined 10 percent from 1989 to 1992; (3) these increases may 		not have been adequate to meet the increased demand from a growing caseload; 		(4) the ratios of Medicaid children to participating providers and the 		percentages of counties with provider shortages rose from 1989 to 1992 in all 		four study States; (5) counting all EPSDT and all other well-child visits paid 		for by Medicaid, only 42 to 54 percent of Medicaid children were recommended to 		have preventive care visits, and of these, only 36 to 59 percent made the 		recommended visits; (6) compared with other low-income children, Medicaid 		coverage increased service use and improved access to illness-related care; and 		(7) Medicaid children had very low completion rates for age-appropriate 		immunizations, from 48 percent in Michigan to 61 percent in Georgia in 1992. 		The report concludes that State efforts to expand the EPSDT provider base and 		to enhance outreach had significant impacts on the use of preventive, 		diagnostic, and treatment services.

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report studies the appropriateness of providing case management services to 		beneficiaries with catastrophic illnesses and high medical costs. The study 		tests case management as a way of controlling costs in the fee-for-service 		sector. These demonstrations, mandated by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 		1990, and are aimed at a number of chronic illnesses, including congestive 		heart failure. The resulting demonstrations were implemented in three sites, 		began operations in October 1993, and continued through November 1995. The 		target conditions and case management protocols differed in each site, though 		all three generally focused on increased education regarding proper patient 		monitoring and management of the target chronic condition. All three sites 		anticipated reduced hospitalizations and medical costs compared to the 		beneficiary control groups. (Final report: 216 pages, plus 		appendices.) </p>

The 		evaluator examines three areas: (1) organizational and financial 		characteristics and evolution over time, (2) impact on the organization of 		service delivery and use of services, and (3) financial impact on providers and 		the Medicaid program in Utah. The development of the demonstration proceeded 		fairly smoothly, albeit somewhat more slowly than planned. Three centers chose 		to enter the demonstration and eight chose to not join.

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report assisted the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in tracking the 		3-year demonstration that tested the concept of a single global Medicare 		payment for outpatient cataract procedures. The payment amount represented 		payment for the physician, facility, and intraocular lens costs. The analysis 		portion of the project tested whether there were any net savings to the 		Medicare program, changes in the use of services included and excluded from the 		bundle, beneficiary satisfaction, and quality of care. The evaluation found 		that the project was reasonably successful in encouraging provider flexibility 		and in managing the bundle of services. There was ample anecdotal evidence that 		the cost effectiveness incentives were working; e.g., cost reduction efforts by 		surgeons in the techniques and time required to perform the surgery and actions 		to standardize the interocular lenses and other supplies and materials. While 		the effort to become a part of the demonstration was substantial, once 		operations began, government activities related to pricing were greatly reduced 		and limited to simple verification and payment of the global fee. The evaluator 		was not able to measure appropriateness, but in terms of quality control and 		utilization review the demonstration was successful in that the outcomes were 		unchanged. The project did produce some insights into the strengths and 		weaknesses of particular incentives in encouraging providers to participate. 		However, it provided limited new information on what factors influenced 		beneficiaries to participate. </p>

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		project evaluated three demonstration project conducted in Maine, South 		Carolina, and Washington State. These demonstrations, implemented in response 		to a Congressional mandate under section 4745 of the Omnibus Budget 		Reconciliation Act of 1990, tested the effect of allowing States to extend 		Medicaid coverage to low-income families.

An initial series of site visits was conducted during 1993. The first annual 		report in the series used data collected during these site visits and data from 		State-administered baseline surveys to describe the implementation phase and 		early operational phase of the demonstrations. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Access to 		Physicians' Services for Vulnerable Beneficiaries: Impact of the Medicare Fee 		Schedule</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In 1992, 		Medicare introduced the Medicare Fee Schedule (MFS), which alters the relative 		prices paid to physicians for services and arguably the incentives to provide 		one service over another. This project evaluates the impact of the MFS on 		individual access to health care. Since the introduction of the MFS, the Health 		Care Financing Administration and the Physician Payment Review Commission have 		monitored access to physicians' services and have failed to document any 		barriers to health care access resulting from the MFS. This study builds on 		this work by (1) oversampling groups of beneficiaries thought to be 		particularly vulnerable to payment changes, (2) evaluating changes in treatment 		patterns for specific episodes of care, and (3) conducting multivariate 		analyses that measure actual payment changes over time rather than expected 		changes due to MFS. A stratified random sampling design took advantage of the 		differential impacts of the MFS across geographic areas and ensured adequate 		numbers of vulnerable beneficiaries. The study divided all geographic areas 		into six groups based on their expected 1992 payment changes under MFS, 		compared with the earlier payment scheme. The report finds that (1) there is 		little evidence that the MFS either improved or worsened health care access for 		Medicare beneficiaries; (2) while some vulnerable groups experienced 		MFS-related changes in access, the actual size of these changes is relatively 		small and is not consistently negative or positive; (3) substantial access gaps 		exist for vulnerable beneficiaries and there is evidence that access to primary 		care may have worsened for dual Medicaid-eligibles; and (4) Medicare 		beneficiaries reduced out-of-pocket payments over the 1991-1993 period, 		including lower copayments and lower extra billing liability.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>A Study of the 		Appropriateness, Process of Care, and Outcomes of Medical Care for Medicaid 		Patients</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Congress requires the Health Care Financing Administration to report on the 		relative quality of care in the Medicaid program. This study assesses the 		variation that exists in the rate of performance of selected treatments and 		procedures provided to Medicaid beneficiaries for small areas within and 		between States. The report's first phase shows that the overall rate of 		inpatient use in the Medicaid population is higher than the rate expected based 		on non-Medicaid utilization patterns. In the report's second phase, data are 		abstracted from medical records at 118 hospitals in California, Georgia, and 		Michigan for a selected series of index diagnoses: pediatric asthma, 		hysterectomy, and complicated labor and delivery. This second phase develops 		five indicators to assess quality: (1) appropriateness to hospitalize or 		perform a procedure, (2) process of care, (3) outcomes of treatments and 		procedures, (4) severity at time of admission, and (5) intensity of care. 		Medicaid-covered children in two States, and women in all three States, are 		younger and represent more minority groups than their privately-insured 		counterparts. The appropriateness of the decision to hospitalize a child with 		asthma, perform a hysterectomy, and do a Cesarean section in the presence of 		labor and delivery complications are comparable between Medicaid and 		privately-insured patients. Most important, the outcomes of care for the two 		groups were essentially similar, for each condition, across the three States. 		Medicaid patients were more seriously ill at admission, which suggests that the 		Medicaid-covered patients may not be practicing the same level of preventative 		care as their privately-insured counterparts. As a result, the differences in 		patient outcomes were not a result of the inpatient quality of care provided. 		The inpatient care for the Medicaid patients was considered adequate and 		comparable with care received by privately-insured patients. (Final report: 46 		pages.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>An Evaluation 		of Implementation of the Medicaid Community Supported Living Arrangements 		(CLSA) Program in Eight States</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report describes the effectiveness of developing a continuum-of-care concept as 		an alternative to the Medicaid-funded residential services provided to 		individuals with mental retardation and related conditions. The program serves 		individuals who are living in the community either independently, with their 		families, or in homes with three or fewer other individuals receiving the same 		services. These services were provided in eight States between fiscal years 		1991 and 1995. By the end of the program only 73 percent of the expected number 		of individuals were receiving services in the Community Supported Living 		Arrangement (CSLA), and the expenditures were only 58 percent ($38.4 million) 		of the amount authorized. A number of factors contributed to this 		smaller-than-expected program: (1) late 1990 authorization of CSLA and 		subsequent delay in regulations, application procedures, and State selection 		put back the first program enrollments by 16-22 months; (2) simultaneously 		expanded Federal latitude allowed rapid growth of Medicaid Home and Community 		Based Services; (3) implementers found that planning and designing services 		"one person at a time" were slower than expected; (4) States experienced delays 		in establishing the new systems of quality assurance required by the CSLA 		program; and (5) recruitment was sometimes delayed by the inclusion of groups 		of persons who were not traditional users of developmental disabilities 		services and who were not already known to the system. The report concludes 		that specific financing problems limit the effectiveness of the program. (Final 		report: 54 pages.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluation of 		the Community Nursing Organization Demonstration Interim Evaluation 		Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report examines a set of demonstration projects mandated in the Omnibus Budget 		Reconciliation of 1987. The legislation directed the establishment of 		demonstration projects to test a capitated, nurse-managed system of care. The 		two fundamental elements of the demonstration are capitation payment and nurse 		case management. It was designed to promote timely and appropriate use of 		community health services and to reduce the use of costly acute care services. 		By October 1995, more than 5,400 beneficiaries were enrolled in the four 		Community Nursing Organizations (CNOs). The evaluation report covers the first 		15 months of operation. The applicants have been healthier and more 		independent, on average, than the general Medicare population in their 		respective market areas. Analyses of measures of death, physical functioning, 		and satisfaction with care detected no statistically significant differences. 		Analysis of a subsample of persons who were impaired in Activities of Daily 		Living indicated that members of the CNO treatment group were more likely to 		improve (or less likely to deteriorate further) than members of the control. An 		even stronger result, in the same direction, was found for individuals who were 		limited in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. (Final report: variously 		paginated.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluation of 		the Effectiveness of the Operation Restore Trust 		Demonstrations</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Operation 		Restore Trust (ORT) was jointly developed by the Office of Inspector General 		(OIG), the Administration on Aging (AoA), and the Health Care Financing 		Administration (HCFA) as a model to demonstrate improved methods for 		investigation and prosecution of fraud and abuse in health programs. ORT 		targets a set of initiatives that focus on a few States, a few areas of the 		Medicare benefit, and a few standard operating procedures (especially failures 		to coordinate among the most central agencies and to exploit available data 		resources). The report finds that (1) ORT is associated with a net increase of 		more than 100 percent in ORT-type cases investigated by the OIG; (2) these 		cases should generate substantial incremental receivables, some fraction of 		which will translate into true savings as collections are made; (3) HCFA and 		its contractors had a series of successful projects under ORT, with notably 		large collections or avoidances of payment accompanying many of these efforts, 		although it cannot be said with certainty that these savings would not have 		been realized without ORT; (4) ORT encourages several important policy changes 		made during, or immediately following, the demonstration; (5) ORT may have 		important "sentinel effects" (e.g., ORT may have deterred providers from 		certain kinds of suspect behavior); (6) there are considerable process effects 		of ORT; (7) giving the AoA a fraud and abuse mission led to active training, 		outreach, and education efforts; and (8) the infrastructure of information for 		combating fraud and abuse has significantly improved, although these 		improvements include many efforts outside ORT itself. The evaluation concludes 		that ORT turned around certain troubling trends of the early 1990s and has 		brought new vigor to government efforts to combat health care fraud and 		abuse. </p>

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report seeks to determine whether the dissemination of information about health 		plans to consumers (who choose health plans within a managed care competition 		framework) would influence their knowledge of plan characteristics, attitudes 		toward the plans, or choice of plan.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Consequences 		of Paying Medicare HMOs and Health Care Prepayment Plans 		(HCPPs)</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This study 		examined the operational aspects of health care prepayment plans (HCPPs) and 		the cost-effectiveness of cost health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and 		HCPPs. The report contains a case study of HCPPs: it looks at plans' 		utilization management and quality assurance programs, marketing practices, and 		contingency plans in case of insolvency. It also examines the 		cost-effectiveness to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) of cost 		HMOs and HCPPs with respect to the fee-for-service and risk contracting program 		during calendar year 1993. The report found that costs to HCFA increased 		substantially under both the cost HMO and HCPP programs. Cost increases 		relative to fee-for-service were larger than those relative to the risk-based 		approach. Only a handful of the 63 plans examined appeared to have generated 		savings for HCFA. The main reason for the cost increase appears to be a lack of 		incentive for plans to drive hard bargains with physicians on prices. 		Furthermore, the report found that most of the cost-based plans experienced 		favorable selection, where the relatively more healthy segments of the 		population are enrolled.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Toward a 		Prospective Payment System for Outpatient Services: Implementation for 		Outpatient Services-Implementation of APGs by State Medicaid Agencies and 		Private Payers</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report studies a Medicaid outpatient prospective payment system, which groups 		patients for payment purposes rather than paying on a cost basis. These groups 		are similar in concept to diagnosis-related groups, which form the heart of 		Medicare's prospective payment system for inpatient care. It involved a case 		study of Iowa's implementation of the ambulatory patient group (APG) system and 		an analysis of the reimbursement methodology. This report has two components: 		an in-depth study of three operational APG systems (based on site visits) and 		telephone interviews with other payers that have implemented or planned to 		implement the system. All six payers with operational experience tailored their 		APG systems to their own priorities and markets. They all implemented the 		system without major incident. The payers reported success in reducing 		outpatient costs, where that was the immediate goal, and they believe the 		system encourages higher-cost facilities to reduce costs and rewards lower-cost 		facilities. Providers' views were more mixed. Though they reported generally 		adequate overall payment, they also viewed the system as complex, had 		difficulty calculating expected payment, and often let payer computer systems 		group related claims rather than consolidating them prior to submission, as was 		the intent of the system. No evidence was found of much behavioral response by 		providers, but that could change if the system is implemented by a large payer 		such as HCFA. (Final report: 78 pages.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Payment of 		Pharmacists for Cognitive Services: Results of the Washington State C.A.R.E. 		Demonstration Project</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Washington Cognitive Activities and Reimbursement Effectiveness (C.A.R.E.) 		Project was a demonstration authorized under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 		Act of 1990 to assess the impact of a financial incentive on pharmacists' 		performance of cognitive services. The premise of this demonstration was that 		direct reimbursement for pharmacists' cognitive services will remove financial 		barriers associated pharmacists' provision of these services and result in 		increased performance of cognitive services, with a subsequent impact on costs 		and outcomes. Data for the demonstration were drawn from three groups of 		pharmacies located throughout the State of Washington, each of which contained 		about 100 pharmacy sites. Pharmacists in the first two groups documented 		cognitive services for Medicaid patients using a problem-intervention-result 		format. The demonstration phase lasted from February 1994 through September 		1995 and resulted in the documentation of 20,240 cognitive service events. The 		project found that (1) Group A pharmacists, who received financial incentives, 		consistently reported higher cognitive service intervention rates than did 		Group B, who did not receive financial incentives; (2) about half of all 		documented cognitive services problems were for patient-related problems, while 		32.6 percent were for drug-related problems, 17.6 percent for 		prescription-related problems, and 1.4 percent for non-drug-related problems; 		(3) a drug therapy change occurred as a result of 28 percent of all cognitive 		services; (4) for each cognitive service associated with any type of drug 		therapy change, the average downstream drug cost savings was about $13, but 		these savings varied by type of drug therapy; and (5) the Medicaid program 		saved about $78,000 due to cognitive services resulting in drug therapy 		changes. The report concludes that the implementation of a prescription 		drug-related cognitive services documentation and reimbursement system is 		feasible and useful. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Assessing the 		Viability of All-Payer Systems for Inpatient Hospital 		Services</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report explores the feasibility and possible structure of alternative 		approaches to developing an all-payer prospective system for reimbursing 		hospitals for inpatient care. The study tests the practicality of adapting or 		extending Medicare's Prospective Payment System (PPS) to either other payers or 		all payers as part of the health care reform legislation proposed by the 		Clinton Administration in 1993. The initial tasks were the development of data 		files necessary to construct such an all-payer PPS. The most basic components 		of a PPS are payment weights, rates, and adjustors. Separate analytic steps are 		required in order to derive each of these components, and several different 		types of data are required to complete each of these analytic tasks. Admission 		records are needed and must be categorized according to a specified 		classification system. Hospital-specific cost data by payer category are 		required to calculate costs per case, and hospital and area characteristic data 		are required in order to judge the need for and level of payment adjustors. 		Once these data were developed, they were used in two analyses: one addressing 		whether diagnosis-related group (DRG)-based payment rates for Medicare and 		non-Medicare patients should be adjusted based on hospital characteristics, and 		one focusing on an alternative approach to defining the Medicare standardized 		prospective payment rate. The report finds that current PPS rates are based on 		the mean adjusted cost for a given category of hospital, and that high-cost 		hospitals are penalized under the assumption that their costs are reflective of 		presumed inefficiency. The report develops hospital-specific measures of 		inefficiency and then excludes the costs of inefficient hospitals from the 		calculation of standardized payment rates. The report concludes that a frontier 		cost function model approach is superior to the current system and can result 		in substantial program savings. See also PIC ID No. 6594.1. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Second Update 		of the Geographic Practice Cost Index: Final Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI) is an input price index used to adjust 		Medicare Fee Schedule (MFS) payments for area variations in physicians' cost of 		practice. The original GPCI was implemented with the MFS in 1992. In 1995 and 		1996, the GPCI was updated with 1990 Decennial Census data. This report 		documents the second update of the GPCI, which is scheduled to be fully phased 		in on January 1, 1999. During the previous year, 1998, a transition will occur 		between the 1997 GPCI and the updated 1999 GPCI, with one-half the total change 		implemented in 1998. The comparison between the 1997 and the 1999 GPCIs shows 		that (1) there is no change between the physician work GPCI or the 		non-physician employee wage index of the practice expense GPCI except that they 		are reweighted with 1994 county relative value units (RVUs); (2) the office 		rental index of the practice expense GPCI is updated with fiscal year 1996 Fair 		Market Rents published by the Department of Housing and Urban Development; (3) 		county rental adjustment factors are eliminated for all metropolitan areas, 		except for the New York City Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area; (4) the 		malpractice GPCI is updated with 1992, 1993, and 1994 premium data, and 		specialty premiums are weighted by national RVU proportions rather than allowed 		charges; (5) there is no change in the GPCI cost shares, which measure the 		share of the various inputs in total practice revenues; and (6) the county RVUs 		used to weight averages of county input prices for each Fee Schedule Area (FSA) 		are updated from 1992 to 1994. The report also examines changes in the 		Geographic Adjustment Factor between 1999 and 1997. It determines that changes 		in MFS payments resulting from implementation of the 1999 GPCIs will be small 		(less than 2.5 percent for each FSA). See also 5764 series.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Validation of 		Nursing Home Quality Indicators Study</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This study 		developed a system by which a series of Quality Indicators (QIs) could be used 		in conjunction with claims data to monitor quality of care in nursing home 		facilities. Fifty QIs were developed and validated using a sample of nursing 		home residents' medical records for a 6-month period surrounding the time of 		nursing facility's Federal certification survey. The QIs focus on the 		occurrence of three broad potential problem areas, including adverse outcomes, 		lack of therapy, and inappropriate pharmaceutical treatments. The QI algorithm 		used ICD-9 CM diagnosis codes and CPT-4 and CRVS procedure codes to generate 		the QIs. These codes represent either medical or surgical conditions that 		define the indicator events (e.g., inpatient stay or emergency room visit), the 		covariant diagnoses, or case selection factors. It is anticipated that these 		validated QIs could be used as the basis for an automated system to 		continuously monitor the quality of care provided in federally certified 		nursing homes to assist Federal and State surveyors in implementing the survey 		process effectively. Such a system could contribute to lowering the costs of 		care and improving outcomes for Medicaid nursing home residents by reducing the 		incidence of potentially avoidable hospitalization and over-medication. The two 		volume report finds that (1) the utility of basing indicators of quality of 		nursing home care on Medicaid and Medicare claims data is clearly demonstrated; 		(2) the study QIs as a whole were generally better at predicting the absence of 		a quality issue, suggesting that the negative finding on the quality indicator 		represented the lack of a quality concern in the nursing home; and (3) using 		covariant diagnoses to adjust for the risk of a resident receiving a QI tag is 		useful. The report concludes with a discussion of the issues raised during the 		validation of the 50 QIs examined here. (Volume I: 88 pages; Volume II: 		appendices variously paginated.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>1995 Influenza 		Immunizations Paid for by Medicare: State and County 		Rates</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In 1993, 		the Health Care Financing Administration began paying providers for influenza 		vaccine and its administration to Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older. 		This data book provides information about the national, State, and county rates 		of influenza vaccination in the Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) sector. 		Medicare-managed care beneficiaries are not counted. The data book presents 		maps that report rates as integers for ease of presentation. It also presents 		tables that measure rates to one tenth of one percent. State rates are also 		presented. The data book provides three tables for each State: (1) a table 		providing the State's rates and numbers of influenza immunizations for 1994 and 		1995 according to age, gender, and race; (2) a table showing the State's number 		of elderly enrolled in Medicare Part B FFS and the number of individuals who 		received flu shots in 1995 according to race and county; and (3) a table 		presenting corresponding immunization rates for 1994 and 1995 according to race 		and county. The data show that (1) about 41 percent of elderly Medicare 		beneficiaries received an influenza vaccination in 1995 that was paid for by 		Medicare; (2) for all sectors of this population, there was an increase over 		1994 immunization rates ranging from 2.3 percent to 6.4 percent, indicating 		progress toward the <b><i>Healthy People 2000</i></b> goal of a 60 percent 		influenza immunization rate for this population; (3) African-American 		beneficiaries have an immunization rate one-half that of Caucasian 		beneficiaries, although between 1994 and 1995, the increase in the rate of 		immunizations was slightly greater for African Americans than for Caucasians; 		(4) there is no substantial variation in rates by gender; and (5) immunization 		rates are lowest for those beneficiaries 85 years and older.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Impact of the 		Medicare Fee Schedule on Teaching Physicians</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Prior to 		the implementation of the Medicare Fee Schedule (MFS) in 1992, several studies 		were conducted to determine the impact of this payment change on various groups 		of physicians. However, no studies examined the potential impact of the MFS on 		teaching physicians, even though anecdotal evidence from academic practices 		suggested that these physicians would be particularly hard hit for four reasons 		(1) teaching physicians perform relatively more high-technology procedures and 		less primary care, which could result in disproportionate net losses for many 		academic practices; (2) teaching hospitals and medical schools tend to be 		located in large urban areas, where the Geographic Practice Cost Index portion 		of the payment is lower; (3) customary charges for teaching physicians may be 		higher than the area-wide historical payments calculated for fee schedule 		transition; and (4) a number of academic medical practices had not signed 		Medicare participation agreements. This study determines the impact of the MFS 		on teaching physicians and examines variations in the impact across academic 		medical centers, other major teaching hospitals, and minor teaching hospitals. 		The net effects of MFS price changes and any observed quantity changes on 		inpatient physician revenues were examined. A total of 720 hospitals were 		selected for this study, including all U.S. academic medical centers. The 		report finds that there is no evidence that teaching physicians have been 		adversely impacted by the MFS. Inpatient revenues per admission fell by the 		same percentage amount in all types of hospitals. Revenues fell because of a 		reduction in prices and in the quantity of services provided per admission. 		Thus, while the theoretical expectation was that teaching physicians would have 		experienced a disproportionately large reduction in their average price per 		service, in practice these physicians have altered that service mix by 		providing less RVU-intensive visits. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Institutional 		Factors Which Influence the Likelihood of Living-Related Kidney Transplant 		Operations-Phase II</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Most 		transplant surgeons and physicians believe that kidneys can be obtained from 		live donors in a safe and effective manner, and that kidneys from live donors 		provide superior long-term graft survival rates for transplant recipients. 		Between 1987 and 1993, for example, the 1- and 2-year survival rates for 		patients who had received kidney transplants through living-related donations 		(LRDs) was superior to that of patients who had received cadaveric kidneys. The 		rate of living-related kidney transplantation varies considerably among States, 		however. This project assessed (1) the willingness of the transplant community 		to conduct, and the frequency with which it has conducted, kidney transplants 		from LRDs; (2) the medical and nonmedical institutional factors that influence 		decision making by transplant professionals about suggesting and conducting a 		living-related kidney transplant; (3) the range of transplant center responses 		to, and procedures for, living-related transplants; and (4) the circumstances 		and conditions under which a transplant team that does not encourage 		living-related transplants would refer a patient to another transplant center 		for evaluation. This study is based on a mail survey of kidney transplant 		centers in the Fall of 1995, which yielded an 80 percent response rate. A key 		finding is that while attitudes toward LRDs among transplant professionals are 		generally positive, survey respondents identified a number of deterrents to 		LRDs that are not related to characteristics or practices of individual 		transplant centers. Some of these factors relate to the characteristics of the 		individual patient and his or her family. Among the recommendations is that 		transplant centers distribute educationally and culturally appropriate 		materials about policies and procedures related to LRDs.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Exploratory 		Study of Reasons Kidney Transplant Waiting List Patients are Unavailable for 		Organ Offers</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Studies 		conducted in the early 1990's to examine the efficiency of the organ allocation 		system identified an additional factor that might influence the equitability of 		allocation decisions: patient unavailability and refusal of an organ. This 		study (1) further examines the extent of the problem of patient unavailability 		for, or refusal of, an organ offer; (2) explores the reasons underlying patient 		unavailability and patient refusal when an organ offer is made; (3) highlights 		strengths and weaknesses in recordkeeping and reporting practices; and (4) 		makes recommendations for improving the procedures for notifying patients of an 		organ offer. The contractor conducted telephone interviews with three groups: 		transplant center staff who make organ offers, transplant waiting list patients 		who had refused an offer or had been unavailable when staff tried to make an 		offer, and recent transplant recipients. Interviews with study participants, 		drawn from 31 randomly selected transplant centers, were conducted between 		November 1995 and September 1996. The major finding was that both patient 		unavailability and refusal occur but are not significant issues at most 		centers. (Final report: 38 pages, plus appendix.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Community 		Health Center User and Visit Study: Survey Methodology 		Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		project collects data on users of Community Health Centers (CHCs) and the 		services they use. The sample survey has two components: (1) a personal 		interview survey of 1,932 randomly selected patients at a representative sample 		of 48 CHCs, and (2) data extraction from 2,878 medical records concerning 		randomly selected encounters at the same centers. Clients and visits are 		surveyed using modified versions of two National Center for Health Statistics 		(NCHS) surveys: the National Health Interview Survey and the National Hospital 		Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, to capture the full range of users and services 		provided at a particular point in time. This approach allows for comparison of 		data on CHC populations with national estimates derived from the NCHS surveys. 		The project provides demographics of users, their reasons for seeking care, 		diagnoses, services used, and self-reported outcomes. The User and Visit Survey 		is part of an overall Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) 		evaluation strategy for collecting data regarding users, services, and outcomes 		of primary care programs. HRSA will be developing further reports based on the 		survey findings. (Final report: 147 pages, plus appendices.) </p>

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		project develops and implements a design to collect uniform data on access, 		use, and continuity of care in the Healthy Schools, Healthy Communities Program 		(HSHC). The Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA's) HSHC 		program is the first Federal categorical grant program specifically targeted to 		school-based health centers, and is jointly funded and administered by the 		Bureau of Primary Health Care and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau. The 		study includes the 25 (of 27) school-based health centers (SBHCs) funded 		initial projects that were first fully operational during the 1995-1996 school 		year. This evaluation, implemented concurrently with the HSHC program, was 		intended to document change in the students' ealth status, utilization of 		services, and outcomes related to the SBHC interventions. There are two data 		sources: a student-based clinical data system and a student/parent survey. 		Findings are informing the activities of participating grantees and the content 		of policies for grantees that join the program in FY 1998 or FY 1999. In 		addition, HRSA has gained new insights into collecting data from children and 		on working with school-based records. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Exploratory 		Evaluation of Rural Applications of Telemedicine</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		purposes of the Health Resources and Service Administration's (HRSA's) Rural 		Telemedicine Grant Program (RTMG) are (1) to facilitate the development of 		rural health care networks through the use of telemedicine, and (2) to develop 		a data base for systematic evaluation of rural telemedicine systems. This 		baseline study concerned (1) the current status of telemedicine in rural 		health; (2) the effects of telemedicine on access to care, practitioner 		isolation, and development of health care networks; (3) the organizational 		factors that aid or impede successful development and implementation of 		telemedicine systems; and (4) development, testing, and refinement of data 		collection instruments for use in subsequent evaluations. The study focused on 		telemedicine projects that link one or more rural hospitals or ambulatory sites 		("spoke sites") with a multispecialty entity ("hub site"). A hub site might be 		a tertiary care hospital, a multispecialty clinic, or a set of facilities that, 		when combined, provide the required range of specialty consultations. In 		addition, the study was limited to systems that employ real-time or 		asynchronous video imaging systems. Data sources for the evaluation include 		three mail surveys to identify and describe telemedicine systems, and site 		visits to four networks. The report presents recommendations on the content of 		future evaluations and on data gathering approaches. Results have influenced 		the FY 1997 RTMG application guidelines and the content of authorizing 		legislation. The report has been distributed to other Federal agencies that 		fund telemedicine projects and to State Offices of Rural Health. Findings are 		being incorporated into the design of a common telemedicine evaluation 		instrument for use by HRSA grantees, and by other Federal funders at their 		option. Finally, five articles based on the study have been published and 		numerous presentations have been given. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Development of 		a Performance Management System for Ryan White Titles I, II, and 		SPNS</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In the 		public sector, efforts to monitor program effectiveness go under the rubric of 		"reinventing government." Several legislative and executive initiatives, 		particularly the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), spur 		the movement to establish measurable performance goals that can be reported as 		part of the budgetary process, thus linking funding decisions to performance. 		GPRA requires each Federal agency to develop comprehensive strategic plans, 		annual performance plans with measurable goals and objectives, and annual 		reports on actual performance compared to goals. This report focuses on the 		response to GPRA undertaken by the Bureau of Health Resources Development (now 		called the HIV/AIDS Bureau) within the Health Resources and Services 		Administration (HRSA) in regard to Titles I, II, and Special Programs of 		National Significance (SPNS) of the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources 		Emergency (CARE) Act of 1990. The major results of this project were the 		development and articulation of an interactive process to be used in the 		development of a performance measurement system. This process includes (1) a 		clear articulation of the purposes and objectives of Ryan White Titles I, II, 		and SPNS; (2) linkage of these purposes and objectives to the broader functions 		of HRSA; (3) using program purposes and functions, and a clear understanding of 		accountability, responsibility, and activity throughout the programs, to enable 		the performance measurement system to capture the individual properties and 		components of each; (4) developing standard performance terminology and 		definitions; (5) identification of seven performance dimensions and linking 		them to the purposes and functions of the programs; and (6) identifying and 		narrowing potential measures for program performance. The report concludes with 		several recommendations for implementing a performance measurement system for 		these three programs. See also PIC ID Nos. 5954 and 5954.2. </p>

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) links funding decisions 		to program performance by calling for the designation of measurable performance 		goals that can be reported as part of the budgetary process. GPRA requires each 		Federal agency to develop comprehensive strategic plans, annual performance 		plans with measurable goals and objectives, and annual reports on actual 		performance compared to goals. This report focuses on the response to GPRA 		undertaken by Division of Organ Transplantation (DOT) within the Health 		Resources and Services Administration. The report provides a conceptual 		framework for the organ and bone marrow transplantation programs; outlines a 		recommended performance management system (including an articulation of program 		purposes and functions, language and tools of performance measurement, criteria 		for selecting measures and indicators, and identification of potential 		measures); and recommends next steps. These next steps include (1) 		identification of a process for selection of measures and indicators for DOT 		programs, (2) selection of the most important measures from the potential 		group, (3) identifying supporting data and data needs and gaps, (4) preparing 		an annual performance plan designed to meet GPRA requirements, and (5) 		identifying technical assistance needs for making a performance management 		system operational.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Profiles of 		Activities to Reduce Perinatal Transmission of HIV: Assessing the 		Response</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In August 		1994, the Public Health Service (PHS) published recommendations for the use of 		zidovudine (ZDV) to reduce perinatal transmission of HIV in response to 		findings from the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 076 by the 		National Institutes of Health (NIH). In December 1995, the Health Resources and 		Services Administration (HRSA) issued a Program Advisory entitled "Use of 		Zidovudine (ZDV) to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in HRSA Funded Programs," 		which provides background information and specific strategies and options for 		implementing the PHS recommendations. This study evaluates HRSA's activities in 		implementing the recommendations through case studies of Florida, Mississippi, 		Missouri, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, Texas, and Washington. Qualitative methods 		were used to describe the following for each site: (1) demographic and 		socioeconomic factors affecting HIV/AIDS prevention and care services, (2) 		nature of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, (3) structure of the public health system, (4) 		structure of the State health department, (5) structure of HIV/AIDS services, 		(6) issues affecting HIV/AIDS prevention and care services, (7) relevant 		policies and activities prior to the release of the ACTG 076 findings, and (8) 		specific responses to the ACTG 076 findings and PHS recommendations. The study 		finds that where providers have responded to the ACTG 076 findings, the results 		are extremely positive. Despite the complexities of the ZDV regimen, the 		majority of women elect to participate in the regimen after being informed 		about it, believing that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The study 		has been widely disseminated to HRSA HIV/AIDS and primary care providers and 		has been used in assessing the incidence of perinatal HIV transmission.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Bilingual 		Assistance Program Evaluation, Part I: Strategies for Reducing Cultural and 		Linguistic Barriers to Health Care for Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander 		Populations</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Disadvantaged Minority Health Improvement Act of 1990 authorized the Bilingual 		Assistance Program, a 3-year initiative to improve the health status of racial 		and ethnic minorities. Under the program, the Health Resources and Services 		Administration (HRSA) awarded grants to three national organizations (the 		Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, the National Association 		of County Health Officials, and the U.S. Conference of Local Health Officials) 		which, in turn, awarded grants in 1993 to 13 State and local health 		departments. The purpose of the local projects, which were selected 		competitively, was to reduce cultural and linguistic barriers to health care 		among Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic populations. This study examines (1) 		factors that allow the local projects to leverage Federal funding and promote 		improved interagency working relationships; (2) realistic approaches to setting 		performance measures; (3) technical assistance needs of grantees, including 		exploring the use of national minority organizations and mentors; and (4) the 		replicability of the products or training curricula developed by the grantees. 		This is the first volume of a two-part final report; the second volume is 		entitled "Assessment of Three Training Curricula." The study was carried out 		through site visits conducted during April-June 1996 and a review of background 		documentation. HRSA's Office of Minority Health has shared the study products 		with interested groups. (Final report: variously paginated.) </p>

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		project (1) determines the extent to which specific Ryan White Comprehensive 		AIDS Resource Emergency (CARE) Act Title I grantees are providing guidance to 		funded providers on tuberculosis (TB) screening, prophylactic, and therapeutic 		regimes; and (2) describes working models of collaboration between human 		immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and TB control programs within individual Eligible 		Metropolitan Areas (EMAs). In March 1995, the 34 EMAs were asked to provide a 		brief description of TB epidemiology in the EMA, along with specific 		information regarding collaboration among programs to treat people co-infected 		with HIV and TB; 30 responded. A literature review provides background for site 		visits to seven EMAs. The visits were conducted to gain more detailed 		information about the nature of partnerships between TB and HIV/AIDS programs 		that result in the most successful models of TB prevention and control within 		Title I-funded programs, as well as to identify programmatic configurations 		that result in poorly implemented TB services at these sites. The study finds 		that TB was prevalent in EMAs, and that services vary across EMAs and across 		different care settings within them. Study results are being used in developing 		Title I program guidance and in planning for training and technical assistance. 		The report has been sent to CARE Act and TB control grantees. 		</p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Availability 		of Primary Care Services Under Medicaid Managed Care: How 14 Health Plans 		Provide Access and the Experience of 23 Safety Net Providers and Their 		Communities</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This study 		examines strategies used by health maintenance organizations (HMOs) to generate 		access to health care services for Medicaid enrollees, who often live in inner 		city and rural underserved areas. The project also explores the implications of 		these strategies for overall access in underserved areas and for existing care 		providers. Third, the study considers how these strategies affect traditional 		Medicaid providers in the community. The study involved interviews and 		collection of secondary data at 14 HMOs with significant Medicaid enrollment, 		and at 23 traditional safety net providers, of which 13 were Community Health 		Centers. The study concluded that Medicaid managed care has had an overall 		positive effect on the availability of primary care to low-income residents in 		the 14 communities, and that the traditional safety net providers have not 		needed to reduce services. However, the future viability and range of services 		of public sector-supported providers might be endangered in a more competitive 		health system. The information derived from this study will be useful to 		policymakers concerned with the provision of appropriate care for vulnerable 		populations, providers in underserved areas, and those attempting to assure an 		adequate supply of health care personnel. The study has attracted attention in 		the professional community, as in a story in the <b><i>American Medical 		News</i>.</b> In addition, an article under preparation for submission to a 		professional journal will reference this study, among other sources.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Service 		Integration for Multi-Risk Patients: Final Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This study 		examines how selected community-based health care organizations integrate 		services for people with multiple risk factors (e.g., pregnancy, substance 		abuse, HIV/AIDS, and homelessness) for poor health outcomes. Since these 		conditions often overlap, the health care organization must integrate services 		to meet the needs of these individuals with multiple risks. This study targets 		six Community Health Centers and local health departments currently receiving 		funding from a combination of Health Resources and Services Administration 		(HRSA) programs. The report uses site visits, interviews, focus groups, and 		discussions to explore several topics, including (1) community-based health 		care organizations' use of multiple funding sources to provide integrated 		services to patients with multiple risk factors, (2) barriers to integration of 		services created by separate funding streams that target specific high-risk 		populations, (3) successful integration strategies used by organizations, and 		(4) ways in which HRSA might reduce barriers created through multiple funding 		streams. Based on these strategies, the report identifies characteristics of 		organizational approaches that facilitate integration and makes recommendations 		for addressing barriers to service integration. The report has been distributed 		to all the HRSA primary care grantees. Results will also be shared through 		articles in peer-reviewed journals. (Final report: variously 		paginated.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Measuring 		Expenditures for Personal Health Care Services Rendered by Public Health 		Departments</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>As changes 		to the health care delivery system continue to occur, the way in which public 		health departments provide services may be affected in a very significant 		manner, making it critical for policymakers, managers, and researchers to be 		able to assess the impact of these changes on the public health infrastructure. 		Therefore, the Health Resources and Services Administration commissioned this 		report, which develops a categorization schema for reporting comparable 		information on State and local health department personal health care services. 		The project initiates development and testing of a methodology to collect 		consistent and complete expenditure data on State and local health department 		services directed toward individuals. Officials from 11 State and local health 		departments and 1 State association of local health officials assisted in the 		development of a survey instrument, which was tested by State health 		departments in Arizona, Iowa, and Rhode Island and by local health departments 		in Austin/Travis County, Texas, and New York City, New York. The report finds 		that (1) the provision of personal health care services accounts for nearly 50 		percent of the health department expenditures in Austin/Travis County and 57 		percent in New York City; (2) participants considered the methodology generally 		clear and potentially useful, although problems were encountered in trying to 		fit personal health care services into some survey categories; (3) among the 		survey respondents, Austin/Travis County is closest to the managed care end of 		the service delivery continuum and Iowa is closest to the traditional approach 		of delivering all services directly, bundling no services, and not using 		capitation; and (4) Rhode Island contracts for 99 percent of its services, and 		New York and Austin/Travis County offer a similar mix of department-run and 		contracted services.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>HIV Capitation 		Risk Adjustment Conference Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Widespread 		adoption of managed care by public insurance programs (such as Medicaid) has 		raised concerns about whether capitated reimbursement affects the quality of 		care provided, especially to people with chronic illnesses or other special 		health care needs. One way to address these concerns is to create risk-adjusted 		capitation rates to provide equitable reimbursement for care of patients with 		costly illnesses, an approach several States had proposed or implemented by 		1997. In May 1997, HRSA convened an invited conference to examine issues 		surrounding risk adjustment for HIV/AIDS, in collaboration with ASPE, HCFA, The 		Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, and the National Academy of State Health 		Policy. Participants included people living with HIV/AIDS and their advocates, 		providers of care, managed care plans, and purchasers, including 		representatives of State Medicaid programs. The report presents findings and 		recommendations concerning various risk-adjustment methods and their 		evaluation, issues related to the implementation of risk adjustment, and 		further research needed in each of these areas. Conference findings have been 		used in technical assistance to States on coordinating CARE Act programs with 		managed care. HRSA has distributed the report to all CARE Act grantees and to 		State Medicaid directors; the Kaiser Family Foundation, which financed 		production of the report itself, has also distributed it widely. 		</p>

There are 		almost 200 federally recognized tribes in a single Area-wide Compact, organized 		via 13 separate consigners-each of which has its own Annual Funding Agreement. 		Seven of these consigners are in the Anchorage Service Unit, which is one of 		nine Service Units in the Alaska Area. The overall conclusion of the evaluation 		is that there are more village representatives who have seen either no change 		or a negative change in in-village services than those who have seen a positive 		change. The perceptions of the officials and employees of the Alaska Native 		Medical Center and the Alaska Area Native Health Service have revealed problems 		in staff morale and shifts in workload resulting from Compact consigners 		transferring patients to the Alaska Native Medical Center who were previously 		treated outside the Anchorage Service Unit. These changes are considered as 		having a negative impact on the Anchorage Service Unit. The "microcosmic" view 		from the Ahtna Region indicates that there is a distinct difference in the 		perception of those who are participating in the Compact and those who are not 		participating. The analysis of the village respondent data, comparing the 		information that came from the Title III villages with the information from the 		Title I villages, further solidified the conclusion that individuals in 		villages that are not served by a Compact consigner hold a consistently more 		negative view than those who live in villages that are serviced by a Compact 		consigner. </p>

<p><b>TITLE:<i> Prior Trauma 		Care of Intoxicated Patients as a Predictor of Subsequently Fatal 		Injury</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This study 		was undertaken to identify intervention opportunities associated with nonfatal, 		alcohol-related injury contacts in Indian Health Service emergency departments 		and clinics that could, over time, decrease alcohol-related injury deaths in 		the Billings Area Indian Health Services. The concept was to determine the 		frequency of injury treatment recidivism, both alcohol- and nonalcohol-related, 		and further to determine if patterns can be established to suggest that injury 		death is predictable based on those previous nonfatal contacts. The findings 		indicate a high degree of recidivism and a strong correlation between non-fatal 		incidents and eventual injury death. This study further reveals that there is a 		high prevalence of alcohol in nonfatal injury-related incidents among this 		cohort. There appears to be a strong relationship between repeated episodes of 		nonfatal injury with alcohol as a contributing factor and subsequently fatal 		events among this cohort. These nonfatal episodes should serve as warning 		signals and opportunities for the application of effective alcohol intervention 		strategies. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>The Status of 		Biomedical Research Facilities 1996</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Since 		1986, the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health 		(NIH) have collected and reported to the Congress biennial information on the 		quantity and quality of biomedical research space. This report describes 		findings from the 1996 Survey of Scientific and Engineering Research Facilities 		at Colleges and Universities. The survey collected data from colleges and 		universities with research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures exceeding 		$50,000, from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) with any 		R&amp;D expenditures, and from a sampling of academic and nonprofit research 		organizations that received extramural research funding from NIH. The report 		found that (1) institutions performing biomedical research devoted 		approximately 67.4 million net assignable square feet to this work; (2) roughly 		half of survey respondents classified their medical science research space 		and/or biological science research space as inadequate; (3) expenditures to 		construct, renovate, and repair biomedical research space declined for the 		first time since NSF and NIH began collecting data; (4) the largest proportion 		of new construction was funded by State and local governments, while almost 		half of all institutions funded their own repair/renovation projects; and (5) 		36 percent of all institutions with biomedical research space reported repair 		renovation projects that had to be deferred because funds were not available. 		In addition, the survey reported that HBCUs: (1) comprised 12 percent of the 		Nation's research-performing institutions, but contained only 1.8 percent of 		the national biomedical research space; (2) reported that 8 percent of their 		biomedical research space needed major repair/renovation to be used 		effectively; (3) have experienced a steady decline in new construction funding 		since the first survey in 1986 which reported expenditures of $42 million, to 		$0.2 million in 1994-5.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluation of 		the National Research Service Award Research Training 		Programs</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		project had several objectives. First, it conducted an evaluation design study, 		developing a detailed plan for a comprehensive evaluation of career outcomes of 		pre- and post-doctoral trainees and fellows and of the National Research 		Service Act (NRSA) programs in which they have participated. The evaluation 		developed recommendations promoting approaches that are successful in order to 		improve the return on Federal investment in research training. The second 		objective of the project was to characterize the nature and quality of the 		training actually experienced by the present and former trainees and fellows 		and to differentiate between a good training program and simply having good 		trainees. The project's third objective was to tap the perceptions of National 		Institutes of Health (NIH) staff, present and former NRSA trainees and fellows, 		and university employees about the nature and impact of the training program. 		The study developed performance indicators so that future evaluations may be 		based on data that are consistent across separate awards. The final report for 		this study will not be available until the Evaluation of NIH Post-doctoral 		Trainees and Fellows is completed in the summer of 1998. See PIC ID No. 		6285. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>National 		Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Article Citation and Patent Reference Study: 		An Analysis of Article Citations and Patent References to Journal Articles 		Supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood 		Institute</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		primary objective of all National Institutes of Health (NIH) activities is to 		improve the health of the American public. However, it is generally impossible 		to demonstrate the impact of basic research in terms of reductions in disease 		mortality or morbidity. Therefore, alternative measures must be relied upon. 		The objectives of this project were to (1) introduce the concept of examining 		patents as an additional measure for assessing the impact of NIH-supported 		research; (2) develop a methodology to use patents in evaluation research; and 		(3) apply this methodology to a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 		(NHLBI) project in order to compare the outcomes for individual research 		project grants (R01s) funded under a Request for Applications (RFA) with 		individual research project grants funded from unsolicited applications. The 		methods, data bases, software, and results of this project will be used by 		other Institutes, Centers, and Divisions to evaluate their own funding 		mechanisms. The project examines the impact of NHLBI grants during the period 		1982 through 1994 with respect to the number of biomedical research articles 		associated with grant programs, the number of subsequent citations to these 		articles, and the number of patent references to the original articles. The 		report finds that (1) about 12,500 grants resulted in over 90,000 research 		articles cited in over 2 million later articles; (2) 3,000 of the original 		articles are referred to in over 1,000 patents; (3) half of all cited articles 		are cited no more than 12 times over the 14-year period studied, although a few 		were cited over 1,000 times each; (4) two-thirds of articles referenced in 		patents appeared only once, although 3 articles are each referenced in over 20 		patents; and (5) new RFAs result in higher than normal numbers of citations, 		but lower than normal number of patent references.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Rare Diseases 		Clinical Research Data base</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The Rare 		Disease Clinical Research Data base (RDCRD) has been established by the Office 		of Rare Diseases (ORD), Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health 		(NIH). NIH made a commitment to the rare disease community and to the Congress 		to develop a mechanism for identifying and monitoring rare disease research 		supported by the NIH. The data base is similar in format to the Physician Data 		Query (PDQ) System of the National Cancer Institute. The International Cancer 		Information Center of NCI provided assistance in the development of the data 		base. Contact was made with 520 principal investigators and the 75 General 		Clinical Research Centers managers to determine those clinical trials in active 		states. The ORD retrieved 291 protocols from ongoing clinical trials to be 		included in the data base. Information from these protocols has been placed in 		abstracts and will be available from ORD's home page on the Internet. This 		development activity will continue, and the next two phases will include the 		development of information from clinical trials receiving support from the 		voluntary patient support organizations and the pharmaceuticals and 		biotechnology industries. ORD will continue to seek information from newly 		supported clinical trials receiving support from NIH. Information on specific 		rare diseases is difficult to locate; and, in many cases, the public, 		confronted with penetrating the NIH information system, reported difficulties 		gaining access to it. The RDCRD will eliminate this problem by providing an 		easy-to-use interface between the user and the data base information system. 		The data base contains up-to-date information that is easily accessible to a 		diverse user population. This information will facilitate patient and physician 		access to this information and lead to improved recruitment of patients with 		rare diseases or conditions into NIH-sponsored clinical trials.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>The National 		Survey of Laboratory Animal Use, Facilities, and 		Resources</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report summarizes the results of the survey conducted by the National 		Institutes of Health (NIH) on animal-based research for fiscal year (FY) 1993. 		NIH is responsible for oversight of the nationwide infrastructure required to 		pursue basic biomedical and behavioral research including laboratory animals, 		as well as the resources and facilities required to ensure their availability, 		appropriate use, and humane care. This study updates information gathered in 		the last national survey conducted in 1978. For FY 1993, the report finds that 		(1) of the 626 respondents, roughly half were academic institutions, and half 		consisted of research laboratories, independent hospitals, and government 		agencies; (2) there is a total census of approximately 2.5 million animals; (3) 		facilities reported acquiring 8.3 million animals, of which 29 percent were 		acquired through the facilities' own breeding; (4) respondent facilities made 		approximately 9 million vertebrate animals available for research, education or 		training, and testing, and animal species were used predominantly for research; 		(5) among directors of animal care and use programs, 74 percent had a 		doctoral-level degree; (6) among respondent facilities, 34 percent reported 		having space in need of renovation, 15 percent reported having space in need of 		replacement, and enclosed animal housing was the category most frequently cited 		as in need of replacement; and (7) the 559 respondents who provided cost 		information spent $521 million on animal care and reported that their costs had 		increased since FY 1991 by 25 percent. This report contributes to the 		understanding of the effects of Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, 		and policies enacted to ensure humane care and to regulate the supply and cost 		of laboratory animals.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Promoting Safe 		and Effective Genetic Testing in the United States: Final Report of the Task 		Force on Genetic Testing</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Genetic 		testing is the analysis of human DNA, RNA, chromosomes, proteins, and certain 		metabolites in order to detect heritable diseases. The Task Force on Genetic 		Testing was created by the NIH-DOE Joint Working Group on Ethical, Legal, and 		Social Implications of Human Genome Research (ELSI Working Group) to review 		genetic testing in the United States and to design policies to minimize the 		potential negative effects of genetic testing. Their final report recommends 		that (1) an advisory committee be established on genetic testing in the Office 		of the Secretary to implement the Task Force recommendations and to determine 		which genetic tests require stringent scrutiny; (2) protocols for the 		development of genetic tests that can be used to predict future disease in 		healthy people receive the approval of an institutional review board (IRB) when 		the intention is to make the test readily available for clinical use; (3) test 		developers submit their validation and clinical utility data to external 		reviewers as well as to interested professional organizations in order to 		permit informed decisions about their routine use; (4) the newly created 		genetics subcommittee of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Advisory Committee 		consider the creation of a specialty in genetics that would encompass all 		predictive tests that satisfy criteria for stringent scrutiny; (5) curricula on 		genetics be incorporated into medical school and residency training; (6) 		hospitals and managed care organizations require evidence of competence before 		permitting providers to order predictive genetic tests or counsel about them; 		and (7) physicians have access to accurate information to enable them to 		diagnose rare diseases, to know where to turn for assistance in clinical and 		laboratory diagnosis, and to locate laboratories that competently test for rare 		diseases.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>National 		Cancer Institute: Characterization of User Population and User Satisfaction of 		the PDQ Data base-Documentation for Tracking System</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This study 		examines the user population and users' satisfaction with the Physician Data 		Query (PDQ) data base. PDQ was originally targeted to physicians only, but the 		information included in the data base was recognized to be of value to the 		larger community of nurses, researchers, health educators, and librarians, as 		well as patients, their families, and friends. PDQ is distributed to these 		audiences by the original on-line services, CD-ROM, facsimile, hard copy, and 		electronic networks, including the Internet. The users surveyed for the study 		include both primary users, or those who access the PDQ data base to fulfill 		their own research needs, and secondary users, who only conduct searches for 		others. The report finds that (1) the data base is widely and repeatedly used 		and is highly regarded; (2) physicians, other health care professionals, and 		librarians/information specialists predominate among the user population; (3) 		patients and their families and friends are also recipients of the PDQ 		information, even when the National Cancer Institute (NCI) toll-free 		information center phone service is excluded; (4) users consistently see PDQ as 		an authoritative and dependable source of cancer information; (5) no sections 		of the data base are negatively regarded or go unused; and (6) many users share 		the information they access through PDQ with others. Several recommendations 		are developed as a result of this report. The report recommends that NCI's 		International Cancer Information Center should (1) establish formal licensing 		structures to strengthen its ability to require access to users from the 		vendors, (2) repeat this survey within three years, (3) consider creating a 		CD-ROM version of the data base on its own in order to reduce costs to 		consumers, and (4) work with distributors and intermediaries to develop 		mechanisms for gathering data on user access.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Bridges to the 		Future: Program Evaluation</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In 		February 1992, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) and 		the National Institutes of Health Office of Research on Minority Health 		announced the implementation of the Baccalaureate and Doctoral Bridge programs. 		The objective of the Baccalaureate Bridge program is to facilitate the 		transition of minority students at two-year colleges into colleges with 		baccalaureate degree programs in the sciences. The Doctoral Bridge program 		seeks to facilitate the transition of students into Ph.D. programs when they 		complete the M.S. degree. Two program outcomes that are particularly relevant 		to the goals of the Bridges program were examined in this study: (1) the 		transition of students from two-year to four-year institutions, or from M.S. to 		Ph.D. programs; and (2) the retention of students in the educational pathway 		both prior to and after making the transition from one institution to another. 		Although the quantity and quality of the comparison data is not high, rates of 		transfer among Bridges students appear to be higher than rates among other 		students. Success in completing the baccalaureate degree among those students 		who have transferred is high, and is comparable to the rate found among other 		minority students in an evaluation of the NIGMS Minority Access to Research 		Careers program. At the baccalaureate level, approximately 70 percent of the 		students are majoring in such fields as biology, chemistry and biochemistry, 		molecular biology, and microbiology. From the current data, it is difficult to 		develop good estimates of the eventual outcomes of participants in the Doctoral 		Bridges program. The early cohorts of students were small. Of the 21 students 		in the first two cohorts, about half have transferred to a doctoral program. 		While the rate of Bridges student attrition from graduate programs is below the 		national average, it is still too soon to predict their rate of completing 		their doctoral programs. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Academic 		Research Instruments and Instrumentation Needs in the Biological 		Sciences</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report examines the fourth cycle of a national instrumentation survey 		concerning scientific research instruments and the academic units in which they 		are found for a range of scientific fields. Conducted in 1994, the survey 		analyzes data from two distinct populations of institutions. The first 		population consists of 318 institutions performing more than $3 million in 		research and development (R&amp;D) in 1991. The second population consists of 		44 historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) that reported R&amp;D 		expenditures in 1994. The study, in results generalized to the first group, 		finds that in 1993 (1) expenditures for biological research instrumentation 		totaled $283 million; (2) Federal funding as a percent of total funds for the 		purchase of biological research instrumentation declined from 48 percent in 		1983 to 39 percent: NIH was the single largest Federal funding source providing 		$85 million; (3) 67 percent of respondents reported an increase in 		instrumentation needs between 1992 and 1994; (4) the price tag for the three 		highest priority research instruments was $363 million; (5) 20,978 research 		instruments in the biological sciences had a purchase price of $20,000 or more; 		and (6) principal investigators report that only 28 percent of the biological 		instruments were state-of-the-art in meeting researchers' needs. For HBCUs, the 		study finds that (1) the purchase price of research equipment in 1993 was $4.9 		million, of which 48 percent was spent on maintenance, repair, and operation 		costs of the instrumentation; (2) Federal funding provided 85 percent of 		funding, $4.2 million, to purchase research instrumentation, and NIH was the 		largest source of funds; and (3) 65 percent of respondents reported inadequate 		research equipment.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>A Study to 		Determine the Changes of Physician Prescribing of Antimicrobial Agents, 		Omeprazole, and H<sub>2</sub>-Receptor Antagonists for Peptic Ulcer Disease Two 		Years Following the NIH Consensus Conference on </i>Helicobacter 		pylori</b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This study 		evaluates physicians' prescribing patterns for the treatment of peptic ulcer 		disease (PUD). Its particular focus is whether recommendations of a February 		1994 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference 		advocating the use of antimicrobial agents for peptic ulcer patients with 		<b><i>Helicobacter pylori</i></b> infection were coincident with a change in 		physician prescribing patterns. The study uses computerized Pennsylvania 		Medicaid administrative data from January 1993 through February 1996 to 		evaluate prescribing patterns in the year prior and the two years following the 		NIH conference (12,737 patient records in all). Seven major therapeutic drug 		classes were analyzed: antimicrobial agents, H<sub>2</sub>-receptor 		antagonists, antisecretory agents, bismuth subsalicylate, sucralfate, 		misoprostol, and antacids. The report finds that (1) only 10 percent of 		prescriptions contained an antimicrobial agent, while 62 percent were for an 		H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist only; (2) the two- and three-drug regimens 		recommended by the NIH conference were infrequently prescribed (1.1 percent and 		0.9 percent, respectively); (3) younger and non-white PUD patients were more 		likely to receive a prescription for antimicrobial agents than older and white 		patients; (4) duodenal ulcer patients were more likely than non-duodenal ulcer 		patients to receive an antimicrobial prescriptions; and (5) the prescription of 		antimicrobial agents for the treatment of PUD significantly increased from 7 		percent to 14.2 percent over the study period, while prescriptions for 		H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists significantly decreased. The report 		concludes that, while there were increases in the prescription of antimicrobial 		agents to treat PUD over the study period, these could not be directly 		attributed to the NIH conference. Physicians do not appear to be using national 		recommendations. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Toxicology and 		Environmental Health Information Resources: The Role of the National Library of 		Medicine</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report examines the utility and accessibility of the National Library of 		Medicine's (NLM) Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program 		(TEHIP). The TEHIP program encompasses 16 online data bases that contain 		bibliographic and factual information on environmental contaminants, including 		chemical properties, carcinogenicity, exposure levels, adverse health effects, 		emergency treatment protocols, and Federal regulations. The report notes that 		Federal appropriations for the TEHIP program have remained relatively constant 		over the past 29 years. However, the program's reimbursements from other 		agencies for collaborative projects have fluctuated. The report also notes that 		the TEHIP data base represents only a small subset of the many data bases 		containing information related to toxicology and environmental health. With 		this in mind, the report recommends that NLM consider expanding its traditional 		library services by organizing and cataloging the full spectrum of online 		toxicology and environmental health information resources. The report also 		recognizes that the health professional community does not have homogenous 		information needs and that there is wide variation in access to online data 		bases and other information resources. It recommends that the TEHIP program 		should set priorities that would allow efforts to be focused on those data 		bases that meet the information needs of the greatest number of health 		professionals and that NLM's training and outreach efforts be increased to 		improve awareness of the TEHIP program. The report notes that access to the 		data bases and difficulties in navigating the user interfaces are the two 		primary factors limiting use of the TEHIP data bases. The report also provides 		recommendations on programmatic issues and future directions for the TEHIP 		program. (Final report: 139 pages, plus appendices.) </p>

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report evaluates the International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups (ICBG) 		program. Funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science 		Foundation, the ICBG is a program designed to protect human health, advance the 		conservation of biologically diverse ecosystems, and promote sustainable 		economic development through the search for drugs to control diseases of 		concern to both developed and developing countries. Since 1993, the program has 		funded five individual cooperative biodiversity groups around the world. The 		study design attempts to (1) accommodate the varied and nonstandard 		implementations of the ICBG concept, (2) obtain broad coverage in terms of 		respondents, (3) maximize response rates and data quality, (4) minimize burden 		on ICBG Group Leaders and other respondents, and (5) incorporate cost and time 		efficiencies wherever possible. Among the benefits for source countries, the 		report finds (1) that scientific capacity has been developed through training 		and equipment, (2) development of economic activities, (3) equitable financial 		return and the protection of intellectual property rights of source-country 		people, and (4) the potential sustainability of the individual ICBG projects is 		one of the strengths of the overall program. The report recommends that the 		ICBG program (1) develop systems of technical assistance based on a combination 		of outside expertise and lessons learned across programs; (2) improve 		communications among the ICBGs; (3) consider developing a cross-ICBG data base 		that includes work being done in collection, extractions, and drug development 		techniques; and (4) bring in the expertise of social scientists and 		source-country legal experts to the ICGB to ensure that the consensus-building, 		benefit sharing, and economic goals of this project are achieved as well.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Finding the 		Balance: Report of the National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research 		Program (IRP) Planning Committee</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute of Mental Health 		(NIMH) must be positioned to make scientific advances crucial to easing the 		burden of mental disorders. This report represents an active effort by the NIMH 		IRP Planning Committee to help the program make these advances. The Committee 		evaluated the rationale for the program's continuance, as well as its strengths 		and weaknesses. It solicited confidential letters from almost 1,000 IRP 		scientists and staff and met with National Institutes of Health (NIH) 		leadership, the IRP's past and present leadership, and advocacy organizations. 		It found strong justification for the continued existence of the IRP, as long 		as the research it produces is of the highest quality. The Committee also 		offered recommendations to revitalize the IRP. The report finds that (1) stable 		scientific leadership is crucial to revitalizing IRP science, thus the program 		must recruit a Scientific Director for the program; (2) the overall quality of 		IRP science has declined from its previous place at the top of the scientific 		endeavor-while there are some areas of research brilliance, some research is of 		lesser quality, according to members of the Board of Scientific Counselors and 		intramural and extramural scientists; (3) recruitment and retention of talented 		scientists is essential, but over the past five years, the program has 		recruited from outside of NIH only one of its four newly-tenured scientists; 		(4) the quality of the program's intramural training efforts is uneven; (5) the 		program should address the fact that post-doctoral fellows have difficulty 		competing for positions when they leave NIH due to a lack of sufficient 		grantsmanship and teaching experience; and (6) NIMH's IRP's clinical research 		program needs to be sustained and revitalized. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>State Assisted 		Living Policy: 1996</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Assisted 		living facilities are an expanding source of supportive housing and services, 		and represent a new model of long-term care. Consumer choice and control are 		central to assisted living models, which seek to allow consumers to control key 		features of their living environments and to direct their own receipt of 		services. This study reviews the assisted living and board and care policies in 		each of the fifty States. Fifteen States have existing licensure regulations 		for assisted living facilities and an additional nine States are developing 		regulations. Twenty-two States reimburse or plan to reimburse assisted living 		as a Medicaid service and six States provide Medicaid payments for services in 		board and care settings. Thirteen states have created a task force or a process 		within a State agency to make recommendations for the development of assisted 		living rules. One of the major difficulties associated with assisted living is 		the lack of a common or standard definition of this kind of care. However, 		State approaches share common components, including that (1) assisted living is 		characterized as residential, rather than institutional; (2) health or medical 		services are provided, either by facility staff or through contracts with 		community agencies; (3) assisted living is a model emphasizing consumer or 		resident independence, autonomy, dignity, privacy, and decisionmaking; and (4) 		many States attempt to combine minimum standards of safety and quality of care 		while also allowing market forces to shape quality. State policies generally 		address three major issues: (1) the requirement for a living unit, (2) 		admission and retention criteria, and (3) the level of services to be provided. 		The report provides specific information about policies in each State. See also 		PIC ID Nos. 4719-4719.2 and 4719.4-4719.5. (Final report: 225 		pages.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluation of 		the Minority Male Consortium for Violence Prevention</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		project evaluated the Office of Minority Health Minority Male Consortium for 		Family and Community Violence Prevention Programs. At the time of this study, 		19 historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) were participating in 		this program. Features of violence prevention program models at 13 historically 		black colleges and universities/family life centers (HBCUs/FLCs) were 		synthesized to determine approaches that could prevent or minimize violence in 		communities committed on or by minority males. The contractor (1) performed an 		extensive literature review; (2) collected and analyzed relevant program 		documentation and materials; (3) conducted focus groups; (4) examined target 		populations; (5) developed a site visit discussion guide; (6) selected 10 HBCUs 		for site visits; (6) developed and executed an analysis plan; (7) interpreted 		analysis findings, including defining program models and analyzing HBCUs' 		organizational capacity; (8) held briefings with Consortium leaders, members, 		and government personnel; (9) reviewed the overall organization, design, and 		implementation of the programs; and (10) evaluated prevention strategies 		adopted by the HBCU/FLCs. Violence prevention programs suffer from an inability 		to produce valid performance data demonstrating that prevention investments pay 		off in the long run. The report recommends that (1) without completely 		centralizing the design process, the Federal government and the Consortium 		should move toward a consensus-seeking information model in which individual 		schools are no longer free to pursue independent designs; and (2) constraints 		should be introduced on which program models are implemented by which schools.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Determinants 		of AFDC Caseload Growth: Final Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		project examined the dynamics of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) 		caseload growth and analyzed the effects of economic, demographic, and 		programmatic changes at the State level on States' AFDC caseload from the early 		1980's to the present. Analysis of economic factors included measures of both 		wages and unemployment; analysis of demographic factors includes an emphasis on 		nonmarital childbearing. Analysis of program effects included changes arising 		from national welfare legislation, changes in State welfare parameters, State 		waivers, and changes in other programs such as Food Stamps and Medicaid. The 		project addressed the interaction of these factors by analyzing the economic, 		demographic, and programmatic factors simultaneously. Compared to earlier 		studies of AFDC caseload determinants, many of which are outdated, this study 		focused much more on State-level indicators, and included a more comprehensive 		set of economic, demographic, and programmatic factors. Recently, many State 		policymakers have expressed concern over the effect of future recessions or 		nonmarital birth rates on their caseloads, and this study is intended to be a 		valuable tool to State policymakers as they continue to assume greater 		responsibility for their AFDC programs and consider new 		innovations. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Informal and 		Formal Kinship Care</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>A growing 		number of States prefer to place children who have been removed from their 		homes of origin in the home of a relative. This practice is known as kinship 		foster care, and is a growing component of family foster care. It comprises 		between one-third and one-half of all foster care days provided in the States 		with the largest foster care populations. Many children, however, live with 		relatives who are not their parents in an informal relationship. In all, about 		2.15 million children lived in the care of relatives without a parent present 		in 1994. This study uses several data sources to examine the characteristics of 		informal kinship care arrangements and how they compare with those initiated 		through or subsidized by the State child welfare system. It considers national 		patterns, examines living arrangement patterns by State for FY 1990, compares 		formal and informal kinship care in four States, and uses Illinois data to 		provide a more focused picture of kinship care. The two-volume report finds 		that (1) kinship care is more prevalent in the South and in non-metropolitan 		areas, and for older children; (2) about two-thirds of kinship caregivers are 		the child's grandparents-about half are currently married, and over 85 percent 		of single kinship caregivers are women; (3) kinship caregivers are more likely 		to be currently unmarried, to be less educated, to be poor, and to receive 		social welfare benefits than are live-in parents; (4) nationally, just over 2 		percent of children lived with relatives not their parents (this percentage 		ranges by State from under 1 percent to well over 3 percent) (5) higher levels 		of kinship care (as well as single mother households) appear to be direct 		products of higher levels of social disruption and family disorganization; and 		(6) while informal kinship care patterns were roughly similar in the four 		States examined, the use of formal kinship care varies widely.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Approaches to 		Evaluating Welfare Reform: Lessons from Five State 		Demonstrations</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Most 		States have obtained waivers from Aid to Families with Dependent Children 		(AFDC) and Food Stamp Program rules in order to implement welfare reform. 		Between 1993 and 1996, the Clinton Administration approved waivers for 43 		States. This project examined waiver demonstration projects in five States 		(California, Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin). Four of the five 		States used an experimental evaluation design, while the fifth used a 		quasi-experimental evaluation design. This two-volume report addresses issues 		in five areas: (1) the choice between an experimental and quasi-experimental 		evaluation design, (2) sample design, (3) implementation of experimental 		evaluations, (4) data collection, and (5) analysis methods. The report finds 		that: (1) most evaluations of State welfare reform demonstrations used an 		experimental design, which involved random assignment of cases to an 		experimental group subject to welfare reform or to a control group subject to 		pre-reform policies; (2) only one waiver (Wisconsin's) was approved with a 		quasi-experimental design, but this may become more common in a block grant 		environment; and (3) when designing a study sample, evaluation planners should 		ensure that the sample size is adequate and should design the sample so that 		applicant and recipient subgroups can support separate impact estimates (the 		sample should also be representative of the State as a whole). The report also 		finds that four aspects of the implementation of an experimental evaluation 		require special care: (1) the timing of the random assignment, (2) the method 		of the random assignment, (3) ensuring that control group policies remain 		unchanged, and (4) preventing experimental and control group cases from 		changing status. The report also discusses data collection and analysis. (Final 		report: Volume I: 128 pages, plus appendices; Volume II: 8 		pages.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Efforts by 		Child Welfare Agencies to Address Domestic Violence: The Experiences of Five 		Communities</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Child 		protective services (CPS) and domestic violence services historically have not 		been closely linked. However, child welfare agencies across the country are 		beginning to consider how families in their child protection caseload are 		affected by domestic violence and are reexamining their policies accordingly. 		This report documents how child welfare agencies in five communities 		(Massachusetts; Michigan; San Diego County, California; Hilo, Hawaii; and 		Oregon) are attempting to integrate domestic violence concerns into their 		services. The communities were chosen for study because they are extending 		their services well beyond educating staff in domestic violence concerns. The 		report finds that (1) child welfare agencies have initiated changes from 		different organizational points within their agencies and have taken different 		approaches to changing case practice; (2) these agencies cannot make 		appropriate changes without major and continuing collaboration with community 		stakeholders who work with domestic violence victims and perpetrators; (3) 		chief among the concerns raised is the need to refrain from actions that 		further endanger mothers and children; (4) changes will also benefit from close 		collaboration with police, civil and criminal courts, corrections, the schools, 		and local clinics and hospitals; and (5) ongoing technical assistance to CPS 		staff after initial training in domestic violence services appears to make a 		more lasting difference on workers' ability to put the content of training into 		practice on a daily basis. The report closes with a general discussion of (1) 		approaches to addressing domestic violence within child welfare agencies; (2) 		the role of the larger community; (3) more complex policy questions, such as 		whether a child's witnessing of domestic violence is itself abusive; and (4) 		evaluating the effectiveness of these efforts.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluability 		Assessment of Responsible Fatherhood Programs</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: 		</b>Responsible fatherhood programs provide fathers, particularly those who are 		young, unmarried, and unemployed, with the support and skills to become active 		participants in their children's lives. An increased interest in fatherhood 		programs and a lack of information on their accessibility and effectiveness led 		to this evaluability assessment. This study visited five fatherhood program 		sites, selected as the most developed programs by HHS, in order to (1) assess 		the readiness of fatherhood programs for formal evaluation and identify 		obstacles to their evaluation in the future, and (2) illustrate the evaluation 		process and mechanisms that must be in place before a formal impact evaluation 		is undertaken. The project goal was to develop an evaluation design that could 		be used by HHS and other policymakers in the future to evaluate such programs. 		The report concludes that at this time formal program evaluation remains 		premature because the programs (1) are new and still at the stage of refining 		recruiting methods and program services, (2) lack automated systems for 		tracking and reporting on clients, and (3) serve a very small number of 		clients. In order to conduct a rigorous evaluation of fatherhood programs, the 		report suggests the development of (1) measurable outcomes; (2) defined service 		components and their hypothesized relationship to outcomes; (3) an established 		recruiting, enrollment, and participation process; (4) an understanding of the 		characteristics of the target population, program participants, and program 		environment; and (5) an ability to collect and maintain an adequate program 		size. The report concludes that to increase viability, fatherhood programs must 		(1) develop a core definition of what constitutes a responsible fatherhood 		program, (2) conduct process evaluations, (3) build basic management 		information system capacity, and (4) stabilize and enhance funding.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Trends in the 		Well-Being of America's Children and Youth: '97</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This is 		the second edition of an annual report from HHS on the well-being of children 		and youth in the United States. The report's purpose is to provide the policy 		community, the media, and all interested citizens with a statistical overview 		describing the condition of children. The report focuses on trends in the 		well-being of children and youth in five key areas: population, family, and 		neighborhood; economic security; health conditions and health care; social 		development, behavioral health, and teen fertility; and education and 		achievement. The report, as it pertains to teenagers, finds (1) a decrease in 		the pregnancy rate among young women aged 15-19 since 1991; (2) an increase in 		alcohol, cigarette, marijuana, and cocaine use in the 1990's; (3) a modest gain 		in math and science proficiency by 17-year-old students since the early 1980's; 		(4) a sustained increase in mortality for black youth aged 15-19 since 1991, 		while there was a decrease in mortality rates for white youth; and (5) a steady 		increase in receipt of early prenatal care by teen mothers. Federal statistical 		data lack (1) standardized measures of social development and health-related 		behaviors for very young and pre-teenaged children; (2) indicators that reflect 		important social processes affecting child well-being that go on inside the 		family and within the neighborhood; and (3) sufficient information on child 		abuse and neglect, youth violent crime, day care quality, learning 		disabilities, and measures of children in institutionalized care. The Federal 		Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics has adopted a mandate to 		improve the statistical system. As data become available they will be 		incorporated into new editions of this report. (Final report: variously 		paginated.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Assessment of 		Performance Measures for Public Health, Substance Abuse, and Mental 		Health</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The Panel 		on Performance Measures and Data for Public Health Performance Partnership 		Grants (PPGs) was established in order to examine the state-of-the-art in 		performance measurement for public health and to recommend measures that could 		be used to monitor the PPG agreements to be negotiated between each State and 		the Federal government. The panel considered performance measures in ten public 		health areas: chronic diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, human 		immunodeficiency virus infection and tuberculosis, mental health, immunization, 		substance abuse, sexual assault, disabilities, and emergency medical services. 		More than 3,200 measures were proposed to the panel through various outreach 		efforts. The panel used four guidelines for assessing the performance measures: 		(1) the measure should be specific and results oriented; (2) the measure should 		be meaningful and understandable; (3) data should be adequate to support the 		measure; and (4) the measure should be valid, reliable, and responsive. The 		measures that scored the highest are recommended for use in performance 		monitoring. They cover health status, social functioning, consumer 		satisfaction, and risk status. In assessing the adequacy of data for specific 		performance measures, the panel concluded that there are few available data 		sources that are ideal for performance monitoring. Many Federal efforts to 		collect health-related data provide national rates, but do not collect data 		that provide State-level rates, and much State-level data may not be 		comparable. The report also finds that many of the performance measures 		presented can and should be subdivided to focus on specific high-risk 		populations in a State. See also PIC ID No. 6200.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Registry of 		State-Level Efforts to Integrate Health Information</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In 1996, 		HHS contracted The Lewin Group to develop a registry of projects that 		integrates health information systems at the State level. The registry is 		located on the World Wide Web at </p>
<p><b><i><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/statereg/index.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/statereg/index.htm</a>.</i></b> 	    The home page compiles, 		abstracts, and indexes summary information on data integration projects for all 		50 States and the District of Columbia. The purpose of the registry is twofold. 		First, the registry gives Federal policymakers a central source for researching 		the types of integration activities being pursued by individual States. Second, 		the registry facilitates communication among States regarding data integration 		activities and related data policy activities. The project (1) provides a 		resource for State and local policymakers as they seek to identify others who 		have pursued information integration activities; (2) facilitates information 		sharing and collaboration across States; and (3) assists Federal policymakers 		in monitoring, assessing, and supporting State-level integration activities. 		Relevant State integration projects were identified through: (1) contacts with 		State officials responsible for hospital discharge data bases, vital 		statistics, Medicaid data, and any other major information system or 		data-related offices; (2) conferences on State data integration activities; (3) 		grantee information related to specific funds which target information 		activity; (4) State health department websites; and (5) recommendations from 		people interviewed. A contract with The Lewin Group has been issued to organize 		and edit the materials that are submitted and encourage biannual updates of the 		site. The data base is administered by the Office of the Assistant Secretary 		for Planning and Evaluation.

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Federal 		welfare policy requires minor custodial parents receiving cash assistance to 		attend school and to live with their parents or in an adult-supervised setting; 		these requirements were established as part of the Personal Responsibility and 		Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, which created the program for Temporary 		Assistance for Needy Families and abolished the Aid to Families with Dependent 		Children (AFDC) program. This two-volume report summarizes lessons learned from 		the operational experiences in four States (Arizona, California, Massachusetts, 		and Virginia) that implemented waivers requiring school attendance and certain 		living arrangements under the AFDC program. The report finds that (1) 		identifying teenage parents, particularly those who do not head their own cash 		assistance cases, can be a major challenge; (2) persistent staff training to 		correct errors, the use of alternative information sources to identify teenage 		parents, and establishing positive incentives for identifying and referring all 		teenage parents can help to address these challenges; (3) a range of education 		options, including GED programs, should be available; (4) programs must 		determine the focus and scope of case management in light of goals and costs; 		(5) monitoring school attendance increases welfare agency workload-sometimes 		substantially-and can complicate the relationship between welfare agencies and 		schools; (6) a very restrictive living arrangement requirement may create 		implementation difficulties; and (7) funding group homes may enable States to 		have fewer exceptions to the requirement, but despite their advantage for teen 		parents, many may not choose to reside in them.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Deriving 		State-Level Estimates from National Surveys: A Statistical Assessment and State 		Tabulations</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is changing its focus from the 		national to the State level. Landmark legislation eliminating entitlement to 		Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits and block granting it to the 		States was passed at the time of this report. This project is one component of 		a larger HHS strategy to generate valid and reliable State-level estimates, 		which can be used to measure the impact of social policy interventions. This 		project (1) appreciates the statistical issues involved in addressing policy 		and research questions at the State level with national survey data; (2) 		assesses the current capabilities of these major surveys to provide answers to 		these questions at the State level; and (3) presents options for obtaining 		valid, reliable State-level data from relatively minimal enhancements and 		changes to the design of the surveys. The study focused on three major Federal 		surveys: the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP); the Current 		Population Survey (CPS); and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). These 		surveys were selected for their widespread applicability, use, and potential 		for analyzing policy issues. The report evaluates statistical concerns to 		determine the suitability and potential of using the selected surveys for 		State-level estimates and to identify differences between States. These 		technical concerns included variance estimation, standard errors, the 		construction of State-level weights, minimum sample sizes needed, design 		effects, pooling several years of data, and longitudinal issues (e.g., response 		rates and weighting). The report recommends periodic redesign efforts and other 		survey enhancements. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Information 		Needs Associated with the Changing Organization and Delivery of Health Care: 		Summary of Perceptions, Activities, Key Gaps, and 		Priorities</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report assesses unmet needs for supply-side information (information about 		health care providers and insurers) on the health system, focusing on helping 		the Department of Health and Human Services identify how information needs 		associated with a changing health care system are perceived by a wide variety 		of user groups and constituencies. Based on information gathered from over 50 		individuals and a review of relevant literature and Web sites, the report 		examines perceived gaps, their causes, and the activities generated in response 		to those perceptions. It also considers, in a more comprehensive manner, 		information on a diverse group of 11 entities. The report finds that (1) the 		serious gaps in "supply-side" information on the health system have grown worse 		as the system has evolved, presenting major obstacles to stakeholders' ability 		to serve their constituency, address operational needs, and participate in 		policy decisions; (2) the growth of managed care and consolidation has 		contributed to the need for supply-side information, as has the growing 		interest in accountability, competition, and cost-containment; (3) stakeholders 		say they need better information on health insurers and plans and the ways in 		which providers are linked to plans and integrated systems; and (4) better 		transaction-level data are needed, as are data from the State and local levels. 		The report identifies 23 ongoing efforts within the private sector, States, and 		foundations to address these gaps, and studies 11 of these more thoroughly. The 		report concludes that private sector stakeholders and States alone cannot 		sufficiently address supply-side information needs, giving importance to 		Federal leadership and convening functions.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Iowa's Limited 		Benefit Plan</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Iowa's 		Family Investment Program (FIP) replaced Aid to Families with Dependent 		Children in 1993. FIP participants who are able-bodied and not caring for 		children, yet who do not develop and carry out a Family Investment Agreement 		(FIA), are sanctioned with assignment to the Limited Benefit Plan (LBP); some 		clients may also choose LBP over FIP. LBP originally provided 3 months of 		benefits at FIP levels, followed by 3 months of reduced levels and 6 months of 		no cash benefits; the program was later changed to eliminate the original 		3-month period. At the end of the 6-month period, the client can reapply for 		FIP, but must meet its requirements. This report present finding from a study 		of the original LBP, showing how some families enter the LBP and how their 		well-being changes after benefits are cut. It examines records for over 4,200 		cases assigned to LBP records during 6 months in 1994 and 1995, a survey of 137 		cases whose cash benefits were terminated, and case studies of 12 LBP families. 		The report finds that (1) most clients are assigned to LBP for failing to 		develop and sign an FIA, rather than for failing to carry it out; (2) slightly 		more than half of LBP clients subsequently meet FIP requirements and are 		reassigned to the program; (3) about half of LBP clients whose cash benefits 		have been terminated are employed immediately after cash benefits end, but 		about half are not; (4) 40 percent of these clients increase their monthly 		incomes by an average of $496 when their benefits end, but 47 percent see a 		decrease in their monthly incomes averaging $384; and (5) other government 		programs remain important sources of support for LBP families whose cash 		benefits have been terminated. The report notes that there are several features 		of the LBP program that mitigate against extreme deprivation when cash 		assistance has been terminated, and notes that the absence of these safeguards 		in a national welfare reform program could result in extreme hardship for many 		families.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Role of Home- 		and Community-Based Services in Meeting the Health Care Needs of People with 		HIV/AIDS: Literature Review</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report provides an overview of the literature describing the delivery and 		financing of home- and community-based services for people with AIDS, focusing 		on the literature published since 1991. The literature review finds that (1) 		since the start of the epidemic, the AIDS population has been decreasingly made 		up of white male homosexuals and increasingly made up of people of color with 		low incomes and low educational levels; (2) new AIDS treatments combining 		protease inhibitors and other antiretroviral medications may increase life 		expectancy among some people with AIDS but annual costs range from $9,000 to 		$18,000 per person; (3) the lifetime cost of AIDS treatment has been rising, 		since drugs have been increasing life expectancy even before the introduction 		of protease inhibitors; (4) AIDS patients who experience periods of disability 		require nursing and support services to complement medical care, including 		assistance with daily living activities, child care, transportation, help 		applying for public assistance, and the like; (5) the increasing number of 		low-income people with AIDS places a heavier burden on public programs such as 		Medicaid and Ryan White CARE Act funding; (6) the Medicare program has borne a 		relatively small proportion of the burden for AIDS care, but this may increase 		as life expectancy increases; (7) rigorous evaluation of programs that provide 		home- and community-based services to people with AIDS appears to be lacking; 		(8) the literature provided little data describing current levels of use of and 		cost for home- and community-based services by people with AIDS; and (9) there 		is little information about how effectively managed care is meeting the need 		for these services. The review examines literature on the provision of these 		services to these elderly to draw inferences for their application to the AIDS 		population. See also PIC ID No. 6418.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Exploring the 		Feasibility of Linking Health Expenditure and Utilization 		Data</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The Health 		Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has the responsibility for 		assessing the adequacy of the Nation's supply of various health professions. 		HRSA commissioned a "General Services Demand Model" (GSDM) in 1994 to permit 		State-specific estimates of health utilization, which it then inputs into 		State-specific provider requirements forecasts. HRSA's GSDM predicts, for each 		State and the District of Columbia: bed days in short-term general hospitals 		for the under-65 and over-65 populations, outpatient visits, and emergency 		visits. HRSA then takes these predictions and estimates requirements for 		various health professions for each State. The estimates are typically based on 		assumptions about appropriate provider staffing/utilization ratios; for 		example, each primary care physician can perform 3,000 office visits in a year. 		From the data and assumptions, a set of State-specific provider requirement 		forecasts can be generated. In general, these forecast supply and demand for 		physicians by speciality type, as well as for registered nurses. The Health 		Care Financing Administration compiles national health account expenditures for 		hospital services, physician services, prescription drugs, and other areas. The 		goal of these projects is to link these two data bases over a 2 to 3-year 		period and then use the model to simulate the utilization and cost savings 		potential of reorganizing the delivery of care (for example, using HMO 		specialist/generalist staffing ratios versus the current fee-for-service 		norms). The ultimate model could be used to analyze utilization and expenditure 		patterns. We know, for example, that managed care enrollees, other things being 		equal, have 20 percent fewer beds and 10 percent fewer specialist visits than 		indemnity enrollees. The ultimate model could provide an estimate of 		utilization and cost-savings effects of HMOs entering and achieving a 30 		percent share in, for example, Alabama over the next 5 years. 		</p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Public Health 		Laboratories and Health System Change</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>All 50 		States and the District of Columbia operate their own Public Health 		Laboratories (PHLs). Changes in the private health care delivery system, 		especially the growth of managed care organizations (MCOs), hospital 		consolidations, and large commercial laboratories are causing public health 		professionals to examine the viability of publicly funded laboratories in this 		new environment. The study identifies aspects of the public health 		infrastructure critical for developing assessment and evaluation tools. The 		report includes a literature review, interviews with stakeholders, an informal 		poll of State PHL directors, and detailed case studies of three States that 		have PHLs with relationships with MCOs and/or private laboratories. The report 		concludes that (1) PHLs are part of the broader public health infrastructure 		and, as such, must respond to changes in the health care marketplace; (2) 		services that are not commercially viable within the private sector, and those 		that are critical to identifying emerging diseases, should remain in the domain 		of PHLs; (3) assurance of quality and consistency of laboratory testing are 		critical functions of PHLs; and (4) policy development in laboratories needs to 		address the growth of managed care and changes in the health care delivery 		system. The study recommends increased Federal guidance in (1) assessing the 		regionalization of laboratory services, (2) supporting information 		infrastructure development, and (3) facilitating communication between private 		and public sectors.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>A Framework 		for Assessing Insurer Responses to Health Care Market 		Changes</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Over the 		past 15 to 20 years, the health insurance market has changed dramatically. 		Where once a few large commercial carriers dominated the market with 		fee-for-service plans, there are now dozens of plans in most markets. In highly 		competitive markets, plans and carriers develop more sophisticated strategies 		and arrangements to identify and retain target markets. In order to 		successfully integrate government programs and develop public policy, insurers' 		business strategies need to be better understood. Understanding insurers' 		strategies is important for policy analysis because insurers are often 		regulated entities; and insurers' responses to changing market and regulatory 		conditions affect both patients' and providers' opportunities and outcomes. 		This report (1) identifies insurer and insurance market characteristics that 		are likely to be important determinants of insurers' response to policy changes 		(such as insurance market reform) and changes in local market conditions (such 		as aggressive entry of managed care plans), (2) identifies potential data 		sources and data needs for future empirical work, and (3) provides a better 		understanding of the operation of insurance markets and how insurers make 		business decisions based on the demand for insurance from employers and 		individuals. In order to improve the analysis of health insurance markets, the 		report recommends (1) measuring changes in the relative density of the health 		plan contour "web," (2) tracking premiums and loading factors, (3) monitoring 		the self-insured market, and (4) watching organized buyers.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Establishing 		an Analytical Framework for Measuring the Role of Reinsurance in the Health 		Insurance Market</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: 		</b>Reinsurance is widely used by underwriters of health benefits to limit 		their risk exposure. Reinsurance contracts can be structured in many ways, and 		insurers can use it to limit their risk for an individual contract or exposure, 		for a group of contracts or exposures, or for a whole portion of the insurer's 		business. This report presents a limited analytical study of the level of risk 		borne by reinsurers in three markets: the indemnity insurance market, the 		managed care market, and the self-insured employer benefit plan market. The 		study focuses on three States using public and private data sources, including 		surveys, published private data, and information from filings made by private 		insurance companies. The purpose of the study is to determine to what extent 		these data can be used to measure the role of reinsurance in the various 		markets and to suggest ways whereby better assessments of reinsurance might be 		made. The report was generally unable to identify either data sources or 		existing research allowing quantification of the risk being ceded to reinsurers 		in the three markets. While a substantial amount of information is available 		about reinsurance in indemnity (non-HMO) health insurers, the data are 		aggregated in ways that make it difficult to specifically identify transactions 		related to primary health insurance offered to groups and individuals. 		Information from State HMO insurance filings is more useful, but lack of detail 		and inconsistencies in the way that HMOs report the information in their annual 		statements reduces its analytic potential. Finally, despite the substantial 		amount of information available about the prevalence of self-funding and the 		use of reinsurance by self-funded employers, there are virtually no reliable 		data about the level of risk being transferred to reinsurers in these 		arrangements. The report closes with suggestions for enhancing the data 		available on this subject. (Final report: 23 pages, plus 		appendices.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>National 		Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies: Evaluating Two Welfare-to-Work 		Program Approaches: Two Year Findings on the Labor Force Attachment and 		Human</i> <i>Capital Development Programs in Three Sites</i></b> 		</p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report is part of a larger study called the National Evaluation of 		Welfare-to-Work Strategies, formerly known as the JOBS Evaluation, which has 		randomly assigned more than 55,000 individuals in seven sites to groups 		eligible for specific welfare-to-work programs and to control groups that do 		not participate in these programs. This study compares two distinct 		welfare-to-work strategies-labor force attachment (LFA) and human capital 		development (HCD)-at each of three of sites: Atlanta, GA; Grand Rapids, MI; and 		Riverside, CA. At each site, Aid to Families with Dependent Children applicants 		were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a group subject to the LFA 		program, a group subject to the HCD program, or a control group not subject to 		any welfare-to-work program. This report presents findings on the 		implementation, participation patterns, and costs of the two types of programs 		operated at each site. Additionally, the report assesses the two program 		approaches in promoting employment and reducing welfare expenditures after 2 		years. The study finds that (1) the LFA programs increased participation in the 		job search and HCD programs increased participation in adult basic education; 		(2) welfare sanction rates for nonparticipation were higher in the LFA and HCD 		programs than in previously studied programs, although higher sanction rates 		were not associated with higher rates of eventually participating in program 		activities; (3) the HCD programs cost about twice as much as the LFA programs; 		(4) both programs increased individuals' 2-year cumulative employment and 		earnings, and (5) both programs reduced welfare expenditures within the 2-year 		followup period. The report concludes that a period of 2 years is insufficient 		to make a credible comparison of the two approaches. See also PIC ID series 		5776 and PIC ID Nos. 6576 and 6576.2.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Improving 		Health in the Community: A Role for Performance 		Monitoring</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report draws on lessons from a number of current community health efforts to 		outline the elements of a community health improvement process, discusses the 		role that performance monitoring can play in this process, and proposes tools 		to help communities develop performance indicators. A recent emphasis on the 		interdependence of stakeholders requires collaborative efforts to improve 		community health: performance monitoring (a continuing process of selecting 		indicators that can be used to measure the process and outcomes of an 		intervention and making the results available to the community) has gained 		increasing currency as a way to do so. The report finds that a community health 		improvement process (CHIP) can be an important tool for developing a shared 		vision and supporting a planned and integrated approach to improving community 		health. The report suggests that a CHIP should include two principal 		interacting cycles based on analysis, action, and measurement: (1) a problem 		identification and prioritization cycle; and (2) the analysis and 		implementation cycle. This system differs from standard models primarily 		because of its emphasis on measurement to link performance and accountability 		on a community-wide basis. The report offers recommendations for implementing 		the CHIP concept: (1) communities should base a health improvement process on a 		broad definition of health and a comprehensive conceptual model of how health 		is produced within the community; (2) a CHIP should develop its own set of 		specific, quantitative performance measures and should seek a balance between 		strategic opportunities for long-term health improvement and short-term goals; 		(3) State and local health agencies should assure that an effective community 		health improvement process is in place in all communities; and (4) the Public 		Health Service should provide support and guidance in these efforts.

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report (1) identifies privacy issues surrounding research on personally 		identifiable health data, paying special attention to the international 		aspects; (2) reviews the ethical, legal, and general social context surrounding 		the privacy and confidentiality of health data; (3) describes relevant 		privacy-protection practices and problems, and identifies emerging issues; (4) 		analyzes the implications of the new European Union Data Privacy Directive and 		related policy and legal changes; and (5) recommends policy approaches and 		technical processes for ensuring that the privacy of individuals is respected. 		The report examines four major groups of issues that are growing rapidly in 		scale and complexity, and that must be urgently attended to: (1) secondary uses 		of data and data linking, (2) research on private-sector health data, (3) 		cybersecurity, and (4) genetic privacy. The report finds that (1) as data bases 		are maturing and increasing in size and quality, their appeal as research 		resources is also growing; (2) if personally identifiable data must be used in 		secondary research, consent will become the most difficult issue; (3) for many 		health data held in the private sector, few legal controls apply in theory or 		are enforced in practice regarding such matters as data-subject consent, public 		notification, or transfer of the data for secondary study; (4) protection of 		the confidentiality and security of health data, especially electronic data, is 		being reviewed worldwide; and (5) developing ethical guidance over genetic 		privacy is crucial to the future of both genetic research and applied genetics. 		The report also examines the international flow of data, new health data 		privacy laws in Europe, the United States' new "Health Insurance Portability 		and Accountability Act," and the need for dialogue between the United States 		and Europe.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>State 		Regulatory Experience with Provider-Sponsored Organizations: Final 		Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report describes the experience of selected State governments in regulating 		provider-owned health care delivery systems that accept insurance risk for the 		provision or arrangement of health care services (provider-sponsored 		organizations, or PSOs). The States included in the study are California, 		Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington. 		The report finds that the main models States use to regulate the activities of 		PSOs contracting directly with purchasers of health care (e.g., employers) are 		(1) licensing these organizations as they would a non-provider owned entity, 		and (2) creating a separate licensing category for risk-assuming PSOs. 		Regulators in States using the first model regulate the activity of risk 		assumption; in some cases, they apply regulation pertaining to non-provider 		managed care entities to all organizations seeking to seeking to provide or 		arrange for health care delivery. In States where PSOs are licensed separately 		from other managed care organizations, differences in the standards required 		for PSOs varied and there was little consistency about the rationale for having 		separate licensing. The report also finds that the States vary considerably in 		their regulation of PSOs that assume risk from self-funded, ERISA-exempt 		employer plans. Most consider the PSO as engaging in the business of insurance 		(thus they may be regulated by the State despite the plan's ERISA status). 		States also vary in their regulation of PSOs that accept risk downstream from 		licensed insurance carriers or managed care organizations: some do not regulate 		these relationships, while others require special licensing or impose 		substantial requirements governing risk transfer agreements. The report 		concludes that, since State policy toward PSOs is still in the early stages of 		development, the lessons to be drawn for Federal policymakers is limited; 		however, some observations are offered. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Indicators of 		Welfare Dependence and Well-Being: Interim Report to 		Congress</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Welfare Indicators Act of 1994 directed the Secretary of Health and Human 		Services to conduct a study to determine which statistics would be most useful 		in tracking and predicting dependence on three means-tested cash- and 		nutritional-assistance programs: Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Food 		Stamps, and Supplemental Security Income. Enactment of the Personal 		Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 makes this task 		even more important. As this bill is implemented, traditional indicators of 		dependence may lose their meaning, making dependence more difficult to track 		over time. In response to these difficulties, this report recommends indicators 		that measure family well-being in addition to those that measure dependence. 		The report recommends two kinds of indicators: indicators of dependence, 		self-sufficiency, and family conditions; and indicators of child achievement, 		health, and well-being. In most cases, the recommended indicators should be 		tabulated separately for children, male non-elderly adults, female non-elderly 		adults, and other important population subgroups wherever possible. To measure 		dependence, self-sufficiency, and family conditions, the report recommends that 		indicators reflect points on a continuum from total dependence to complete 		self-sufficiency. Recommended indicators are grouped into several categories, 		including: (1) range of dependency, (2) work and job readiness, (3) poverty and 		deprivation, (4) family structure, and (5) parenting. To measure child 		achievement and health, the report recommends using indicators of infant and 		child mortality, low birthweight, child health limitations, teen birth rates, 		teen violent crime arrests, and others. Finally, the report discusses data 		needs for the recommended indicators. (Final report: variously paginated, plus 		appendices.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Setting the 		Baseline: A Report on State Welfare Waivers</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 		1996 eliminated the entitlement to Aid to Families with Dependent Children 		(AFDC) and replaced it with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a 		block grant which States can use to provide cash and services to low-income 		families with children. This report is one in a series designed to provide 		baseline information on the AFDC program as it existed prior to enactment of 		the new law. The report focuses on the waivers of AFDC requirements that were 		granted to States in the years preceding enactment of PRWORA. Between 1993 and 		1996, waivers were granted to 43 States to help them reform their welfare 		programs. The report provides an overview of the types of waivers that States 		requested and received, and provides details on specific State policies. The 		report finds that, in many regards, the waiver programs were the first phase of 		welfare reform. States were required to conduct evaluations of waiver impacts, 		and had to ensure that the programs would be cost-neutral (that is, that they 		would not require additional Federal spending). This cost-neutrality could be 		achieved over the entire waiver period, rather than in each year, as had been 		previously required. This allowed States to make large up-front investments 		that they expected to gain back through reduced benefit payments in later 		years. The report provides valuable information about how specific States 		approached the AFDC program and what the Federal government authorized them to 		implement so that the effects of the TANF program can be measured State by 		State. Furthermore, the TANF program allows States to maintain their waiver 		programs or to delay implementation of certain TANF provisions until their 		waiver expires. The bulk of the report consists of tables presenting 		information on various aspects of the waiver programs. (Final report variously 		paginated.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Market 		Barriers to the Development of Pharmacotherapies for the Treatment of Cocaine 		Abuse and Addiction: Final Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report presents an analysis of the market barriers to development of 		pharmacotherapies for substance abuse and addiction, particularly for abuse of 		and addiction to cocaine. There are more than 2 million addicted or "heavy" 		cocaine users. Of these, almost a million may enter treatment at least once in 		a given year. On any given day, about 10 percent of heavy cocaine users are 		enrolled in treatment programs. The report examines the development of 		pharmacotherapies for cocaine abusers in the light of the size of the potential 		market, estimates of market penetration, and the basic relationships between 		price, market size, and revenues. The report finds that there are several 		critical market barriers that must be taken into account. For example, there is 		a small and uncertain market for cocaine addiction and abuse pharmacotherapy. 		Although drug companies agree that the total number of cocaine users is 		significant, they believe that the feasible market for a cocaine abuse 		treatment is likely to be much smaller than the absolute number of people who 		use cocaine. Drug companies also anticipate that market penetration would be 		uncertain; potential patient compliance problems, limited access to patients, 		and the fact that most substance abuse treatment providers view drug use as a 		behavioral (rather than a medical) problem further exacerbate this uncertainty. 		Furthermore, the limited number and capacity of treatment facilities restricts 		market opportunities, as does the lack of medical treatment models. Finally, 		the substance abuse treatment market relies heavily on State and Federal 		reimbursement. Most substance abuse treatment services are subsumed under the 		mental health benefits of entitlement programs, and drug companies are 		reluctant to rely upon this kind of reimbursement in an age of shrinking 		budgets for mental health services. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: 		<i>Consumer-Directed Personal Assistance Services: Key Operational Issues for 		State CD-PAS Programs Using Intermediary Service 		Organizations</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This study 		was undertaken by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and 		Evaluation (OASPE) to identify best practices for implementing 		consumer-directed personal assistance (CD-PAS) programs through the use of 		various intermediary service organization (ISO) models. This report provides 		practical advice to State program administrators about the design and 		implementation of CD-PAS programs with ISOs in order that: (1) they comply with 		Federal tax and labor laws; (2) they make available supportive services that 		some consumers may want or need; and (3) they allow for the application and 		enforcement of any limitation or restrictions on consumer direction that may be 		required by State laws and regulations. The report draws a number of 		conclusions that cut across ISO models, including (1) that the most successful 		State-ISO contract relationships are forged when the State has a clear 		understanding of the services that it wishes to purchase from the ISO; (2) that 		consumers' backup plans for relief attendants frequently fail, causing 		consumers to have a difficult time finding relief attendants over weekends, 		holidays, and when the primary attendant is absent for any reason; (3) that 		consumers are reluctant to initiate criminal background checks on prospective 		attendants because they do not know how to conduct them and they feel these 		checks compromise the consumer-attendant relationship; and (4) that a number of 		disability advocates and CD-PAS consumers expressed concern about the potential 		impact of managed care on the availability of CD-PAS to eligible consumers. The 		report also makes recommendations on how to address these problems. (Final 		report: 70 pages; appendices bound separately.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Measuring 		Expenditures for Essential Public Health Services</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In 1995, 		the Public Health Foundation, under contract to the U.S. Public Health Service 		(PHS), worked with State and local public health, mental health, substance 		abuse, and environmental agencies in nine States-Arizona, Illinois, Iowa, 		Louisiana, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, and Washington-and with 		Federal PHS agencies to develop and test a methodology for estimating 		investments in ten essential public health services. These services include 		both personal health services (care provided to individuals) and 		population-based health services (interventions that prevent disease and 		promote health among entire populations). The report finds that public health 		expenditures can indeed be defined, measured, and monitored according to the 		essential services framework. The report also produced State-level estimates of 		essential public health services spending. It finds that (1) more than 2 of 		every 3 dollars spent by the 9 States on essential public health services ($6.1 		billion of $8.8 billion) was for personal health services; (2) population-based 		health services spending ($2.7 billion or $36 per capita) was only 1 percent of 		total health care expenditures in the participating States; (3) of the 		population-based expenditures, 26 percent was for enforcing laws and 		regulations protecting the health and safety of the public; (4) States were the 		largest funders of population-based health services, providing 50 percent of 		the total funding for these activities (Federal funding accounted for 32 		percent, while local and other sources accounted for the remaining 18 percent); 		and (5) of the $7.1 billion PHS expenditures on essential public health 		services, $2.4 billion (34 percent) supported prevention-related research and 		$2 billion (29 percent) supported personal health services. The report makes 		recommendations to improve the methodology for future data collection. (Final 		report: 36 pages, plus appendices.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluation of 		the HBCU Capacity Building Program</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In 1992, 		the Public Health Service (PHS) initiated the Historically Black Colleges and 		Universities (HBCUs) Capacity Building Program to increase HBCUs' involvement 		in health and social service programs funded by PHS and other Federal agencies. 		The hypothesis was that HBCUs could compete more effectively for grant monies 		if they had comprehensive and fully functional sponsored program offices 		(SPOs). This evaluation, conducted by the Office of Minority Health (OMH), 		addresses a series of questions regarding the appropriateness of program 		processes and the observable impacts of the program at four participating 		HBCUs. The OMH designed evaluation methods around a logic model that documents 		the links between program assumptions, activities, and final outcomes. The OMH 		collected data through questionnaires, site visits, and telephone interviews. 		The evaluation includes quantitative and categorical indicators of program 		implementation and outcomes, as well as comparisons of qualitative case 		histories. The report finds that the grant funds and technical assistance 		achieved many of the program's aims. An SPO was established at all four 		participating HBCUs, resulting in more structured and uniform procedures for 		obtaining and managing externally sponsored programs. Program impact data show 		that some desired outcomes, such as increased proposal submissions and awards, 		were partially achieved. The study concludes by highlighting major findings and 		recommendations related to program effectiveness, including the need for 		investments in programmatic, as well as administrative, infrastructure.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Environmental 		Health Data Needs: An Action Plan for Federal Public Health Agencies (Workshop 		Results, March 3-5, 1997-Linthicum Heights, Maryland)</i></b> 		</p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>State and 		local public health agencies have had a long-standing role in monitoring the 		human health hazards of environmental factors. Public health agencies must be 		able to collect the necessary information to assess the impact of environmental 		hazards on community health. The Federal government can help State and local 		public health agencies in environmental surveillance by identifying the types 		of information and data necessary to successfully protect community health. 		This report presents the findings of a conference held in March 1997 to assess 		the environmental health information needs of State and local governments. The 		report finds that (1) resources should be used to improve existing data 		collection systems and to increase data accessibility and usability, rather 		than to create new data collection systems; (2) the integration of activities 		and electronic data among public health, environmental health, and 		environmental protection agencies is vital; (3) the usefulness of environmental 		health information systems can be enhanced through common data architecture, 		delineation of core baseline and sentinel data, and a comprehensive, central 		environmental health data repository; (4) these information systems must be 		evaluated based on their usefulness to State and local agencies in responding 		to community demands for timely, accurate, and reliable information, and in 		achieving their research, surveillance, intervention, and health education 		goals; and (5) full funding of these systems is necessary so that they may be 		built into a national network that meets the needs of a national environmental 		health research agenda. The workshop also developed seven key roles the Federal 		government could play in helping States and localities improve their 		environmental health surveillance. Finally, the workshop considered potential 		short-term strategies to help the Federal government fulfill these roles. 		(Final report: 12 pages, plus appendices.) </p>

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		objectives articulated in <b><i>Healthy People 2000</i></b> aim to improve the 		health of Americans through effective prevention strategies. They form a model 		framework for results-oriented performance measurement that can be made 		relevant to both population-based and individual health care initiatives. They 		also serve as a benchmark against which health improvement efforts across the 		Nation can be measured over time. The development of <b><i>Healthy People 		2010</i></b> provides an opportunity to consider the successes and failures 		of<i> <b>Healthy People 2000</b> </i>in achieving these important goals. Based 		on experience with<i> <b>Healthy People 2000</b></i> and major changes since 		1990 in the Nation's health and health care, this report explores new 		approaches for the development of <b><i>Healthy People 2010.</i></b> The 		perspectives of the Healthy People Steering Committee and the Healthy People 		Consortium, made up of 350 member organizations were sought. Through interviews 		with key Steering Committee members, a retreat for the entire Steering 		Committee, and seven focus groups of Consortium members, clear themes and 		suggestions emerged. The report finds that both Steering Committee and 		Consortium members valued <b><i>Healthy People 2000</i> </b>as a framework and 		a voice for public health concerns and issues. However, both groups had several 		suggestions for the next version. For example, (1) most members of the Steering 		Committee thought that the document should be reduced in size, (2) Steering 		Committee members were more interested than Consortium members in making major 		changes to the document, (3) Consortium members recommended that current 		information technology be used in order that the document reach the widest 		audience possible, and (4) health care purchasers and managed care plans 		thought that there should be fewer priorities and objectives in order to focus 		on a limited number of problems.

<p><b>TITLE:<i> </i>Health of 		Washington Women</b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report examines the health and well-being of women in Washington State. A broad 		coalition of Washington's health care providers, researchers, and activists 		organized to implement this evaluation. To add to the quantitative data 		collected and analyzed, the report also includes qualitative information from 		focus groups of women from diverse geographical areas and economic and social 		strata. The focus groups were conducted to gather women's perceptions and 		satisfaction with the health care services they received throughout the State. 		The data show that the nearly 2.8 million women who live in Washington State 		are living longer lives, are making many positive decisions about their health, 		and experience, on average, a better standard of living than women in United 		States in general. The report finds that the overwhelming majority of women in 		the State are white and live in urban areas, but about 11.3 percent live below 		the poverty line. The report also finds that women reported more days of poor 		mental and physical health than did men, but that they are less likely than men 		to have a sedentary lifestyle, are less likely to smoke, and are more likely to 		eat healthy fruits and vegetables. Access to health care for Washington's women 		is relatively good, but about 10 percent did not participate in a health 		insurance plan in 1994 and 12 percent reported that they were unable to see a 		doctor because of the cost. Furthermore, elderly women, those with less than a 		high school education, and poor women were less likely to use mammography and 		have regular Pap smears. The report also examines rates of domestic violence 		and sexually-transmitted diseases, as well as mortality patterns and 		birth-related indicators. The report provides several policy recommendations to 		address problem areas for Washington women's health. (Final report: 68 pages, 		plus appendix.) </p>

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The Health 		Professions Clinical Training Program in Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse (Faculty 		Development Program, or FDP) was established in 1989 and offers training to 		faculty from schools of medicine, nursing, social work, and graduate psychology 		programs. The purpose of the FDP was to enhance research, teaching, and 		clinical practices on issues of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs (ATOD) within 		these fields. Specifically, the program seeks to (1) improve the knowledge and 		practice of participating faculty on ATOD-related issues; (2) incorporate 		ATOD-related issues into the curriculum at participating institutions; and (3) 		increase the level of institutional and professional support for ATOD in both 		policies and programs. The 5-year projects involved two phases: (1) faculty 		development and implementation efforts, and (2) an evaluation of the program's 		impact. The report finds that (1) all projects held meetings and seminars, 		provided mentoring to fellows, supported fellows' attendance at conferences and 		meetings, and promoted collaboration between fellows and other faculty members; 		(2) some project directors with extensive prior ATOD experience provided strong 		organizational leadership and fostered a group spirit among fellows, while 		others provided less direct guidance and worked with fellows individually; (3) 		less experienced directors tended to work with the fellows as peers in 		organizing activities and formulating a training program; (4) at least 		two-thirds of the fellows participated in all training activities (except for 		academic courses) during Years 1-3, while during Year 4, two-thirds continued 		to meet as a group, attended conferences, and engaged in independent studies; 		and (5) fellows noted three types of particularly helpful training 		experiences-literature collection and synthesis, participation in experiential 		learning, and collaborative curricula development and research.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Report on the 		CTS National Evaluation</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The Center 		for Substance Abuse Prevention national Training System (CTS) included the 		development and delivery of more than 30 distinct curricula on hundreds of 		occasions to more than 10,000 participants through 1996. Recipients included 		community teams, health professionals, State administrators, and a range of 		volunteers engaged in prevention activities. The report finds that CTS was 		innovative in several important ways, including (1) a focus on community 		coalitions and associations of health professionals that are responsible for 		planning and delivering prevention services, rather than concentrating on 		target populations; (2) curricula were developed quickly in response to 		emerging issues in the field; and (3) a continuing commitment to quality 		control and continual curricular improvement. The report also finds that, of 		three common levels of prevention training (introductory training, training 		directed at treatment providers and other health professionals, and approaches 		that contribute to broad systemic changes, usually directed at teams or 		coalitions), CTS was far more effective at delivering training at the lower two 		levels, given the complex nature of training for systemic change. The report 		then focuses on obstacles to training for systemic change, including (1) the 		difficulty of disseminating best practices, and (2) resistance to change by the 		prevention community. The report then discusses the principles of effective 		training. These include (1) attention to post-training application of the 		knowledge gained; (2) providing a blueprint or schema by which participants may 		understand the entire framework for a training effort; (3) focus on barriers to 		application, as well as advantages; (4) ensuring that training is culturally 		appropriate; and (5) training should encourage participants to use their 		intellectual and collective intellectual, verbal, emotional, artistic, and 		imaginative skills.

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The Center 		for Substance Abuse Treatment within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 		Services Administration sponsored a 4-year demonstration project of the Drug 		Treatment Enrichment Program (DTEP), which was put in place within the 		Department of Labor's Job Corps program. DTEP was implemented in four 		experimental Job Corps centers, which were matched with four control centers 		that provided the standard Job Corps Alcohol and Other Drugs of Abuse (AODA) 		program. The report finds that (1) the organizational location of DTEP within 		each Job Corps center's operations was problematic, since DTEP staff reported a 		lack of managerial support for the program, high staff turnover, and long 		periods for staff replacement; (2) the average cost per program participant for 		DTEP was twice the amount required for AODA; (3) DTEP reduced marijuana and 		crack/cocaine use post-Job Corps significantly more than did AODA; (4) DTEP 		students were less likely to engage in moderate to extensive use of marijuana 		or to use other drugs, but no differences were found for alcohol abuse; (5) 		DTEP improved students' mental health; (6) DTEP students were less likely to 		report selling or helping to sell drugs after Job Corps; (7) no differences 		between DTEP and AODA were found for other criminal activities; (8) DTEP 		students with mental health problems experienced a significantly higher job 		placement rate after Job Corps, although the program had no effect on job 		placement rates of other students; and (9) DTEP appeared to have no significant 		positive effect on duration of stay in Job Corps or on educational and 		vocational gains. The report makes recommendations regarding the integration of 		DTEP into Job Corps and other topics. (Final report: variously paginated, plus 		appendices.) </p>

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		National Treatment Improvement Evaluation Study (NTIES) is a comprehensive 		assessment of the results of 157 3-year demonstration grants and cooperative 		agreements funded by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment within the 		Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration beginning in 		1990-1991. These grants were intended to improve alcohol and drug treatment in 		selected target cities with severe substance abuse problems; among critical 		populations such as minority groups and women; and in the criminal justice 		system. Based on a final sample of 6,600 clients, the evaluation produced 		several results. For clients who entered treatment for alcohol and illegal drug 		use, the evaluation found that the program produced (1) a 78-percent reduction 		in selling drugs and committing violent crimes; (2) a 56-percent reduction in 		high-risk sexual behaviors related to HIV transmission; (3) a 53-percent 		reduction in medical visits; (4) a 42-percent reduction in homelessness; (5) a 		28-percent reduction in inpatient mental health visits; and (6) a 19-percent 		increase in employment.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluation of 		Model Projects for Pregnant and Postpartum Women and Their 		Infants</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In 1989, 		the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) implemented a national 		demonstration program to provide prevention, education, and intervention 		services to substance-abusing pregnant and postpartum women and infants 		(PPWIs). CSAP contracted this study in 1993 to (1) assess the effectiveness of 		the PPWI programs in enhancing services coordination and increasing the 		availability and accessibility of substance abuse prevention services delivered 		to clients; and (2) document the extent to which program models are effective 		in decreasing the use of alcohol and drugs among substance-abusing women and 		enhancing the healthy development of their children. Ten PPWI programs funded 		by CSAP in 1992 were selected to participate in a 4-year cross-site evaluation. 		The wide range of interventions and possible outcomes required that program 		evaluations were augmented by a process evaluation to explain the relationships 		between mediating variables and outcomes. The project found that (1) there were 		significantly lower prevalence rates in the use of alcohol, marijuana, crack, 		and other illicit substances in the treatment group from intake to delivery, 		and in recent (30 day) marijuana and crack use in the treatment group from 		intake to delivery (these differences disappeared by the 6-month postpartum 		followup); (2) the effect of PPWI treatment group membership for lower recent 		crack use appears to be attributable to participation in day treatment, rather 		than case management programs; and (3) in general, treatment and comparison 		group members gave birth to infants with similar birth-related outcome 		characteristics, but when the mother's crack use histories were taken into 		account, treatment babies had significantly higher birthweights than comparison 		group babies.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Final Report: 		Review of the CMHS Mental Health Care Provider Education in HIV/AIDS 		Program</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report presents findings from a review of the Center for Mental Health 		Services' (CMHS) Mental Health Care Provider Education in HIV/AIDS Program, 		from its inception in 1986 through 1994. The program supports the provision of 		state-of-the-art training for (1) traditional mental health care providers 		(psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, and social workers), (2) other 		first-line providers of mental health care services (primary care physicians 		and medical students), and (3) nontraditional providers of such services 		(clergy or alternative health care workers). The program also supports the 		development and dissemination of curricula and teaching materials for providing 		training on the mental health aspects of HIV/AIDS. The goal of the program is 		to improve access to appropriate and adequate mental health services for people 		living with HIV/AIDS and for their families and partners. The review examines 		the activities and outcomes of 27 projects funded by the program. The report 		finds that (1) the program has trained tens of thousands of mental health 		service providers, representing the full spectrum of assistance to persons 		infected with HIV and to their families; (2) training participants are likely 		to have increased their knowledge about the mental health aspects of the 		disease, their willingness to serve HIV-infected individuals, and their 		confidence that they can effectively do so; (3) program funding has served as a 		catalyst for systemic changes within teaching institutions and hospitals for 		the development of alliances with concerned groups; (4) the need for training 		in the mental health aspects of HIV/AIDS is needed throughout the country, 		especially as affected areas and populations change over time; (5) at the 		program level, there is a pressing need to obtain systemic knowledge about the 		efficacy of various approaches to training mental health providers; and (6) the 		program must identify its priorities and how different projects can meet 		them. </p>
