    <p><b>MISSION: To promote the 		timely delivery of appropriate, quality health care to the Nation's aged, 		disabled, and poor through administration of the Medicare and Medicaid 		programs.</b> </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation 		Program</i></b> </p>
<p>The research arm of the 		Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)--the Office of Strategic Planning 		(OSP)--performs, coordinates, and supports research and demonstration projects 		(through intramural studies, contracts, grants, and waivers) to develop and 		implement new health care financing policies and to provide information on the 		impact of HCFA's programs. The scope of HCFA's research and demonstration 		activities embraces all areas of health care: cost, access, quality, service 		delivery models, and financing approaches. OSP's research responsibilities 		include evaluations both of the ongoing Medicare and Medicaid programs and of 		demonstration projects testing new health care financing and delivery 		approaches. These projects address four major themes. </p>
<ul><li> <b><i>Monitoring and 		  Evaluating Health System Performance: Access, Quality, Program Efficiency and 		  Costs</i></b>--HCFA's research program produces information and descriptive 		  statistics on the infrastructure of the health system, on populations of health 		  care users, and on service and expenditure patterns; examines differences in 		  costs, quality, and access to care; and assesses the effects of HCFA programs 		  on beneficiary health status.</li>
<li> <i><b>Improving Health 		  Care Financing and Delivery Mechanisms: Current Programs and New 		  Models</b>--</i>HCFA 		  performs research and demonstrations to develop and test new payment and 		  delivery models intended to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of 		  Medicare. OSP's evaluations of these demonstration projects provide 		  policymakers with information about their impact.</li>
<li> <b><i>Meeting the Needs 		  of Vulnerable Populations</i></b>--HCFA's research and evaluation program 		  includes projects that develop new approaches to improve access to 		  cost-efficient and appropriate health services for vulnerable 		  populations.</li>
<li> <b><i>Information to 		  Improve Consumer Choice and Health Status</i></b>--Improving beneficiaries' 		  knowledge and ability to make informed health care choices, both in the health 		  plans they select and in the services they use, is part of HCFA's commitment to 		  improving communication of information to beneficiaries. OSP examines 		  variations in the use of services and treatments and the impact of new 		  information tools and technologies in making health care decisions and 		  improving beneficiaries' health status.</li>
</ul><p><b><i>Summary of Fiscal 		Year 1997 Evaluations</i></b> </p>
<p>During FY 1997, HCFA 		completed 21 evaluations, which are briefly described below. </p>
<p>In, <b><i>Access to 		Physicians' Services for Vulnerable Beneficiaries: Impact of the Medicare Fee 		Schedule</i></b> (6301), HCFA evaluated the effect of the physician fee 		schedule on a beneficiary's access to care. Six different strata of 		beneficiaries were selected based on the relative size of the payment change 		under the fee schedule compared to the earlier payment scheme. The project 		examined the use of services, outcomes of services, and the change in the 		beneficiary's financial liability. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Impact of the 		Medicare Fee Schedule on Teaching Physicians</i></b> (6666) was started because 		of four concerns: (1) teaching physicians perform more high-technology 		procedures and less primary care, which could result in disproportionate net 		loss for these practices; (2) teaching hospitals and medical schools tend to be 		located in large urban areas, where the Geographic Practice Cost Index portion 		of the payment is lower; (3) customary charges for teaching physicians may be 		higher than the areawide historical payments calculated for fee schedule 		transition; and (4) a number of academic medical practices had not signed 		Medicare participation agreements. For this study, 720 hospitals were selected, 		including all U.S. academic medical centers. The results indicated that there 		is no evidence that teaching physicians have been adversely affected by the 		Medicare Fee Schedule. </p>
<p><b><i>1995 Influenza 		Immunizations Paid for by Medicare: State and County Rates</i></b> (6615) is a 		data book tied to the program begun in 1993 to stimulate the provision of flu 		vaccine to Medicare beneficiaries. It provides information about National, 		State, and county rates of vaccination in fee-for-service settings (managed 		care beneficiaries could not be counted because their encounter data are not 		reported). </p>
<p>The Department was 		legislatively required to report to the Congress on the relative quality of the 		care in the Medicaid program. HCFA's <b><i>A Study of the Appropriateness, 		Process of Care, and Outcomes of Medical Care for Medicaid Patients</i></b> 		(6302) examined the necessity, appropriateness, and effectiveness of selected 		medical treatments and surgical procedures for Medicaid patients. It assessed 		the variation that exists in the rate of performance of selected treatments and 		procedures on Medicaid beneficiaries for small areas within and among States. 		It determined that there are underutilized, medically necessary treatments and 		procedures for which failure to furnish could have an adverse effect on health 		status. The study had two phases. The first used extant data in HCFA to examine 		patterns of utilization for over 160 different conditions and procedures. It 		found that, for all conditions combined, utilization was higher in the Medicaid 		population and that the differences were higher for medical than for surgical 		conditions. Within Medicaid, medical conditions showed somewhat more small-area 		geographic variation than did surgical conditions. For all conditions combined, 		the Medicaid population tended to exhibit more small-area geographic variation 		than did the non-Medicaid population, but the pattern was not consistent across 		States. In the second phase, data were abstracted from medical records at 118 		hospitals in California, Georgia, and Michigan for a selected series of index 		diagnoses: pediatric asthma, hysterectomy, and complicated labor and delivery. 		Five indicators were developed to assess the level of quality. In general, 		Medicaid women and children were treated in public hospitals, teaching 		hospitals, and hospitals with large bed capacities. The appropriateness of the 		decision to hospitalize was comparable between Medicaid and the 		privately-insured. And, once hospitalized, they received a similar level of 		care. Most importantly, the outcomes of care were essentially similar between 		the two payer groups, although the Medicaid patients were more severely ill. As 		a result, there were differences in outcomes that were not related to the 		inpatient quality of care provided. The inpatient care for the Medicaid 		patients was considered adequate and comparable with care received by 		privately-insured patients. </p>
<p><i><b>Evaluation of the 		Medicaid Uninsured Demonstrations</b> </i> 		(6298) assesses three demonstrations 		conducted in the States of Maine, South Carolina, and Washington. These 		demonstrations, implemented in response to a Congressional mandate under 		section 4745 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, tested the 		effect of allowing States to extend Medicaid coverage to low-income families. 		The project examined the ability of the Medicaid programs to enroll significant 		numbers of eligible persons, looking particularly at the conditions under which 		eligible persons and their families are willing to participate in such 		programs, given their scarce financial resources. The evaluation also looked at 		the ability of the programs to induce adequate levels and the willingness of 		employers to participate in the programs. </p>
<p>The Inspector General of 		the Department conducted a demonstration of improved methods for the 		investigation and prosecution of fraud and abuse. The <b><i>Evaluation of the 		Effectiveness of the Operation Restore Trust Demonstrations</i></b> (6311) 		examined whether this more concentrated effort, rendered through the 		demonstration's partnership model, had a relatively greater impact on health 		industry fraudulent behavior than the same efforts conducted separately. 		Operation Restore Trust (ORT) involved a targeted set of initiatives that 		focused on a few States, a few areas of the Medicare benefit, and a few 		standard operating procedures (especially, failures to coordinate among the 		most central agencies and to exploit available data resources). The evaluation 		concluded that ORT turned around certain troubling trends of the early 1990's 		and has brought new vigor to government efforts to combat health care fraud and 		abuse. ORT had important effects across the full spectrum of organizations it 		sought to affect, and even had some important effects on organizations over the 		boundaries of the demonstration (e.g., Medicare contractors) that were not so 		directly orchestrated by the ORT initiative. </p>
<p><b><i>Assessing the 		Viability of All-Payer Systems for Inpatient Hospital Services</i></b> (6594) 		explored the feasibility and possible structure of alternative approaches to 		developing such a system. It looked at the practicality of adapting or 		extending Medicare's Prospective Payment System to other payers. Two analyses 		were conducted to determine (1) whether diagnosis-related group-based payment 		rates for Medicare and non-Medicare patients should be adjusted based on 		hospital characteristics, and (2) alternative approaches in defining the 		Medicare standardized prospective payment rate. Current Medicare standardized 		prospective payment rates are based on the mean adjusted cost for a given 		category of hospital; high-cost hospitals are penalized under the assumption 		that their costs reflect presumed inefficiency. It developed hospital-specific 		measures of inefficiency and then excluded the costs of inefficient hospitals 		from the calculation of standardized payment rates. The conclusion was that a 		frontier cost function model approach is superior to the current system and can 		result in substantial program savings. </p>
<p><b><i>Monitoring and 		Evaluation of the Medicare Cataract Surgery Alternate Payment 		Demonstration</i>: <i>Final Evaluation Report</i></b> 		 (6295) assisted HCFA in tracking the 		3-year demonstration that tested the concept of a single global Medicare 		payment for outpatient cataract procedures. The payment amount represented the 		cost for physician, facility, and intraocular lenses. The evaluation found that 		the project was reasonably successful in encouraging provider flexibility and 		in managing the bundle of services. There was ample anecdotal evidence that the 		cost-effectiveness incentives were working; e.g., cost reduction efforts by 		surgeons in the techniques and time required to perform the surgery and actions 		to standardize the intraocular lenses and other supplies and materials. Once 		operations began, government activities related to pricing were greatly reduced 		and limited to simple verification and payment of the global fee. The evaluator 		was not able to measure appropriateness, but in terms of quality control and 		utilization review, the demonstration was successful in that the outcomes were 		unchanged. The project offered some insights into the strengths and weaknesses 		of particular incentives in encouraging providers to participate. However, it 		provided only limited new information on the factors that influenced 		beneficiaries to participate. </p>
<p>HCFA completed an 		evaluation on the implementation of ambulatory patient groups (APGs) under the 		title, <b><i>Toward a Prospective Payment System for Outpatient Services: 		Implementation for Outpatient Services-- Implementation of APGs by State 		Medicaid Agencies and Private Payers.</i></b> (6320) The focus of this study 		was the Medicaid outpatient prospective payment system that groups patients for 		payment purposes rather than paying on a cost basis. These groups are similar 		in concept to diagnosis-related groups, which form the heart of Medicare's 		prospective payment system for inpatient care. It involved a case study of 		Iowa's implementation of the APG system and an analysis of the reimbursement 		methodology. All six payers that had operational experience tailored their APG 		systems to their own priorities and markets. They all implemented the system 		without major incident. The payers reported success in reducing outpatient 		costs where that was the immediate goal, and they believe the system encourages 		higher-cost facilities to reduce costs and rewards lower-cost facilities. The 		views of providers were more mixed. Though they reported generally adequate 		overall payment, they also viewed the system as complex, could not calculate 		expected payment, and often let their computer systems group related claims 		rather than consolidating them prior to submission, as was the intent of the 		system. No evidence was found of much behavioral response by providers, but 		that could change if the system is implemented by a large payer such as 		HCFA. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Second Update of 		the Geographic Practice Cost Index: Final Report</i></b> (6611) was produced 		and is scheduled to be fully phased in by January 1, 1999. One-half of the 		total change will be implemented in 1998. A comparison between the 1997 and 		1999 Geographic Practice Cost Indexes (GPCIs) shows that (1) there is no change 		between the physician work GPCI or the non-physician employee wage index of the 		practice expense GPCI, except that they are reweighted with 1994 county 		relative value units; (2) the office rental index of the practice expense GPCI 		is updated with FY 1996 Fair Market Rents (from the Department of Housing and 		Urban Development); (3) county rental adjustment factors are eliminated for all 		metropolitan areas (except for the New York City Primary Metropolitan 		Statistical Area); (4) the malpractice GPCI is updated with 1992, 1993, and 		1994 premium data, and specialty premiums are weighted by national relative 		value unit proportions rather than allowed charges; (5) there is no change in 		the GPCI cost shares, which measure the share of the various inputs in total 		practice revenues; and (6) the county relative value units used to weight 		averages to county input prices for each Fee Schedule Area are updated from 		1992 to 1994. The project determined that the changes in the Medicare Fee 		Schedule resulting from implementation of this GPCI update will be less than 		2.5 percent for each Fee Schedule Area. </p>
<p>The <i><b>Payment of 		Pharmacists for Cognitive Services: Results of the Washington State C.A.R.E. 		Demonstration Project</b> </i>(6528) is a report on a demonstration project 		called Cognitive Activities and Reimbursement Effectiveness (C.A.R.E.). It is 		operated under the premise that (1) direct reimbursement for cognitive services 		would remove financial barriers associated with the pharmacists' provision of 		these services; and (2) that this change would result in more consultations, 		with a subsequent impact on costs and outcomes from drug therapy. Data were 		drawn from three groups of approximately 100 pharmacies in the State of 		Washington. The project found that (1) pharmacists who received a financial 		incentive consistently reported higher cognitive service intervention rates 		than did those who did not receive financial incentives; (2) about half of all 		documented service problems were for patient-related matters (about one-third 		were for drug-related problems, about 17 percent were for prescription-related 		problems, and the residual 1.4 percent were for non-drug problems); (3) a drug 		therapy change occurred as a result of 28 percent of all pharmacist cognitive 		services; (4) for each cognitive service that was associated with any type of 		drug therapy change, the average downstream drug cost savings was about $13.05 		(but these savings varied by type of drug therapy); and (5) the demonstration 		generated savings of about $78,000 in Medicaid prescription drug expenditure 		over the 18-month period. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Consequences of 		Paying Medicare HMOs and</i> <i>Health Care Prepayment Plans (HCPPs)</i></b> 		(6314) compared the cost effectiveness of such plans to fee-for-service (FFS) 		and health maintenance organizations (HMOs), which operate on a risk basis. The 		main question examined in this study was whether HCFA payments would have 		increased or decreased had these organizations remained risk contractors. The 		evaluator found that costs to HCFA increased substantially under the cost 		programs, HMO, and Health Care Prepayment Plan (HCPP). Furthermore, most of the 		cost-based plans were found to have favorable selection. Total dollar losses to 		HCFA for 1993 due to the cost, HMO, and HCPP programs were estimated to be $185 		million relative to fee-for-service, and $4 million relative to risk-based 		payments. Dropping the seven plans that converted to risk or dropped out of 		Medicare since 1993 would have resulted in estimated losses of $210 million 		compared to FFS, and $90 million compared to risk contracting. 		</p>
<p>The <b><i>Costs and 		Consequences of Case Management for Medicare Beneficiaries: Final 		Report</i></b> (6291) studied the appropriateness of providing case management 		services to beneficiaries with catastrophic illnesses and high medical costs. 		It tested case management as a way of controlling costs in the fee-for-service 		sector. The target conditions and case management protocols differed in each 		site, though all three generally focused on increased education regarding 		proper patient monitoring and management of the target chronic condition. All 		three sites anticipated reduced hospitalizations and medical costs compared to 		the beneficiary control groups. The evaluation found that (1) the projects 		successfully identified and enrolled populations of Medicare beneficiaries 		likely to have much higher than average Medicare reimbursements during the 		demonstration period; (2) each project met with unexpectedly low levels of 		enthusiasm for the demonstration from beneficiaries and their physicians; and 		(3) despite high levels of satisfaction among the high-cost, chronically ill 		beneficiaries who eventually participated, the projects failed to improve 		client self-care or health, or reduce Medicare spending. Comparisons of health 		status, functional status, and expenditures between the control and 		intervention groups showed no improvements resulting from the case management 		intervention. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Validation of 		Nursing Home Quality Indicators Study</i></b> (6612) developed a system by 		which a series of indicators could be used, in conjunction with claims data, to 		monitor quality of care in nursing facilities. Fifty such indicators were 		developed and validated. The indicators focused on three broad problem areas: 		adverse outcomes, lack of therapy, and inappropriate pharmaceutical treatments. 		The indicators were designed to be used in an automated system to continuously 		monitor the quality of care provided. The study found that (1) it is possible 		to base such indicators on Medicaid and Medicare claims data; (2) as a whole, 		the indicators were better at predicting the absence of a quality issue 		(suggesting that the negative finding represented the lack of a quality concern 		in a specific nursing home); and (3) using covariant diagnoses was useful to 		adjust for the risk of a resident receiving an indicator tag. 		</p>
<p>The<i> <b>Evaluation of the 		Community Nursing Organization Demonstration Interim Evaluation Report</b></i> 		(6306) examined a set of demonstration projects that tested a capitated, 		nurse-managed system of care. It was designed to promote timely and appropriate 		use of community health services and to reduce the use of costly acute care 		services. More than 5,400 beneficiaries were enrolled in the four Community 		Nursing Organization (CNO) demonstration sites. The evaluation report covers 		the first 15 months of operations. The applicants have been healthier and more 		independent, on average, than the general Medicare population in their 		respective market areas. Analyses of measures of death, physical functioning, 		and satisfaction with care detected no statistically significant differences. 		Analysis of a subsample of persons who were impaired in Activities of Daily 		Living indicated that members of the CNO treatment group were more likely to 		improve (or less likely to deteriorate further) than members of the control 		group. An even stronger result, in the same direction, was found for 		individuals who were limited in Instrumental Activities of Daily 		Living. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Evaluation of the 		Utah Prepaid Mental Health Plan</i></b> (6293) focuses on a demonstration 		project in which three mental health centers provided services to all Medicaid 		beneficiaries in their catchment areas (these areas included over 50 percent of 		all Utah Medicaid beneficiaries). It was expected that this program would 		control the cost inflation and improve patient outcomes in mental health 		services. The study examined (1) the organizational and financial 		characteristics and their evolution over time, (2) the impact on the 		organization of service delivery and use of services, and (3) the financial 		impact on providers and the Medicaid program in Utah. The development of the 		demonstration proceeded fairly smoothly, albeit somewhat more slowly than 		planned. Three centers chose to enter the demonstration and eight chose to not 		join. Several changes in the program's environment affected the development 		during the initial 3 years. There were general expansions in children's 		programs, day treatment programs, and case management. The community mental 		health centers began to focus staff attention on ways to increase the 		efficiency with which discharges from the hospital were managed and on the way 		outpatient services were delivered--all while maintaining quality of care. The 		results suggest that the demonstration reduced expenditures on acute inpatient 		care by reducing admissions, without significant effects on outpatient 		expenditures and visits. Financial impact was possible in that the 		demonstration altered the way in which Medicaid funds flowed to the 		participating community mental health centers and it redefined their 		responsibilities with respect to the provision of services. In addition, there 		were relatively few financial differences between contracting and 		non-contracting community mental health centers. Thus, the decision to 		participate appears to have had a null effect on the site's financial 		performance. The payments to the participating sites were less than estimated. 		In the second method of looking at payments to the sites, there were savings on 		inpatient care, which were partially offset by increases in outpatient care for 		a net overall savings. The overall estimates of total program savings showed 		this same pattern of inpatient savings, diminished by outpatient increases. 		However, these estimates are very sensitive to the methods used to project 		trends. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Limited-Service 		Hospital Pioneers: Challenges and Successes of the Essential Access Community 		Hospital/Rural Primary Care Hospital (EACH-RPCH) Program and Medical Assistance 		Facility (MAF) Demonstration</i></b> (5200.1) concerned a legislatively 		mandated attempt to assist States in maintaining access to health care services 		in rural areas. The program awarded grants to several States to develop rural 		health plans, establish rural health networks, and create a limited service 		alternative for communities that could no longer support a full-service 		hospital. These limited service providers and other health care providers were 		organized into rural health networks. This evaluation examined the development, 		implementation, and early operating experience of the program. In addition, it 		looked at a forerunner program, the Montana Medical Assistance Facility 		Demonstration. It found that these limited service hospital models occupy a 		niche in rural health care system by permitting an alternative for outright 		closure. However, there were considerable limitations to participation. The 		financial benefits varied by facility, depending on such things as cost 		structure, provider supply, and patterns of use in the specific community. It 		found that program flexibility and the linkage of primary care services to 		developing networks was essential. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Comparative Study 		of the Use of EPSDT and Other Preventive and Curative Health Care Services by 		Children Enrolled in Medicaid: Final Project Synthesis Report</i></b> (6236.7) 		included (1) a description of the Medicaid program in the four study States 		(Michigan, Georgia, Tennessee, and California) and these States' responses to 		the 1989 legislative changes relating to children's and Medicaid coverage and 		also to the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program; 		(2) an analysis of the impacts of the State's responses on participating 		providers and enrolled children; and (3) an assessment of the national context. 		The States' efforts to increase provider participation in Medicaid and EPSDT 		were successful in increasing provider participation and average caseloads 		among all types of providers (except for dentists in Michigan). However, the 		increased supply may not have been adequate to meet the increased demand 		because the ratios of Medicaid children to participating providers and 		percentages of counties with provider shortages rose from 1989 to 1992 in all 		four States. Only 42 to 54 percent of Medicaid children were recommended to 		have preventive care visits and, of these, only 36 to 59 percent made such 		visits. Compared with other low-income children, Medicaid coverage did increase 		service use and improved access to illness-related care. However, Medicaid 		children had very low completion rates for age-appropriate 		immunizations. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Evaluation of the 		Demonstration to Improve Access to Care for Pregnant Substance Abusers</i></b> 		(6297) sought to evaluate project effectiveness in (1) outreach and assessment; 		(2) expansion, integration, and coordination of program services; and (3) 		improvement of client case management. The evaluator examined the effects of 		access to prenatal care and substance abuse treatment services on the health of 		drug-addicted pregnant women and birth outcomes of their infants. The 		evaluation showed that the number of abusers enrolled in the demonstrations was 		low relative to all pregnant substance abusers in the area, since women were 		reluctant to be identified. The project found higher enrollment rates in States 		that implemented broad-based outreach efforts, and that higher levels of 		participation and greater retention in substance abuse treatment resulted in 		higher-birthweight infants. </p>
<p><b><i>An Evaluation of 		Implementation of the Medicaid Community Supported Living Arrangements (CLSA) 		Program in Eight States</i></b> (6304) was designed to test the effectiveness 		of developing a continuum of care concept as an alternative to the 		Medicaid-funded residential services provided to individuals with mental 		retardation and related conditions. The program served individuals who are 		either living in the community independently, with their families, on in homes 		with three or fewer other individuals receiving the same services. These 		services were provided in eight States between fiscal years 1991 and 1995. By 		the end of the program, only 73 percent of the expected number of individuals 		were receiving services in the Community Supported Living Arrangement (CSLA), 		and the expenditures were only 58 percent ($38.4 million) of the amount 		authorized. </p>
<p>The<i> <b>Impact of Report 		Cards on Employees: A Natural Experiment</b></i> (6312) sought to determine 		whether the dissemination of information about health plans to consumers (who 		choose health plans within a managed care competition framework) would 		influence their knowledge of plan characteristics, attitudes toward the plans, 		or choice of plan. Investigators found that report cards had no effect on 		employees' knowledge of health plans, their attitude about quality of health 		plans, or their choices in selecting a managed care health plan. The study did 		find that health plan characteristics (such as price) were strongly related to 		health plan choice. The investigators suggest that consumers do not seem to be 		influenced by the information in any of the ways measured in this 		study. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluations in 		Progress</i></b> </p>
<p>HCFA currently supports 19 		evaluation projects in progress, 13 of which are scheduled to be completed in 		FY 1998. These projects provide information for continued monitoring of the 		Medicare and Medicaid programs and assess the impacts of HCFA's Medicare and 		Medicaid demonstration projects. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Evaluation of 		Medicare SELECT</i></b> (5966.3) examines a pilot Medicare supplemental 		insurance product under which full Medigap benefits are paid only when services 		are provided by the plan's provider network. Case studies, primary surveys, and 		administrative data (claims) analyses are conducted. The analytical portion of 		the project compares cost and use of Medicare and supplemental services, 		selection effects, beneficiary satisfaction, and physician practice patterns to 		other Medigap options. To date, the evaluation has found no health status 		differences or quality of care received by SELECT and non-SELECT beneficiaries. 		In addition, there were no differences in overall satisfaction levels between 		these populations. Premiums for SELECT policies were almost always cheaper than 		the same company's own standard Medigap policy for any age group. In two out of 		three years examined, SELECT policies were generally more expensive for older 		beneficiaries when compared to community rated policies. Medicare costs 		generally increased as a result of Medicare SELECT. The costs increased in five 		States, decreased in three States; and were not affected in three other States. 		Since the States studied were not chosen to be representative of the Nation, 		their experience is not necessarily indicative of a national program. 		Consequently, the effect of SELECT on Medicare program expenditures appears to 		be mixed at best. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Medicare 		Participating Heart Bypass Center Demonstration Extended Evaluation</i></b> 		(5985.5) continues to study the feasibility of a negotiated, all-inclusive 		pricing arrangement for coronary artery bypass graft surgery while maintaining 		high-quality care. The project looks for any net cost savings to the Medicare 		program, any volume increases at the demonstration sites, the aspects of the 		demonstration that were attractive to beneficiaries and referring physicians, 		and whether the quality of care at the sites was equivalent to that provided 		prior to the demonstration. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Medicare HMO 		Evaluation</i></b> (6294) updates the findings of an earlier study of Medicare 		risk health maintenance organizations. That study found that Medicare paid 5.7 		percent more for plan enrollees than would have been spent under 		fee-for-service. The current study looks at disenrollment, beneficiary 		satisfaction, quality of care, and selection and savings. </p>
<p>The <i><b>Evaluation of 		Medicaid-Managed Care Programs with 1915(b) Waivers</b> </i>(6290)<i> </i>will 		provide information on the extent to which various features of the managed care 		waiver projects contribute to the ability of the Medicaid program to deliver 		cost-effective care to eligible populations. </p>
<p><b><i>Maximizing the 		Effective Use of Telemedicine: A Study of the Effects, Cost Effectiveness, and 		Utilization Patterns of Consultation via Telemedicine</i></b> (6303) is a 		comprehensive evaluation of HCFA's telemedicine demonstration projects. The 		project assesses alternative payment options for the providers of telemedicine 		services, such as fee-for-service, facility payments, or capitation. Objective 		measures of the cost of telemedicine services in different clinical settings 		are used, both from the payer's and the physician's perspective. Provider and 		patient satisfaction, utilization measures (e.g., physician visits, 		hospitalizations or rehospitilizations, and frequencies of complications or 		comorbidities), and the effect of telemedicine on practice patterns are 		included. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Drug Utilization 		Review Evaluation Contract</i></b> (6296) is examining the impacts of 		retrospective and prospective review, which included the payment of pharmacists 		for cognitive services. Demonstrations of on-line prospective drug utilization 		review (DUR) in Iowa and of cognitive service by Washington State pharmacists 		provided the primary data for evaluation. This evaluation looks at the two 		types of DUR program effects in preventing adverse drug-related events by 		incorporating and analyzing the program participants' pharmaceutical and 		medical information. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Evaluation and 		Technical Assistance of the Medicare Alzheimer's Disease Demonstration</i></b> 		(6305) is being conducted to determine the effectiveness, cost, and impact on 		health status and functioning of providing comprehensive in-home and 		community-based services to beneficiaries with dementia. Two models of care 		will be studied. Both include case management and an extensive package of 		services not presently covered under Medicare, such as adult day care, 		homemaker/personal care services, companion services, and caregiver education 		and training. The models are differentiated by the intensity of the case 		management provided to beneficiaries and their families and by the monthly 		amount of Medicare payments for project services. The purpose of the evaluation 		is to measure the cost and effect on the beneficiaries' functional level and 		institutionalization rate, as well as its impact on caregiver burden and 		stress. </p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation of Phase 		Two of the Home Health Agency Prospective Payment Demonstration</i></b> (6308) 		examines the second phase of a program designed to test the effectiveness of 		using prospective payment methods to reimburse Medicare-certified home health 		agencies (HHAs). In this demonstration a per-encounter payment method is being 		tested. The study looks at the effects of this payment method on HHAs 		operations, service quality, and expenditures. It also analyzes the 		relationship between patient characteristics and the cost and utilization of 		home health services. </p>
<p>The<i> <b>Examination of 		the Medicaid Expansions for Children</b></i> (6300) uses enrollment and 		expenditure trends to ascertain the impact of the 1989 program changes. It will 		look at target population penetration, and the impact of State policies (and 		the eligibility group) on enrollment, expenditures, and utilization of 		services. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Project 		Demonstrating and Evaluating Alternative Methods to Assure and Enhance the 		Quality of Long-Term Care Services for Persons with Developmental Disabilities 		through Performance-Based Contracts with Service Providers</i></b> (6310) tries 		to determine whether and how well the implementation of new approaches to 		quality assurance--with outcome-based definitions and measures of quality--will 		replace input and process measures of quality in this population 		group. </p>
<p>In future years, several 		other evaluations are expected to be completed. </p>
<p>The <b><i>Evaluation of the 		Medicare Choice Demonstration</i></b> (6292) assesses the feasibility and 		desirability of new types of managed care plans for Medicare. These plans can 		be integrated delivery systems and preferred provider 		organizations. </p>
<p>HCFA is conducting 		demonstrations testing the payment of skilled nursing facilities on a 		prospective basis for Medicare and Medicaid services. Medicare currently 		reimburses such facilities on a retrospective cost basis. This demonstration 		uses a case-mix classification system (called Resource Utilization Groups) to 		classify patients and establish payment rates. The <b><i>Evaluation of the 		Nursing Home Case-Mix and Quality Demonstration</i></b> (6307) seeks to 		estimate specific behavioral responses to the prospective payment and to test 		hypotheses about aspects of such responses. The main goal of the project is to 		estimate the effects on the health and functioning of the nursing home 		residents, their length of stay, and use of health care services; on the 		behavior of the facilities; and on the level and composition of Medicare 		expenditures. </p>
<p>The State of Delaware is 		experimenting with its Medicaid program. The State believes that by enrolling 		Medicaid children in a managed care system, it will benefit from a higher level 		of coordinated care and reduced costs. The <b><i>Evaluation of the 		Demonstration Entitled Delaware Health Care Partnership for Children</i></b> 		(6288) is examining this project. </p>
<p>HCFA is sponsoring a wide 		variety of waiver-based demonstrations that give States the opportunity to 		experiment with their Medicaid programs. As these demonstrations begin, HCFA 		will undertake examinations of their impact. The<i> <b>Evaluation of the Oregon 		Medicaid Reform Demonstration</b></i><b> (6166), the<i> Evaluation of the State 		Medicaid Reform Demonstrations</i></b> (in Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Tennessee) 		(6289), and the <b><i>Evaluation of the State Medicaid Reform 		Demonstrations</i> </b>(in Kentucky; Los Angeles County, California; Minnesota; 		New York; and Vermont) (6289.1) are three such projects. More evaluations will 		be initiated as more State demonstrations are begun. </p>
<p>In 1977, the Congress 		authorized a new type of provider, the Rural Health Clinic, which must be 		located in a rural health professional shortage area, medically underserved 		area, or Governor-designated shortage area and must make use of mid-level 		practitioners. Rural Health Clinics are reimbursed on a cost basis by the 		Medicare and Medicaid programs. Their numbers have been growing at a relatively 		rapid rate. The<i> <b>Evaluation of Rural Health Clinics</b></i> (6299) 		examines the reasons for this growth, the impact on access to care for these 		rural populations, and the costs to the Federal government and 		States. </p>
<p>The<i> <b>Evaluation of the 		Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly Demonstration</b></i> (6309), 		known as PACE, examines replications of a unique model of managed care service 		delivery for very frail community-dwelling elderly, most of whom are dually 		eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and all of whom are assessed as being 		eligible for nursing home placement. The core services include adult day health 		care and multidisciplinary team care management through which all health and 		long-term care services are arranged. The evaluator is looking at the 		demonstration sites before and after assumption of financial risk to see if the 		replicates are cost effective relative the current Medicare and Medicaid 		services. They are also looking at the decision to enroll in order to 		understand how PACE enrollees differ from the eligible beneficiaries who choose 		not to enroll. </p>
