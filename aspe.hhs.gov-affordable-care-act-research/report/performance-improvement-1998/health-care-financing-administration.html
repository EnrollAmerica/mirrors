<p><b>TITLE: 		<i>Limited-Service Hospital Pioneers: Challenges and Successes of the Essential 		Access Community Hospital/Rural Primary Care Hospital (EACH-RPCH) Program and 		Medical Assistance Facility (MAF) Demonstration</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Small 		communities in rural America are struggling to maintain health care resources 		in the face of increasing competition and a dwindling population and economic 		base. In response to the threatened survival of small rural hospitals, the 		Health Care Financing Administration has supported two initiatives to introduce 		innovative limited-service hospitals: the Essential Access Community 		Hospital/Rural Primary Care Hospital (EACH-RPCH) program, implemented in seven 		States; and the Medical Assistance Facility (MAF) demonstration in Montana. 		Both establish a new Medicare provider that is exempt from specific key 		requirements of participation, and both offer enhanced reimbursement. Other 		States have looked to these two programs as possible models for their rural 		communities. This report documents the evaluation of the EACH-RPCH program from 		its start in October 1991 through September 1994. The report assesses the 		implementation process, initial operating experience, and potential impact of 		the programs on access and cost as related to limited hospital service. The 		introductory chapter reviews the background of the EACH-RPCH and MAF programs, 		discusses the evaluation issues to be examined, and summarizes the evaluation 		methodology and data sources. Chapters II and III examine the development of 		networks and the shift to limited service licensure under the EACH-RPCH 		program. Chapter IV reviews the implementation and operation of the MAF 		demonstration. Chapters V and VI focus on the two programs' impact on access to 		care and mechanisms for quality assurance, respectively. The report concludes 		with Chapter VII, which assesses the impact of both programs on facility 		finances and the Medicare program. (Final report: 260 pages, plus 		appendices.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Comparative 		Study of the Use of EPSDT and Other Preventive and Curative Health Care 		Services by Children Enrolled in Medicaid: Final Project Synthesis 		Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report includes (1) a description of the Medicaid program in Michigan, Georgia, 		Tennessee, and California and these States' responses to the Omnibus Budget 		Reconciliation Act of 1989 provisions relating to children's and Medicaid 		coverage and on the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) 		program; (2) results of analyses of the impact of these responses on 		participating providers and enrolled children; and (3) an assessment of the 		national context through a review of the national survey data analyses. It 		finds that (1) State efforts to increase provider participation in Medicaid and 		EPSDT included recruitment activities, training in billing, and increased fees; 		(2) the States' efforts were successful in increasing provider participation 		and average caseloads among all types of providers, except for dentists in 		Michigan, which declined 10 percent from 1989 to 1992; (3) these increases may 		not have been adequate to meet the increased demand from a growing caseload; 		(4) the ratios of Medicaid children to participating providers and the 		percentages of counties with provider shortages rose from 1989 to 1992 in all 		four study States; (5) counting all EPSDT and all other well-child visits paid 		for by Medicaid, only 42 to 54 percent of Medicaid children were recommended to 		have preventive care visits, and of these, only 36 to 59 percent made the 		recommended visits; (6) compared with other low-income children, Medicaid 		coverage increased service use and improved access to illness-related care; and 		(7) Medicaid children had very low completion rates for age-appropriate 		immunizations, from 48 percent in Michigan to 61 percent in Georgia in 1992. 		The report concludes that State efforts to expand the EPSDT provider base and 		to enhance outreach had significant impacts on the use of preventive, 		diagnostic, and treatment services.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Costs and 		Consequences of Case Management for Medicare Beneficiaries: Final 		Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report studies the appropriateness of providing case management services to 		beneficiaries with catastrophic illnesses and high medical costs. The study 		tests case management as a way of controlling costs in the fee-for-service 		sector. These demonstrations, mandated by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 		1990, and are aimed at a number of chronic illnesses, including congestive 		heart failure. The resulting demonstrations were implemented in three sites, 		began operations in October 1993, and continued through November 1995. The 		target conditions and case management protocols differed in each site, though 		all three generally focused on increased education regarding proper patient 		monitoring and management of the target chronic condition. All three sites 		anticipated reduced hospitalizations and medical costs compared to the 		beneficiary control groups. (Final report: 216 pages, plus 		appendices.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluation of 		the Utah Prepaid Mental Health Plan</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report is an evaluation of a demonstration project conducted in Utah, in which 		three mental health centers provided mental health services to all Medicaid 		beneficiaries in their catchment areas (these areas include over 50 percent of 		all Utah Medicaid beneficiaries). The hope was that this program would control 		the cost inflation and improve patient outcomes in mental health services. The 		evaluator examines three areas: (1) organizational and financial 		characteristics and evolution over time, (2) impact on the organization of 		service delivery and use of services, and (3) financial impact on providers and 		the Medicaid program in Utah. The development of the demonstration proceeded 		fairly smoothly, albeit somewhat more slowly than planned. Three centers chose 		to enter the demonstration and eight chose to not join. Several changes in the 		program's environment affected the development during the initial 3 years. 		(Final report: 68 pages.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Monitoring and 		Evaluation of the Medicare Cataract Surgery Alternate Payment Demonstration: 		Final Evaluation Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report assisted the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in tracking the 		3-year demonstration that tested the concept of a single global Medicare 		payment for outpatient cataract procedures. The payment amount represented 		payment for the physician, facility, and intraocular lens costs. The analysis 		portion of the project tested whether there were any net savings to the 		Medicare program, changes in the use of services included and excluded from the 		bundle, beneficiary satisfaction, and quality of care. The evaluation found 		that the project was reasonably successful in encouraging provider flexibility 		and in managing the bundle of services. There was ample anecdotal evidence that 		the cost effectiveness incentives were working; e.g., cost reduction efforts by 		surgeons in the techniques and time required to perform the surgery and actions 		to standardize the interocular lenses and other supplies and materials. While 		the effort to become a part of the demonstration was substantial, once 		operations began, government activities related to pricing were greatly reduced 		and limited to simple verification and payment of the global fee. The evaluator 		was not able to measure appropriateness, but in terms of quality control and 		utilization review the demonstration was successful in that the outcomes were 		unchanged. The project did produce some insights into the strengths and 		weaknesses of particular incentives in encouraging providers to participate. 		However, it provided limited new information on what factors influenced 		beneficiaries to participate. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluation of 		the Demonstration to Improve Access to Care for Pregnant Substance 		Abusers</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report evaluates demonstration project effectiveness in (1) outreach and 		assessment; (2) expansion, integration, and coordination of program services; 		and (3) improvement of client case management. The evaluator examined access to 		prenatal care and substance abuse treatment services and assessed the effects 		of these services on the health of drug-addicted pregnant women and birth 		outcomes of their infants. The evaluation showed that the number of abusers 		enrolled in the demonstrations was low relative to all pregnant substance 		abusers in the area, since women were reluctant to be identified. The project 		found higher enrollment rates in States that implemented broad-based outreach 		efforts; higher levels of and greater retention in substance abuse treatment 		resulted in higher birth weight infants.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluation of 		the Medicaid Uninsured Demonstrations</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		project evaluated three demonstration project conducted in Maine, South 		Carolina, and Washington State. These demonstrations, implemented in response 		to a Congressional mandate under section 4745 of the Omnibus Budget 		Reconciliation Act of 1990, tested the effect of allowing States to extend 		Medicaid coverage to low-income families. The evaluation resulted in a series 		of annual reports, an interim and a final report to Congress, and a final 		evaluation report. The project examined intra- and inter-site processes and 		outcomes, including (1) the ability of the programs to enroll significant 		numbers of eligible persons; (2) conditions under which eligible persons and 		their families are willing to participate in such programs, given their scarce 		financial resources; (3) ability of the programs to induce adequate numbers of 		providers to ensure the availability of necessary services at appropriate 		utilization levels; (4) willingness of employers to participate in the programs 		and the conditions under which they participate or choose not to participate; 		(5) the program's effect on service utilization and health outcomes of 		participants; (6) the cost-effectiveness of such programs for the various 		public and private interests; and (7) the extent to which the demonstration's 		interventions could be applied nationally to assist in achieving program goals. 		An initial series of site visits was conducted during 1993. The first annual 		report in the series used data collected during these site visits and data from 		State-administered baseline surveys to describe the implementation phase and 		early operational phase of the demonstrations. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Access to 		Physicians' Services for Vulnerable Beneficiaries: Impact of the Medicare Fee 		Schedule</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In 1992, 		Medicare introduced the Medicare Fee Schedule (MFS), which alters the relative 		prices paid to physicians for services and arguably the incentives to provide 		one service over another. This project evaluates the impact of the MFS on 		individual access to health care. Since the introduction of the MFS, the Health 		Care Financing Administration and the Physician Payment Review Commission have 		monitored access to physicians' services and have failed to document any 		barriers to health care access resulting from the MFS. This study builds on 		this work by (1) oversampling groups of beneficiaries thought to be 		particularly vulnerable to payment changes, (2) evaluating changes in treatment 		patterns for specific episodes of care, and (3) conducting multivariate 		analyses that measure actual payment changes over time rather than expected 		changes due to MFS. A stratified random sampling design took advantage of the 		differential impacts of the MFS across geographic areas and ensured adequate 		numbers of vulnerable beneficiaries. The study divided all geographic areas 		into six groups based on their expected 1992 payment changes under MFS, 		compared with the earlier payment scheme. The report finds that (1) there is 		little evidence that the MFS either improved or worsened health care access for 		Medicare beneficiaries; (2) while some vulnerable groups experienced 		MFS-related changes in access, the actual size of these changes is relatively 		small and is not consistently negative or positive; (3) substantial access gaps 		exist for vulnerable beneficiaries and there is evidence that access to primary 		care may have worsened for dual Medicaid-eligibles; and (4) Medicare 		beneficiaries reduced out-of-pocket payments over the 1991-1993 period, 		including lower copayments and lower extra billing liability.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>A Study of the 		Appropriateness, Process of Care, and Outcomes of Medical Care for Medicaid 		Patients</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Congress requires the Health Care Financing Administration to report on the 		relative quality of care in the Medicaid program. This study assesses the 		variation that exists in the rate of performance of selected treatments and 		procedures provided to Medicaid beneficiaries for small areas within and 		between States. The report's first phase shows that the overall rate of 		inpatient use in the Medicaid population is higher than the rate expected based 		on non-Medicaid utilization patterns. In the report's second phase, data are 		abstracted from medical records at 118 hospitals in California, Georgia, and 		Michigan for a selected series of index diagnoses: pediatric asthma, 		hysterectomy, and complicated labor and delivery. This second phase develops 		five indicators to assess quality: (1) appropriateness to hospitalize or 		perform a procedure, (2) process of care, (3) outcomes of treatments and 		procedures, (4) severity at time of admission, and (5) intensity of care. 		Medicaid-covered children in two States, and women in all three States, are 		younger and represent more minority groups than their privately-insured 		counterparts. The appropriateness of the decision to hospitalize a child with 		asthma, perform a hysterectomy, and do a Cesarean section in the presence of 		labor and delivery complications are comparable between Medicaid and 		privately-insured patients. Most important, the outcomes of care for the two 		groups were essentially similar, for each condition, across the three States. 		Medicaid patients were more seriously ill at admission, which suggests that the 		Medicaid-covered patients may not be practicing the same level of preventative 		care as their privately-insured counterparts. As a result, the differences in 		patient outcomes were not a result of the inpatient quality of care provided. 		The inpatient care for the Medicaid patients was considered adequate and 		comparable with care received by privately-insured patients. (Final report: 46 		pages.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>An Evaluation 		of Implementation of the Medicaid Community Supported Living Arrangements 		(CLSA) Program in Eight States</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report describes the effectiveness of developing a continuum-of-care concept as 		an alternative to the Medicaid-funded residential services provided to 		individuals with mental retardation and related conditions. The program serves 		individuals who are living in the community either independently, with their 		families, or in homes with three or fewer other individuals receiving the same 		services. These services were provided in eight States between fiscal years 		1991 and 1995. By the end of the program only 73 percent of the expected number 		of individuals were receiving services in the Community Supported Living 		Arrangement (CSLA), and the expenditures were only 58 percent ($38.4 million) 		of the amount authorized. A number of factors contributed to this 		smaller-than-expected program: (1) late 1990 authorization of CSLA and 		subsequent delay in regulations, application procedures, and State selection 		put back the first program enrollments by 16-22 months; (2) simultaneously 		expanded Federal latitude allowed rapid growth of Medicaid Home and Community 		Based Services; (3) implementers found that planning and designing services 		"one person at a time" were slower than expected; (4) States experienced delays 		in establishing the new systems of quality assurance required by the CSLA 		program; and (5) recruitment was sometimes delayed by the inclusion of groups 		of persons who were not traditional users of developmental disabilities 		services and who were not already known to the system. The report concludes 		that specific financing problems limit the effectiveness of the program. (Final 		report: 54 pages.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluation of 		the Community Nursing Organization Demonstration Interim Evaluation 		Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report examines a set of demonstration projects mandated in the Omnibus Budget 		Reconciliation of 1987. The legislation directed the establishment of 		demonstration projects to test a capitated, nurse-managed system of care. The 		two fundamental elements of the demonstration are capitation payment and nurse 		case management. It was designed to promote timely and appropriate use of 		community health services and to reduce the use of costly acute care services. 		By October 1995, more than 5,400 beneficiaries were enrolled in the four 		Community Nursing Organizations (CNOs). The evaluation report covers the first 		15 months of operation. The applicants have been healthier and more 		independent, on average, than the general Medicare population in their 		respective market areas. Analyses of measures of death, physical functioning, 		and satisfaction with care detected no statistically significant differences. 		Analysis of a subsample of persons who were impaired in Activities of Daily 		Living indicated that members of the CNO treatment group were more likely to 		improve (or less likely to deteriorate further) than members of the control. An 		even stronger result, in the same direction, was found for individuals who were 		limited in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. (Final report: variously 		paginated.) </p>

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Operation 		Restore Trust (ORT) was jointly developed by the Office of Inspector General 		(OIG), the Administration on Aging (AoA), and the Health Care Financing 		Administration (HCFA) as a model to demonstrate improved methods for 		investigation and prosecution of fraud and abuse in health programs. ORT 		targets a set of initiatives that focus on a few States, a few areas of the 		Medicare benefit, and a few standard operating procedures (especially failures 		to coordinate among the most central agencies and to exploit available data 		resources). The report finds that (1) ORT is associated with a net increase of 		more than 100 percent in ORT-type cases investigated by the OIG; (2) these 		cases should generate substantial incremental receivables, some fraction of 		which will translate into true savings as collections are made; (3) HCFA and 		its contractors had a series of successful projects under ORT, with notably 		large collections or avoidances of payment accompanying many of these efforts, 		although it cannot be said with certainty that these savings would not have 		been realized without ORT; (4) ORT encourages several important policy changes 		made during, or immediately following, the demonstration; (5) ORT may have 		important "sentinel effects" (e.g., ORT may have deterred providers from 		certain kinds of suspect behavior); (6) there are considerable process effects 		of ORT; (7) giving the AoA a fraud and abuse mission led to active training, 		outreach, and education efforts; and (8) the infrastructure of information for 		combating fraud and abuse has significantly improved, although these 		improvements include many efforts outside ORT itself. The evaluation concludes 		that ORT turned around certain troubling trends of the early 1990s and has 		brought new vigor to government efforts to combat health care fraud and 		abuse. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>The Impact of 		Report Cards on Employees: A Natural Experiment</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report seeks to determine whether the dissemination of information about health 		plans to consumers (who choose health plans within a managed care competition 		framework) would influence their knowledge of plan characteristics, attitudes 		toward the plans, or choice of plan. Investigators found no "report card" 		effect on employees' knowledge of health plans, their attitude about quality of 		health plans, or their choices in selecting a managed care health plan. The 		study did find that certain health plan characteristics (such as price) were 		strongly related to health plan choice. The investigators suggest that the 		current versions of health plans are works in progress and that consumers do 		not seem to be influenced by the information in any of the ways measured in 		this study.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Consequences 		of Paying Medicare HMOs and Health Care Prepayment Plans 		(HCPPs)</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This study 		examined the operational aspects of health care prepayment plans (HCPPs) and 		the cost-effectiveness of cost health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and 		HCPPs. The report contains a case study of HCPPs: it looks at plans' 		utilization management and quality assurance programs, marketing practices, and 		contingency plans in case of insolvency. It also examines the 		cost-effectiveness to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) of cost 		HMOs and HCPPs with respect to the fee-for-service and risk contracting program 		during calendar year 1993. The report found that costs to HCFA increased 		substantially under both the cost HMO and HCPP programs. Cost increases 		relative to fee-for-service were larger than those relative to the risk-based 		approach. Only a handful of the 63 plans examined appeared to have generated 		savings for HCFA. The main reason for the cost increase appears to be a lack of 		incentive for plans to drive hard bargains with physicians on prices. 		Furthermore, the report found that most of the cost-based plans experienced 		favorable selection, where the relatively more healthy segments of the 		population are enrolled.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Toward a 		Prospective Payment System for Outpatient Services: Implementation for 		Outpatient Services-Implementation of APGs by State Medicaid Agencies and 		Private Payers</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report studies a Medicaid outpatient prospective payment system, which groups 		patients for payment purposes rather than paying on a cost basis. These groups 		are similar in concept to diagnosis-related groups, which form the heart of 		Medicare's prospective payment system for inpatient care. It involved a case 		study of Iowa's implementation of the ambulatory patient group (APG) system and 		an analysis of the reimbursement methodology. This report has two components: 		an in-depth study of three operational APG systems (based on site visits) and 		telephone interviews with other payers that have implemented or planned to 		implement the system. All six payers with operational experience tailored their 		APG systems to their own priorities and markets. They all implemented the 		system without major incident. The payers reported success in reducing 		outpatient costs, where that was the immediate goal, and they believe the 		system encourages higher-cost facilities to reduce costs and rewards lower-cost 		facilities. Providers' views were more mixed. Though they reported generally 		adequate overall payment, they also viewed the system as complex, had 		difficulty calculating expected payment, and often let payer computer systems 		group related claims rather than consolidating them prior to submission, as was 		the intent of the system. No evidence was found of much behavioral response by 		providers, but that could change if the system is implemented by a large payer 		such as HCFA. (Final report: 78 pages.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Payment of 		Pharmacists for Cognitive Services: Results of the Washington State C.A.R.E. 		Demonstration Project</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Washington Cognitive Activities and Reimbursement Effectiveness (C.A.R.E.) 		Project was a demonstration authorized under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 		Act of 1990 to assess the impact of a financial incentive on pharmacists' 		performance of cognitive services. The premise of this demonstration was that 		direct reimbursement for pharmacists' cognitive services will remove financial 		barriers associated pharmacists' provision of these services and result in 		increased performance of cognitive services, with a subsequent impact on costs 		and outcomes. Data for the demonstration were drawn from three groups of 		pharmacies located throughout the State of Washington, each of which contained 		about 100 pharmacy sites. Pharmacists in the first two groups documented 		cognitive services for Medicaid patients using a problem-intervention-result 		format. The demonstration phase lasted from February 1994 through September 		1995 and resulted in the documentation of 20,240 cognitive service events. The 		project found that (1) Group A pharmacists, who received financial incentives, 		consistently reported higher cognitive service intervention rates than did 		Group B, who did not receive financial incentives; (2) about half of all 		documented cognitive services problems were for patient-related problems, while 		32.6 percent were for drug-related problems, 17.6 percent for 		prescription-related problems, and 1.4 percent for non-drug-related problems; 		(3) a drug therapy change occurred as a result of 28 percent of all cognitive 		services; (4) for each cognitive service associated with any type of drug 		therapy change, the average downstream drug cost savings was about $13, but 		these savings varied by type of drug therapy; and (5) the Medicaid program 		saved about $78,000 due to cognitive services resulting in drug therapy 		changes. The report concludes that the implementation of a prescription 		drug-related cognitive services documentation and reimbursement system is 		feasible and useful. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Assessing the 		Viability of All-Payer Systems for Inpatient Hospital 		Services</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report explores the feasibility and possible structure of alternative 		approaches to developing an all-payer prospective system for reimbursing 		hospitals for inpatient care. The study tests the practicality of adapting or 		extending Medicare's Prospective Payment System (PPS) to either other payers or 		all payers as part of the health care reform legislation proposed by the 		Clinton Administration in 1993. The initial tasks were the development of data 		files necessary to construct such an all-payer PPS. The most basic components 		of a PPS are payment weights, rates, and adjustors. Separate analytic steps are 		required in order to derive each of these components, and several different 		types of data are required to complete each of these analytic tasks. Admission 		records are needed and must be categorized according to a specified 		classification system. Hospital-specific cost data by payer category are 		required to calculate costs per case, and hospital and area characteristic data 		are required in order to judge the need for and level of payment adjustors. 		Once these data were developed, they were used in two analyses: one addressing 		whether diagnosis-related group (DRG)-based payment rates for Medicare and 		non-Medicare patients should be adjusted based on hospital characteristics, and 		one focusing on an alternative approach to defining the Medicare standardized 		prospective payment rate. The report finds that current PPS rates are based on 		the mean adjusted cost for a given category of hospital, and that high-cost 		hospitals are penalized under the assumption that their costs are reflective of 		presumed inefficiency. The report develops hospital-specific measures of 		inefficiency and then excludes the costs of inefficient hospitals from the 		calculation of standardized payment rates. The report concludes that a frontier 		cost function model approach is superior to the current system and can result 		in substantial program savings. See also PIC ID No. 6594.1. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Second Update 		of the Geographic Practice Cost Index: Final Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI) is an input price index used to adjust 		Medicare Fee Schedule (MFS) payments for area variations in physicians' cost of 		practice. The original GPCI was implemented with the MFS in 1992. In 1995 and 		1996, the GPCI was updated with 1990 Decennial Census data. This report 		documents the second update of the GPCI, which is scheduled to be fully phased 		in on January 1, 1999. During the previous year, 1998, a transition will occur 		between the 1997 GPCI and the updated 1999 GPCI, with one-half the total change 		implemented in 1998. The comparison between the 1997 and the 1999 GPCIs shows 		that (1) there is no change between the physician work GPCI or the 		non-physician employee wage index of the practice expense GPCI except that they 		are reweighted with 1994 county relative value units (RVUs); (2) the office 		rental index of the practice expense GPCI is updated with fiscal year 1996 Fair 		Market Rents published by the Department of Housing and Urban Development; (3) 		county rental adjustment factors are eliminated for all metropolitan areas, 		except for the New York City Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area; (4) the 		malpractice GPCI is updated with 1992, 1993, and 1994 premium data, and 		specialty premiums are weighted by national RVU proportions rather than allowed 		charges; (5) there is no change in the GPCI cost shares, which measure the 		share of the various inputs in total practice revenues; and (6) the county RVUs 		used to weight averages of county input prices for each Fee Schedule Area (FSA) 		are updated from 1992 to 1994. The report also examines changes in the 		Geographic Adjustment Factor between 1999 and 1997. It determines that changes 		in MFS payments resulting from implementation of the 1999 GPCIs will be small 		(less than 2.5 percent for each FSA). See also 5764 series.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Validation of 		Nursing Home Quality Indicators Study</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This study 		developed a system by which a series of Quality Indicators (QIs) could be used 		in conjunction with claims data to monitor quality of care in nursing home 		facilities. Fifty QIs were developed and validated using a sample of nursing 		home residents' medical records for a 6-month period surrounding the time of 		nursing facility's Federal certification survey. The QIs focus on the 		occurrence of three broad potential problem areas, including adverse outcomes, 		lack of therapy, and inappropriate pharmaceutical treatments. The QI algorithm 		used ICD-9 CM diagnosis codes and CPT-4 and CRVS procedure codes to generate 		the QIs. These codes represent either medical or surgical conditions that 		define the indicator events (e.g., inpatient stay or emergency room visit), the 		covariant diagnoses, or case selection factors. It is anticipated that these 		validated QIs could be used as the basis for an automated system to 		continuously monitor the quality of care provided in federally certified 		nursing homes to assist Federal and State surveyors in implementing the survey 		process effectively. Such a system could contribute to lowering the costs of 		care and improving outcomes for Medicaid nursing home residents by reducing the 		incidence of potentially avoidable hospitalization and over-medication. The two 		volume report finds that (1) the utility of basing indicators of quality of 		nursing home care on Medicaid and Medicare claims data is clearly demonstrated; 		(2) the study QIs as a whole were generally better at predicting the absence of 		a quality issue, suggesting that the negative finding on the quality indicator 		represented the lack of a quality concern in the nursing home; and (3) using 		covariant diagnoses to adjust for the risk of a resident receiving a QI tag is 		useful. The report concludes with a discussion of the issues raised during the 		validation of the 50 QIs examined here. (Volume I: 88 pages; Volume II: 		appendices variously paginated.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>1995 Influenza 		Immunizations Paid for by Medicare: State and County 		Rates</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In 1993, 		the Health Care Financing Administration began paying providers for influenza 		vaccine and its administration to Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older. 		This data book provides information about the national, State, and county rates 		of influenza vaccination in the Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) sector. 		Medicare-managed care beneficiaries are not counted. The data book presents 		maps that report rates as integers for ease of presentation. It also presents 		tables that measure rates to one tenth of one percent. State rates are also 		presented. The data book provides three tables for each State: (1) a table 		providing the State's rates and numbers of influenza immunizations for 1994 and 		1995 according to age, gender, and race; (2) a table showing the State's number 		of elderly enrolled in Medicare Part B FFS and the number of individuals who 		received flu shots in 1995 according to race and county; and (3) a table 		presenting corresponding immunization rates for 1994 and 1995 according to race 		and county. The data show that (1) about 41 percent of elderly Medicare 		beneficiaries received an influenza vaccination in 1995 that was paid for by 		Medicare; (2) for all sectors of this population, there was an increase over 		1994 immunization rates ranging from 2.3 percent to 6.4 percent, indicating 		progress toward the <b><i>Healthy People 2000</i></b> goal of a 60 percent 		influenza immunization rate for this population; (3) African-American 		beneficiaries have an immunization rate one-half that of Caucasian 		beneficiaries, although between 1994 and 1995, the increase in the rate of 		immunizations was slightly greater for African Americans than for Caucasians; 		(4) there is no substantial variation in rates by gender; and (5) immunization 		rates are lowest for those beneficiaries 85 years and older.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Impact of the 		Medicare Fee Schedule on Teaching Physicians</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Prior to 		the implementation of the Medicare Fee Schedule (MFS) in 1992, several studies 		were conducted to determine the impact of this payment change on various groups 		of physicians. However, no studies examined the potential impact of the MFS on 		teaching physicians, even though anecdotal evidence from academic practices 		suggested that these physicians would be particularly hard hit for four reasons 		(1) teaching physicians perform relatively more high-technology procedures and 		less primary care, which could result in disproportionate net losses for many 		academic practices; (2) teaching hospitals and medical schools tend to be 		located in large urban areas, where the Geographic Practice Cost Index portion 		of the payment is lower; (3) customary charges for teaching physicians may be 		higher than the area-wide historical payments calculated for fee schedule 		transition; and (4) a number of academic medical practices had not signed 		Medicare participation agreements. This study determines the impact of the MFS 		on teaching physicians and examines variations in the impact across academic 		medical centers, other major teaching hospitals, and minor teaching hospitals. 		The net effects of MFS price changes and any observed quantity changes on 		inpatient physician revenues were examined. A total of 720 hospitals were 		selected for this study, including all U.S. academic medical centers. The 		report finds that there is no evidence that teaching physicians have been 		adversely impacted by the MFS. Inpatient revenues per admission fell by the 		same percentage amount in all types of hospitals. Revenues fell because of a 		reduction in prices and in the quantity of services provided per admission. 		Thus, while the theoretical expectation was that teaching physicians would have 		experienced a disproportionately large reduction in their average price per 		service, in practice these physicians have altered that service mix by 		providing less RVU-intensive visits. </p>
