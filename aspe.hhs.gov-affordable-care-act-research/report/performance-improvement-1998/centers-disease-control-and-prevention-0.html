<p><b>TITLE: <i>Sexually 		Transmitted Disease (STD) Prevention in the United States: Integrated 		Evaluation of Public and Private Sector Disease Reporting and Service 		Delivery</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of Sexually 		Transmitted Disease (STD) Prevention provides financial and technical 		assistance to State and local agencies to support a range of prevention, 		research, policy development, and surveillance activities. Two parallel STD 		surveillance systems are currently operated by CDC, both of which rely upon 		regular, voluntary reporting of STD incidence by State and local agencies. Both 		systems are thought to suffer from less-than-complete reporting of STDs by 		diagnosing practitioners. Estimates of this underreporting range from 25 to 90 		percent. The focus of this project, therefore, was to design and pilot test a 		methodology for validating the STD data routinely collected, analyzed, and 		published by the Division. The study's main objective was to test the 		feasibility of using a provider-based survey (1) to quantitatively validate 		CDC's data on STD diagnoses, and (2) to assess the extent to which clinicians 		follow CDC's treatment guidelines for STDs. The study was designed to generate 		estimates of STD incidence through a survey of a random sample of STD data 		providers in four States, and to compare these estimates with State-reported 		STD incidence for the same time period. The report finds that (1) the four 		pilot States differ in terms of their STD data-gathering policies and 		practices, including which diseases are reported, how cases are defined for 		reporting purposes, how laboratory reporting is utilized, and which date 		information is recorded for each case; (2) syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia 		are reportable diseases in all four States, and in two States many additional 		diseases are reportable; (3) in two States, physicians must report diseases for 		them to be recorded, while in two others laboratory reports are sufficient; (4) 		STDs are considerably underreported by providers; and (5) most STD cases are 		seen by individual private practitioners. (Final report: 82 pages, plus 		appendices.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE:<i> </i>Evaluation 		of ICD-10 for Morbidity Reporting in the United States</b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report evaluates (1) whether the International Classification of Disease 		(ICD)-10 is a significant improvement over the ICD-9; (2) whether these 		improvements warrant its implementation in the United States; (3) the 		modifications needed to improve its use for morbidity applications; and (4) 		whether there are any codes or concepts in ICD-9, but not in ICD-10, that 		should be considered for inclusion. The Technical Advisory Panel and project 		staff conclude that there are many strengths in ICD-10 in comparison with 		ICD-9. Many of the chapters contain a wealth of useful expansion in detail for 		which diagnostic information is typically available and which represent 		important clinical distinctions. These expansions will facilitate future 		specificity in statistical tabulations of diseases and conditions, provide some 		additional means for severity coding, and provide for enhanced applicability of 		the classification to primary care reporting. The logic and detail of ICD-10 		will also contribute to progress toward the computerization of medical records. 		Although a number of limitations in ICD-10 are identified, the recommended 		modifications will overcome most of them. Therefore, it is strongly recommended 		that the National Center for Health Statistics implement a revised version as 		soon as possible. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Suicide 		Intervention and Prevention: Evaluation of Community-Based Programs in Three 		American Indian Communities</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Suicide is 		the second leading cause of death for Native Americans aged 15 to 24. American 		Indian/Alaska Native young people are more likely to attempt suicide; to choose 		a highly lethal method, such as firearms or hanging; and to be successful at 		committing suicide. This report evaluates the local community-based suicide 		intervention and prevention programs of three geographically diverse American 		Indian tribes (the Jicarilla Apache Tribe, the Western Athabaskan Tribe, and 		the Northern Woodlands Tribe). In two tribes, suicide intervention efforts had 		been in place since 1989 and 1990, respectively; in the third, a suicide crisis 		in late 1992 precipitated community response. The report finds that (1) the 		local nature of the evaluation process opened itself to problems of diffuse 		authority and lack of focus on the evaluation process; (2) suicide prevention 		issues, tribal identity issues, and staffing issues took precedent over the 		actual evaluation activities; (3) a major recommendation arising from this 		study was to have process evaluation activities conducted by an external 		(non-community member) evaluator not supervised by local staff; (4) the 		Jicarilla Apache program represents a suicide prevention program in a very 		small, cohesive, and well-coordinated community response, which depends upon a 		staff model; (5) at the Western Athabaskan reservation, the prevention program 		used several special initiatives loosely coordinated with an existing 		Behavioral Health Services program using a staff model; (6) using a volunteer 		network, the Northern Woodlands tribe produced an excellent manual describing a 		grassroots community approach to suicide prevention; and (7) in all three 		tribes, attempted and successful suicide rates were reduced. The report 		concludes that the staff models used in the two small and centralized 		reservation communities were more successful than the diffuse, volunteer 		effort. (Final report: 120 pages.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE:<i> </i>Evaluation 		of the Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) Program: Phase II 		Final Report</b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) program of the National 		Institute for Occupational Safety and Health seeks to prevent workplace 		fatalities by identifying and investigating fatal occupational injuries and 		disseminating prevention strategies to those who can intervene in similar 		situations. Publications based on information from fatality investigations 		identify occupational hazards and prevention measures, and are disseminated to 		persons who can influence work conditions and information availability in 		related occupations and work settings. </p>
<p>This report (1) describes 		the dissemination of five recent FACE documents (4 tear-sheet Alerts and one 		monograph), (2) compiles users' assessments of their usefulness, and (3) 		identifies examples of prevention efforts and other impacts attributable to the 		documents. The report finds that (1) publications are generally considered 		technically accurate and focused on significant occupational hazards by users; 		(2) workers participating in focus groups see job-related chronic illnesses and 		nonfatal injuries as more significant than the risk of fatality, and are less 		convinced of tear sheets' relevance to them; (3) workers consider the tear 		sheets' recommendations accurate and appropriate, but are concerned by the 		inclusion of "common sense" recommendations; (4) the tear sheets' terminology 		and generally high literacy level may limit their usefulness to their target 		audiences; (5) the publications are generally disseminated by distributing them 		directly or by modifying them for inclusion in other informational materials; 		and (6) information from the publications is used to improve worker training, 		identify existing hazards, and improve safety standards. The report concludes 		that the FACE publications are a useful source of authoritative occupational 		safety information. The report includes several recommendations. See also PIC 		ID No. 5506.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Assessment of 		the National Laboratory Training Network</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		National Laboratory Training Network (NLTN) was established in 1989 to provide 		training in new methodologies and theoretical concepts for laboratory workers. 		This report assesses whether the NLTN has had a beneficial impact on public 		health by improving laboratory practice. Data were gathered through a series of 		surveys of local health department and physician office laboratory employees 		who participated in training, as well as comparison groups of those who did 		not. Other surveys of State training coordinators (STCs), laboratory 		inspectors, microbiology directors, microbiology program participants, and NLTN 		co-sponsors were also conducted. The report categorizes its findings in three 		groups, based upon the responses of (1) STCs, laboratory inspectors, and 		co-sponsors; (2) microbiologists; and (3) course participants and their 		comparison groups. The report finds that: (1) STCs felt supported in their jobs 		and used NLTN resources (88 percent were somewhat or very satisfied with NLTN 		services, and 90 percent were satisfied with programs); (2) laboratory 		inspectors often recommended training as a means to correct deficiencies, but 		only a small percentage used the NLTN as a training source; (3) co-sponsors 		rate relevance, quality, and currency of course content very highly; (4) 		microbiology directors rated NLTN fees, convenience, relevance, quality, 		currency of content, and pertinence of issues addressed favorably; (5) 		one-third of microbiology course participants instituted a change in practice 		as a result of training (80 percent rated quality and currency of content 		highly); and (6) course participants in the third group rated their training 		highly and most instituted changes or saw positive results subsequent to 		training. The report includes recommendations for further improving the NLTN. 		(Final report: 147 pages, appendices bound separately in Volume 		II.) </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Race Reporting 		on Birth Records by Multiracial Women: An Evaluation of Question Format 		Alternatives</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		report examines the implications of changing the format of the race item on the 		birth record filled out for every birth in the United States at the location 		where the birth occurred. Procedures for filling out birth certificates vary 		from State to State and in some States, from hospital to hospital. To provide 		uniform information to the vital registration system, the Federal government, 		in cooperation with the States, developed the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live 		Birth that collects relevant information about the race and Hispanic origin of 		the parents, but not of the baby. This study (1) evaluates how women of 		multiracial and Hispanic backgrounds interpret the race question on the birth 		certificate; (2) evaluates experimental race questions, such as the use of a 		multiracial cue and the use of a "mark all that apply" format; and (3) learns 		more about the response processes that women use when answering questions about 		race. Nine States and the District of Columbia recruited 763 women to 		participate in this study. The study tests the effects of different questions 		on race, both in a mail and a followup telephone survey. The mother's 		self-reported race is compared with what she reported on the actual birth 		record. Further, for those residents with two children, the study compared 		consistency of race reporting between the last two birth records. The report 		concludes that (1) the number of women reporting more than one race increases 		when the race questions include a multiracial cue or "mark all that apply" 		format; (2) women who report more than one race are more likely to enter two 		specific races rather than a term like multiracial; (3) among the mothers whose 		parents who were two or more races, self-reports of race on the last two birth 		records are inconsistent 25 percent of the time; and (4) self-reports of race 		are different 40 percent of the time between the birth record and the standard 		version of the mail survey.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Management and 		Operational Impacts of HIV Prevention Community Planning: Lessons Learned at 		Mid-Course and Implications for Future Activities</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>HIV 		Prevention Community Planning, implemented in January 1994, represented a major 		policy change in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding policy. 		Prior to that time, State, territorial, and local health department grantees 		with prevention funds were required to spend most of their cooperative 		agreement funds on counseling and testing services. A new emphasis on planning 		through HIV Prevention Community Planning requires grantees to set their own 		HIV prevention priorities locally through a process that emphasizes input from 		the affected communities and relevant technical experts. This project broadly 		evaluated the policy impact of this new planning process on grantees' HIV 		prevention programs as demonstrated by budgetary and operational indicators. 		This is an issue of national importance, as the HIV prevention community 		planning process affects over $200 million dollars in HIV prevention funds 		across the country. This first phase of a two-phase project ascertained how 		community planning is confirming, enhancing, and changing HIV prevention 		programs. A methodology for obtaining information on the indicators for a 		retrospective study was also developed and piloted during this phase of the 		study. The report finds that (1) a prospective and iterative approach to 		planning, implementation, and assessment is the most valuable approach; (2) in 		a prospective approach, the baseline is the set of circumstances extant at the 		beginning of the process, and site-specific goals and objectives are developed 		and tracked; and (3) more detailed guidance addressing these issues could help 		operationalize this kind of approach. Finally, the report finds that the 		indicators offering the most promise are (1) correspondence between the 		community plan, proposed activities, and undertaken activities; (2) quality 		assurance for implementation; and (3) capacity building and infrastructure 		development.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>CDC's Early 		Implementation of GPRA: A Case Study--July 1995 to November 		1996</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) stresses the importance 		of government agencies' monitoring their results or outcomes in order to 		improve their management of associated processes and outputs. GPRA mandates 		that each agency produce a 5-year strategic plan and a 1-year performance plan 		by September 1997. This report offers a record of the experience of the Centers 		for Disease Control and Prevention in its early implementation of GPRA. It 		documents the process, summarizes key findings, and recommends strategies and 		approaches for the ongoing implementation of GPRA. The report finds that (1) 		implementation during the study phase did not proceed at the anticipated rate 		(instead of a fully developed strategic plan and pilot performance plans, most 		of the effort has concentrated on a strategic plan that is not yet 		drafted-little attention has been paid to the performance plans); (2) the role 		and responsibilities of the GPRA Implementation Team (GIT) evolved over the 		study period; (3) the GIT suffered from shifting membership, lack of continuity 		in meeting attendance, and an overall insufficient level of effort; (4) more 		effective and comprehensive planning and coordination was needed; and (5) 		despite the large amount of time and effort devoted to GPRA, the levels and 		types of commitment and resources fell short of what was needed. The report 		also concludes that insufficient momentum, commitment, and resources were a 		greater problem than ineffective planning; the process could have benefitted 		from greater executive staff involvement early on; and the process was often 		frustrating for participants. The report recommends that (1) organizational 		change efforts be unified under a high-level champion or team; (2) the Office 		of Program Planning and Evaluation's charge of implementing GPRA requirements 		be maintained; (3) the GIT be revamped; and (4) realistic budget be developed, 		requested, and executed. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Collaborating 		with Managed Care Organizations for Mammography Screening and Rescreening: 		Guidance for NBCCEDP Grantees</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>Clinical 		trials show that mammography screening among women aged 50-69 years can reduce 		mortality from breast cancer by as much as 30 to 40 percent. Thus, more 		complete mammography screening coverage is needed throughout the Nation. This 		project was undertaken with a dual purpose: (1) to evaluate strategies used in 		the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) to 		reach women 50 years and older for the early detection of breast cancer; and 		(2) to assess potential partnership opportunities between public health and 		managed care organizations to increase the coverage of mammography screening. 		Currently, all States, the 5 territories, and 25 American Indian tribes are 		funded by the NBCCEDP to establish and manage comprehensive breast and cervical 		cancer screening services for women who are minorities, low-income, and age 50 		or older, a population that seeks mammography services less often than other 		women because of cost, knowledge, and other barriers. The report notes that the 		increased use of managed care organizations (MCOs) by State Medicaid programs 		offers new opportunities and incentives to build partnerships between NBCCEDP 		grantees and MCOs. The report finds that (1) because grantees give priority to 		women who are low-income, uninsured, racial minorities, or Native American, 		special attention must be paid to educating and building relationships with 		MCOs in outreach, case management, and followup; (2) both sectors will benefit 		from data partnerships and community collaborations; (3) most current MCO 		efforts in the area of breast and cervical cancer detection are data-driven and 		office-based; and (4) health plans target providers more than patients to 		increase their attention to the prevention effort. The report also addresses 		opportunities for collaboration, barriers to and facilitators of such 		collaboration, and strategies that programs might use to enhance screening 		efforts.

This information will also be useful 		for private sector and other organizations that are working to provide 		prevention services to hard-to-reach groups. Five categories of strategies are 		examined: inreach, public education, outreach, policies and procedures, and 		coalition and partnership development. While all of these strategies are 		different, several common themes underlie them all: (1) organizations must 		consider broad partnerships to reach marginalized populations who, because of 		their complicated lives, may not seek out care for themselves; (2) aggressive 		outreach may be needed to work with agencies and individuals who are most 		frequently in contact with these populations; (3) organizations should consider 		their infrastructure, not just outreach, to bring women in (health care 		organizations or health plans with a designated group of clients will find 		inreach more effective than outreach in the short term); (4) while the natural 		tendency is to focus on the relationship between the direct caregiver 		(especially the physician) and the patient, women are more likely to return for 		rescreening and to comply with followup regimens if a welcoming atmosphere is 		created by the entire office; and (5) the successful strategies show that there 		are diverse resources available for programs, but that innovation is needed 		when developing partnerships.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluation 		Design for the Business Responds to AIDS (BRTA) Program</i></b> 		</p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Business Responds to AIDS program (BRTA) is a public-private initiative 		partnership undertaken by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 		Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention to help businesses create and implement 		comprehensive HIV/AIDS workplace programs. To better understand how worksites 		are engaged in health promotion efforts, the BRTA Program conducted a national 		probability survey (the BRTA Benchmark Survey) to track progress since 1992. 		This project conducts a secondary analysis of the BRTA Benchmark Survey in 		order to provide recommendations about future evaluation designs that rely 		heavily on national communication channels. While much of the survey addressed 		issues related to HIV/AIDS, a number of questions were included that help track 		trends in worksite policies, screening programs, and health promotion 		activities. Results from this survey were compared to those gathered in a 1992 		Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion survey of health promotion 		and disease prevention in the worksite. The report finds that (1) recent trends 		in worksite health promotion efforts seem to show increases in worksite 		policies, but no changes or decreases in classes or screening programs; (2) 		having a worksite policy may be less costly to implement than classes or 		screening programs (these policy interventions may also be more cost-effective 		than other types of interventions); and (3) the downward trend may result from 		some measurement bias introduced by asking questions about health promotion 		classes and screening programs only of those respondents to the BRTA Benchmark 		Survey who said they had had some health promotion program in the past 12 		months.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Case Studies 		of the Prevention Marketing Initiatives (PMI) Local Demonstration Site 		Projects: Experiences During Planning and Transition 		Phases</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		Prevention Marketing Initiative (PMI) is a social marketing program intended to 		influence behaviors that contribute to the sexual transmission of HIV and other 		sexually transmitted diseases among young people below 25 years of age. PMI 		includes among its components locally funded demonstration sites, which combine 		community participation with social marketing and behavioral science 		methodology and theory in order to design, implement, and sustain viable 		prevention programs. The PMI case study gathered in-depth information at these 		sites to describe the experiences of program participants over a 2-year period 		spanning two major project phases: planning and transition to implementation. 		The study highlights participants' reflections on what was done to foster 		achievement of PMI's goals, as well as what could be avoided in the future. The 		qualitative information gathered will be used to contextualize quantitative 		evaluation data collected as sites move through the implementation phase of 		PMI. The report finds that PMI had the following effect: (1) increased 		collaboration among community organizations and individuals on HIV prevention; 		(2) increased youth involvement in planning HIV prevention activities after 		some initial floundering in this area; (3) there is some weak evidence of 		increased support for HIV prevention programs within the community; and (4) 		increased participants' knowledge of, and sensitivity to, social marketing 		methodologies. The report also makes several recommendations on two levels: 		those that can be applied to new PMI sites and to other community-based 		ventures and those that pertain to PMI in particular. A,ong these 		recommendations are (1) define and become familiar with the community, (2) 		learn to manage issues and be realistic, (3) maintain diversity and enforce 		rules, (4) be clear with the lead agency, and (5) have the staff in place to 		provide needed technical and management services.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Evaluability 		Assessment of CDC-Funded Traumatic Brain Injury and Spinal Cord Injury 		Programs</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In 1988, 		the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) created the Disabilities 		Prevention Program (DPP) to reduce the incidence and severity of primary and 		secondary disabilities in the United States and to promote the independence and 		productivity of persons with disabilities. This report was commissioned to 		assess the feasibility of conducting an evaluation of the traumatic brain 		injury and spinal cord injury (TBI/SCI) programs funded through the DPP, the 		National Center for Environmental Health, and CDC. Interviews were conducted 		with Federal and State staff with a background or interest in DPP, external 		stakeholders, and with program staff in eight States. Interview data were used 		to prepare a logic model of State-level TBI/SCI programs, along with a set of 		measurable program components that match the activities and the objectives set 		forth in the logic model. The report finds that (1) there is a consensus among 		all stakeholders on the goals, activities, and objectives of the TBI/SCI 		capacity building programs' intended goals and on indicators that can be used 		to measure attainment; and (2) identifying the logic model and framework of 		measurable components for these programs offers many benefits. In order to 		strengthen CDC-State partnerships, the report recommends: (1) an appropriate 		balance in the partnership that allows States to be flexible but also provides 		parameters to ensure consistency; (2) the provision of regular, consistent 		feedback on State plans, activities, quarterly reports, and surveillance data; 		(3) grounding program design and decisions on valid data, whenever possible (in 		the absence of data, programs should proceed with a phased approach involving 		both the CDC and the States in the evolutionary learning process); and (4) the 		expansion of partnerships at the Federal, State, and community levels.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Community 		Context Study: Minors' Access to Tobacco</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		project represents the first phase of a national study designed to profile the 		relationship between youths' access to tobacco and the contextual variables 		that define communities' policies, attitudes, and activities regarding youth 		and tobacco. The results of the study have implications for local, State, and 		Federal policies and programs. The basic conceptual model postulates that 		community forces will initiate and/or enhance local enforcement efforts. 		Enforcement will affect vendor behavior, which will then restrict minors' 		access to-and thereby, use of-tobacco. To address the questions raised by the 		conceptual model, data collection and analysis for this project were conducted 		in three parts: (1) telephone interviews with tobacco vendors and community 		leaders, and purchase attempts in stores in 20 communities; (2) in-person 		interviews with community leaders in ten case-study communities; and (3) 		analysis of teen tobacco use data from the 1995 Youth Risk Behavior Study 		(YRBS), collected by CDC for the same 20 communities. The report finds that (1) 		adolescents have little difficulty buying cigarettes in retail outlets; (2) 		even in restrictive communities, some stores would sell tobacco to minors; (3) 		the most important deterrent of sales to minors is asking for proof of age; (4) 		the presence of tobacco sales warning signs is associated with a lower sale 		rate; (5) community support for tobacco control promotes merchant compliance 		with the law; and (6) even a perception of enforcement acts as a strong 		deterrent to selling tobacco to minors. The report recommends that (1) the 		study should be expanded as a followup to the 1997 YRBS in sampled communities, 		(2) a question about the location of sources of retail purchase should be added 		to the YRBS, and (3) the expanded community context study should be fielded as 		soon as possible.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Directions for 		Research on the National Immunization Survey: Final 		Report</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The 		National Immunization Survey (NIS) measures the immunization levels among young 		children in each State and in large metropolitan areas on a quarterly basis. 		This survey recently came under review, and questions about the cost of the 		survey and the utility of the data were raised. This report reviews the survey 		and develops a plan for determining whether less expensive methods could be 		used and still yield a statistically sound survey that meets the needs of the 		National Immunization Program. The report finds that (1) the NIS is a 		well-designed response to a very difficult set of goals posed by the Centers 		for Disease Control and Prevention; (2) dramatic cost reductions (i.e., 30 		percent or larger) could not be achieved without major changes in survey 		objectives or quality; (3) there is greater potential for cost savings in the 		area of data collection than in analysis, since the volume of the survey makes 		refined systems for data collection economically feasible; (4) the high data 		analysis costs for the survey are well justified; (5) the survey meets the need 		for monitoring trends at the national level and can also be used to identify 		Immunization Action Plan (IAP) areas with either very poor or outstanding 		immunization levels; and (6) the survey can differentiate the immunization 		rates for reasonably small demographic groups annually, and can be used to 		monitor immunization trends at the IAP level, but only on an annual or biennial 		basis. The report concludes that the relative emphasis on IAP-level statistics 		and on national statistics should perhaps be adjusted-in the justification of 		the survey, in the design of the household interview, and in the choice of 		statistics to publish. It recommends that the schedule for publication of 		IAP-level statistics be cut back to an annual schedule and that new 		publications on national statistics for domains of interest be developed to 		fill the publication schedule. </p>

<p><b>TITLE: <i>In Her Own 		Words: A Focus Group Study of Risk and Protective Factors in Intimate Partner 		Violence</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This study 		was designed to provide insights into how African-American and Caucasian women 		in urban and rural settings perceive the factors that placed them at risk for 		an abusive relationship, as well as the factors that protected them from 		further violence during and after the relationship. The model used as the 		conceptual framework for the study (Prochaska's and DiClemente's 		Transtheoretical Model) depicts a sequence of five stages that culminate in 		lasting behavior change. Twenty-two focus groups were conducted in urban and 		rural areas in Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Oregon. One hundred and 		sixty-eight women participated in the study, ranging in age from 18 to 60; all 		had been out of their abusive relationships from 6 months to 24 years. The 		report finds that (1) the long-term effects of emotional and physical abuse are 		worse than the actual violence and resulting injuries themselves; (2) a wide 		range of psychologically and physically abusive acts were described by focus 		group participants, including abuse not only of themselves but also of children 		and of pets; (3) most focus group participants concluded that anything could be 		a trigger to violence, and that this realization was a significant contributor 		to the terror, fear, and desperation they felt in their relationships; (4) 		participants agreed that a number of problem behaviors, such as a history of 		violence at home, extreme charm, possessiveness, and explosive rage, are early 		warning signs of abuse; and (5) women describe the decision to leave the 		abusive relationship as the result of a breaking point. The report concludes 		that this study's findings should be validated in a national telephone survey 		of women's risk and protective factors for intimate partner violence.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Linking 		Research and Public Health Practice: A Review of CDC's Program of Centers for 		Research and Demonstration of Health Promotion and Disease 		Prevention</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>In order 		to advance research in health promotion and disease prevention, the Centers for 		Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established a program of university-based 		Centers for Research and Demonstration of Health Promotion and Disease 		Prevention. The prevention research center (PRC) program began in 1986 with 		funding to three universities; in 1996, there were 13 PRCs. This report 		examines the extent to which the PRC program is providing the public health 		community with workable strategies to address major public health problems in 		disease prevention and health promotion. The report finds that (1) by forging 		links with academia, CDC has created a gateway for access to a cadre of 		well-trained, university-based researchers who could serve to inform and 		collaborate with the agency and the public health community regarding health 		promotion and disease prevention; (2) the PRC has made substantial progress in 		advancing the scientific infrastructure in support of disease and health 		promotion policy, programs, and practices; (3) each of the centers has made 		some contributions toward one or more of the goals of the program (research, 		dissemination, and developing connections with the community and public health 		practitioners); (4) there are substantial differences among the PRCs in the 		kinds of activities they have undertaken and the success realized (only a few 		have made substantial progress in all areas); and (5) CDC's management of the 		program has been creative in the face of limited resources relative to its 		mandate-dogged in pursuing the mandate over a 10-year period in a bureaucratic 		environment that was not created or structured for the management of 		university-based research programs, and skilled in enhancing a sense of 		community and networking among the funded centers in a time of disappointing 		funding levels.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Syphilis in 		the South: A Case Study Assessment in Eight Southern 		Communities</i></b> </p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		two-volume report presents the results of a comparative case study of 		local-level syphilis prevention efforts that are conducted as part of sexually 		transmitted disease (STD) prevention programs supported by the Centers for 		Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The case studies were conducted in eight 		communities in four Southern States: Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and 		Tennessee. The project investigated past and current responses of the public 		and private health sectors to a syphilis epidemic that occurred in the southern 		United States between 1990 and 1992. Study findings were developed around four 		key questions: (1) who is at greatest risk of syphilis infection and 		transmission, (2) what institutions are best able to reach those at greatest 		risk, (3) what are the barriers to syphilis prevention and control in 		communities, and (4) what innovative ways have been found to transcend these 		barriers? The report finds that (1) interviewees perceived African Americans to 		be the demographic group most at risk for infection and transmission of 		syphilis, especially those who exchanged sex for drugs, homeless people, and 		incarcerated individuals; (2) adolescent high-risk sexual behavior was of 		concern as a possible precursor to infection once practitioners reached their 		20s; (3) local health departments are the only community organizations focusing 		directly on syphilis and other STD control and prevention; (4) public health 		agencies assigned priority to disease control and engaged in few agency-based 		prevention activities, and schools were limited in their ability to be venues 		for STD prevention messages due to the local restrictions on sexually explicit 		materials in health education curricula; and (5) barriers to those at greatest 		risk of syphilis infection are cultural, programmatic, and political. 		Recommendations are offered in a manner designed to allow practical 		implementation. (Vol. I: 121 pages, plus appendices; Vol. II: 100 		pages.) </p>

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>The three 		aims of this project were to (1) establish population-based surveillance for 		invasive <b><i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i></b> infection; (2) evaluate the 		validity of the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 		sentinel surveillance system; and (3) identify the optimal methods for 		determining antimicrobial resistance patterns in the United States. Active, 		population-based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal infection was 		established in all hospitals in the Baltimore metropolitan area over a 2-year 		period. Various additional data collection methods were employed, including 		bimonthly contact/followup to participating sites to obtain cases not reported 		spontaneously, yearly laboratory audits to identify cases not reported through 		active surveillance, and retrospective chart reviews. During the 2-year project 		period, 1,415 cases were reported: 685 in 1995 and 730 in 1996. Additionally, 		the contractor conducted two nasopharyngeal culture surveys of 300 children 		each in 5 pediatric clinics within the Baltimore metropolitan area. Sputum 		surveys were also conducted in three large Baltimore area hospitals. All data 		and isolates from the project have been sent to CDC. See also PIC ID Nos. 		6580.1 and 6580.2.

<p><b>TITLE: <i>Assessment of 		the Programmatic Impact of One-Percent Evaluation Studies</i></b> 		</p>
<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		three-volume report provides a systematic evaluation of the programmatic impact 		of 1-percent evaluation studies carried out by the Centers for Disease Control 		and Prevention (CDC) between 1990 and 1995. The study was also designed to 		elicit information about what the Office of Program Planning and Evaluation 		could do to enhance the impact of 1-percent evaluation studies. The study 		resulted in findings in three major areas: (1) the perception at CDC of 		evaluation in general, (2) the perception at CDC of the 1-percent process in 		particular, and (3) the programmatic impact to date of 1-percent evaluation 		studies at CDC. Among the findings were that: (1) although pressure for program 		accountability is mounting, evaluation still engenders anxiety among some CDC 		program staff-although these attitudes are changing slowly; (2) program staff 		are concerned that the 1-percent evaluation process in particular is 		unpredictable-staff do not know from one year to the next how much 1-percent 		funding they will receive, and the time allowed between the issuance of 		1-percent guidance and the deadline for submissions is perceived as too short; 		(3) despite numerous obstacles to implementation, nearly 70 percent of the 		recommendations developed in the evaluation studies examined for this report 		have been considered for implementation and about 50 percent have been 		implemented in some form; and (4) CDC evaluations have produced programmatic 		impact leading to changes in practices and procedures, activities, 		responsibilities, changes in full-time equivalents, budgets, organizational and 		administrative structures, and policy. Specific recommendations are made in the 		report and are arrayed according to project phases (study selection, design, 		implementation, recommendation, and dissemination stages).

<p><b>ABSTRACT: </b>This 		directory is one of the products of a study conducted for the Office of Program 		Planning and Evaluation (OPPE) of the Centers for Disease Control and 		Prevention (CDC) entitled "Assessment of the Programmatic Impact of (CDC) 		One-Percent Evaluation Studies." During a process of reviewing nearly 50 CDC 		evaluations completed between 1990 and 1995 and about 40 additional studies in 		various stages of completion, it became apparent that these studies were 		important to CDC program staff in particular and to the field of public health 		in general. Many common themes ran through these evaluations: (1) the 		difficulties of monitoring the performance of public health programs; (2) the 		growing importance of community outreach and mobilization; (3) the evolving 		role of health communications in CDC's work; and (4) concerns over the impact 		of managed care on the public health sector. This directory includes both 		completed and in-process studies. Project summaries reflect a project's 		reported status as of August 1995. The volume is arranged according to the 		study ID number assigned to each project as it is initiated through OPPE. See 		also PIC ID No. 6581. (Final report: variously paginated.) </p>
