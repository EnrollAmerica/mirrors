    <p class="ParaHeader">Mission</p>
<p>To provide analytical support and advice to the Secretary on policy development and assist the Secretary with the development and coordination of department wide program planning and evaluation activities.</p>
<p class="ParaHeader">Evaluation Program</p>
<p>The Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) functions as a principal advisor to the Secretary on policy development and, in this capacity, conducts a variety of evaluation and policy research studies on issues of national importance. ASPE also is responsible for department wide coordination of legislative, planning, and evaluation activities. In its evaluation coordination role, ASPE has the following tasks:</p>
<ul><li>Provide annual guidance to all HHS agencies and staff offices regarding evaluation priorities, procedures, and review requirements.</li>
<li>Review evaluation priorities proposed by HHS agencies, providing advice about the focus or method of proposed projects and identifying opportunities for collaboration and effective use of resources.</li>
<li>Prepare planning and summary reports on evaluation activities as required by Congress.</li>
</ul><p>Through the departmental evaluation planning process, ASPE has the capacity to identify crosscutting program or policy issues of particular concern to the Secretary and specific program and policy areas not covered by the HHS Agency evaluation plans. In these instances, ASPE initiates evaluations or collaborates with the agencies to conduct evaluations or policy assessments.</p>
<p>Another continuing evaluation objective of ASPE is to support and promote the development and improvement of databases that HHS agencies and ASPE use to evaluate health care programs and health trends. For example, ASPE has been the major initiator, in collaboration with the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, of the first comprehensive survey of people with disabilities in the United States. The first component of these new data was completed in FY 1996, and national prevalence data on disability are now available.</p>
<p>The ASPE chairs the Research Coordination Council (RCC), which will evaluate Department-wide research priorities to ensure that efficiencies are realized and research funding priorities are consistent with the Administrations priorities. The ASPE also co‑chairs and provides support to the HHS Data Council, which is charged with integrating key national surveys, such as linking health status indicators with indicators of well‑being.</p>
<p>Finally, ASPE uses evaluation funds to promote effective use of evaluation‑generated information in program management and policymaking. The latter is accomplished through the dissemination of evaluation findings and other activities, such as providing technical assistance to agencies in the development of performance measures.</p>

<p class="ReportTitle">A Study of Screening and Assessment in TANF and Welfare to Work</p>
<p>This study, jointly funded with the Administration for Children and Families, highlights critical issues in the development and use of screening and assessment tools designed to identify TANF and/or welfare-to-work (WtW) recipients who experience barriers to employment. The barriers of specific interest for this study include substance abuse, mental health or illness, low basic skills, physical/developmental disabilities (including learning disabilities), and domestic violence. The project provided information about: (1) The screening and assessment tools used by experts in the field to identify each of the barriers to employment; 2) The screening and assessment process states and localities are using to identify and serve the target populations and how and why the states chose particular screening and assessment tools; and 3) The linkage between screening and assessment and referral to services, and the types of coordinated services that are being provided to TANF/WtW recipients. Question one notes the lack of a common terminology between TANF agencies and their partners. Question two provides an overview of incentives to screen or assess clients within TANF as well as a review of prevalence estimates for these barriers. Question three builds on this discussion, outlining key aspects of TANF policy that provide TANF agencies flexibility in how they meet the needs of TANF clients. Questions 4 ‑ 10 are as follows: (4) How can the case management process aid in identifying unobserved barriers to employment? (5) Are there tools that can be used to identify barriers to employment? (6) When should screening or assessment (S&amp;A) occur? (7) Who should conduct the S &amp; A? (8) What training issues are related to S&amp;A? (9) What issues related to privacy and confidentiality should be considered? (10) What other questions should be asked? This paper is a first step in identifying barriers to employment. The second phase of the study will consist of conducting case studies to further explore how these issues are addressed in a select number of localities.<br /><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/scrnasmt.pdf">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/scrnasmt.pdf</a><br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Indicators of Welfare Dependence: Annual Report to Congress 2001</p>
<p>The Welfare Indicators Act of 1994 requires the Department of Health and Human Services to prepare annual reports to Congress on indicators and predictors of welfare dependence. Each annual report on Welfare Indicators is developed with the advice and recommendations of the bipartisan Advisory Board on Welfare indicators, the assistance of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Bureau of the Census. The purpose of this report, as stated in the law, is to provide the public with generally accepted measures of welfare receipt so that it can track such receipt over time and determine whether progress is being made in reducing the rate at which and, to the extent feasible, the degree to which, families depend on income from welfare programs and the duration of welfare receipt. Drawing on various data sources, including the Current Population Survey (CPS), this report provides a number of key indicators of welfare recipiency, dependence, and labor force attachment. Selected highlights from the many findings include: (1) In 1998, 3.8 percent of the total population was dependent in the sense of receiving more than half of total family income from TANF, down from 5.8 percent in 1993. (2) The drop in dependency parallels the more well-known drop in AFDC/TANF and food stamp caseloads. (3) In an average month in 1998, more than half (56 percent) of TANF recipients lived in families with at least one family member in the labor force. (4) Long-term dependency is relatively rare. Only 4 percent of those who were recipients in 1982 received more than 50 percent of their income from AFDC and food stamps in nine or more years over a ten-year period.<br /><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/indicators01/index.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/indicators01/index.htm</a><br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Supportive Health Services Needs of Children with Disabilities</p>
<p>The disability supplement to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS-D) is the first comprehensive survey on disability in the United States. The survey is unique in that it focuses on several populations of persons with disabilities who are generally omitted or under-represented in national survey efforts: children, persons with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities and the working-age population. The goal of this overall project is to conduct a series of analyses and produce both short-term products and final reports that will inform ongoing Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) departmental and administrative research and policy initiatives. This study focused on a subset of health-related services that are used almost exclusively by children with disabilities, namely, supportive services. The major finding is that policies focused on low-income children will reach the majority of children with disabilities who have unmet supportive service needs. These needs range widely across types of services, however. Reaching these children is dependent on how comprehensive the service coverage is. If policymakers wish to target the largest group of children with disabilities, they will do so by focusing on the nearly 90 percent of children with disabilities who have a learning limitation. Policies focusing on this group could potentially reach 3.5 million children, almost 13 percent of whose need for supportive services is unmet. Such policies would also potentially reach a proportion of children with other types of disabilities as well, since 30 percent of children with learning limitations have other functional limitations as well.<br /><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/suphsnd.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/suphsnd.htm</a><br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Clarifying the Definition of Homebound and Medical Necessity Using OASIS Data: Final Report</p>
<p>The purpose of this project was to develop and test a set of uniform and reliable indicators that can be systematically used to document and monitor two Medicare home health care coverage criteria: the Homebound and the Medical Necessity criteria. The indicators will be linked to items from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) in a decision tree algorithm (or a logic model). Two decision algorithms will be developed for the two criteria. The algorithms will represent a major step toward helping providers, CMS, and the intermediaries in administering the home health benefit. Findings from the study show that the two OASIS algorithms successfully identify patients highly likely to meet the homebound and medical necessity criteria for medicare home health care. Using OASIS data alone, almost 90% of the 600 patients in the sample were classified as meeting the medical necessity criterion. The figure for the homebound criterion is lower (48.5%). It should be noted, however, that individuals may be clearly eligible for home care benefits even though they are not captured by the OASIS algorithms. Nurses who were experts in chart review, in fact, concluded that over half of the patients who were not captured by the homebound algorithm did meet the requirement based on a careful review of patients medical records.<br /><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/OASISfr.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/OASISfr.htm</a><br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Private Payers Serving Disabled Individuals and Research Synthesis on Managed Care for Persons with Disabilities</p>
<p>This study was undertaken in order to provide a better understanding of the role of private insurance plans in caring for people with chronic conditions and disabilities. It estimates the prevalence of chronic illness, analyzes the factors affecting the choice of indemnity plans versus managed care, and estimates the impact of managed care on service use and expenditures. The study also investigates the leading risk adjustment systems as a possible method for paying plans more appropriately in serving this population. The four major questions answered by this research are: (1) What is the prevalence of chronic illness and disability among the population enrolled in employer-based health insurance plans? (2) Are individuals with chronic illness more or less likely to choose managed care or indemnity plans, if given a choice? (3) What is the impact of health plan type on utilization and expenditures, taking into account differences in the populations that enroll in different types of insurance plans? (4) To what extent can risk-adjustment systems help employers and health plans predict expenditures of their chronically ill and disabled enrollees?<br /><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/privpay.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/privpay.htm</a><br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Screening and Assessment in TANF/Welfare-to-Work: Ten Important Questions TANF Agencies and Their Partners Should Consider</p>
<p>Changes to the welfare system brought about by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), carries serious implications for TANF recipients with disabilities and barriers to employment. There is general agreement among TANF agencies that larger proportions of clients with difficulties transitioning from welfare to work are the Hard-to-serve. Given the employment focus and time-limited nature of TANF, there is increased interest in screening and assessment approaches that can be used to identify these barriers to employment. The Department of Health and Human Services asked The Urban Institute to explore the issues and challenges related to screening and assessment within the TANF context. This paper identifies ten of the important questions that should be considered by TANF agencies and their partners as they develop approaches to screening and assessing for barriers to employment, such as substance abuse, mental illness, low basic skills, developmental disabilities, and domestic violence. The second phase of this study will consist of conducting case studies to explore how these issues are addressed in a select number of localities. The ten questions include, for example: How can the case management process aid in identifying unobserved barriers to employment? Who should conduct screening or assessment and when should it occur? What issues related to privacy and confidentiality should be considered?<br /><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/scrnasmt.pdf">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/scrnasmt.pdf</a><br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Understanding Medicaid Home and Community Services: A Primer</p>
<p>This Primer is designed to encourage use of the Medicaid program in a manner that minimizes reliance on institutions and maximizes community integration in a cost-effective manner. It describes the many options states have to use the Medicaid program to fund long-term care services and supports. Its intended audience is policymakers and others who wish to understand how Medicaid can be used--and is being used--to expand access to a broad range of home and community services and supports, and to promote consumer choice and control. In addition to comprehensive explanations of program features states can implement to achieve these goals, the Primer presents examples of state programs that have taken advantage of Medicaids flexibility to expand home and community services for people of all ages with disabilities. For every Medicaid service, states must answer two basic questions: (a) how to define medical necessity, and (b) how to manage overall utilization. Federal Medicaid law and policy, however, give states great latitude to offer individuals a wide range of home and community services through the states regular Medicaid program. States can offer a more comprehensive service range by operating one or several home and community based services waiver programs. The design of the Primer grew out of a series of discussions among federal officials, state policymakers, service providers, and advocates regarding how to make the document as useful as possible. Each chapter provides an annotated bibliography, with full information on how to obtain each publication. The report is designed to serve as a reference guide.<br /><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/primer.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/primer.htm</a><br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Teen Risk-Taking: A Statistical Portrait</p>
<p>This is the second of two projects that analyzed data from several major Departmental surveys of youth (the National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health, the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, and the National Survey of Adolescent Males) regarding the clustering or co-occurrence of youth risky behaviors. Both projects were conducted for ASPE by The Urban Institute. The first project produced three working papers that were synthesized into a single document entitled: Teen Risk-Taking: A Statistical Portrait which is available through the Urban Institute web site at <a href="http://www.urban.org">www.urban.org</a> (search by first author of the report - Laura Duberstein Lindberg). The second project produced four working papers that are available in the PIC. The objective of this research was to go beyond demographic data to identify vulnerability and protective factors related to profiles of risk which co-occur with health risk behaviors, such as alcohol use, binge drinking, cigarette use, sexual activity, marijuana use, other illicit drug use, fighting, and suicide. The sample includes 12, 578 students in grades 9 throught 12 from the National Longitudinal Study. Results indicate that profiles of risk are related to vulnerability and protective factors in the individual psychosocial adjustment, school, and family domains. Students in the lowest risk profiles reported consistently higher levels of protective factors and lower levels of vulnerability factors than students in any other risk profile. Students in profiles consisting of substance using, sexually active teens reported higher levels of protective factors and lower levels of vulnerability factors than both the highest risk profiles and the profiles distinguished by suicidal thoughts and behaviors.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Assessing Core Capacity for Infectious Diseases Surveillance</p>
<p>This project was designed to develop an investment plan to improve the nations core capacity for infectious diseases surveillance in light of recent changes. These challenges include the changing nature of biological threats--including bioterrorism and emerging infections--the rapid pace of technological development, and changes in the health care delivery system. The investment plan that evolved is based on an analysis of recent literature, interviews with over 50 experts in the field, and validation through direct observation of the capacity currently in place for surveillance in three locations across the country. The researchers present a three pronged strategy for improving core capacity for infectious disease surveillance. Each of the three prongs has two major components along with a package of specific activities that relate to each component. The priority investment areas are: 1) Improve State and Local Preparedness to Identify and Respond to Infectious Disease Threats. (2) Engage the Health Care Delivery System and the Public as Partners in Infectious Diseases Surveillance. (3) Enhance Public and Private Laboratory Support for Infectious Diseases Surveillance.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Assessing the Individual Health Insurance Market in the Post-HIPAA Era: A Review of the Literature</p>
<p>This paper reviews the available literature describing the individual health insurance market and the impact of state regulation on this market. By any measure, the individual health insurance market is much smaller than the group market. The number of people under age 65 who report individual coverage (about 16 million) is only about 10 percent as many as those who report employer group coverage (158 million). Despite its small size, the individual health insurance market plays an important role in a voluntary, private-public system of health insurance. For people without access to either employer coverage or public coverage, the individual market is their only source of insurance. Prices in this market are notoriously high. Administrative costs for individual coverage (measured as insurance loadings on medical benefits) are commonly a multiple of (according to one estimate, three times) those in the group market. The small size of the individual market allegedly makes it fragile. In light of the importance of the individual market to consumers who rely on it, its fragility is highly problematic. In addition, the cost of coverage in this market remains a principal problem. The study makes these recommendations: Potential areas for reform--guaranteed issue and some constraints on insurer products and pricing to ensure stability--may offer the most significant opportunities to assist consumers in the individual health insurance market. By guaranteeing access to coverage and making coverage more understandable, they would greatly improve consumers ability to compare insurance policies and prices.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Assessment Approaches to Evaluating Telemedicine Programs and Projects</p>
<p>The purpose of the study was to extend the 1996 Institute of Medicine framework for telemedicine evaluation as it applies to teleconsultations. The purpose of this study was not to evaluate telemedicine, but rather to identify the different kinds of issues on which telemedicine evaluations can focus, and the kinds of information that such evaluations can yield. This report is intended to guide evaluators and policy makers in selecting the questions that they want to answer regarding the value of telemedicine programs, and in designing evaluations that will best serve their interests and purposes. There are a number of major findings, including: 1) A fundamental consideration in evaluating a telemedicine application is specifying a minimum set of elements such as purpose, target audience, and the scope or focus of the evaluation; 2) Patient satisfaction with telemedicine has consistently been demonstrated to be high. As such, resources for future evaluations may be better allocated to areas of higher priority. 3) Lack of reimbursement for telemedicine services has been a significant confounder in past evaluations of telemedicine. Future evaluation efforts should seek to establish comparable reimbursement environments for telemedicine and the usual care comparators whenever differences in reimbursement might affect study results.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Construction of an Integrated Measure of the Burden of Disease: Final Report</p>
<p>This study examined one of the main challenges in measuring the burden of disease: the fact that the burden of disease has multiple components (medical costs, reduced quality of life, reduced longevity, productivity loss, etc). The report includes a review of relevant literature, some discussion of various empirical approaches to measuring trade-offs between the various components of the burden of disease within health systems, and consideration is given to the problem of comparing performance across health systems when the outcome has multiple components. The report sums up as follows: It seems critical to recognize that the observed relationship between the multiple components of healthcare outcomes, including cost, are a product of the interplay between production and consumer preference factors when considering the burden of disease. The entire relationship is of relevance when comparing the effectiveness of health systems, not just individual outcomes. Yet our ability to understand how this relationship is determined, in theory, and to appropriately estimate it in practice is limited. Because costs are jointly determined with other outcomes, estimation of cost regressions is not the right approach. Approaches that treat cost and other outcomes symmetrically yield different answers, but there are many such approaches and no clear criteria to select among them.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Decliners of Employer Based Health Insurance: An Analysis Using the National Health Interview Survey</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of workers who decline offers of health insurance coverage from their employers (decliners) and remain uninsured. Using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), this project focused on how decliners compare to other relevant employee groups (e.g., uninsured workers not offered health insurance coverage) and how the decliner population changed during the 1990s. In addition to comparing the usual socioeconomic variables (such as age, sex, etc.), this analysis looks at decliners health status, health conditions and utilization of health care services. According to the NHIS, both employer-based insurance (ESI) offer and take-up rates fell between 1993 and 1997, which appears to imply that decliners of ESI have become, and will continue to be, more important in the pool of the uninsured. Length of spells of uninsurance seem to be decreasing for those decliners without coverage and their spell lengths are significantly shorter than those of workers who are uninsured and have no ESI offer. Still, in 1997, 57 percent of uninsured decliners had been without coverage of any kind for at least a year. Over time, decliners appear to be getting somewhat older, and less likely to be married or to have children. Oddly, they also seem to be getting more highly educated. In terms of health status, the decliners fell between ESI takers and those not offered in terms of the probability that at least 1 person in their family was in fair or poor health, although the probability of a sick family member was decreasing over the time period studies. Interestingly, decliners were less likely than those not offered to have had a recent doctors visit, and more likely to have not had one in 3 or more years. Finally, decliners were substantially more likely than ESI takers to report problems related to mental health conditions.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Factors Influencing Effective Dissemination of Prevention Research Findings by DHHS: Final Report</p>
<p>Disease prevention and health promotion activities are receiving increased attention by the Department of Health and Human Services and its partners. This report addresses both primary and secondary prevention efforts. Primary prevention denotes interventions taken to prevent the development of a disease in individuals who do not have the disease in question. Secondary prevention denotes the identification of individuals who have developed a disease at an early stage in the diseases natural history, followed by early intervention to prevent mortality or complications of the disease. Four major tasks and deliverables of this project, including a literature review, discussions with technical advisors (personnel from federal government agencies involved in prevention) and dissemination partners (representatives of professional groups, foundations, and communications media partnering with federal agencies), case study reports, and an expert panel meeting, served as inputs into this report. HHS roles in prevention activities are described based upon these inputs. The report then identifies factors critical to processes for the effective translation of research findings into clinical and public health practice and into individual behaviors that promote health.</p>
<p>This research effort determined that to develop and advance its prevention initiative, HHS must consider demographic, social, economic, and technological trends, and anticipate how these will affect priorities for prevention research translation, dissemination, and intervention. Further, HHS must account for the effects of these trends on the identity, needs, and means for reaching at-risk populations and other target audiences for these initiatives. In order to increase the likelihood of success, HHS must look for potential partners in the federal government, state governments, and the private sector who can provide market access, financial support, and other complementary advantages. Finally, ongoing evaluation of these functions will enable continued improvement of each prevention initiative and building a growing knowledge base of what works to improve the processes and health outcomes of preventive services.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Americas Children: Key National Indicators of Well-Being 2001</p>
<p>This report was developed by the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics. It is the fifth annual synthesis of information on the status of the Nations most valuable resource, our children. This report presents 24 key indicators of the well-being of children. These indicators are monitored through official federal statistics covering childrens economic security, health, behavior and social environment, and education. The report also presents data on eight key contextual measures and includes two indicators as special features: asthma prevalence and youth employment. The 20 agencies of the Forum have also introduced improvements in the measurement of several of the indicators presented last year. The report is intended to stimulate discussions by policy-makers and the public, exchanges between the data and policy communities; and improvements in federal data on children and families.<br /><a href="http://www.childstats.gov/americaschildren/">http://www.childstats.gov/americaschildren/</a><br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Children and Welfare Reform: A Guide to Evaluating the Effects of State Welfare Policies on Children</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, policymakers and researchers have expressed a growing interest in understanding how and to what extent welfare policies affect childrens health, cognition, school achievement, and social and emotional development. The purpose of this guidebook is to share the results of a unique project designed to assist States in measuring child outcomes in the context of welfare reform programs. The Project on State-Level Child Outcomes consisted of representatives of State welfare agencies, federal government representatives, and researchers working together to identify an important set of child outcomes and ways to measure them. The project proceeded in two phases: The Planning Phase - the primary goal of this phase was the selection of a common design and a common set of family and child well-being outcomes that could be measured in state welfare evaluations. Several meetings were organized and facilitated by Child Trends, Inc. Twelve States participated in this phase (California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont, and Virginia). The second phase, The Operational Phase, began in the fall of 1997 and will continue for at least three years. Five States are participating in this phase (Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, and Minnesota). They are diverse in their welfare policies and programs, recipient populations, geography, and political climate. This guidebook condenses and integrates the materials, discussions, and products from each phase of the project to provide the tools needed to initiate or augment a study of child well-being in the context of welfare reform.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Evaluating Two Approaches to Case Management: Implementation, Participation Patterns, Costs, and Three-Year Impacts of the Columbus Welfare-to-Work Programs</p>
<p>This is the latest in a series of evaluations of 11 welfare-to-work programs in seven sites across the nation. This report presents results from Columbus (Franklin County), Ohio. Two case management approaches (traditional with two case workers, one for income maintenance, the other for employment and training) and integrated case management (one case manager for both income maintenance and employment-related issues) were evaluated. The report provides information on how the integrated and traditional programs were implemented, how they affected participation in employment-related activities, and the costs of providing employment-related services in the two programs. To facilitate this assessment, from 1992 to 1994 over 7,000 single-parent welfare applicants and recipients were randomly assigned for the evaluation. The key findings include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) Integrated case managers provided more personalized attention than traditional case managers and more closely monitored participation in program activities; 2) The integrated program engaged more people in welfare-to-work activities than the traditional program; 3) Both Columbus approaches increased earnings by about $1,000, or 10 percent, relative to the control group average; 4) Neither program increased sample members average combined income from earnings, cash assistance, and Food Stamps; and, 5) For sample members who did not have a high school diploma or GED when they entered the study, the integrated program produced larger earnings gains and welfare reductions than the traditional program.<br /><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/NEWWS/columbus01/index.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/NEWWS/columbus01/index.htm</a><br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Evaluation of Family Preservation and Reunification Programs: Interim Report</p>
<p>This is a report of an evaluation of programs intended to prevent the placement of children in foster care when it can be avoided. This report focuses on programs in three states, using a particular approach to family preservation, Homebuilders, thought by many to be the most promising approach. Homebuilders, a foster care placement prevention program developed in 1974 in Tacoma, Washington, calls for short-term, time-limited services provided to the entire family in the home. Key program characteristics include: contact with the family within 24 hours of the crisis, caseload sizes of one or two families per worker, service duration of four to six weeks, provision of both concrete services and counseling, and up to 20 hours of service per family per week. The programs evaluated were in Louisville, KY; seven counties in New Jersey; and Memphis, Tennessee. Did the study meet the goals of reducing foster care placement, maintaining the safety of children, and improving family functioning? No significant differences were found between the experimental and control groups on family level rates of placement, case closings, or subsequent maltreatment. It was also found that family preservation programs in two states resulted in higher assessments by clients of the extent to which goals have been accomplished and of overall improvement in their families' lives.<br /><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/hspyoung.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/hspyoung.htm</a><br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Providing Mental Health Services to TANF Recipients: Program Design Choices and Implementation Challenges in Four States</p>
<p>This report profiles the efforts of four States (Florida, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah) to address the mental health needs of welfare recipients. This study was designed (1) to identify and provide detailed information about the design and structure of mental health services developed by state and local welfare offices to address the mental health needs of welfare recipients, (2) to highlight service delivery options in designing and implementing these services, and (3) to discuss the key implementation challenges and lessons learned in providing mental health services to welfare recipients. The researchers visited one rural and one urban site in each state. The sites provided services in a variety of ways, and the research did not collect any evidence that suggests that one model for providing mental health services is better than any other. Rather, the project was designed to draw attention to the key design and implementation choices made by policymakers and managers in providing mental health services for welfare recipients.<br /><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/TANF-MH01/">http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/TANF-MH01/</a><br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Trends in the Well-Being of Americas Children and Youth 2000</p>
<p>This report presents the fifth edition of a collection of national estimates of child and youth well-being. Trends are presented from the 1970s through the 1990s. The report presents the most recent and reliable estimates on more than 80 indicators which have been organized into these five broad areas: 1) Population, family, and neighborhood; 2) Economic security; 3) Health conditions and health care; 4) Social development, behavioral health, and teen fertility; and 5) Education and achievement. Some sections of this report, mostly sections one and two, have been significantly revised since the 1999 edition of this report. Some indicators have been combined while others have been rewritten or replaced with new sources of data. A new indicator has been added on the number of births in the US, while several have been removed. The indicators that have been removed are: children as a percentage of the dependent population; long-term childhood poverty; effect of government cash and near-cash transfer programs on poverty among persons living in families with children under 18; long-term welfare dependence; parental labor force detachment; secure labor force attachment; and lead exposure.<br /><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/00trends/index.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/00trends/index.htm</a><br />

<p class="ReportTitle">EZ/EC Health Planning Capacity Survey</p>
<p>This study consisted of a survey of directors or acting directors in 141 Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities/EZ/ECs) during he summer of 2000. The survey asked about their interest in and capacity to engage in health improvement activities (defined as planned activities to address health issues) as well as their desires for technical assistance (TA) in this area. An 84% response rate was achieved. The survey findings are organized by five factors of EZ/EC health planning capacity and an additional section focusing on EZ/EC desires for technical assistance. The five factors are: 1) Interest and commitment to health - 88% reported interest in health issues, and 39% consider health issues among their top priorities. 2) Experience in various health improvement roles - Half of the respondents had participated in or had planned a health improvement activity during the past year. 3) Availability of expertise and data - Half reported they have access to regularly published information on local health statistics. (4) Existence and stability of local administrative structures and site advisory organizations - 89% of respondents have a general community advisory group and 5) Established relationships with community officials, business representatives, and health departments - 90% of respondents have business people they can call upon for advice, and 57% have conversed with business people about health issues. Regarding technical assistance, more than three-quarters of the respondents said they would use TA if offered for the participation of residents and community groups in EZ/EC-led activities. These responses show, according to the report, that many EZ/ECs already have the basic level of readiness to undertake and sustain successful health improvement efforts and to benefit from technical assistance.<br /><a href="http://www.phf.org/research.htm">http://www.phf.org/research.htm</a><br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Analysis of the Disability Supplement to the National Health Interview Survey</p>
<p>The disability supplement to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS-D) is the first comprehensive survey on disability in the United States. The survey is unique in that it focuses on several populations of persons with disabilities who are generally omitted or under-represented in national survey efforts: children, persons with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities and the working-age population. The goal of this project is to conduct a series of analyses and produce both short-term products and final reports that will inform ongoing Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) departmental and administrative research and policy initiatives. The analyses will address a specific set of questions in four topical areas using the NHIS-D: (1) welfare receipt and disability (including chronic illness); (2) disability and chronic illness among low income populations; (3) childhood disability and chronic illness; and (4) employment and disability.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Analyses of Residential Transition of Older Americans</p>
<p>There are four main questions to be addressed in this project: (1) How do characteristics (both individual and environmental) of elderly persons residing in institutional settings differ from those residing in community-based settings? (2) How do these characteristics vary over time? (3) Are there differences in these characteristics between subgroups of institutionalized and non-institutionalized elderly? (4) What is the relationship between selected individual and environmental factors and the transition of the elderly between community and institutional residential settings? Data from six years of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey will be used to answer these questions. Understanding residential transitions will help staff in the Department improve surveys that monitor acute health and long-term care use in different settings (e.g., the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey) and address outstanding long-term care policy issues (e.g., allocation of resources between community and institutional settings).<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Case Studies and Technical Assistance for Medicaid Buy-Ins for People with Disabilities</p>
<p>In an effort to encourage more States to provide Medicaid to working individuals with disabilities, and to give States additional options for providing Medicaid to those individuals, Congress permitted States to expand their Medicaid programs (through a Medicaid buy-in) and allow people with disabilities to continue to receive Medicaid services even if they return to work and have earnings greater than 100% of the Federal Poverty Level. The goals of this project are to: (1) examine the early implementation experiences of States that have opted for a Medicaid buy-in for people with disabilities, and (2) offer technical assistance to States on developing cost models, design features of a buy-in, as well as implementation and administration considerations for a buy-in. The project represents a unique opportunity to compare the design and implementation experiences of different States, and use the information gathered to inform both State and federal policy makers about strategies for improving systems that support the employment of people with disabilities.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Design Options for Modeling Policy Impacts on Working Age Adults and Children with Disabilities</p>
<p>The Department currently has a limited ability to model the impacts of alternative health, long-term care and employment related policies on the program participation of younger individuals with disabilities and public and private costs, both in the short and long run. For example, none of the current models were capable of generating estimates about the cost and impact of the Kennedy-Jeffords proposal to extend Medicaid and Medicare coverage to SSI and/or SSDI disabled adults who return to work. The purpose of this project is to develop preliminary design options for constructing a microsimulation model of children, working age adults and their families. Such a model would age a sample of persons over time, keeping track of changes in their disability status, income, education, living arrangement, program participation, employment, health insurance status, health and long-term care service use, including personal assistance services/equipment.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Evaluation of Practice in Care (EPIC)</p>
<p>From 1989 to 1992, there was a 210 percent increase in Medicare expenditures for home health services. This increase in utilization has generated policy interest in measures to control expenditures without compromising quality. Medicare home health has been the subject of considerable research, but the actual practice of home health care has not been extensively examined. This study will: (1) analyze episodes of care under the Medicare home health benefit, (2) assess the actual practice of care, (3) determine the extent to which there is variation in practice between acute and long-term care patients, and (4) uncover the factors accounting for that variation. The study will also examine decision-making processes between patients, providers and physicians. The events that take place during a visit and between visits as actual practice have never been measured. Furthermore, the function of decision-making by various parties has not been observed in actual practice. This effort to understand issues surrounding regional and practice variations of home health care delivery will aid the Department of Health and Human Services and the industry in combating fraud and abuse, as well as contribute valuable data to a future prospective payment system.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Long Term Care Microsimulation Model</p>
<p>The Long-Term Care Financing Model is a resource which has been extensively used by ASPE to project future long- term care utilization and expenditures and simulate various long-term care policy options. These include expansions of public financing, such as those proposed during health care reform, as well as changes to Medicaid and Medicare. The model has also been used extensively to study private sector policy options, such as the impact of further growth on private long-term care insurance and the impacts of changing trends in disability rates on long-term care use and expenditures. Recent data on disability rates, nursing home use, and home care use will be used to update existing portions of the model. In addition, the model will be expanded to include acute care use, thereby increasing the ability to simulate a wide range of policy options. ASPE will use this computer model for projections and a series of policy simulations which will be presented in reports. In addition to its previous long-term care policy uses, the revised model will enable ASPE to address acute care issues, such as the combined burden of acute and long-term care spending on the elderly. Since the model simulates the income and assets of the population, including pension and Social Security payments, the model will also be used to study other aging-related issues, such as the impact of changes in employer-sponsored health insurance for retirees.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Monitoring the Health Outcomes for Disabled Medicare Beneficiaries</p>
<p>The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 mandated major changes in home health payment requiring the implementation of a Prospective Payment System (PPS) by October 1999 (later delayed until October 2000) and an Interim Payment System (IPS) prior to the implementation of PPS. It also contained changes in eligibility and coverage for home health services. These changes, while intended to reduce Medicare home health costs, run the risk of reducing beneficiaries access to appropriate care and adversely affecting health outcomes, especially for beneficiaries needing the most care. Disabled Medicare beneficiaries are most vulnerable. The purpose of this project is to study the impact of recent payment policy changes on disabled Medicare beneficiaries satisfaction and quality of life with a view toward formulating inferences that will inform national home health care policy for the disabled. The study will build on a research project recently funded by the Home Care Research Initiative of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that examines the direct and indirect effects of the BBA changes. The main focus is to examine BBA impacts on Medicare beneficiaries access to care, costs, satisfaction, and quality of care.<br />

<p>The purpose of this project is to develop and test the effectiveness of a National Consortium and Resource Center (NCRC) to improve access to consumer responsive home and community-based long-term care for people with disabilities of all ages. The long range purpose of such a center would be to foster long-term care policies and practices. Barring a fundamental shift in public financing that few expect, the Medicaid program will continue to be the principal purchaser of public long-term care services well into the next century. Several factors offer new opportunities and pose new dilemmas for long-term care policy and program development in the 21st century. Clearly, consumers, policy makers, and providers are experiencing some tensions in their relationships as a result of several of the above factors.

<p class="ReportTitle">Personal Assistance Services Cash and Counseling Demonstration/Evaluation</p>
<p>This study will employ a classical experimental research design (i.e. random assignment of participants to treatment and control groups) to test the effects of cashing out Medicaid-funded personal assistance services for the disabled. The demonstration sites are located in Arkansas, New Jersey and Florida. Control group members will receive traditional benefits in the form of case-managed home and community-based services where payments for services are made to vendors. Treatment group members will receive a monthly cash payment in an amount roughly equal to the cash value of the services that they would have received under the traditional program. It is hypothesized that cash payments will foster greater client autonomy and that, as a result, consumer satisfaction (particularly among disabled persons under age 65) will be greater. It is also hypothesized that states will save Medicaid monies (mostly in administrative expenses) from cashing out benefits.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Preliminary Analysis of the 1988 MCBS Institutional Drug File</p>
<p>It is very important that ASPE be able to have a reliable source of drug utilization data for the elderly and disabled in long-term care facilities as well as in the community. The 1988 MCBS Cost and Use files are the most up-to-date, publicly available, person-level data available to address drug use and expense questions for community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries. However, these files contain no drug use data for facility residents (despite the fact that MCBS surveyors have collected this information since 1997). The objective of this task is to create a research-ready file of 1998 drug use data for facility respondents and link it to the 1998 Cost and Use file data on facility residents. We have selected the 1998 facility drug file for this task order in order to facilitate linking with the latest available MCBS Cost and Use files. This linked file will serve as the primary data source to address policy questions of interest to ASPE.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Research on Employment Supports for People with Disabilities</p>
<p>Employment rates for people with disabilities have remained low despite advances in legislation (especially the Americans with Disabilities Act), the availability of technology which can assist with everyday activities and work-related functions, and an increase in positive societal attitudes toward the integration of people with disabilities into mainstream social institutions. Only about 25 percent of people with significant disabilities between the ages of 16 and 64 are employed. Most of the policy research on the employment of people with disabilities has relied on statistical data from national surveys. Detailed information on individuals experiences was needed to augment the survey data. This project will fill that need as it will: (1) gather descriptive data about public and private sector employment programs, (2) examine successful employment supports, and (3) investigate the factors that affect the ability of people with significant disabilities to work. Focus groups, examining the supports important to people with disabilities who are competitively employed, will be conducted in three cities. Policy papers, summarizing the results of the focus groups, will be completed by March 2001. The topics of the policy papers will include: transitions to employment, supports for employment, role of health insurance, role of employers, and supports used by individuals with mental disabilities.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">The Contribution of Changes in Medication Use to Improvements in Functioning Among Older Adults</p>
<p>Drug treatment has become an increasingly important aspect of medical care for older Americans with approximately nine out of ten older Americans currently taking one or more prescription drugs daily. During the 1980s and early 1990s there have been major shifts in the classes of drugs prescribed for some of the more debilitating chronic conditions. For example, for arthritis, increased availability of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and, for women, estrogen replacement therapy may be associated with fewer debilitating effects. New classes of psychotropic agents have become available to treat depression and other psychiatric conditions, which have been identified as a major cause of premature disability among the elderly. Drug treatments for diabetes and hypertension have also expanded significantly during this period. This project supplements an existing National Institute on Aging grant to Vicki Freedman of the Philadelphia Geriatric Center. Under the grant Dr. Freedman is examining the role of changes in the use of medications in explaining aggregate changes in functioning in the U.S. population aged 51-61. The data sets for the analyses are the first (1992) and fourth (1998) waves of the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), which provide nationally representative cross-sections of the noninstitutionalized population in this age range.<br />

<p>ASPE is conducting a three-year, Congressionally mandated evaluation of the State Childrens Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The evaluation will provide an opportunity to learn how effective the variety of state programs created under Title XXI have been in reducing the number of uninsured, and also help Congress, DHHS, and the States to take stock of the programs first few years and provide information to guide future policies for childrens health insurance. Key topics to be examined through this evaluation include SCHIPs impact on uninsurance rates; reasons why states designed their SCHIP programs as they did; enrollment and disenrollment trends; reasons for disenrollment and non-participation; barriers to enrollment; the impact of cost-sharing on enrollment, retention, and utilization of services; effectiveness of outreach approaches; SCHIPs impact on access to care and enrollee satisfaction; and the relationships between SCHIP, Medicaid, and private coverage. The overall evaluation design includes both quantitative and qualitative research components, focusing on the experience of 10 States that represent a wide range of program designs and geographic regions.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Development and Validation of a Performance Measure Set for the Evaluation of Medicaid Services Rendered to People with Developmental Disabilities</p>
<p>Many public policies seek to influence the decisions employers make about whether and how to offer health benefits to their employees. The process of how employers make such decisions, however, is largely unknown. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation convened two panels of senior corporate managers to discuss how firms make decisions about health benefits. The purpose was to help the office formulate a more comprehensive view of employer decision-making by posing common questions to a cross-section of knowledgeable people, and to identify issues that may be empirically measured. The long-term goal is to be able to better determine how public policies affect or influence the decisions made by employers and unions regarding health coverage. The first meeting focused on the strategic trends and issues affecting employer health coverage, addressing such questions as, What is the role of the employer in shaping health care markets? The second meeting focused on the internal and operational issues of how employers make health benefit decisions, addressing such questions as: At what level of the corporate structure are health benefit decisions made?<br />

<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (OASPE) is supporting a time series study of the relationships between competition in hospital markets and the prices of hospital care, hospital revenues and hospital costs. The project began in the late 1980s and was extended in 1994 to investigate how health maintenance organization (HMO) enrollment affects changes in Medicare payments on behalf of beneficiaries. The project will collect time series data on California Hospitals (cost reports supplemented by a small survey on selective contracting by the hospital) to investigate whether competition continues to depress hospital prices, revenues and costs. In addition, several smaller projects are underway to investigate whether hospital mergers result in increased prices and a series of investigations (individual and county level) to determine if HMO enrollment leads to a decline in Medicare costs when other appropriate variables are held constant. California is particularly important in this study, because it tends to be a trend-setting State.<br />

<p>The purpose of this project is to investigate how States are monitoring and evaluating the experience of children with special health care needs enrolled in Medicaid Managed care. Research findings will be used to refine the standards CMS requires States to meet in order to enroll children with special health care needs into capitated Medicaid managed care plans, and to assess States ability to meet these standards. Policy makers are interested in addressing the issue of whether Medicaid plans and providers are meeting the complex needs of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) children, for example, but the lack of concrete data or information related to the experience of this population in Medicaid managed care hamper their efforts. In response, CMS has developed interim review criteria that will be applied to all upcoming 1915(b) waiver applications and renewals from States. The criteria establishes requirements regarding definition, identification, tracking, and access to care for children with special health care needs enrolled in capitated managed care arrangements. This study will help CMS and the States move forward with this important effort by providing critical information about current State activity and insights as to how these criteria can be refined, improved, and be put into operation.<br />

From this study, we expect to learn about the challenges of welfare reform in a context of high levels of unemployment and concentrated poverty. The Urban Change project brings together data from a wide array of sources: longitudinal administrative data for all families receiving AFDC/TANF or Food Stamps dating back to 1992, survey data, an implementation study, neighborhood indicators, an institutional study focusing on local service providers, and an ethnographic study of a limited number of families. The contractor hopes to be able to assess the effects of welfare reform on recipient experiences based on the administrative data using a multiple cohort comparison design. The study seeks to answer a broad array of questions, including: How do welfare recipients and other low-income residents fare in the new welfare environment in terms of both economic and non-economic indicators of well-being? What policies do State and local officials formulate, and how are these carried out by line staff in the welfare offices? How do the social and economic conditions of neighborhoods change over the time period before, during, and after implementation of welfare reform?<br />

In one approach, the human capital development approach, individuals were directed to avail themselves of education services and, to a lesser extent, occupational training before they sought work, under the theory that they would then be able to get better jobs and keep them longer. In the other approach, the labor force attachment approach, individuals were encouraged to gain quick entry into the labor market, even at low wages, under the theory that their work habits and skills would improve on the job and they would thereby be able to advance themselves. Sample members are being followed for five years from the time they entered the study.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">Welfare Outcomes Panel Study</p>
<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (OASPE) is conducting a panel study with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to evaluate the design of current, proposed and future studies of the effects of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996. This panel study will assist the department in: (1) reviewing existing research efforts on the effects of welfare reform; (2) examining the appropriate data sources, research designs and statistical methods for analyzing welfare reform outcomes; and (3) identifying research gaps and data needs for the continued study of welfare reform. Specific topics to be covered by the panel of experts include: (1) the appropriate outcome measures needed to effectively evaluate the outcomes of welfare reform; (2) the appropriate population of study; (3) the design and usefulness of existing national-level surveys (e.g., the Survey of Program Dynamics and the Survey of Income and Program Participation); (4) data needs for monitoring State and sub-state variation in outcomes; (5) potential uses and limitations of administrative data; and (6) integration of survey and administrative data. Over the course of the study, the NAS expert panel will address the above mentioned tasks through workshops, quarterly panel meetings and the publication of both an interim report and a final report. The interim report (see PIC # 7145.1) included early recommendations of the panel and the final report will document the comprehensive list of final recommendations to the department. The panel is also releasing an accompanying compilation of papers written for the panel study, entitled: Studies of Welfare Populations: Data Collection and Research Issues.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">State Telephone Survey Estimates for Evaluation and Monitoring</p>
<p>This project, funded by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) and carried out by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), develops and evaluates an integrated survey mechanism to collect broad State-based health and human services data. It also evaluates the quality and utility of State-level estimates developed from telephone surveys alone and in conjunction with, estimates obtained from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). A variety of health and human services data estimates for a selected number of States will be obtained through a telephone interview survey based on the NHIS questionnaire and selected supplemental data.<br />

<p class="ReportTitle">The Importance of Place</p>
<p>There is a growing body of research documenting the synergistic effect that the configuration of community resources, community values, population demographic, geography, and other factors have on health and human service outcomes. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation is funding the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to commission a series of papers to synthesize the available research on the relationship between these place-based factors and outcomes in the areas of health, child and youth development, and welfare reform. The papers will identify available data to assess these interactions and make recommendations for a future research agenda. NAS also will convene a workshop of researchers and policy makers from federal, state and local government, academic institutions and private organizations to reflect on the papers and develop and refine an integrated research agenda. The commissioned papers as well as a workshop summary which will include the research agenda will be available for dissemination.<br />
