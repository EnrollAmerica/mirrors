    <p>One of the main goals of the analyses of post-acute care episodes using the 2006 Medicare claims was to incorporate Medicare carrier claims (including Part B physician services, independent clinical labs, ambulance providers, and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers), DME, and hospice claims in order to learn more about complete composition of service use within an episode. <strong>Figures 3-8</strong> through <strong>3-16</strong> graphically display the composition of post-acute care episode payments for all beneficiaries using PAC services, as well as beneficiaries in DRGs 089 Simple Pneumonia &amp; Pleurisy and 544 Major Joint Replacement or Reattachment of Lower Extremity using PAC services. These charts demonstrate the proportion of total episode payments attributable to each type of service in a post-acute episode overall (<strong>Figures 3-8</strong>, <strong>3-11</strong> and <strong>3-14</strong>), and by APR-DRG severity of illness level (<strong>Figures 3-9</strong>, <strong>3-12</strong>, and <strong>3-15</strong>), and by MS-DRG severity level (<strong>Figures 3-10</strong>, <strong>3-13</strong>, and <strong>3-16</strong>). These figures allow us to compare episode composition for medical versus rehabilitation DRGs, to compare episode composition across severity levels (within APR-DRGs, and within MS-DRGs), and to compare episode composition within DRGs using the APR-DRG severity measures versus the MS-DRG severity measures.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3-8</strong> demonstrates the composition of Medicare payments for beneficiaries using post-acute care, across all diagnoses (N=109,236). Mean episode payments for all beneficiaries using PAC were $30,028. Medicare payments for index acute hospital admissions (34.3 percent) and SNF (17.9 percent) made up over half of Medicare payments for PAC episodes. Though per beneficiary payments are very high for beneficiaries using LTCH services, across all beneficiaries using PAC (including beneficiaries who use LTCH as well as beneficiaries who do not use LTCH), LTCH payments accounted for 3.7 percent of total Medicare payment for PAC services. In looking at the composition of payments for all PAC users by severity level as measured by APR-DRGs (<strong>Figure 3-9</strong>) and MS-DRGs (<strong>Figure 3-10</strong>) similar patterns in the distribution of payments emerge. Mean episode payments increase with increasing severity and the proportion of episode payments for LTCH services also increases with increasing severity. For example, in <strong>Figure 3-10</strong>, mean episode payments for MS-DRG No CCs were $26,609 and LTCH spending accounted for 3.7 percent of total spending for beneficiaries in this severity level. Mean episode payment for MS-DRG W/MCCs were $39,587 and LTCH payments accounted for 4.8 percent of total spending for beneficiaries in this severity level.</p>

<hr /><p>For beneficiaries pneumonia using PAC services (<strong>Figure 3-11</strong>), the services that made up the largest proportion of total episode payments were the index acute admission (25.2 percent) and the SNF claims (26.3 percent). These results are consistent with the high rates of utilization of SNF services for beneficiaries with pneumonia where over half of beneficiaries with pneumonia had a SNF claim in their post-acute episode and the length of stay in the SNF setting averaged 35 days (<strong>Table 3-14</strong>). For beneficiaries in the lowest severity levels (both APR-DRG 1 and MS-DRG No CCs), index acute hospital and SNF services accounted for more than 50.0 percent of total episode payments (<strong>Figure 3-12</strong> and <strong>Figure 3-13</strong>). The proportion of payments attributable to these services decreased with increasing severity as the use of other post-acute care services including Part B physician services and readmission to acute hospitals increased. Part B services increased as a proportion of total episode payments with increasing severity. For beneficiaries in APR-DRG severity levels 1 and 2, Part B services accounted for 11.0 percent of total episode payments compared with 13.0 percent for beneficiaries in APR-DRG severity levels 3 and 4. Similarly, the proportion of episode payments for Part B services increased from 10.1 percent to 13.9 percent from the lowest to highest MS-DRG severity levels. As expected, the proportion of payments attributable to HHA services decreased with increasing severity levels as these more medically complex beneficiaries are more likely to have treatment in inpatient settings. LTCH service use was very low for beneficiaries in DRG 089 (2.8 percent of payments overall), although for beneficiaries in this DRG with APR-DRG severity level 4, LTCH payments did account for 8.0 percent of Medicare payments. The proportion of payments for IRF services remained small across all levels of patient severity for beneficiaries in DRG 089 (2.4 percent of payments overall).</p>

<hr /><p>Several key differences between beneficiaries in DRG 089 Simple Pneumonia &amp; Pleurisy and DRG 544 Major Joint Replacement or Reattachment of Lower Extremity emerged in the analysis of episode composition. The proportion of total episode payments attributable to the index admission was significantly higher for beneficiaries in DRG 544 (43.9 percent overall) compared to DRG 089 (25.2 percent overall). One explanation for this is simply the nature of the care for beneficiaries in this DRG. Beneficiaries admitted to acute hospitals for DRG 544 are likely to undergo surgical procedures and therefore incur higher costs during the initial hospital stay. The proportion of episode payments for IRF services was also significantly higher for beneficiaries in DRG 544 (10.3 percent of payments overall) compared to beneficiaries in DRG 089 (2.4 percent of payments overall). As presented in section 3.5, approximately 20.0 percent of beneficiaries in DRG 544 had a claim for IRF services compared to less than 3.0 percent of beneficiaries in DRG 089. The proportion of episode payments for readmissions during post-acute episodes was lower for beneficiaries in DRG 544 (7.7 percent of payments overall) compared with beneficiaries in DRG 089 (20.1 percent of payments overall). Over 31.0 percent of beneficiaries in DRG 089 had an acute readmission in their PAC episode compared to 14.0 percent of beneficiaries in DRG 544 (<strong>Section 3.5</strong>). The differences in service use between the medical and rehabilitation DRGs are reflected in the proportion of total payments attributable to each service type. Overall, DME, hospice, and Therapy (including hospital outpatient therapy and therapy) account for very small proportions of total episode payments in both DRGs due to the lower payments associated with these services during episodes of PAC in comparison to the payments associated with inpatient service use.</p>
<p>Examining episode payments across all beneficiaries in a DRG and severity level, rather than payments by user of the service, is a helpful step in understanding the overall distribution of payments among beneficiaries with similar diagnoses and complexity. While the payments per service type, per user of services, presented in <strong>Section 3.5</strong> are also important to understand, the graphic representation of the proportions of total spending by service type in a DRG bring us a step closer to understanding the overall allocation of Medicare spending across services. These analyses may be helpful as we look to consider bundled payment options. The composition of episodes, the definition of episodes, and potential bundling options will be explored further in future work in 2008 and 2009.</p>

              <p>The pie charts in the previous section showing the distribution of payments for service use within episodes by service type indicate the significant role of physician services within episodes of PAC. The proportion of total episode payments accounted for by physician services varied only slightly across the medical DRG (DRG 089: Simple Pneumonia &amp; Pleurisy Age &gt;17) and the rehabilitative DRG (DRG: Major Joint Replacement or Reattachment of Lower Extremity) and also varied only slightly by severity level. In order to better understand the nature of physician service use, we examined the place of service associated with Part B physician claims using the Berenson-Eggers Type of Service (BETOS) codes on each of the Part B claims. The BETOS codes group HCPCS procedure codes into clinically meaningful categories.</p>
<p>We selected several BETOS categories to answer our questions of where these Part B physician services take place during post-acute episodes. These categories included office visits, hospital visits, nursing home visits, emergency room visits, home visits, inpatient consultations, and outpatient consultations. Note that the consultations were identified using HCPCS codes rather than BETOS codes because BETOS group inpatient and outpatient consultations into one category. <strong>Table 3-23</strong> shows the number and proportion of beneficiaries using PAC with each type of visit, the mean number of units and the mean payments associated with visits in each category. In our 2006 episode sample overall, 90.2 percent of beneficiaries had a physician visit in a hospital. Over 68.0 percent had an inpatient consultation, 60.0 percent had an emergency room visit, and 55.0 percent had an office visit sometime during the episode of PAC. The highest payments were associated with physician hospital visits (over $1,100). Though beneficiaries in our sample all had an index acute hospital stay initiating an episode of care, some physician visits related to the hospital service may not be in the counts in the table.<sup>14</sup> Note that over half of all beneficiaries had an office visit during their PAC episode indicating ongoing physician care subsequent to an acute hospitalization.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><div>The second two panels of the table allow for comparison of types of physician service use in a medical versus a rehabilitative DRG (DRG 089: Simple Pneumonia &amp; Pleurisy versus DRG 544: Major Joint Replacement or Reattachment of Lower Extremity). The following differences in service use are noted. A higher proportion of beneficiaries in DRG 089 had hospital visits and emergency room visits (97.8 percent and 74.0 percent) compared with beneficiaries in DRG 544 (70.7 percent and 23.7 percent). These descriptive tables provide a straightforward look at service use within episodes and serve as a starting point to think more about the role of physician services in episodes of care. For example, other interesting analyses to perform on the physician claims include identifying when during the PAC episode these services occur and what types of specialists the beneficiaries see.</div>
