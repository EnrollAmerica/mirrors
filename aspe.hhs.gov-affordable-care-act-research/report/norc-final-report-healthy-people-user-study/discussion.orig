    <p>The 2008 <em>Healthy People</em> User Study results enhance our understanding of the awareness and use of <em>Healthy People 2010</em>, provide information to aid in the development of strategies for improving the utility of <em>Healthy People</em> to state, local and tribal health organizations/agencies, and provide valuable feedback as HHS develops <em>Healthy People 2020</em>. In analyzing the key findings of this study, eight important conclusions were identified:</p>
<ol><li>Awareness and use of <em>Healthy People</em> has grown over time, but there continues to be a need for targeted efforts directed toward local and tribal health organizations.</li>
<li>The vast majority of <em>Healthy People 2010</em> users do not utilize the initiative as a guide for setting spending priorities at their organizations. Rather, spending priorities are determined by available funding mechanisms, which may not be aligned with <em>Healthy People</em> goals. Efforts to align <em>Healthy People</em> goals and funding resources for state, local, and tribal health organizations may help overcome this barrier.</li>
<li>User groups utilize <em>Healthy People</em> differently and for different purposes. These variations indicate that there may be opportunity for expanded use of the initiative as users learn of other users’ <em>Healthy People</em> activities. The variations also indicate there is a continued need for targeted outreach efforts to support expansion of <em>Healthy People </em>utilization<em>.</em></li>
<li>Barriers to use or increased use of <em>Healthy People</em> are primarily attributed to organizations/agencies, rather than the <em>Healthy People</em> initiative itself. This distinction may be useful when developing outreach efforts to encourage greater use of the initiative.</li>
<li>The absence of implementation guidelines is the leading barrier to use among non-users of <em>Health People</em>. The extent to which this is a barrier shows an important unmet need by the initiative.</li>
<li>In addition to outreach to tribal health organizations, MTAHB’s appear to be an effective avenue for communication with tribal health organizations.</li>
<li>Chronic Disease Directors have similar levels of awareness and use of <em>Healthy People</em> as HP Coordinators, indicating that Federal outreach to states is effective beyond HP Coordinators.</li>
<li>To further improve <em>Healthy People</em> and its usability, <em>Healthy People 2020</em> should include implementation guides and evidence-based practices, and HHS should increase communication with stakeholders to ensure users are aware of the spectrum of uses of <em>Healthy People</em> (rather than users continuing to use <em>Healthy People</em> only in the ways previously established by their organization/agency).</li>

          Awareness and Use of Healthy People 2010      </h4>

              <p>The results from the 2008 User Study indicate that <em>Healthy People 2010</em> is a highly visible initiative—with awareness of the initiative among responding organization/agencies increasing between 2005 and 2008. This increase appears to be due to a rise in awareness among local and tribal health organizations and may be related to the aforementioned focused outreach efforts undertaken by HHS and its partners since the 2005 study. Degree of use among those aware of the initiative also increased from 71 percent in 2005 to 77 percent in 2008. Although tribal and local health organizations continue to be less likely to use the initiative than states, there have been gains in use among the local health organizations. These results suggest that recent efforts on the part of HHS to target outreach to local groups and to disseminate implementation tools have been effective in encouraging local usage of <em>Healthy People 2010</em>. The gains in awareness and use seen by local and tribal health organizations may also be related to concurrent work by these organizations/agencies to develop their capacity to implement programs that cross specific disease and behavior areas like <em>Healthy People 2010</em> does. In fact, tribal health organizations were substantially more likely than the other sample types to report that <em>Healthy People 2010</em> resulted in the development of new programs and the expansion of existing programs. HHS should continue its focused outreach and dissemination efforts to these groups.</p>
<p>Specific uses of <em>Healthy People 2010</em>remained largely unchanged between 2005 and 2008. The 2008 results continue to show that the percentage of respondents reporting that they use the initiative as a guide to set spending priorities is low. This finding identifies a potential barrier to the initiative’s effectiveness since it may not be reasonable to expect that organizations/agencies will achieve outcomes related to the <em>Healthy People 2010</em> objectives if they are not using the initiative to direct funding within their organization/agency. In a follow-up discussion with a HP Coordinator who does not use <em>Healthy People 2010</em>, the respondent explained “Since the health department receives 80 percent of funding from grants or reimbursement, we’re driven by funding agencies, so basically we do whatever we’re told to do based on funding. So everything goes back to funding. When staff applies for funding, they don’t go to <em>Healthy People 2010</em>, they go to documents from the funding agencies and submit a grant application that is built on the needs of the funding agencies.” This HP Coordinator’s experience is consistent with the reality that external funding availability may drive priorities for programming, rather than the overall priorities of <em>Healthy People 2010</em>. If the priorities of the funding organizations are not consistent with <em>Healthy People 2010 goals</em>, there may be an impediment to meeting the goals and objectives of <em>Healthy People 2010</em>.</p>

          Awareness and Use Across Respondent Group      </h4>
    </a>
    
      <ul class="collapsibleChild level5" id="ajax-target-node-182486">

              <p>In the 2008 User Study input from tribal health organizations was expanded to include a larger number and a greater mix of tribal health organizations, thus increasing the precision and reliability of the 2008 findings for this sample type. Tribal health organizations indicated a higher rate of awareness of <em>Healthy People 2010</em> in 2008 than in 2005. However, this awareness did not translate into increased use of the initiative. This suggests that the aforementioned HHS outreach efforts were successful in increasing knowledge about the initiative but there remains a need for resources and tools to help translate this knowledge into action among this target audience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, responses from the tribal health organization sample indicated that the 2005 conclusion that tribes use <em>Healthy People</em> in a manner uniquely to that of state and local organizations/agencies was affirmed. Tribal health organizations cited the overarching goals as the most useful aspect of the initiative; an aspect the other respondent types considered the <em>second</em> most useful. Tribal health organizations were also the only respondent type for which <em>Healthy People 2010</em> has resulted in the development of new programs and expansion of existing programs <em>for a majority</em> of the respondents, and were more likely than the other respondent types to report that they plan programs intentionally around the <em>Healthy People 2010</em> objectives. Additionally, tribal health organizations reported the highest degree of relevance between the <em>Healthy People 2010</em> objectives and the organization’s work.</p>
<p>These findings are particularly interesting for two reasons. First, they confirm that tribal health organization users experience <em>Healthy People</em> in a different way than state and local organizations/agencies. Recognizing this unique use of <em>Healthy People</em> may enable HHS to better respond to the needs of tribal health organizations. Tribal health organizations may be a constituent group that is very ready to use <em>Healthy People</em> but, they also need more targeted assistance for developing and executing implementation plans, identifying what data sources are available to them, and determining how the existing <em>Healthy People</em> objectives can be made applicable to their organization/agency.</p>
<p>Second, the results suggest that state and local health organizations use <em>Healthy People</em> in a way that builds on previous, established efforts. This is an important note for the implementation of <em>Healthy People 2020</em>, as HHS may need to consider implementation campaigns that will inform users of new ways of incorporating <em>Healthy People</em> into their work, rather than having users rely only on their previous experiences with <em>Healthy People</em>. For example, in a follow-up discussion, one local user of <em>Healthy People 2010</em> stated, “You have to take the book for what it is. It gives baselines, tells you where you need to be and where you are in comparison.” Like many state and local users, this respondent’s organization/agency has been utilizing <em>Healthy People 2010</em> as a benchmarking tool, with less utilization for program planning or expansion.</p>
<p>The results gathered from the tribal health organizations were instrumental in providing information on the unique tribal health organization uses of <em>Healthy People</em>, however additional insights on the tribal health community’s relationship with <em>Healthy People</em> was gathered from the responses provided by MTAHB. More than three-quarters of these MTAHB were aware of <em>Healthy People 2010</em>and, as was true for state organizations, 100 percent of the MTAHB that were aware of <em>Healthy People 2010</em> reported use. This high degree of usage suggests that MATHB may be viable networks through which to disseminate information and increase use of <em>Healthy People 2010</em> among tribal groups. This finding validates IHS’s conclusion that these boards may be a useful mechanism for working and communicating with tribal health organizations.</p>
<p>Follow-up discussions with MTAHB as well as with tribal health organizations provided additional information on how the two sample types interact and how <em>Healthy People</em> can better meet the needs of tribal health organizations. In conducting discussions with one MTAHB that does use <em>Healthy People 2010, </em>and one that is not aware of the initiative, we found that the MTAHB’s role in tribal health varies depending on the board’s and tribe’s structures. The MTAHB using <em>Healthy People 2010</em> was highly involved in the tribes’ health program planning and implementation. The respondent explained that the MTAHB “works with tribes to: do community assessments and needs assessments, locate resources, funds, and training opportunities, and implement programs in each local community. [The MTAHB] provides overall coordination and management, as well as technical assistance - taking on the administration load, and letting tribes go to work.” In contrast the MTAHB unaware of <em>Healthy People 2010</em> explained that each tribe conducts its own health programs, and the board serves as more broad oversight. This variation in roles indicates that outreach to tribal health organizations can be complex, but communication to MTAHBs can be vital for reaching them.</p>
<p>The 2008 User Study was also expanded to include a second state sample, Chronic Disease Directors. Though not directly involved with <em>Healthy People</em> this is a position within the state agency that is likely to be impacted by <em>Healthy People</em> goals. The results of the study indicate that information regarding the <em>Healthy People</em> initiative is in fact getting to these individuals—with 98 percent of them reporting awareness of the initiative and 100 percent of those who were aware reporting use. Perhaps not surprising, the responses for the Chronic Disease Directors did not substantially differ from HP Coordinators on any question. These results suggest that knowledge of the initiative is organization-based, not role-based at the state level. Given the similarity of their user profile future studies of <em>Healthy People</em> use may eliminate the Chronic Disease Director sample for reasons of cost.</p>
<p>Finally, the results of the current study can be helpful to policymakers in clarifying which aspects of the <em>Healthy People </em>initiative are most useful to various constituent groups. Specific aspects of <em>Healthy People 2010</em> considered <em>most useful</em> varied by respondent type. HP Coordinators and Chronic Disease Directors cited that the most useful aspect of the initiative was its identification of specific health objectives. MTAHB reported leading health indicators as most useful, and tribal health organizations cited overarching goals as most useful. Local health organizations further differed from the other respondent types by indicating that the leading health indicators and data resources were the most useful aspects of <em>Healthy People 2010</em>. These results suggest a call for a variety of outreach and support efforts, while also emphasizing the diverse needs of users, to be met by <em>Healthy People 2020</em>.</p>

          Barriers to Use      </h4>
    </a>
    
      <ul class="collapsibleChild level5" id="ajax-target-node-182491">

              <p>In both 2005 and 2008, users of <em>Healthy People 2010</em>were most likely to cite barriers related to their organization/agency as opposed to barriers related to <em>Healthy People 2010</em>when asked about issues preventing their organizations/agencies from using <em>Healthy People 2010</em> more. These findings are not surprising, but are very important to note when considering the difficulties encountered by <em>Healthy People</em> audiences and the appropriate mechanisms for addressing these difficulties. One mechanism by which HHS could increase familiarity and use of the <em>Healthy People</em> initiative is by funding micro grants directed towards <em>Healthy People 2010</em> use, as they have in the past. In the event that providing direct funding to these organizations/agencies may not be an option for HHS, another suggestion is for HHS to use its resources and influence to increase exposure of the <em>Healthy People</em> initiative to other potential funders and key stakeholders including state legislatures. For barriers related to the initiative itself, the most commonly reported barrier for users overall was lack of data to track objectives. Future research could seek to gather information on particular focus areas and/or objectives where more data is needed. This information could then be used to aid in the identification of the health objectives (sub-objectives and developmental objectives) and data sources to be included in <em>Healthy People 2020</em>.</p>
<p>As in 2005, non-users of the initiative were comprised almost entirely of local and tribal health organizations. Specific reasons for non use mirror the barriers faced by users of the initiative—organization/agency issues such as limited resources in terms of staffing and funding, and competing priorities continue to top the list, though at notably lower levels than in the 2005 User Assessment. However, unlike the findings of the 2005 User Assessment, a lack of implementation guidance and the amount of materials (too much material) also received a large response from non-users in the 2008 User Study. These barriers are directly related to <em>Healthy People</em> and should be considered when assessing areas of improvement to target for the next iteration. Non-users and users alike would benefit from increased technical assistance focused on translation and comprehension of the materials. Also, it may be helpful for HHS to develop and disseminate more implementation and data collection tools that could be used to help organizations/agencies utilize the initiative. The anticipated usefulness of these types of tools and guides were highlighted in a number of follow-up discussions. One <em>Healthy People 2010</em> local user said “If there is a way to include a section in each topic area on some best practices for implementation that would be wonderful. It would be helpful without costing us anything.” Another local user asked for the inclusion of real examples, saying it is “always useful to see what others do, even though we will have to morph it to fit our community. But it would be an opportunity to see other creative thinking, and an opportunity to provide information on things we have done well.”</p>

          Implications for Healthy People 2020      </h4>
    </a>
    
      <ul class="collapsibleChild level5" id="ajax-target-node-182496">
        
                      <li class="chapter_content without_highlight">
              <p>The findings contained within this report are useful in informing the assessment, development, and implementation of <em>Healthy People 2020.</em> The variations in use reported above parallel the distinct and competing opinions regarding the organization of <em>Healthy People</em> and the number of focus areas and objectives that should be included in <em>Healthy People 2020</em>. In sum, there is no clear consensus from <em>Healthy People </em>2010 users about how to organize <em>Healthy People 2020</em>, or how many areas to include within any organizational format. These findings mirror discussions that have occurred in the <em>Healthy People</em> <em>2020</em> Federal Interagency Workgroup, the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Objective for 2020, and across the regional meetings hosted by ODPHP in 2008.</p>
<p>Together these findings and discussions suggest that <em>Healthy People</em> is utilized by different people in different ways, and these differences make aspects of the initiative more or less useful depending on the audience. To serve the various needs of different stakeholder groups, <em>Healthy People 2020</em> should be a dynamic initiative that enables users to continue having access to the aspects of the initiative that help them support movement towards meeting the national health goals. This conclusion supports the decision to develop <em>Healthy People 2020</em> using a two-pronged approach which addresses risk factors and determinants of health, as well as specific conditions/disease areas. The results additionally support the development of a web-based format for <em>Healthy People 2020</em>, which will enable users to more easily link objectives, and connect to implementation strategies and evidence-based practices.</p>
<p>To further improve the <em>Healthy People</em> initiative, users would benefit from the inclusion of implementation guides and evidence-based practices and interventions. The addition of these materials would provide users with information to help their resources stretch further, while expanding the use of programs, policies, and interventions shown to be effective. The need for these materials is conveyed in the previously described requests by local users. The need for evidence-based practices and implementation guides was also made apparent by one user at the state level who explained, “An evaluation component is missing from <em>Healthy People 2010</em>. Planning is not evidence based. There are initiatives out right now to evaluate planning. Value would be added if certain components of planning could be evaluated with evidence based science. There has been discussion for a web site with evidence based interventions to go with objectives. There should be a component of <em>Healthy People</em> objectives with proven effective interventions. Such a link to the interventions to meet the goals would be a big help.”</p>
<p>Finally, increased and more efficient communication between HHS and <em>Healthy People</em> stakeholders could provide users with a more complete understanding of <em>Healthy People</em> and the tools it provides. From the follow-up discussions we found very little engagement in the development process for <em>Healthy People 2020</em>, even among the users of <em>Healthy People 2010</em>. Of the ten discussions that took place, only two spoke of participation in the <em>Healthy People 2020</em> process, one of which was minimal (periodic notices through APHA). While this could be a call for increased communication and outreach efforts, HHS should be heartened to know that many of the changes they are pursuing for <em>Healthy People 2020 </em>are highly sought by the initiative’s key audiences. The MTAHB user explained “we find ourselves drawn more and more to environmental issues. We really like the Social Ecological Models. We talk about determinants of health, so I think everybody would like to see a broader emphasis that way.” A local user stated that “the whole emphasis on social determinants of health is really taking off in our community. People are really starting to see connections, and anything 2020 can do to support that would be great.” Additionally, a local non-user of <em>Healthy People 2010</em> requested a disaster preparation and management area of focus, to support his organization/agency’s work in that area. HHS is already working to include, and even emphasize these areas in <em>Healthy People 2020</em>, though more outreach may be needed to inform key audiences of these updates.</p>
<p>The study results indicate the importance of building on past <em>Healthy People</em> iterations and demonstrate that within all organization/agency types, both users and non-users have an interest and a willingness to work with HHS to bring about even greater implementation of the <em>Healthy People 2010 </em>and <em>Healthy People 2020</em> initiatives.</p>

              <p>Given the important timing of this study in terms of the release of <em>Healthy People 2020</em>, several follow-up studies and dissemination activities should be considered.</p>
<ol><li><em>Targeted assessment of prior outreach efforts. </em>Following the 2005 User Assessment, HHS engaged in outreach activities to encourage broader involvement with the <em>Healthy People</em> initiative. Targeted assessment of those outreach efforts using qualitative data collection such as discussions with regional health administrators and participating organizations would help determine how well those efforts were experienced by the key stakeholders. Such information could be useful for planning outreach activities in support of <em>Healthy People 2020</em>.</li>
<li><em>Repeat the User Study early in the next decade</em>. Planning for <em>Healthy People 2020</em> has utilized a more inclusive approach than past iterations. Users may be more aware of the process and engaged in the final product. Further, the development activities emphasize the importance of implementation activities to motivating the nation. Repeating the User Study early in the decade will provide valuable insight into how the new initiative is perceived by key stakeholders and assess whether newly developed implementation tools are reaching end users. By conducting it early in the decade, a new User Study will facilitate refinement of the implementation activities. Lessons learned regarding the methodology and scope of the 2008 User Study can be found in Appendix 2.</li>
<li><em>Dissemination of the findings from the 2008 User Study</em>. The results of the 2008 User Study indicate broad support for <em>Healthy People</em> among key target audiences, and continued growth in terms of the breadth and depth of how <em>Healthy People</em> is used. HHS should celebrate the success of this important initiative. Further, the opinions and suggestions for the format and scope of <em>Healthy People 2020 </em>parallel many ideas being put into process by HHS. While the 2008 User Study was not developed to assess stakeholders’ views on decisions for <em>Healthy People 2020,</em> the results indicate that <em>Healthy People 2020</em> will be improved in ways important to key stakeholders. This finding should be explored for further dissemination as another avenue for engaging stakeholders and emphasizing their importance to the <em>Healthy People</em> initiative and its development.</li>
