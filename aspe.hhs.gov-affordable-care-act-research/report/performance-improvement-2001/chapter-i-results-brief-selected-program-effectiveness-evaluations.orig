<p><b>ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE </b></p>
<p><i><b>The National Health Service Corps</b> </i></p>
<p>The evaluation of the effectiveness of the National Health Service Corps 		(NHSC) focused on mechanisms for training and recruiting providers, placement 		in underserved areas, and retainment in primary care and related professions. 		The findings showed that NHSC:</p>
<ul><li> needs to focus more sharply on the loan repayment program to meet 		  the needs of underserved populations, based on findings that the loan repayment 		  program has greater impact in achieving NHSC objectives.</li>
<li> achieves better outcomes in rural communities, because they may 		  enable young clinicians to make relatively important contributions in a short 		  period, enhancing their professional gratification.</li>
<li> should strategically manage the mix of health professionals it 		  supports in response to both community requirements and NHSC health service 		  delivery objectives.</li>
</ul><p>The study concluded that underserved areas continue to need NHSC 		placements if they are to provide basic health care to a growing and diverse 		population. NHSC helps extend and expand access to basic health care services 		and improves the health care delivery system in underserved communities.</p>

<p><i><b>Evaluation of Written Prescription Information Provided in 		Community Pharmacies: An 8-State Study </b></i></p>
<p>This evaluation assessed the quality of written prescription information 		provided voluntarily to individuals receiving new prescription medicines in 		community pharmacies. The study tested whether fictitious patients as observers 		were given any written prescription information by pharmacists whom they asked 		for drugs prescribed (in addition to the labels and stickers on their 		medication containers). The quality of written information was also assessed. 		This pilot study produced encouraging results for consumers:</p>
<ul><li> nearly 87% of new prescriptions were dispensed with some written 		  prescription information in addition to the label and stickers on the 		  medication container, suggesting that the provision of written prescription 		  information is becoming a routine practice in community pharmacies.</li>
<li> expert panelists found that most written information sheets were 		  accurate and unbiased in content and tone. They included necessary details for 		  monitoring and interpreting adverse reactions and appeared legible and 		  comprehensible to consumers.</li>
</ul><p>The study raised several concerns: most patient information was rated 		low on identifying precautions, their significance, and how to avoid them, and 		storage instructions and general information. The study will be repeated 		nationally in 2001 and the results will be used to identify areas for 		improvement in consumer communication of prescription information.</p>

<p><i><b>FY 2000 Performance Report to Congress for the Prescription Drug 		User Fee Act of 1992</b> </i></p>
<p>The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) authorized FDA to collect 		fees from companies that produce human drug and biological products. The PDUFA 		annual performance report to Congress for FY 2000 focuses on the Agency's 		performance toward the agreed-upon numeric goals for reviewing and acting on 		submissions and responding to sponsors' pre-submission requests. The major 		accomplishments to report are:</p>
<ul><li> FDA continued to exceed nearly all the review performance goals in 		  FY 2000increasing numbers of applications filed; higher quality 		  applications; quicker approvals for products with the requisite data; and 		  outcomes that result in more quality products reaching American practitioners 		  and consumers faster.</li>
<li> application filings and quality remain high by historic standards 		  and approval times continue to drop;</li>
<li> compared to the approval rates for all new drug applications, there 		  is a smaller increase in approval rates for new molecular entities (NMEs), 		  unique new drugs that are approved for the first time by FDA.</li>
<li> median total approval time (i.e., time from the initial submission 		  of a marketing application to the issuance of an approval letter) for priority 		  applications submitted in FY 99 was 6 months, less than half the median 		  approval times for priority applications submitted in the early PDUFA 		  years.</li>
</ul><p>The FDA performance report states that since the passage of PDUFA there 		has been a shift in the pattern of NME introductions with more American 		patients now receiving the benefits of important new drugs before they are 		available to citizens of other countries. This shift requires that FDA be 		increasingly vigilant in its post-market surveillance efforts.</p>

<p><i><b>Infant Immunization with Acellular Pertussis Vaccines in the US: 		Assessment of the First Two Years Data from the Vaccine Adverse Events 		Reporting System (VAERS)</b> </i></p>
<p>The evaluation objective was to assess the safety of infant immunization 		with acellular pertussis vaccines in the United States. In 1996, the FDA 		approved the first acellular pertussis vaccine for use in infants in the United 		States. The study examined adverse events in the US after infant immunization 		with pertussis-containing vaccines, using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting 		System (VAERS), a national surveillance system. The overall findings showed 		that:</p>
<ul><li> the annual number of reported events categorized as nonfatal serious 		  (defined as events involving initial hospitalization, prolongation of 		  hospitalization, life-threatening illness, or permanent disability) to VAERS 		  for all pertussis-containing vaccines declined between 1995 and 1998.</li>
<li> the annual number of less serious reports to VAERS for 		  pertussis-containing vaccines also declined.</li>
<li> this evaluation did not identify any new safety concerns of the 		  vaccine based on an analysis of VAERS data for acellular pertussis vaccines, 		  with regards to adverse events identified in a 1991 Institute of Medicine 		  report on the safety of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine.</li>
</ul><p>The study findings support the safety of marketed acellular pertussis 		vaccines. In addition, the VAERS data, although subject to the limitations of 		passive surveillance, support the prelicensure data with regard to the safety 		of the US-licensed acellular pertussis vaccines evaluated in this study.</p>

<p><i><b>Consumer Attitudes Toward Potential Changes in Food Standards of 		Identity</b> </i></p>
<p>As part of the 1995<i>Regulatory Reinvention Initiative</i>, FDA 		evaluated federal food standards of identity regulations (intended to assist 		consumers with the identity, quality, and fill of containers for standardized 		foods) to guide policy decisions about which standards should be retained, 		revised, or revoked. Consumer attitude data toward standards of identity 		regulations, collected in eight focus group discussions with household grocery 		shoppers, were analyzed. The principal findings showed that the focus group 		participants:</p>
<ul><li> those who think standards are bad believe that truth-in-labeling 		  laws are adequate protection for consumers;</li>
<li> supported standards in a philosophical sense;</li>
<li> did not think their choices were being unduly restricted by 		  standards;</li>
<li> had concerns about the time it takes them to find products they like 		  in the grocery store than about a lack of product choice.</li>
</ul><p>Overall, the focus group participants were wary of trying to draw 		generalizations about when standards would be bad, and instead, they felt that 		evaluating and revising standards could only be done on a case-by-case basis. 		Furthermore, participants felt that FDA should get input from consumers about 		standards and not rely on industry.</p>

<p><i><b>Status of Nutrition Labeling, Health Claims, and Nutrient Context 		Claims on Processed Foods - 1997 Food Label and Package Survey (FLAPS)</b> 		</i></p>
<p>This evaluation study analyzed data to determine the status of food 		labels three years after nutrition labeling rules were implemented in 1994. FDA 		conducted the 1997 Food Labels and Package Survey (FLAPS) as an ongoing effort 		to monitor the food industrys response to the food labeling regulations. 		FLAPS allows FDA to characterize various aspects of the labeling of processed, 		packaged food products, including the prevalence and accuracy of nutrition 		labeling, health claims, and nutrient content claims. Product classes 		representing 80 percent of the sales in each of 58 product groups were included 		in the sample. From each product class, FDA selected the 3 top- selling product 		brans and randomly selected follower brands. Based on label information from a 		final sample of 1,267 food products and weighting by food market data, FDA 		determined the percentage of products sold that bear<i>Nutrition Fact</i> 		labels, health claims, and nutrient content claims. The major findings of the 		survey were that:</p>
<ul><li> Nutrition-labeled products accounted for an estimated 96.5 percent 		  of the annual sales of processed, packaged foods.</li>
<li> An additional 3.4 percent of products sold were exempt from labeling 		  regulations.</li>
<li> Nutrient content claims and health claims appeared on a estimated 39 		  percent, and 4 percent respectfully, of the products sold.</li>
</ul><p>The 1997 FLAPS collected sufficient product label information to 		estimate the prevalence of nutrition labels for most processed, packaged foods 		in the US. Although regulation for nutrition labeling have changed since the 		surveys start in 1976, the FLAPS data collected allow for analysis of 		consistent patterns and trends in food labeling practices.</p>

<p>The<i>National Vital Statistics System</i> is the Nations capacity 		to collect data maintain statistics on birth, deaths, fetal deaths, marriages, 		and divorces. These data come from State vital registration systems where 		standardize certificates are filed. The evaluation purpose was to assess 		current certificates for usefulness and quality for statistical and legal 		purposes; identify unmet data needs and determine whether the standard 		certificates should be changed; make recommendations for a standard vital 		statistics data base. Based on survey data from State vital registration and 		statistics executives and representative national health organizations and the 		work of an expert panel, the study found that: </p>
<ul><li> substantial changes were needed for the standard birth certificate, 		  particularly the medical portion;</li>
<li> additional data items are needed on the mothers health which 		  could linked to other health data sources;</li>
<li> changes are recommended for the standard certificates on death and 		  fetal deaths to include data items that could permit linkages to other health 		  data systems and would improve the quality of cause-of-death 		  data.</li>

<p><i><b>Evaluation of Effectiveness of Group B Streptococcal Disease 		Prevention Guidelines</b> </i></p>
<p>Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of bacterial infection 		in newborns in the United States. To address the problem CDC developed 		prevention guidelines in collaboration with the American College of 		Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Academy of Pediatrics 		(AAP) and published the guidelines in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 		in 1996. This evaluation assessed the management of GBS disease in the United 		States, looking at the extent to which the guidelines were followed and factors 		associated with poor compliance. Results showed that:</p>
<ul><li> implementation of the new GBS prevention guidelines was successful 		  at the test site (Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound) and was accomplished 		  in a short time period;</li>
<li> more complete compliance with GBS guidelines helped to improve 		  clinical outcomes for mothers with GBS infections; and</li>
<li> a cost benefit analysis showed that the costs of delivering 		  antibiotics is minimal compared with the potential health and economic benefits 		  from reduced infant mortality.</li>
</ul><p>This population-based evaluation is a good example of collaboration 		between managed care organizations and public health agencies to determine the 		impact of national disease prevention guidelines on health care providers.</p>

<p><i><b>Evaluation of National Center for Injury Prevention and Control 		(NCIPC) Injury Control Recommendations for Bicycle Helmets</b></i></p>
<p>In 1995, NCIPC published recommendations on the use of bicycle helmets 		in preventing head injuries, including information on the magnitude of related 		head injuries, potential impact of increased helmet use, helmet standards and 		crash performance, barriers to increased helmet use by the public, and 		approaches to increase community-level bicycle helmet use. The evaluation 		purpose was to measure effective use of the recommendations by NCIPCs 		injury prevention constituents (state and local health officials and national 		bicycle safety advocate organizations) and access the process of developing the 		recommendations. The studys survey of constituents showed that:</p>
<ul><li> ninety percent of respondents found the recommendations useful for 		  their efforts to increase bicycle helmet use, such as directing a bicycle 		  helmet promotion program, advocating for a injury prevention program, and 		  disseminating information to other injury prevention constituents; and</li>
<li> eighty percent of respondents said that CDC should develop 		  additional recommendations to address prevention service problems.</li>
</ul><p>The evaluative survey results on bicycle helmets have helped CDC to 		improve the development and dissemination of injury control recommendations. 		</p>

<p><i><b>Effect of Healthy Start on Infant Mortality and Birth 		Outcomes</b></i></p>
<p>The<i>Healthy Start</i> program was launched in 1991 by the Health 		Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the U.S. Public Health Service 		to demonstrate innovative ways to reduce infant mortality in some of the areas 		with the highest infant mortality rates in the country. Strategies used in the 		selected fifteen high-risk communities included outreach, case management, 		public information campaigns, support services, health education, and enhanced 		clinical services. Thirteen of the fifteen sites were urban. This evaluation 		analyzed the effects of<i>Healthy Start</i> on pregnancy- related outcomes by 		comparing the original fifteen<i>Healthy Start</i> sites with comparison 		communities from 1991 thorough 1996. Infant mortality related outcomes  		prenatal care utilization, pre-term birth rate, incidence of low and very low 		birth weight infants, and infant mortality ratesfor the fifteen<i>Healthy 		Start</i> communities were compared with two comparison communities pre site 		for fourteen of the sites. Conclusions of the study suggest that<i>Healthy 		Start</i> communities showed:</p>
<ul><li> increased use of any prenatal care in five project sites;</li>
<li> increases in first trimester care in three communities;</li>
<li> improved adequacy of prenatal care in eight communities;</li>
<li> increases in the adequacy of prenatal care in four projects; </li>
<li> improved adequacy of the number of prenatal care visits in nine 		  projects; and</li>
<li> and improvements in all prenatal care measures in three of the 		  project areas.</li>
</ul><p>As for health outcomes, Healthy Start was associated with lower pre-term 		births in four sites; reductions in low birth weight in three project areas; 		and reductions in infant mortality rates, neonatal mortality, and post neonatal 		mortality in two sites each.</p>

<p><i><b>Report to the President: Prescription Drug coverage, Spending, 		Utilization, and Prices.</b> </i></p>
<p>Although the use of prescription drugs are increasingly improving health 		outcomes and quality of life, these drugs, and in particular new drugs, are not 		available to everyone. The elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries in 		particular have either inadequate or no coverage for drugs. The purpose of this 		study is to examine drug costs and trends for Medicare beneficiaries, using a 		combination of public and private databases, data on coverage, effects of 		coverage on spending and utilization, and prescription drug prices. The 		principal findings are:</p>
<ul><li> although 85% of Medicare beneficiaries use at least one prescription 		  drug annually, only 54% were covered for a full year during 1996, and 25% had 		  no coverage. Most sources of drug coverage for these individuals are unstable; 		  and drug benefits are becoming less generous.</li>
<li> the very old, those who live outside a metropolitan area, and those 		  at the higher end of the poverty spectrum are the least likely to be 		  covered.</li>
<li> rates for prescriptions are currently higher for those with five or 		  more chronic conditions.</li>
<li> there are very significant differences in drug utilization and 		  out-of-pocket spending between those with coverage and those without, 		  regardless of health status.</li>
<li> prescription drugs represent a significant source of spending, 		  taking up about one-sixth of all health spending by the elderly (cash customers 		  pay more for drugs than do those with third party payments).</li>
</ul><p>The study provides a detailed examination of multiple factors related to 		coverage, utilization, and spending for prescription drugs, particularly for 		the Medicare population.</p>

<p><b><i>The Potential of the Child Support Enforcement Programs to Avoid 		Costs to Public Programs: A Review and Synthesis of the Literature</i></b> </p>
<p>The Child Support Enforcement Programs ensures that non-custodial 		parents provide appropriate financial support for their children through four 		major services: locating absent parents, establishing paternity, establishing 		child support and medical support obligations, and enforcing support orders. 		One of the goals of the program is to reduce government expenditures on 		means-tested public assistance programs by increasing the amount of child 		support paid to custodial households by non- custodial parents. This study 		synthesizes the theoretical and empirical literature on cost avoidance to build 		a comprehensive and coherent framework to evaluate the intricacies of child 		support cost avoidance. The main findings drawn from the literature are:</p>
<ul><li> several studies present estimates of cost avoidance, but differences 		  in methodology, populations analyzed and assumptions by the authors make 		  comparability and generalizations difficult to estimate;</li>
<li> although realized cost avoidance is relatively modest under the 		  current child support enforcement system, the potential for cost avoidance is 		  unknown;</li>
<li> evaluations of several demonstrations found that periodic review and 		  updating of support orders for AFDC cases was effective in avoiding state and 		  federal government costs, that is the overall cost of the process was less than 		  the increase in dollars collected; the literature indicates that child support 		  enforcement has, at most, a limited indirect effect on cost avoidance by 		  changing the marital and childbearing behavior of custodial and noncustodial 		  parents.</li>
</ul><p>The current research focuses on custodial parents and suggests that 		child support enforcement has a small deterrent effect on divorce and little or 		no deterrent on out-of-wedlock childbearing. The few published studies on the 		effect of child support on the labor force participation of custodial mothers 		find mixed results.</p>

<p><i><b>Evaluation of Head Start Family Child Care Demonstration: Final 		Report</b></i></p>
<p>This evaluation assessed, over a three-year period, the effectiveness of 		the Head Start Family Child Care Homes (HSFCCH) demonstration projects, funded 		by the Administration for Children, Youth, and Families (ACYF) during Fiscal 		Year 1992. It also compares services delivered in family child care homes to 		those delivered in Head Start centers. The findings showed: on </p>
<ul><li> no significant differences in child cognitive, physical, and 		  social-emotional outcomes between family child care homes and center 		  classrooms;</li>
<li> the kindergarten followup did not show any significant differences 		  as a result of the family child care homes versus center classroom; </li>
</ul><p>The study concluded that family child care homes can meet Head Start 		standards of quality and can produce similar outcomes in children and families. 		</p>

              <p><strong align="CENTER">WELFARE REFORM</strong></p>
<p><b>CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS</b></p>
<p><i><b>Welfare Leavers and Medicaid Dynamics: Five States in 		1995</b></i></p>
<p>State welfare caseloads have been declining at an unprecedented rate 		since 1994, partly as a result of state and federal welfare reform efforts and 		partly because of a strong economy. Medicaid enrollment for children and their 		parents has been shrinking as well (although less so than welfare), in spite of 		state efforts to expand their Medicaid eligibility policies. This study 		analyzed the 1995 Medicaid enrollment patterns of children and their parents in 		five states--Alabama, California, Florida, Michigan and New Jersey--to assess 		the impact of welfare declines on overall Medicaid enrollment. The findings 		showed that:</p>
<ul><li> declines in the welfare caseload which began in 1995 are likely to 		  have a noticeable effect on state Medicaid programs, in terms of overall 		  enrollment, caseload mix, and per capita expenditure levels.</li>
<li> some of the states were able to increase enrollment through the 		  non-welfare eligibility groups by making greater use of the child 		  poverty-related, transitional assistance, and medically needy groups.</li>
<li> many welfare leavers are not staying on Medicaid and are at risk of 		  becoming uninsured.</li>
<li> states are experiencing considerable turnover in their Medicaid 		  caseloads.</li>
<li> since state welfare caseloads declined at much greater rates after 		  1995, there is concern that Medicaid enrollment will drop even more, and that 		  Medicaid reductions may be contributing to the continuing problem of the 		  uninsured.</li>
<li> state officials report that many families leave welfare without 		  providing the information needed to redetermine their continued eligibility for 		  Medicaid.</li>
</ul><p>One conclusion of the study is that while states may continue to make 		policy changes to expand Medicaid coverage provisions in an effort to reduce 		the number of uninsured, these changes are not likely to be effective unless 		steps are also taken to improve individual continuity in Medicaid coverage.</p>

<p><i><b>Dynamics of Childrens Movement Among the AFDC, Medicaid, and 		Foster Care Programs Prior to Welfare Reform: 1995-1996</b></i></p>
<p>This study examined patterns of program utilization by children before 		and after welfare reform to assess how the social safety net programs and human 		service utilization have been affected by ending the entitlement to cash 		assistance and placing new work-related requirements on their parents. Three 		programs affected by welfare reform were studied: Temporary Assistance for 		Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, and foster care during 1995-1996, or the years 		immediately prior to welfare reform, which was implemented first in 1997. The 		major findings were:</p>
<ul><li> the consistency across states in the numbers participating in AFDC 		  and Medicaid prior to foster care entry suggests that poverty, or perhaps 		  participation in welfare program, plays an important role in the entry of 		  children into foster care.</li>
<li> transitions from AFDC to a system exit are most likely among the 		  oldest children in all three states, suggesting that families with the youngest 		  children are the most acutely needy and likely to remain on AFDC longer than 		  families with older children.</li>
<li> With the emphasis on work and time limits, welfare reform is likely 		  to result in more and earlier exits from cash assistance.</li>
</ul><p>The major conclusions of the study are that welfare reform is likely to 		have many effects on children and their families. Each state will differ based 		on its program practice and policies, economy, demographic characteristics and 		other factors. Each state will have to tailor its plans accordingly.</p>

<p><b>STATE WELFARE REFORM PROGRAMS </b></p>
<p><i><b>Final Results from Floridas Family Transition </b></i></p>
<p>In 1994, Florida started the Family Transition Program (FTP) in Escambia 		Country as a pilot test site, the first welfare reform initiative to test time 		limits for eligibility and continued benefits. Families were limited to only 24 		months of assistance during a 60-month period (36 months out of 72 for the 		least job-ready persons) and were provided services and incentives to find 		work. The evaluation was a random assignment comparison group study of welfare 		recipients placed in FTP and others receiving traditional Aid to Families with 		Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits. The findings showed that:</p>
<ul><li> FTP recipients, compared to those in the AFDC group spent less time 		  on welfare over the four follow-up periods. There were fewer impacts on 		  children, with the exception of some negative impacts on adolescents 		  school performance; and</li>
<li> FTP families gained in income more than they lost in welfare 		  payments. Slightly less than half of the FTP families who reached their time 		  limits worked steadily in the subsequent18 months, many relying on family, 		  friends, Food Stamps, and housing assistance.</li>
</ul><p>The conclusion was that time limits can be imposed without widespread 		impact on families, but that the robustness of the local economy may be a 		strong contributing factor.</p>

<p><i><b>Reforming Welfare and Rewarding Work: Final Report on the 		Minnesota Family Investment Program (Summary; Volume I: Impact on Adults; 		Volume II: Impact on Children) </b></i></p>
<p>The Minnesota Family Investment Programs (MFIP) combined financial work 		incentives with participation or work requirements for long-term welfare 		recipients. The MFIP evaluation examined ways that states could increase the 		probability that long-term welfare recipients will be able to support 		themselves before they reach their time limit on welfare benefits; how states 		support the efforts of low-income workers to stay in their jobs and provide for 		their families in this era of time-limited welfare; how social policies avoid 		penalizing marriage; and the policy adjustments that states have made in 		changing their welfare systems from Aid to Families with Dependent Children 		(AFDC) to Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) affect families and 		children. The evaluation findings show that:</p>
<ul><li> single-parent, long-term welfare recipients benefitted most from the 		  MFIP program, mainly in employment and increased earnings compared to AFDC 		  participants. However, total costs were higher, since families retained their 		  welfare benefits even as their earnings increased.</li>
<li> MFIP families showed improvements in family well-being, as evidenced 		  by positive parental reports on childrens behavior, decreases in reported 		  domestic abuse, and modest increases in marriage rates.</li>
<li> For two-parent recipient families, the proportion of parents who 		  stayed married increased, compared to AFDC families, and the program enabled 		  second earners to work less.</li>
<li> Results on parent or child outcomes between the experimental and 		  control groups were not significantly different for more recent welfare 		  applicants for whom job preparation services were not mandatory.</li>
</ul><p>Lessons learned from this evaluation concern types of families for which 		the experiment is most effective (e.g., single-parent and two-parent long-term 		recipients versus single parent and two-parent recent applicants); which 		program components (financial incentives, mandatory employment and training) 		contribute most to economic outcomes and social impacts on both families and 		children.</p>

<p><i><b>Evaluation of North Dakotas Training, Education, Employment, 		and Management (TEEM) Program</b></i></p>
<p>The North Dakota Training, Education, Employment and Management (TEEM) 		program is the states Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) 		program to families, providing the following cash assistance and supportive 		services: a computerized assessment that results in a social contract and 		referrals to needed services; incentives to promote work and work effort; 		sanctions for non-compliance with the program requirements; increased asset 		limits allowing families to save while on aid; and a benefit cap that precludes 		TEEM recipients who get pregnant while on aid from receiving additional cash 		benefits for that child. The evaluation of TEEM monitored program 		implementation and examined client caseload trends and client characteristics 		between 1997 and 1999 to measure outcomes. The monitoring effort identified 		programs improvements needed in providing information to recipients on Earned 		Income tax Credit, more training for TEEM staff on case manager role; and 		changes in the client assessment process. The client outcome trend data showed 		that:</p>
<ul><li> TEEM families retained substantial public assistance from other 		  sources after finding employment;</li>
<li> Native Americans increased as the proportion of TEEM adults cases 		  between 1998-1999 and had higher TEEM recidivism rates;</li>
<li> the child-only cases increased proportionately and were living with 		  parents receiving disability payments;</li>
<li> and the proportion of case closures due to employment declined over 		  time, which may have been due to problems with the closure codes.</li>

<p><i><b>Analysis of Administrative Data on Families Receiving Welfare and 		Diversion Assistance under the Work First Program: Third Quarterly Report</b> 		</i></p>
<p>The<i>North Carolina Work First Program</i>s third quarterly 		report analyzing administrative data examined patterns of welfare 		participation, employment, earnings, and other key outcomes among families who 		enter and leave the<i>Work First</i> program, and persons who receive Diversion 		Assistance. The findings show that:</p>
<ul><li> families in the AFDC entry cohort were more likely to be still on 		  assistance 36 months after going on welfare compared to families in the Work 		  First entry cohort;</li>
<li><i>Work First</i> program has had far less impact on child-only cases 		  than on other cases;</li>
<li> length of stay on welfare for all entry cohorts was longer for 		  persons without a work history, persons without a work history and a high 		  school diploma, families that were younger, African American, and living in 		  large cities; and</li>
<li> fewer families in the<i>Work First</i> program, compared to the AFDC 		  exit cohorts returned to cash assistance in the followup study period. </li>
</ul><p>No major differences were found between the exit cohorts in employment 		rates, which seemed to be more influenced by seasonal factors. All cohorts 		showed evidence of earning progression after leaving welfare, controlling for 		seasonal variations.</p>

<p><i><b>Study of Families Receiving Diversion Assistance Payments Under 		the Work First Program</b> </i></p>
<p>The<i>North Carolina Work First Diversion Assistance</i> program serves 		families eligible for<i>Work First</i> cash assistance but instead receive 		diversion assistance in the form of cash payments equal to as much as three 		months of<i>Work First</i> benefits. The program goal is to provide assistance 		to families when they need short-term help to become or remain self-sufficient, 		as an alternative to going on welfare. The evaluation consists of telephone 		interviews with 242 families receiving assistance between May 1999 and August 		1999. The study found that:</p>
<ul><li> client household characteristics, plus prior welfare use and 		  employment, varied by county which was interpreted as variations in the 		  countys approach to targeting diversion assistance.</li>
<li> one quarter of respondents said they were not working;</li>
<li> there was evidence of food deprivation among 22 percent of 		  respondents but no evidence of major problems of hunger, homelessness, poor 		  housing conditions, or placement of children.</li>
</ul><p>The results suggest that county administration of the programs should 		take caution in using diversion for applicants that do not have a recent work 		experience.</p>

<p><i><b>Study of Families Leaving Work First Due to Time Limits: Results 		of the Second Round of Follow-up Surveys</b></i></p>
<p>The evaluation of the<i>North Carolina Work First</i> program includes a 		report on results of the second round of follow-up surveys in late 1999 on the 		status of families who left the programs in August 1998 as a result of reaching 		the 24-month time limit. The first round of surveys were conducted between 		December 1998 and March 1999. Between the first and second survey rounds, the 		employment changes experienced by leaving families showed that: </p>
<ul><li> employment was slightly higher; the rates of job turnover were not 		  significant; almost half of respondents said they received a raise between 		  interviews (however, the earning progress ion may be unique to the sample and 		  all welfare leavers).</li>
<li> as for employer health insurance, participation in such plan when 		  available increased for respondents, but largely because they became eligible 		  to participate in plans by reason of increase time on the job and increased 		  work hours;</li>
<li> the two reasons given by respondents who were unemployed at the 		  second round were-- could not find a job or get one after applying, and could 		  not take work because of disability or illness.</li>
<li> There was an increase in the number of respondents who said they had 		  experienced adverse events since leaving, with ability to buy food as the one 		  most often mentioned.</li>
<li> No significant differences were found for access to health care, 		  child care, and housing, nor differences in childrens school 		  performance.</li>
<li> Employed respondents with higher incomes thought they were better 		  off without welfare, but the pattern was inconsistent at the lower income 		  levels.</li>
