    <p><b>MISSION: To provide analytical support and advice to the Secretary on 		policy development and assist the Secretary with the development and 		coordination of department wide program planning and evaluation activities.</b> 		</p>
<p><b><i>Evaluation Program</i></b> </p>
<p>The Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) functions as 		a principal advisor to the Secretary on policy development and, in this 		capacity, conducts a variety of evaluation and policy research studies on 		issues of national importance. ASPE also is responsible for department wide 		coordination of legislative, planning, and evaluation activities. In its 		evaluation coordination role, ASPE has the following tasks: </p>
<ul><li> Provide annual guidance to all HHS agencies and staff offices 		  regarding evaluation priorities, procedures, and review requirements.</li>
<li> Review evaluation priorities proposed by HHS agencies, providing 		  advice about the focus or method of proposed projects and identifying 		  opportunities for collaboration, and effective use of resources.</li>
<li> Prepare planning and summary reports on evaluation activities as 		  required by Congress.</li>
</ul><p>Through the departmental evaluation planning process, ASPE has the 		capacity to identify crosscutting program or policy issues of particular 		concern to the Secretary and specific program and policy areas not covered by 		the HHS Agency evaluation plans. In these instances, ASPE initiates evaluations 		or collaborates with the agencies to conduct evaluations or policy assessments. 		For example, in recent years, ASPE has initiated projects to develop cost 		estimates for health financing issues in general, and specifically for the 		Medicare and Medicaid programs; assess the effects of managed care expansion on 		public health infrastructure; examine welfare-to-work approaches; test 		alternative methods of long-term care service delivery; and evaluate 		alternative services for children at risk of harm from drug abuse, crime, child 		abuse, and other pathologies.</p>
<p>Another continuing evaluation objective of ASPE is to support and 		promote the development and improvement of data bases that HHS agencies and 		ASPE use to evaluate health care programs and health trends. For example, ASPE 		has been the major initiator, in collaboration with the National Center for 		Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, of the 		first comprehensive survey of people with disabilities in the United States. 		The first component of these new data was completed in FY 1996, and national 		prevalence data on disability are now available. The ASPE co-chairs and 		provides support to the HHS Data Council, which is charged with integrating key 		national surveys, such as linking health status indicators with indicators of 		well-being.</p>
<p>Finally, ASPE uses evaluation funds to promote effective use of 		evaluation-generated information in program management and policymaking. The 		latter is accomplished through the dissemination of evaluation findings and 		other activities, such as providing technical assistance to agencies in the 		development of performance measures.</p>

<p><b>A Survey of Employers Offering Group Long-Term Care Insurance to 		Their Employees</b> </p>
<p>This final report provides information about current and best practices 		in the employer group LTC insurance market that can inform federal policy 		makers and employers in deciding how to construct a group LTC insurance 		offering. Current practices were collected from a random and select sample of 		employers and best practices were compiled from the select sample. The random 		sample survey generated a response rate of 58 percent. The total sample 		included 93 employers. The principle findings indicate the employer market 		provides greater access to coverage than in the individual market. A majority 		of employers offered less restrictive underwriting or even guarantee issue 		policies (i.e., did not require health information) during initial offerings to 		active, full-time employees. A majority offered coverage to at least one group 		in addition to full-time active employees (i.e., parents/inlaws, spouses, and 		retired employees), potentially extending the benefit well beyond the size of 		the employee population. Most employers usually limited the number of benefit 		choices. The majority offered two to four benefit amount options and a set 		package rather than allowing the employee to select every option separately. 		Nearly all employers used a single LTC insurer. Despite this, however, data 		from a random sample of employers suggest that the benefit features of employer 		group plans generally resemble the most common individually purchased policies. 		</p>

<p>Evaluation of the District of Columbia's Demonstration Program - 		"Managed Care System for Disabled and Special Needs Children"</p>
<p>This evaluation focuses on an assessment of the District of Columbia's 		1115 waiver demonstration to integrate acute and long-term care services for 		SSI (Supplemental Security Income) eligible children with disabilities in a 		single capitated payment system, called Health Services for Children with 		Special Needs (HSCSN). The evaluation shows that the capitated model tested in 		the demonstration is not viable. The main contributing factor is the 		insufficient size of the population of special needs children in the District 		to protect a plan against severe financial losses. Despite a proposal by the 		District's Medicaid Program to add stop-loss protection, HSCSN officials 		decided to not enter the waiver for re-competition. The impact of the 		demonstration on participants was mostly positive: better access to services 		and more satisfaction with services. Caregivers reported heavier use of medical 		services, particularly preventive services. They also felt less positive about 		the current or future health of the children being served. The policy 		implications of the evaluation indicated that coordinated and integrated care 		models still offer a valuable service despite the lack of success of the 		demonstration. In addition, policy makers need to consider alternative models 		of financing care management, such as primary care case management models that 		involve the child's primary physician in the coordination and integration.</p>

<p>In-Home Supportive Services for the Elderly and Disabled: A Comparison 		of Client-Directed and Professional Models of Service Delivery</p>
<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation 		conducted a survey of personal assistance services clients, workers, and case 		managers to compare measures of quality of care, quality of life, client 		satisfaction, and worker satisfaction between a consumer-directed model (CDM) 		and a professionally directed model (PDM) of in-home supportive services 		delivery. The study also compared the outcomes associated with the use of 		family, friends, and neighbors as independent providers, as compared to 		services provided by aides previously unknown to the client. The study was 		conducted in the context of California's In-Home Supportive Services Program 		with the assistance of state officials. Findings regarding both models were 		generally positive; however, the study's principal finding is that clients in 		the CDM had more desirable outcomes than those in the PDM within three broadly 		defined areas: satisfaction with services, empowerment, and quality of life. 		Clients who hired family members as paid workers had more desirable outcomes on 		some measures in the areas of safety, satisfaction with services, and 		empowerment. Specifically, such clients reported a greater sense of security, 		having more choice about how their aides performed various tasks, a stronger 		preference for directing their aides, and a closer rapport with them.</p>

<p>Post-Acute Care Issues for Medicare: Interviews with Provider and 		Consumer Groups, and Researchers and Policy Analysts</p>
<p>The 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA) was aimed at curbing the remarkably 		rapid rate of spending for post-acute care. This research was undertaken to 		provide an "early indication" qualitative study of the potential effects of the 		BBA provisions and other related issues. This study collected information 		through interviews with individuals knowledgeable about Medicare post-acute 		care issues. They included representatives of post-acute care providers 		(including discharge planners) and their organizations, quality of care 		experts, consumer groups, researchers, and health policy analysts. While this 		study was in progress, Congress enacted the 1999 Balanced Budget refinement Act 		(BBRA) which increased Medicare payments for post-acute care providers. These 		Acts have created some changes, however many important post-acute care policy 		issues remain unresolved, such as the goal of the Medicare home health benefit. 		Ambivalence about whether individuals requiring extended personal assistance 		with skilled supervision (who also tend to have high per-person costs) should 		be covered has resulted in the use of reimbursement policy strategies, such as 		the per-beneficiary limit in the HHA IPS to contain Medicare costs of those 		recipients. Also, providers, consumer representatives, and researchers 		expressed concern about access problems faced by individuals with particularly 		high service needs, such as Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF) patients with high 		non-therapy ancillary costs, rehabilitation patients who exceed the Part B 		therapy caps, and home health patients whose costs exceed the per beneficiary 		limits.</p>

<p>State Welfare-to-Work Policies for People with Disabilities: 		Implementation Challenges and Considerations</p>
<p>This report focuses on State policy responses to two key aspects of the 		recent Federal welfare reform law that hold important ramifications for 		recipients with disabilities and caregivers--work participation and time limit 		requirements--and State flexibility to exempt recipients from one or both of 		these requirements. Findings are based on two primary data sources--written 		policy documents and conversations with State welfare agency staff in each of 		the 50 States and the District of Columbia--and reflect State policies at a 		single point in time (April-May 1998). Although this point in time review 		provides essential baseline information, it is important to note that States 		are likely to revisit these policies and may use the increased flexibility 		provided under Federal welfare reform to change policies over time.

<p>Synthesis and Analysis of Medicare Hospice Benefits</p>
<p>The rapid rise in Medicare hospice expenditures, particularly on behalf 		of nursing home residents, has drawn the attention of a wide variety of health 		policymakers and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). The OIG has 		advanced recommendations to modify how Medicare and Medicaid will pay for 		hospice services. However, a larger study is needed to examine key hospice 		trends nationally and in selected States. This report synthesizes the 		literature related to the Medicare hospice benefit and summarizes discussions 		with key informants about nursing home residents who elect this benefit. In 		addition, this report analyzes Medicare utilization and expenditures for 		beneficiaries electing the hospice benefit, analyzes and compares outcomes 		derived from the nursing home MDS data for decedents electing the hospice 		benefit with decedents not electing this benefit, and analyzes hospice coverage 		policy and utilization data from private insurers. This and other Medicare 		hospice benefit reports can be found at: 		<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/projects.htm">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/projects.htm</a>.</p>

<p>Synthesis and Analysis of Medicare Post-Acute Care Benefits and 		Alternatives</p>
<p>This project synthesized what is known about : (a) current coverage and 		payment policies for post-acute care (PAC); (b) predictors of PAC use and 		nonuse and of the type, amount, and duration of PAC use; (c) PAC utilization 		including characteristics of PAC patients, patterns of PAC utilization, and 		geographic distribution of providers; (d) Medicare expenditures during the 		course of PAC episodes; (e) outcomes of patients in and across PAC settings; 		and (f) State policies designed to maximize Medicare PAC coverage. Two reports 		have been reproduced. The first report, Medicare's Post-Acute Care Benefits: 		Background, Trends, and Issues to be Faced" provides background on post-acute 		care expenditures and utilization, and Medicare policy changes that have 		contributed to these trends; the supply and changes in distribution of 		post-acute care providers; beneficiary, provider, and market characteristics 		associated with differential post-acute care provider use; and issues that need 		to be addressed regarding Medicare post-acute care services. [see PIC 		ID#7365.1] The second report, "Interviews with Provider and Consumer Groups, 		and Researchers and Policy Analysts" summarizes discussions with key 		stakeholders regarding issues with Medicare's skilled nursing facility, home 		health, rehabilitation and long-term care hospital benefits. Many comments were 		raised regarding the impact of the changes enacted in the Balanced Budget Act 		on these benefits. [see PIC ID# 7365.2]</p>

<p>The Use of Nursing Home and Assisted Living Facilities Among Privately 		Insured and Non-Privately Insured Disabled Elders</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to collect detailed information on the 		experiences of long-term care policy holders who have filed insurance claims to 		receive home care benefits and how their formal and informal service use 		compares to a comparable population of elderly persons without private 		insurance. Primary data collection involved face-to-face interviews with 		approximately 1,000 persons (500 disabled insurance claimants and 500 		next-of-kin of those claimants) to collect information on functional and 		medical characteristics of claimants as well as formal and informal services 		use. The sample of claimants was drawn from the files of insurance companies 		that account for the majority of private long-term care policies now in force. 		Four reports were prepared that contributed to this study: (1) The Use of 		Nursing Home and Assisted Living Facilities Among Privately Insured and 		Non-Privately Insured Disabled Elders; (2) Informal Caregivers of Disabled 		Elders with Long-Term Care Insurance; (3) Multivariate Analysis of Patterns of 		Informal and Formal Caregiving among Privately Insured and Non-Privately 		Insured Disabled Elders Living in the Community; (4) A Descriptive Analysis of 		Patterns of Informal and Formal Caregiving among Privately Insured and 		Non-Privately Insured Disabled Elders Living in the Community.</p>

<p>Understanding Medicaid Home and Community Services: A Primer</p>
<p>Medicaid now offers so many options for providing home and community 		services that they can be confusing for policymakers, state officials, 		advocates, and consumers alike. To add to the confusion, the extensive 		flexibility states have to combine these options has resulted in 50 different 		state Medicaid programs. This Primer is designed to encourage use of the 		Medicaid program in a manner that minimizes reliance on institutions and 		maximizes community integration in a cost-effective manner. It is intended for 		policymakers and others who wish to understand how Medicaid can be used--and is 		being used--to expand access to a broad range of home and community services 		and supports, and to promote consumer choice and control. In addition to 		comprehensive explanations of program features, states can implement to achieve 		these goals, the Primer presents examples of state programs that have taken 		advantage of Medicaid's flexibility to expand home and community services for 		people of all ages with disabilities. Each chapter of the Primer provides an 		annotated bibliography, with full information on how to obtain each 		publication. The next four chapters lay out and discuss the basic elements 		involved in Medicaid's financial and functional eligibility criteria and 		service coverage alternatives. The last four chapters focus on key policy goals 		in the provision of home and community services and supports. It concludes with 		a series of Appendices that provide additional information about the Medicaid 		program.</p>

<p>Access and Utilization of New Antidepressant and Antipsychotic 		Medications</p>
<p>This study was commissioned to identify, document, and assess the 		factors that affect access to and utilization of new generation antidepressant 		and antipsychotic medications. It is designed to assist the U.S. Department of 		Health and Human Services evaluate existing and proposed policies in this area 		by developing important insights and knowledge concerning the complex processes 		related to access, utilization, and coverage of newer psychotropic mediations 		from a variety of perspectives. This study is also designed to identify 		clinical and health policy issues where further research is needed. The 		analysis was developed based on published literature, pharmaceutical claims, 		and primary research with stakeholders. It focuses on antidepressants and 		antipsychotics as general classes of pharmacotherapy, with emphasis on agents 		introduced to the US market after 1988. The report's findings are organized 		into categories, guided by the original principal questions. For example, in 		terms of access to newer antidepressant and antipsychotic medications, the 		pharmaceutical benefits are commonly available for psychotherapeutic agents; 		Limits on prescription coverage and cost sharing requirements apply equally to 		all classes of medications. In terms of the cost-effectiveness of newer 		antidepressant and antipsychotic medications, the findings indicate the 		published cost-effectiveness literature shows no clear differences in total 		treatment costs associated with the use of different antidepressant agents, 		although individual studies have claimed that one particular agent is superior 		to another.</p>

<p>An Inventory of Federal HIV-Related Databases</p>
<p>Many federal agencies maintain major HIV-related databases. They contain 		a range of potentially useful information, including epidemiologic and 		patient-level data as well as health resource utilization, disability benefits, 		and insurance claims information. However, there is no single inventory that 		fully describes their study design, data collection methodology, and common and 		unique data elements. This report is designed to help address this information 		gap. The resulting resource can be used to catalyze collaborations among 		government agencies, philanthropies, industry, and academia to increase the 		understanding of HIV disease and its impact on the health care delivery system. 		The inventory summarizes the types of HIV-related research supported by DHHS, 		SSA, and the VA. It describes the major issues addressed by the various studies 		reviewed in the inventory, their study designs, and their research 		applications. The inventory includes primarily major studies and databases. The 		report also identifies selected policy, clinical, evaluation, or other 		questions that might be the focus of new studies or database development.</p>

<p>Consumer Protection in Private Health Insurance: The Role of Consumer 		Complaints</p>
<p>This study provides background lessons for federal regulators who may be 		required to implement federal patient protection legislation by focusing on 		consumer complaints about private health insurance in a sample of selected 		states and major employers. Specifically, the study identified the agencies 		responsible for health insurance complaints and the availability of complaints 		data, to review the status of complaints "report cards" and to analyze 		complaints data as a tool in understanding the implementation of patient 		protections. A sample of six states (California, Maryland, New York, Oregon, 		Texas and Vermont) was selected to represent a range of jurisdictional 		responsibility for health insurance complaints and the existence of ombudsman 		programs, together with states representing best practice in publication of 		health insurance complaints report cards. The principal findings include: 1) 		Jurisdiction over private health insurance complaints varies across states, 		with responsibility for indemnity health insurance, managed care and quality 		complaints often split within or between state agencies. 2) There is a wide 		spectrum in the type of consumer assistance or ombudsman programs available to 		people with health insurance complaints. 3) There is a hierarchy of complaints 		handling, with state regulators seeing only the tip of the iceberg in consumer 		complaints. Across three states for which data were available, the volume of 		grievances received directly by plans about about seven to eight times greater 		than the volume of complaints receiped by state regulators.</p>

<p>Consumer Protection in Private Insurance: State Implementation and 		Enforcement Experience</p>
<p>The Office of the Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (OASPE) 		requested this study of state implementation of consumer protections (access to 		emergency services, network adequacy, continuity of care, standing referral, 		and access to out-of-network specialists) specifically for the most seriously 		and chronically ill patients. These protections are sought by people with AIDS, 		cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and other serious or chronic conditions. This 		report discusses the experience of four states (Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, 		and New York) that have enacted these forms of consumer protection. These 		states were selected because they had several years of experience implementing 		most, if not all, of these protections. The report provides a summary of 10 		findings, with recommendations for policy direction. The findings from the 		states indicate those experiences provide a range of approaches that federal 		regulators can consider when deciding how to implement consumer protection 		laws. The states also provide potential solutions to implementation challenges 		that have worked and insights into practices federal regulators may want to 		avoid because they have not worked well at the state level.</p>

<p>Report to the President: Prescription Drug Coverage, Spending, 		Utilization, and Prices</p>
<p>In 1999 the President directed the Secretary of Health and Human 		Services to study prescription drug costs and trends for Medicare 		beneficiaries. Specifically, he asked that they investigate: (1) price 		differences for the most commonly used drugs for people with and without 		coverage; (2) drug spending by people of various ages, as a percentage of 		income and of total health spending; and (3) trends in drug expenditures by 		people of different ages, as a percentage of income and of total health 		spending. This study represents the work of individuals and agencies throughout 		HHS. Key findings are: (1) Individuals without drug coverage pay a higher price 		at the retail pharmacy than the total price paid on behalf of those with drug 		coverage. The differences held up when examining the Medicare and non-Medicare 		populations. (2) Cash customers pay more for a given drug than those with third 		party payments at the point of sale. In fact, the typical cash customer paid 		nearly 15 percent more than the customer with third party coverage. This study 		presents a detailed examination of multiple factors relating to coverage, 		utilization, and spending for prescription drugs, particularly by the Medicare 		population.</p>

<p>Coordination and Integration of Welfare and Workforce Development 		Systems</p>
<p>This study provides a snapshot of welfare and workforce system 		coordination in a limited number of sites at a point in time where welfare 		programs are work-focused and workforce development systems are reorganizing to 		provide one-stop services to a broad population. As a result, there is an 		increased interest in coordination between welfare and workforce development 		agencies and a greater awareness in each other's programs and services. States 		and local sites selected for this study represented a range of organizational 		structures, historical experiences, and economic and demographic variables. 		Cities in these six states were visited- Missouri, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, 		Rhode Island and South Carolina. No information collected from clients. The 		description of client flow and service receipt are developed from discussions 		with service providers and administrators. There were several key findings: (1) 		past relationships in implementing previous welfare-to-work programs were 		important factors in current coordination models and activities. (2) 		Coordination can occur under a variety of organizational approaches. Different 		levels of coordination may be appropriate in different communities; (3) Service 		systems need to fit local conditions. Planners should consider issues of 		scale--a one-stop with all services in one location works in Dayton, but may 		not work in a larger city. In some localities, a decentralized, 		neighborhood-based structure may be more effective.</p>

<p>Dynamics of Children's Movement Among the AFDC, Medicaid, and Foster 		Care Programs Prior to Welfare Reform: 1995-1996</p>
<p>This report describes pre-welfare reform behavior in order to understand 		the caseload dynamics around major social programs and provides a baseline for 		future follow-up. The report traces patterns of children's service use in three 		programs affected by welfare reform: TANF, Medicaid, and foster care. The data 		span 1995-1996, the years immediately prior to welfare reform, which was 		implemented first in 1997. The key findings are: (1) In each of the states less 		than 3% of children who entered during the study period moved to foster care. 		However, while this is a small percentage, the majority (60%) of entries to 		foster care in each of the states were from AFDC and therefore, the small flow 		from AFDC accounts for a large flow into foster care. (2) Infants are nearly 		three times as likely to enter foster care from an AFDC spell. This suggests 		that for young children, there may be a link between the stress or crisis that 		propels families onto the AFDC rolls and a child's entry to foster care. (3) 		The numbers participating in AFDC and Medicaid prior to foster care entry 		suggests that poverty, or perhaps participation in the welfare program, plays 		an important role in the entry of children into foster care. (4) There was 		considerable variation in the three states as to patterns of transition of 		children from AFDC to Medicaid, which suggests that it is unlikely that there 		will be many similarities in program utilization across the states given the 		differences. Each state will differ based on its program practices and 		policies, economy, demographic characteristics and other factors. Each state 		will have to tailor its plans accordingly.</p>

<p>Evaluating Alternative Welfare-to-Work Approaches: Two-Year Impacts for 		Eleven Programs</p>
<p>This report analyzes the effectiveness of 11 mandatory welfare-to-work 		(WtW) programs operated in seven locales: Atlanta, GA, Columbus, OH, Detroit 		and Grand Rapids, MI, Oklahoma City, OK, Portland, OR, and Riverside, CA. 		Individuals in these programs did not face a time limit on eligibility for 		assistance since all the programs studies were pre-TANF. The 11 programs 		differed in the messages that they sent to welfare recipients about how best to 		obtain and retain employment. Some stressed getting a job quickly, and others 		stressed initial investments in basic education or training. Most of the 		programs imposed a mandatory participation requirement, with several using 		financial sanctions (i.e., welfare grant reductions) extensively to enforce 		this mandate. Sample members are being followed for five years from the time 		they entered the study. This report focuses on adult outcomes, although some 		information on children's outcomes is provided. The report cites a number of 		findings, including 1) All programs reduced welfare dependency to some degree; 		(2) Most programs increased sample members' reliance on earnings, as opposed to 		welfare, but their families' net incomes were largely unchanged; and, (3) All 		programs, regardless of their approach, increased participation in activities 		designed to promote employment during the two-year follow-up period.</p>

<p>Evaluation of the New York City Homerebuilders Demonstration</p>
<p>In 1993, the New York State Department of Social Services (DSS) and the 		New York City Child Welfare Administration began testing a new approach to the 		financing of services to foster children and their birth families based on 		concepts from managed care. Based on the premise that paying for each day a 		child is in foster care (per diem payment) is a disincentive to return children 		home, the demonstration tested an alternativve method of agency reimbursement. 		Instead of paying for each day in care, agencies were paid a flat amount of 		money or capitation payments for an identified group of children in foster 		care. The funds were to be used to serve the children for three years. A 		projection of care day utilization was calculated based on each agency's 		historic care day usage. A strategy was agreed upon to pay agencies a 		percentage of the three-year capitation each year. Funding was front loaded in 		the first year to encourage early discharge. It was hypothesized that the 		change in the payment system would achieve earlier permanency for children 		through intensified discharge planning and aftercare services. Funds could be 		used for foster care costs and any services the agencies believed would achieve 		earlier permanency. The initiative included six agencies, using an experimental 		design involving comparison groups in five of the agencies, with random 		assignment in three. The new financing mechanism was to be used in the 		experimental groups while services to the control group were financed under the 		old system. The purpose of the evaluation was to document the implementation of 		the program, the services provided, and the outcomes of those services. (See 		PIC ID 5337 and 5337.1.)</p>

<p>Health Conditions Utilization and Expenditures of Children in Foster 		Care</p>
<p>This study was funded by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for 		Planning and Evaluation in the Department of Health and Human Services to 		inform policymakers of the health care experience of children in foster care 		who are enrolled in Medicaid, including their demographic characteristics, 		diagnosed health conditions, and patterns of health care utilization and 		expenditures. The data source for the study is the State Medicaid Research 		Files (SMRF) from three states (California, Florida and Pennsylvania) of 		children under age 19 who received adoption assistance, AFDC, or SSI benefits. 		The results indicate: (1) Children in foster care accounted for a 		disproportionate share of Medicaid expenditures (1.1 and 3.3 percent enrolled; 		3.6 to 7.8 percent of Medicaid expenditures); (2) Children in foster care had 		less continuous Medicaid coverage than children receiving SSI benefits and 		those in families receiving adoption assistance; (3) Children in foster care 		were more likely than other groups of Medicaid children to have a mental health 		or substance abuse condition. They had a higher likelihood of comorbidities 		than AFDC and adoption assistance children, but were less likely than SSI 		children to have multiple diagnoses; (4) In general, foster care children in 		California were less likely to receive health care services than those in the 		other two states. (5) In general, expenditures were highest for the SSI 		population and second-highest for foster care children.</p>

<p>Impacts on Young Children and Their Families Two Years After Enrollment: 		Findings from the Child Outcomes Study</p>
<p>This component of the evaluation focuses in depth on children's 		development and well-being for a sample of families with young (preschool age) 		children at the start of the evaluation drawn from three of the NEWWS sites: 		Atlanta, Grand Rapids, and Riverside. The report asks whether young children's 		development and well-being were affected when their mothers were assigned to 		participate in Welfare-to- Work (WtW) programs implemented as part of the Job 		Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) Program. This program required 		mothers of young children as young as age three (or age one, at state option) 		to participate in WtW activities. The findings indicate that the WtW programs 		did have significant impacts on children's developmental outcomes, but these 		impacts were not widespread and were generally small. When impacts did occur, 		they were favorable in the area of the children's cognitive development and 		academic achievement, unfavorable in the area of the children's health and 		safety, and mixed in the area of behavioral and emotional adjustment. Looking 		at subgroups of families, there was a pattern of favorable impacts for children 		from higher-risk families assigned to human capital development programs or to 		the Atlanta labor force attachment program. Yet, at the same time, there was a 		concentration of unfavorable, and policy relevant, impacts for children from 		lower-risk families in three of the programs studied.</p>

<p>The Child Outcomes Study is a substudy of the National Evaluation of 		Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS), a longitudinal evaluation of a set of 		welfare-to-work strategies implemented under the Job Opportunities and Basic 		Skills Training (JOBS) Program as a part of the 1988 Family Support Act. In the 		three sites selected for the Child Outcomes Study--Atlanta, GA; Grand Rapids, 		MI; and Riverside, CA--the evaluation is examining the impacts of two types of 		welfare-to-work approaches. The "labor force attachment (LFA) approach" 		encourages a rapid transition into the labor force, whereas the "human capital 		development (HCD) approach" follows a long-term strategy of investing in 		recipients' basic education, with the aim of increasing qualifications for 		higher wage jobs. This study focuses in depth on children's development and 		well-being for a sample of families with young (preschool age) children at the 		start of the evaluation, drawn from three of the evaluation's seven research 		sites.

This report analyzes data on participation, AFDC and 		Food Stamp receipt, employment, and earnings. The results are based on a random 		assignment research design, in which welfare recipients were randomly assigned 		to one of two groups: the program group, whose members were assigned initially 		to MOST and were subject to MOST participation requirements; and the control 		group, whose members were not subject to any participation requirements for 		three years, but who could seek out, on their own, educational and training 		programs available in the community, and who were eligible for child care and 		transportation assistance provided by the MOST office. The report sample 		consisted of 4,459 single-parent sample members (2,226 program group and 2,233 		control group members).

<p>Indicators of Welfare Dependence: Annual Report to Congress</p>
<p>The Welfare Indicators Act of 1994 requires HHS to prepare annual 		reports to Congress on indicators and predictors of welfare dependence. This is 		the third of these annual reports. The report focuses on benefits under the Aid 		to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, now Temporary Assistance to 		Needy Families (TANF); the Food Stamp Program; and the Supplemental Security 		Income (SSI) program. Selected highlights from the many findings in the report 		include the following: In 1995, 5.1 percent of the total population was 		dependent in the sense of receiving more than half of total income from AFDC, 		food stamps, and/or SSI. The percentage of the population that received 		AFDC/TANF in 1998 was lower than in any year since 1970. Long term dependency 		is relatively rare. Only 4 percent of those who were recipients in 1982 		received more than 50 percent of their income from these programs in nine or 		more years over a ten-year period. This represents less than 0.5 percent of the 		total population. Recipients of AFDC, food stamps, and SSI are less apt to have 		a family member participating in the labor force than are individuals in the 		general population. Full-time participation in the labor force has increased 		among AFDC families between 1993 and 1995, according to Census Bureau data. 		Other data sources indicate that this trend of increased labor force 		participation has continued through 1998.</p>

<p>Oklahoma City's ET&amp;E Program: Two-Year Implementation, 		Participation, Cost, and Impact Findings</p>
<p>This report presents evaluation results for Oklahoma City's Education, 		Training, and Employment (ET&amp;E) program, which was designed to promote 		self-sufficiency among applicants for and recipients of AFDC. The program 		advocated participation in education, training, and job search classes to 		enhance the individual's employability and granted child care assistance to 		support participation in the program and employment. This report's data measure 		ET&amp;E's operation before it was overhauled in late 1995. At that time, 		Oklahoma City's program shifted from one that encouraged individuals to build 		skills through formal education and that put great emphasis on participants' 		choice to a program that is mandatory and employment-focused, requiring 		individuals to look for a job first, both before and after their application 		for welfare is approved. Future NEWWS documents will follow Oklahoma City 		sample members for up to five years; it is possible that longer follow-up will 		reflect Oklahoma City's shift to a program type that has produced large effects 		in other locales. Major two-year findings are: (1) ET&amp;E administrators and 		staff did not strongly enforce the stated mandate to participate. (2) There was 		only a slight increase in participation among welfare applicants in training 		and education activities above what they would have accessed on their own 		within a two-year period. (3) Less than $1,000 was spent on each program group 		member, the lowest found for a NEWWS program. (4) ET&amp;E produced no impacts 		on employment or earnings within two years, but did generate moderate AFDC 		savings.</p>

Services such as child care and 		transportation are also important. (2) Policies to encourage or support 		occupational mobility/job advancement. These include developing information 		networks and policies to encourage businesses to delineate skill requirements 		and career ladders for entry-level jobs, as well as on-the-job training for 		such career ladders. (3) Policies to raise the incomes of low-wage workers and 		enhance employment security.

<p>The Role of Intermediaries in Linking TANF Recipients with Jobs: Final 		Report</p>
<p>Moving millions of welfare recipients into the workforce is the 		cornerstone of the recently enacted welfare reform legislation, the Personal 		Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996. 		Efforts to employ welfare recipients under PRWORA will not be successful 		without the involvement and support of private sector employers. Across the 		country, businesses are getting involved to varying degrees in welfare-to-work, 		including more than 2,500 member companies of the Welfare to Work Partnership 		who have pledged their commitment to hire welfare recipients. Many of these 		businesses are in turn relying on intermediaries to help them hire welfare 		recipients. The role of intermediaries varies significantly, from providing 		referrals or assistance with filing for tax credits, to providing extensive pre 		and post-employment services. While the importance of intermediaries is growing 		rapidly, little is known about them. This study provides two types of 		information on intermediaries. The first is a broad description of the types of 		intermediaries currently participating in welfare-to-work efforts in several 		sites across the country. This information is presented for a large number of 		intermediaries, in general terms, focusing on the basic characteristics of the 		intermediaries and the types of services provided. The second part of the 		project presents in-depth information on implementation issues based on site 		visits to the communities of an urban and rural site in ten states.</p>

The report presents the most recent and reliable estimates 		on more than 90 indicators which have been organized into these five broad 		areas: (1) population, family, and neighborhood; (2) economic security; (3) 		health conditions and health care; (4) social development, behavioral health, 		and teen fertility; and (5) education and achievement. Now indicators for this 		edition of the report include: arts proficiency for children in grade 8; 		student computer use. In terms of how children are faring overall, the report 		highlights indicate: youth violence has been decreasing; the birth rate for 		teen females ages 15 to 19 continues its downward trend; median incomes of 		families with children receiving welfare payments decreased steadily since 		1993; and the percent of single mothers in the labor force increased from 66 		percent in 1996 to 74 percent in 1998. The report also speaks to major gaps in 		the federal statistical system which contributes to an incomplete picture of 		the quality of our children's lives. For example, there are few measures of 		social development and health- related behaviors for very young and pre-teenage 		children that are measured on a regular basis. There are few indicators 		available that reflect important social processes affecting child well-being 		that go on inside the family and within the neighborhood. Other areas in need 		of measurement development or improvements in the quality, consistency, and 		frequency of available data include child abuse and neglect, youth violent 		crime, day care quality, learning disabilities, and measures of children in 		institutionalized care.</p>

<p>Welfare Leavers and Medicaid Dynamics: Five States in 1995</p>
<p>In addition to the unprecedented decline in state welfare caseloads, 		since 1994, is the decline in Medicaid enrollment for children and their 		parents. These declines in Medicaid enrollment were not expected, given the 		many ways family members, especially children, can remain eligible for Medicaid 		after welfare. There has also been a decline in the number of uninsured. This 		study analyzed the 1995 Medicaid enrollment patterns of children and their 		parents in five states to increase our understanding of the enrollment 		interactions between welfare and Medicaid. One part of the analysis focused on 		persons who left welfare during the year to see how many stayed on Medicaid. A 		second part of the analysis looked at the dynamics of overall Medicaid 		enrollment during 1995, with a focus on the extent of turnover. State Medicaid 		Research Files (SMRF) from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) are 		the primary data source. The findings indicate: 1) Declines in state welfare 		caseloads are associated with declines in Medicaid enrollment, particularly for 		parents; (2) Many welfare leavers are not staying on Medicaid and are at risk 		of becoming uninsured; (3) Medicaid programs appear to disproportionately lose 		low-cost welfare leavers while continuing to cover those with higher costs; (4) 		States are experiencing considerable turnover in their Medicaid caseloads.</p>

<p>What Works Best for Whom: Impacts of 20 Welfare-to-Work Programs by 		Subgroup</p>
<p>During the ten years prior to the Personal Responsibility and Work 		Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996, large-scale rigorous studies 		of welfare-to-work (WtW) programs were launched in many states and counties. 		This report investigates results from 20 of these programs to determine who has 		benefited from welfare-to-work programs (and who has not) and whether some 		practices appear more effective than others at increasing the employment and 		earnings of single-parent welfare recipients. All the programs required some 		portion of the welfare caseload to participate in a WtW program or risk losing 		some or all of their welfare benefits through sanctions. The researchers used 		an experimental research design in which individuals were assigned at random 		either to a program group, which was required to participate in an employment 		or training program, or to a control group, which did not have access to the 		program. The findings are described in brief, including 1) People in the 		program groups had higher earnings and lower welfare payments than people in 		the control groups, but generally had the same combined income from earnings, 		AFDC, and Food Stamps. 2) Employment-focused programs tended to be more 		effective than education-focused programs for the more disadvantaged groups. 		Programs that provided a mix of first activities tended to help the broadest 		range of people.</p>

<p>Community-Level Indicators for Understanding Health and Human Services 		Issues</p>
<p>Local governments, private civic improvement organizations, community 		foundations and private community-based services organizations are beginning to 		build and use data sets to create local indicator systems that, in turn, have 		become fundamental tools for tracking and understanding community viability, 		health and social functioning. The HHS, Office of the Secretary for Planning 		and Evaluation (ASPE) has a keen interest in partnering with states and 		localities to further the availability and appropriate use of local- level 		data. This compendium is a useful tool for achieving that goal. This compendium 		is a resource for people in local, state and federal government agencies, 		private sector organizations and others who are interested in learning more 		about the growing use of community-level social indicators. It is designed as a 		user-friendly tool that showcases an interesting and diverse selection of 		indicator systems and resource organizations. It is intended to facilitate 		information sharing among those who are doing local indicator work and to 		provide background information for those who are new to this rapidly evolving 		area of interest. By focusing attention specifically on community-based 		indicator systems, this publication may also increase awareness of current data 		resources and inform discussions of strategies for improving the availability, 		quality and applicability of local indicator data.</p>

<p>Food Safety Strategic Elements: Evaluation Synthesis Findings and 		Research Needs: Final Report</p>
<p>The purpose of this evaluation synthesis is to identify research needs 		and directions for enhancing our knowledge base in food safety. Using the 		President's Council on Food Safety's Draft Preliminary Food Safety Strategic 		Plan, the first step in the process consisted of identifying key elements 		critical to achieving the draft food safety goals and objectives. While the 		Council's plan is comprehensive and includes microbial, chemical and physical 		hazards, this report is limited to microbial hazards. Once the key elements 		were selected and the research review questions clearly defined, a review was 		conducted of the scientific research literature related to the policy-relevant 		question for each of the eight food safety elements. The report is divided into 		three sections: Section 1 - provides an overview of the report; Section 2 - 		summarizes the scientific research literature on the eight strategic elements. 		For each element, a specific research question is stated followed by a summary 		of key findings from the literature; and Section 3 - provides information on 		future research needs which constitute the starting point of a two- fold 		process in developing a food safety research agenda. The first step is the 		idea-generating and feedback phase. The second step is the development of a 		process for and the prioritization of the generated list of research needs in 		line with a strategic plan for food safety.</p>

<p>A Comparative Study of the Outcomes and Costs Associated with Medicare 		Post-Acute Services in Skilled Nursing Faciities, Rehabilitation 		Hospitals/Units</p>
<p>This project will study the cost-effectiveness of Medicare post-acute 		care services for Medicare beneficiaries with certain conditions, within and 		across post-acute care settings and over episodes of care. The study will 		examine: (1) demographic and health-related characteristics of Medicare 		beneficiaries who use post-acute services following a hospital stay to 		determine how much overlap there is in the patient populations treated by each 		provider type and across provider types; (2) patterns of service use and costs 		associated with the treatment of similar patients in each setting and across 		episodes of care; (3) outcomes for similar Medicare beneficiaries by each 		post-acute provider type and across episodes including those in which multiple 		providers are used; (4) relationship between outcomes for similar patients and 		differences in the mix and intensity of services provided, and level of 		reimbursement across post-acute care providers and episodes of care; and (5) 		core measures that are most useful to incorporate into on-going reporting 		requirements to monitor outcomes in each post-acute care setting and across 		episodes of care.</p>

<p>Analyses of Changes in Elderly Disability Rates: Implications for Health 		Care Utilization and Costs</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to conduct analyses using the 1984 to 		1999 National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) and the Medicare Current 		Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) to understand the nature of recent declines in 		elderly disability rates and their implications for health care utilization and 		costs. Specifically, researchers are (1) decomposing changes in elderly 		disability rates using the 1984 to 1999 NLTCS and exploring possible reasons 		for the decline, and (2) linking changes in elderly disability rates to the use 		of specific medical procedures (e.g., cataract surgery, coronary and joint 		replacement surgeries) and/or assistive technology. The MCBS is the primary 		data set for the latter analyses.</p>

<p>Analyses of Residential Transition of Older Americans</p>
<p>There are four main questions to be addressed in this project: (1) How 		do characteristics (both individual and environmental) of elderly persons 		residing in institutional settings differ from those residing in 		community-based settings? (2) How do these characteristics vary over time? (3) 		Are there differences in these characteristics between subgroups of 		institutionalized and non-institutionalized elderly? (4) What is the 		relationship between selected individual and environmental factors and the 		transition of the elderly between community and institutional residential 		settings? Data from six years of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey will 		be used to answer these questions. Understanding residential transitions will 		help staff in the Department improve surveys that monitor acute health and 		long-term care use in different settings (e.g., the Medical Expenditure Panel 		Survey) and address outstanding long-term care policy issues (e.g., allocation 		of resources between community and institutional settings).</p>

<p>Analysis of the Disability Supplement to the National Health Interview 		Survey</p>
<p>The disability supplement to the National Health Interview Survey 		(NHIS-D) is the first comprehensive survey on disability in the United States. 		The survey is unique in that it focuses on several populations of persons with 		disabilities who are generally omitted or under-represented in national survey 		efforts: children, persons with mental retardation and other developmental 		disabilities and the working-age population. The goal of this project is to 		conduct a series of analyses and produce both short-term products and final 		reports that will inform ongoing Assistant Secretary for Planning and 		Evaluation (ASPE) departmental and administrative research and policy 		initiatives. The analyses will address a specific set of questions in four 		topical areas using the NHIS-D: (1) welfare receipt and disability (including 		chronic illness); (2) disability and chronic illness among low income 		populations; (3) childhood disability and chronic illness; and (4) employment 		and disability.</p>

<p>Case Studies and Technical Assistance for Medicaid Buy-Ins for People 		with Disabilities</p>
<p>In an effort to encourage more states to provide Medicaid to working 		individuals with disabilities, and to give states addition options for 		providing Medicaid to those individuals, Congress permitted states to expand 		their Medicaid programs (through a Medicaid "buy-in") and allow people with 		disabilities to continue to receive Medicaid services even if they return to 		work and have earnings greater than 100% of the Federal Poverty Level. The goal 		of this project is to: (1) examine the early implementation experiences of 		states that have opted for a Medicaid buy-in for people with disabilities, and 		(2) offer technical assistance to states on developing cost models, design 		features of a buy-in, as well as implementation and administration 		considerations for a buy-in. The project represents a unique opportunity to 		compare the design and implementation experiences of different states, and use 		the information gathered to inform both state and federal policy makers about 		strategies for improving systems that support the employment of people with 		disabilities.</p>

<p>Characteristics of Nursing Home Residents</p>
<p>Caring for persons with disabilities in the least restrictive setting is 		a major long-term policy objective. It is important to identify nursing home 		residents who could be discharged to the community if appropriate home and 		community-based services were available. This project will analyze data from 		the Minimum Data Set (MDS). The MDS consists of assessments which have been 		conducted on all nursing home residents in selected States as part of a HCFA 		demonstration (and starting the summer of 1998, the data will be collected in 		all 50 States). Using this new data set will provide more information about the 		medical conditions, functional needs, and specific services used by nursing 		home residents than was possible with previous data sets. It will also be 		possible to study important subpopulations, especially the nonelderly.</p>

<p>Clarifying the Definition of Homebound and Medical Necessity Using OASIS 		Data</p>
<p>Home health care services are covered in full for Medicare beneficiaries 		who meet a set of coverage criteria. Though most coverage criteria are 		straightforward, there is no operational definition to either the homebound or 		the medical necessity criteria that can be used uniformly by providers and 		intermediaries. The vagueness of these two criteria led to wide interpretations 		by and subsequent problems for the Fiscal Intermediaries and providers as well. 		The purpose of this project is to develop and test a set of uniform and 		reliable indicators that can be systematically used to document and monitor two 		Medicare home health care coverage criteria: the "Homebound" and the "Medical 		Necessity" criteria. The indicators will be linked to items from the Outcome 		and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) in a decision tree algorithm (or a logic 		model). Two decision algorithms will be developed for the two criteria. The 		algorithms will represent a major step toward helping providers, HCFA, and the 		intermediaries in administering the home health benefit.</p>

Specifically, the 		project will use data from the 1994 and 1995 disability supplements to the 		National Health Interview Survey (NHIS-D), the 1997 National Health Interview 		Survey (NHIS), and the 1992 and 1993 panels of the Survey of Income and Program 		Participation to develop concise measures of disabilities in children. The 		method of development will use two leading conceptual models of disability: 		that of the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research (NCMRR) and 		that of the World Health Organization (WHO). The intent of these concise 		measures is to provide reliable sets of indicators that are sensitive to 		subgroups of children to be used in population sample surveys and survey-based 		surveillance systems.</p>

<p>Evaluation of Practice in Care (EPIC)</p>
<p>From 1989 to 1992, there was a 210 percent increase in Medicare 		expenditures for home health services. This increase in utilization has 		generated policy interest in measures to control expenditures without 		compromising quality. Medicare home health has been the subject of considerable 		research, but the actual practice of home health care has not been extensively 		examined. This study will: (1) analyze "episodes" of care under the Medicare 		home health benefit, (2) assess the actual practice of care, (3) determine the 		extent to which there is variation in practice between acute and long-term care 		patients, and (4) uncover the factors accounting for that variation. The study 		will also examine decision-making processes between patients, providers and 		physicians. The events that take place during a visit and between visits as 		"actual practice" has never been measured. Furthermore, the function of 		decision- making by various parties has not been observed in "actual practice". 		This effort to understand issues surrounding regional and practice variations 		of home health care delivery will aid the Department of Health and Human 		Services and the industry in combatting fraud and abuse, as well as contribute 		valuable data to a future prospective payment system.</p>

<p>Long Term Care Microsimulation Model</p>
<p>The Long-Term Care Financing Model is a resource which has been 		extensively used by ASPE to project future long- term care utilization and 		expenditures and simulate various long term care policy options. These include 		expansions of public financing, such as those proposed during health care 		reform, as well as changes to Medicaid and Medicare. The model has also been 		used extensively to study private sector policy options, such as the impact of 		further growth on private long-term care insurance and the impacts of changing 		trends in disability rates on long-term care use and expenditures.Recent data 		on disability rates, nursing home use, and home care use will be used to update 		existing portions of the model. In addition, the model will be expanded to 		include acute care use, thereby increasing the ability to simulate a wide range 		of policy options. ASPE will use this computer model for projections and a 		series of policy simulations which will be presented in reports. In addition to 		its previous long-term care policy uses, the revised model will enable ASPE to 		address acute care issues, such as the combined burden of acute and long-term 		care spending on the elderly. Since the model simulates the income and assets 		of the population, including pension and Social Security payments, the model 		will also be used to study other aging-related issues, such as the impact of 		changes in employer-sponsored health insurance for retirees.</p>

<p>The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 mandated major changes in home 		health payment requiring the implementation of a Prospective Payment System 		(PPS) by October 1999 (later delayed until October 2000) and an Interim Payment 		System (IPS) prior to the implementation of PPS. It also contained changes in 		eligibility and coverage for home health services. These changes, while 		intended to reduce Medicare home health costs, run the risk of reducing 		beneficiaries' access to appropriate care and adversely affecting health 		outcomes, especially for beneficiaries needing the most care. Disabled Medicare 		beneficiaries are most vulnerable. The purpose of this project is to study the 		impact of recent payment policy changes on disabled Medicare beneficiaries' 		satisfaction and quality of life with a view toward formulating inferences that 		will inform national home health care policy for the disabled. The study will 		build on a research project recently funded by the Home Care Research 		Initiative of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that examines the direct and 		indirect effects of the BBA changes. The main focus is to examine BBA impacts 		on Medicare beneficiaries' access to care, costs, satisfaction, and quality of 		care.</p>

<p>Personal Assistance Services "Cash and Counseling" 		Demonstration/Evaluation</p>
<p>This study will employ a classical experimental research design (i.e. 		random assignment of participants to treatment and control groups) to test the 		effects of "cashing out" Medicaid-funded personal assistance services for the 		disabled. The demonstration sites are located in Arkansas, New Jersey and 		Florida. Control group members will receive "traditional" benefits in the form 		of case-managed home and community-based services where payments for services 		are made to vendors. Treatment group members will receive a monthly cash 		payment in an amount roughly equal to the cash value of the services that they 		would have received under the traditional program. It is hypothesized that cash 		payments will foster greater client autonomy and that, as a result, consumer 		satisfaction (particularly among disabled persons under age 65) will be 		greater. It is also hypothesized that States will save Medicaid monies (mostly 		in administrative expenses) from cashing out benefits.</p>

<p>Research on Employment Supports for People with Disabilities</p>
<p>Employment rates for people with disabilities have remained low despite 		advances in legislation (especially the Americans with Disabilities Act), the 		availability of technology which can assist with everyday activities and 		work-related functions, and an increase in positive societal attitudes toward 		the integration of people with disabilities into mainstream social 		institutions. Only about 25 percent of people with significant disabilities 		between the ages of 16 and 64 are employed. Most of the policy research on the 		employment of people with disabilities has relied on statistical data from 		national surveys. Detailed information on individuals' experiences was needed 		to augment the survey data. This project will fill that need as it will: (1) 		gather descriptive data about public and private sector employment programs, 		(2) examine successful employment supports, and (3) investigate the factors 		that affect the ability of people with significant disabilities to work. Focus 		groups, examining the supports important to people with disabilities who are 		competitively employed, will be conducted in three cities. Policy papers, 		summarizing the results of the focus groups, will be completed by March 2001. 		The topics of the policy papers will include: transitions to employment, 		supports for employment, role of health insurance, role of employers, and 		supports used by individuals with mental disabilities.</p>

<p>Construction of an Integrated Measure of the Burden of Disease</p>
<p>The burden of disease in a population consists of the morbidity and 		disability experienced by its members, their psychological perception of the 		adequacy and effectiveness of the care they receive, and resources expended for 		health maintenance.

<p>Development and Validation of a Performance Measure Set for the 		Evaluation of Medicaid Services Rendered to People with Developmental 		Disabilities</p>
<p>Many public policies seek to influence the decisions employers make 		about whether and how to offer health benefits to their employees. The process 		of how employers make such decisions, however, is largely unknown. The Office 		of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation convened two panels of 		senior corporate managers to discuss how firms make decisions about health 		benefits. The purpose was to help the office formulate a more comprehensive 		view of employer decision-making by posing common questions to a cross-section 		of knowledgeable people, and to identify issues that may be empirically 		measured. The long-term goal is to be able to better determine how public 		policies affect or influence the decisions made by employers and unions 		regarding health coverage. The first meeting focused on the "strategic" trends 		and issues affecting employer health coverage, addressing such questions as, 		"What is the role of the employer in shaping health care markets?" The second 		meeting focused on the internal and operational issues of how employers make 		health benefit decisions, addressing such questions as: "At what level of the 		corporate structure are health benefit decisions made?"

<p>Impact of Medicare HMO Enrollment on Health Care Costs in California 		</p>
<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation 		(OASPE) is supporting a time series study of the relationships between 		competition in hospital markets and the prices of hospital care, hospital 		revenues and hospital costs. The project began in the late 1980s and was 		extended in 1994 to investigate how health maintenance organization (HMO) 		enrollment affects changes in Medicare payments on behalf of beneficiaries. The 		project will collect time series data on California Hospitals (cost reports 		supplemented by a small survey on selective contracting by the hospital) to 		investigate whether competition continues to depress hospital prices, revenues 		and costs. In addition, several smaller projects are underway to investigate 		whether hospital mergers result in increased prices and a series of 		investigations (individual and county level) to determine if HMO enrollment 		leads to a decline in Medicare costs when other appropriate variables are held 		constant. California is particularly important in this study, because it tends 		to be a trend-setting State.</p>

Research findings will be used to refine the 		standards HCFA requires States to meet in order to enroll children with special 		health care needs into capitated Medicaid managed care plans, and to assess 		States' ability to meet these standards. Policy makers are interested in 		addressing the issue of whether Medicaid plans and providers are meeting the 		complex needs of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) children, for example, but 		the lack of concrete data or information related to the experience of this 		population in Medicaid managed care hamper their efforts. In response, HCFA has 		developed interim review criteria that will be applied to all upcoming 1915(b) 		waiver applications and renewals from States. The criteria establishes 		requirements regarding definition, identification, tracking, and access to care 		for children with special health care needs enrolled in capitated managed care 		arrangements. This study will help HCFA and the States move forward with this 		important effort by providing critical information about current State activity 		and insights as to how these criteria can be refined, improved, and 		operationalized.</p>

<p>A Research Synthesis of the Findings from ASPE's "Leavers" Grants</p>
<p>This study will critically analyze and synthesize the findings of ASPE's 		grants that have studied welfare outcomes for individuals and families who have 		left cash assistance under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) 		program. The project will result in an Initial Synthesis Report and a Final 		Report. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation 		(ASPE) awarded grants to states and counties to study the outcomes of welfare 		reform on individuals and families who leave TANF, individuals and families 		entering the caseload, and TANF applicants and potential TANF applicants. All 		of the grantees are using a combination of linked administrative data and 		surveys to study the outcomes of the TANF "leavers." The grantees include: 		Arizona, Cuyahoga County, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Los 		Angeles, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, San Mateo County, Washington, and 		Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Abstinence-based Teen Pregnancy Prevention Efforts Targeting Boys</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to: (1) identify abstinence-based 		pregnancy prevention programs that target boys or both boys and girls; (2) 		utilize a framework to assess and summarize the state of the field; and (3) 		provide the information in a format useful to state, local, and community 		policy-makers. Adolescent pregnancy is a complex issue, and understanding its 		causes, as well as effective prevention strategies, is still not 		well-developed. Traditionally, adolescent pregnancy prevention research and 		programs have focused on adolescent girls. It is becoming increasingly clear, 		however, that adolescent boys and young men must share that focus. At the same 		time, there has been a recent influx of funding for programs that use an 		abstinence-based approach. States and communities have shown an interest in 		providing services and programs for boys and young men, but have also expressed 		frustration that they do not have access to information about what strategies 		have been tried, if these have been successful, and how they can access funding 		for the development and operation of these programs. The project will result in 		a final report identifying existing abstinence-based teen pregnancy prevention 		efforts undertaken by youth organizations serving boys, target populations, and 		results of any evaluation activities. It will include information on issues of 		approach, cost, target group, impact, community support, geography, 		race/ethnicity, and special needs. This project is an integral part of the 		Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) National Strategy to Prevent 		Teen Pregnancy and the Clinton Administration's Fatherhood Initiative.</p>

<p>Disaggregating the TANF Child-Only Caseload in Three States</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to give the Department of Health and Human 		Services more detailed information about the make-up and trends of the 		Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) child- only population three 		States. Child-only cases are those in which benefits are paid only on behalf of 		minor children, and there are no adults in the household receiving assistance. 		In some cases the children are living with adults other than their parents. In 		such a case, the caretaker receives assistance on behalf of the child, but not 		for himself/herself. In other cases, a parent is in the household but is 		ineligible for benefits for one of several reasons, including: (1) receipt of 		SSI, (2) unqualified alien status, or (3) imposed sanctions. Such cases 		currently make up 21 percent of the TANF caseload, a proportion which has grown 		significantly in recent years. This study will use administrative data, case 		file reviews, and interviews with program and policy staff in three States to 		provide a better understanding of the issues regarding child-only TANF cases. 		</p>

<p>Domestic Violence and Welfare: An Early Assessment</p>
<p>This project will study early implementation of the Temporary Assistance 		for Needy Families (TANF) Family Violence Option and child support enforcement 		program responses, including the use of good cause waivers for battered women. 		Evidence suggests that some battered women seek employment and child support 		while others need specialized assistance in addressing partner abuse. To 		address domestic violence, States may have policies regarding screening and 		other forms of identification, assessment of a battered woman's needs, service 		provision, confidentiality, corroboration required, staffing arrangements, 		agreements with community resources and other considerations. The study will 		provide information about these policy issues, the status of program 		implementation and descriptions of useful models.</p>

<p>Economic and Health Status of Immigrants, Their Communities, and the 		Organizations that Serve Them</p>
<p>This project will conduct research on the economic and health status of 		immigrants, their communities and the organizations serving them. The research 		will profile the status of immigrants with regard to health, employment and 		participation in programs administered by public and private agencies, with 		special attention to distinguishing categories of immigrants and drawing 		comparisons with the citizen population. The project will also explore the 		impacts of welfare reform on immigrants and organizations, with special 		attention to both individual and institutional adaptations. Since the loss of 		food stamps appears to be the most far-reaching and permanent change affecting 		current legal immigrants, its impact on immigrants and their families will also 		be a focus of the study. The project will supplement an examination of existing 		secondary data with intensive data collection in Los Angeles and New York, the 		two cities that together account for one-fourth of the immigrant population. 		Primary data collection in the two cities has been designed to develop profiles 		of immigrants in these cities and the agencies serving them. This effort has 		several components, including: (1) interviews with 1,650 immigrant households 		in each city; (2) telephone interviews with most of the non-profit agencies 		providing services to immigrants; (3) in-depth interviews with 100 immigrants 		who lose Food Stamps and with additional immigrants who retain food stamps in 		each city; and (4) in-depth interviews with administrators and staff in public 		and private agencies.</p>

<p>Indicators of Welfare Dependence</p>
<p>The Welfare Indicators Act of 1994 requires the Department of Health and 		Human Services to prepare annual reports to Congress on indicators and 		predictors of welfare dependence. Each annual Report on Welfare Indicators is 		developed with the advice and recommendations of the bipartisan Advisory Board 		on Welfare indicators, the assistance of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 		the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Bureau of the Census. The 		purpose of this report, as stated in the law, is "to provide the public with 		generally accepted measures of welfare receipt so that it can track such 		receipt over time and determine whether progress is being made in reducing the 		rate at which and, to the extent feasible, the degree to which, families depend 		on income from welfare programs and the duration of welfare receipt."</p>

<p>Low-Income and Low-Skilled Worker's Involvement in Non-Standard 		Employment</p>
<p>A growing proportion of the work force is involved in forms of 		nonstandard employment such as temporary work, and there is apparently 		considerable overlap between the nonstandard workforce and at-risk populations 		such as the low-income and low-skilled and public assistance recipients or 		ex-recipients. These circumstances have combined to spur a strong policy 		interest in the implications of nonstandard employment for the well-being of 		those who enter it. This project was developed to achieve a greater 		understanding of the circumstances, characteristics and trends of those 		involved in the alternative workforce who are most at risk of welfare 		dependency--i.e., current assistance recipients and the low- income and 		low-skilled in general. It is hoped that insight will be gained into the 		conditions of the nonstandard work sectors, the experiences of employers hiring 		welfare clients to fill nonstandard slots, to better understand the employment 		context for these at-risk populations. The overall aim in doing these 		descriptive analyses is to answer the question: Are those at risk of welfare 		dependency who enter nonstandard employment better or worse off than their 		counterparts in more traditional jobs?</p>

<p>National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS)</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is undertaking a study 		of the effectiveness of welfare-to-work programs. as part of the National 		Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS), the effects of two approaches 		to preparing welfare recipients for employment will be compared in three sites 		(Atlanta, Grand Rapids, and Riverside). In one approach, the human capital 		development approach, individuals are directed to avail themselves of education 		services and, to a lesser extent, occupational training before they seek work, 		under the theory that they will then be able to get better jobs and keep them 		longer. In the other approach, the labor force attachment approach, individuals 		are encouraged to gain quick entry into the labor market, even at low wages, 		under the theory that their work habits and skills will improve on the job and 		they will thereby be able to advance themselves. The evaluation uses a random 		assignment design in order to get reliable results. Sample members are being 		followed for five years from the time they entered the study. Comprehensive 		data on economic outcomes, including information on quarterly Unemployment 		Insurance-reported earnings and monthly Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 		(TANF) and Food Stamp payments is being collected.</p>

<p>Pregnancy Prevention Programs Targeting Boys and Young Men: Policy 		Information Dissemination Strategy</p>
<p>This project will develop a research and policy information strategy to 		inform regional, State, and local policy officials and community-based 		organizations serving children and youth of the program models, primarily 		directed at boys and young men, that can be implemented to help teenagers avoid 		premature sexual activity and unintended pregnancies. Project staff will: (1) 		review activities within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and 		outside the Federal government to collect information about pregnancy 		prevention activities targeted at boys and young men; (2) meet with national, 		State, and community leaders to determine information needs; (3) develop 		information packets; and (4) test strategies to get information to State and 		community decision makers in a timely and usable format. This project is an 		integral part of the National Strategy to Prevent Teen Pregnancy and the 		Clinton Administration's Fatherhood Initiative, which promotes delaying 		fatherhood until a man is emotionally and financially ready, and encourages 		fathers to take a more active role in providing support and guidance to their 		children. It is also being undertaken in collaboration with the activities of 		the non-profit, non-partisan National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.</p>

<p>The National Evaluation of the Welfare to Work Grants Program</p>
<p>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 authorized the Department of Labor to 		award $3 billion in Welfare-to- Work grants to States and local communities to 		promote job opportunities and employment preparation for the hardest-to-employ 		recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and for non- 		custodial parents of children on TANF. This project is evaluating the 		effectiveness of Welfare-to-Work initiatives, including those undertaken by the 		Welfare-to-Work grantees and by American Indian and Alaska Native tribal 		organizations.The Deparment of Health and Human Services (DHHS), in conjunction 		with the Departments of Labor and Housing and Urban Development, has designed 		an evaluation to address four key questions: (1) What are the types and 		packages of services provided by Welfare-to- Work grantees? (2) What are 		Welfare-to-Work program participants outcomes regarding employment and 		family well-being? (3) What challenges are confronted as grantees implement and 		operate the programs? (4) How well do private industry councils and other 		non-TANF organizations meet the challenges of implementing the programs for the 		hard to employ? The evaluation study includes three main components: (1) a 		descriptive assessment of all Welfare-to-Work grantees based on mail surveys 		and site visits; (2) in-depth process and implementation study; and (3) a 		special process and implementation study focusing on tribal welfare and 		employment systems.</p>

This panel study will assist the department in: (1) reviewing existing 		research efforts on the effects of welfare reform; (2) examining the 		appropriate data sources, research designs and statistical methods for 		analyzing welfare reform outcomes; and (3) identifying research gaps and data 		needs for the continued study of welfare reform. Specific topics to be covered 		by the panel of experts include: (1) the appropriate outcome measures needed to 		effectively evaluate the outcomes of welfare reform; (2) the appropriate 		population of study; (3) the design and usefulness of existing national-level 		surveys (e.g., the Survey of Program Dynamics and the Survey of Income and 		Program Participation); (4) data needs for monitoring State and sub-State 		variation in outcomes; (5) potential uses and limitations of administrative 		data; and (6) integration of survey and administrative data. Over the course of 		the study, the NAS expert panel will address the above mentioned tasks through 		workshops, quarterly panel meetings and the publication of both an interim 		report and a final report. The interim report (see PIC # 7145.1) included early 		recommendations of the panel and the final report will document the 		comprehensive list of final recommendations to the department.</p>

<p>Welfare Reform and Changing Program Participation Patterns in Four 		States</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to understand how families' use of a 		variety of safety net programs changes over time as welfare reform is 		implemented. This will be an early look at how welfare waivers and the welfare 		reform law influenced families' program participation. Using administrative 		data in four States from 1994-1997, the study will examine a series of 		questions regarding whether families' program participation patterns change in 		response to program eligibility changes and policy shifts. It will examine the 		child and family outcomes in such areas as family self sufficiency, child 		living arrangements and child abuse and neglect reports. The study's unique 		contribution will be its effort to look at families' pathways across a series 		of safety net programs.</p>

<p>Trends in Demand for Emergency Assistance Services</p>
<p>Since 1993, the number of families receiving federally-funded assistance 		under Title IV-A of the Social Security Act (welfare) has declined by 50%. 		While many studies have addressed the circumstances of those who have left 		welfare, little research has examined: 1) the impact that declining caseloads 		and welfare reform may have on the demand for and utilization of services from 		the perspective of community- level emergency assistance providers, and 2) 		reasons for changes in the composition of clients using such services (e.g., 		increasing over-representation of of single mothers). The Office of the 		Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) is committed to research 		in this latter area in order to determine the outcomes of welfare reform. Since 		1999, ASPE has carried out an ongoing project to support the efforts of state 		and local research organizations in examining the question of whether declining 		welfare caseloads and TANF implementation have led to a shift in the demand 		and/or utilization of emergency assistance programs, especially those that 		provide food and shelter, and to explore some of the reasons this may be 		occurring. Using grant and contract approaches, the analyses rely upon provider 		data in conjunction with socioeconomic and caseload information over time to 		describe and understand trends in demand for and use of emergency assistance 		providers at the state and local levels.</p>
