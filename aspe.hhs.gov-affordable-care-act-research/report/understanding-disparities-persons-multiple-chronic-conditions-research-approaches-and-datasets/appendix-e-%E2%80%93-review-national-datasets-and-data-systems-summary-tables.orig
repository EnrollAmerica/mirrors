</tr><tr><td><strong>Description:</strong></td>
<td>CAHPS is a series of surveys that are used to ask consumers and patients about their experiences with healthcare. These surveys cover a wide spectrum of topics, such as provider communication skills and healthcare access. The goal of CAHPS is two-fold: 1) to develop standardized patient surveys that can be used to compare results across providers over time and 2) to generate tools and resources users can use to create comparative information for all stakeholders. There are CAHPS surveys for a variety of different care settings, including hospital, home health care, health plans, and in- center hemodialysis and clinician groups.</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Database</strong><br />(Scope, Size, Setting, Population, Age Range)</td>
<td>CAHPS surveys are used at various levels in the healthcare delivery system; anywhere from individual practices to national samples.</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Database Type:</strong><br />(Survey, Registry, Research Study, Program Database, Claims, Administrative Data, and Clinical Databases)</td>
<td>Survey &amp; Program Database. The CAHPS Database is a compilation of survey results from a large pool of healthcare consumers that are maintained in a national database.</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Database Source/Origin:</strong></td>
<td>Survey Data</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Date or Frequency of Data Collection:</strong></td>
<td>Annually, since 1995.</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Longitudinal vs. Cross-sectional Database:</strong></td>
<td>Serial Cross-Sectional Survey</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Data Collection Methodology:</strong></td>
<td>Data collection methodology varies by CAHPS sponsor and vendors administering the CAHPS survey. Surveys can be completed via the mail, telephone or internet.</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Sampling Strategy:</strong></td>
<td>Sampling strategies for CAHPS vary by sponsor. CAHPS provides guidelines for sampling, including determining eligibility, calculating the estimated sample size needed for reporting, and creating a sub-sample of a specific patient population.</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Unit of Analysis:</strong></td>
<td>Multiple (patients, providers, health plan, etc.) and dependent on survey type.</td>
</tr><tr><td class="active" colspan="2"><strong>Diagnosis Information</strong></td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Diagnosis Variable Type:</strong><br />(Chronic Condition Status, Principal Diagnosis, Primary Diagnosis, Secondary Diagnosis, Admit/Discharge Diagnosis and Self-Reported Diagnosis)</td>
<td>A patient’s principal diagnosis at discharge is used to determine whether he or she falls into a specific service line for CAHPS eligibility. Diagnosis is not capture on the survey itself.</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Diagnosis Codes:</strong><br />(ICD-9, ICD-10, SNOMED, CPT)</td>
<td>Principal diagnosis ICD-9 codes at discharge.</td>

</tr><tr><td><strong>Measures of Healthcare Utilization:</strong><br />(Number of Visits, Any Procedures/Number of Procedures/Type of Procedure, Number of Admission/Type of Admission, Length of Stay, Hospitalizations, Emergency Department Utilization, etc.)</td>
<td>CAHPS does not include measures of healthcare utilization, but the number of survey respondents can be used as a proxy for the number of discharges.</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Measures of Healthcare Access:</strong></td>
<td>Ease of access to healthcare services.</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Demographic Information:</strong><br />(Sex, Age, Race, Ethnicity, Marital Status, Disability Status, Language, Insurance Type, Educational Attainment).</td>

</tr><tr><td class="active" colspan="2"><strong>Strengths, Limitations &amp; Feasibility</strong></td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Data Strengths:</strong></td>
<td>Select CAHPS datasets contain a large number of minority respondents. Data are collected on key health policy issues, including health status.</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Data Limitations:</strong></td>
<td>The CAHPS survey is not administered in a consistent fashion. The CAHPS database is a collection of surveys administered at various levels. As such, not all providers participate each year, so the mix of users will vary across years. Sampling and data collection methods also vary by user and are cross-sectional.</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Data Access Restrictions:</strong></td>
<td>To access CAHPS data, a data release agreement, description of the planned research, and IRB documentation must be submitted to AHRQ. Survey instruments are publically available.</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Data Linking Feasibility</strong><br />(Unique identifiers or sufficient demographics to allow for data linkages)</td>
<td>No unique identifiers. However, CAHPS surveys have been administered to Medicare Fee-for-Service patients, which may have resulted in a linked CAHPS-claim dataset.</td>

</tr><tr><td><strong>Data Limitations:</strong></td>
<td>Missing data values can compromise the quality of estimates. If the outcome for discharges with missing values is different from the outcome for discharges with valid values, then sample estimates for that outcome will be biased and inaccurately represent the discharge population. For example, race is missing on over 11% of discharges in the 2010 NIS because some hospitals and HCUP State Partners do not supply it. Not all states report patient identifiers and complete diagnostic information.</td>

Medical examinations and laboratory tests follow very specific protocols and are as standard as possible to ensure comparability across sites and providers. Beginning in 1999, NHANES became a continuous, annual survey. Data are collected every year from a representative sample of the civilian non-institutionalized U.S. population, newborns and older, by in-home personal interviews and physical examinations in the mobile examination centers.</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>Sampling Strategy:</strong></td>
<td>The sample design is a complex, multistage, clustered design using unequal probabilities of selection. Low-income persons, adolescents 12-19 years of age, persons 60 years of age and over, African Americans, and persons of Mexican origin are oversampled. The sample is not designed to provide nationally representative estimates for the population of U.S Hispanics.</td>

<p>The National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) is a new resource for the scientific study of functioning in later life. The NHATS is being conducted by the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, with data collection by Westat, and support from the National Institute on Aging. In design and content, NHATS is intended to foster research that will guide efforts to reduce disability, maximize health and independent functioning, and enhance quality of life at older ages.</p>
<p>The NHATS will gather information on a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 and older. In-person interviews will be used to collect detailed information on activities of daily life, living arrangements, economic status and well-being, aspects of early life, and quality of life. Among the specific content areas included are: the general and technological environment of the home, health conditions, work status and participation in valued activities, mobility and use of assistive devices, cognitive functioning, and help provided with daily activities (self-care, household, and medical). Study participants will be re-interviewed every year in order to compile a record of change over time. The content and questions included in NHATS were developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers from the fields of demography, geriatric medicine, epidemiology, health services research, economics, and gerontology.</p>
<p>As the population ages, NHATS will provide the basis for understanding trends in late-life functioning, how these differ for various population subgroups, and the economic and social consequences of aging and disability for individuals, families, and society.</p>
