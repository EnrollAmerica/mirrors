    <p>Beginning with the earliest published reports in 1987, the literature on homeless children now spans about 23 years. Viewing these studies in the aggregate, a set of “first generation” studies, many of which were reviewed 15 years ago by Rafferty and Shinn (1991), can be distinguished from a second stage of investigations published after the review. The first studies conducted on homeless children sounded a public health alarm (Alperstein, Rappaport, &amp; Flanigan, 1987; Bassuk &amp; Rubin, 1987; Miller &amp; Lin, 1988; Rescorla, Parker, &amp; Stolley, 1991; Wood, Valdez, Hayashi, &amp; Shen, 1990). Findings indicated that homeless children had a range of health and mental health problems. Data for these investigations were collected in the mid-1980s, not long after the issue of homelessness for families became apparent in the United States.</p>
<p>A second generation of studies followed in the early 1990s to further clarify the impact of homelessness on children (Buckner, 2004). Some of these investigations were funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, while others were supported by foundations and other funding sources. Investigators who conducted these studies attempted to further an understanding of the effects of homelessness on children by involving larger study populations, including comparison groups of housed children from low-income families, administering a greater breadth and quality of assessment instruments, and applying more advanced statistical techniques with which to analyze the data (Bassuk, Weinreb, Dawson, Perloff, &amp; Buckner, 1997; Buckner, Bassuk, Weinreb, &amp; Brooks, 1999; Masten, Miliotis, Graham-Bermann, Ramirez, &amp; Neemann, 1993; Rafferty, Shinn, &amp; Weitzman, 2004; Rubin, Erickson, San Agustin, Cleary, Allen, &amp; Cohen, 1996; Schteingart, Molnar, Klein, Lowe, &amp; Hartmann, 1995; Shinn et al., 2008; Zeismer, Marcoux, &amp; Marwell, 1994).</p>
<p>Almost all investigations of homeless children sample children in shelter in the midst of an episode of homelessness. As such, all homeless children in these studies fit the HUD definition of homelessness. Masten and colleagues (1993) described children as falling on a “continuum of risk” in which children who experience homelessness are worse off than other poor children, and both are worse off than middle class groups. That is, children who are homeless share all of the adversities of poverty and also experience additional risks associated with episodes of homelessness, which for most are temporary.</p>
<p>By and large, differences between children in homeless shelters and poor domiciled children are smaller in recent, second-generation, research than in earlier research (Buckner, 2008). Buckner suggests three principal reasons for this. First, as more and more families experience episodes of homelessness in tight housing markets, differences between poor families that do and do not become homeless are diminished. In a housing market in the early stages of dwindling supply, family difficulties (such as mental health or substance use problems in mothers), which can put children at risk, are prominent in explaining which families are most vulnerable to experiencing homelessness. Over time, as the housing supply worsens, families that become homeless will have characteristics increasingly similar to the broader group of low-income housed families. Thus, the family-level risks that children are exposed to will be more alike in each group. Second, as shelter conditions have improved in many jurisdictions and as legal changes and funding have reduced obstacles to stable schooling for children, the plight of sheltered homeless children may have become less severe. Third, homeless children and children from low-income families living in housed conditions are exposed to many of the same stressors, such as community and family violence. As such, the effects of homelessness per se, above and beyond the effects of poverty, can sometimes be difficult to discern.</p>
<p>Buckner (2005, 2008) conducted a comprehensive review of the published literature on homeless children from its inception in 1987 through 2005. The chief criteria for inclusion in this review were that the study be published in an academic journal and that it involve a comparison of homeless children to either normative data on children or a housed comparison group. This eliminated unpublished reports or a few studies that examined only homeless children. The dominant research question across these publications was ascertaining the impact of homelessness on children, an issue that requires comparative data. Some studies focused on a particular domain, such as mental health or academic achievement, while others looked across several domains. With studies that examined children of different age groups and/or across various domains, findings from the same overall investigation can sometimes be found dispersed across academic journals due to journals' space limitations and areas of focus (e.g., mental health, education, health). For instance, child-related findings from the Worcester Family Research Project, a comprehensive investigation of 436 homeless and low-income housed mothers and more than 600 of their children conducted in Worcester, Massachusetts, during the 1990s, can be found in various publications (Bassuk et al., 1997; Buckner et al., 1997, 1999, 2001, 2004; Garcia Coll et al., 1998; Weinreb et al., 1998, 2002). While these articles may seem to be separate studies, they report on data collected during the same time period, in the identical community context, and with the same overall study population.</p>
<p>This section of the paper begins with an overview of the demographic characteristics of homeless children and is followed by a review of studies, including those examined by Buckner (2005, 2008) and other studies published more recently. Table 2 (Parts A–D) distinguishes among studies focusing on the impact of homelessness in various domains: health status (Part A), developmental status (Part B), mental health and behavior (Part C), and education/academic achievement (Part D).  The table includes all published studies of the effects of homelessness on children, emphasizing studies that included housed comparison groups and that followed homeless families over time and used relatively comprehensive measurement. This section continues with a discussion of the small number of studies that follow children longitudinally and the finding that homeless children’s outcomes improve with the passage of time. Next, it describes the subgroup of children who become separated from their homeless families. Finally, it concludes with what is known about interventions for homeless families and children.</p>

              <p>As noted above, according to AHAR, just over half (51 percent) of homeless children in emergency shelters and transitional housing were under 6 years of age in 2008, 34 percent were 6 to 12, while only 15 percent were 13 to 17. Slightly over half (51 percent) were Black or African American; 24 percent were White, non-Hispanic or Latino; 13 percent were White and Hispanic or Latino; and the remaining were mixed race (7 percent), American Indian or Alaska Native (2 percent), Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (2 percent), or Asian (1 percent). This racial breakdown refers to all people in homeless families, not just children. Homeless families are more likely than homeless individuals to be members of minority groups.</p>

              <p>As shown in Table 2 Part A, five studies of children’s health produced results consistent with the idea of a continuum of risk. Three studies found homeless children worse off than other poor children, who in turn were worse off than the general population, typically on measures of global health. A fourth, which did not include a poor-housed comparison group, found homeless children worse off than the general population. Only one study found no differences between groups. Overall, although the majority of homeless children were rated by parents as in good or excellent health, the proportion in fair or poor health was greater than for other groups. Homeless children were less likely to have a regular source of medical care and more likely to use emergency rooms. A long-term follow-up study not included in the review found no health differences between formerly homeless and housed children five years after shelter entry, but the children who had been homeless were still less likely to have a usual source of medical care  (Shinn et al., 2008). There were no consistent patterns by age of children. A study of children in 16 supported housing programs in Minnesota found that rates of health insurance, well child checkups, and immunizations were greater than that of the general population of Minnesota (Gewirtz, Hart-Shegos, &amp; Medhanie, 2008).</p>

              <p>As shown in Table 2 Part C, 11 studies reviewed by Buckner (2005, 2008) examined children’s mental health and behavior. Nine studies used maternal reports of both internalizing symptoms (such as depression and anxiety) and externalizing symptoms (disruptive behavior) on the Child Behavior Checklist. Six studies additionally used child reports of depressive symptoms on the Children’s Depression Inventory; one study included teacher reports and one used a diagnostic interview. All 11 studies found homeless children to experience more mental health and behavioral problems than normative samples of the general population, but only five of nine studies that included housed poor children found homeless children to have more problems than their housed peers. The two studies with the strongest measurement (teacher reports and the diagnostic interview) were among those that found no difference between homeless children and their housed peers. Again, these studies are broadly consistent with the continuum of risk, with a substantial effect of poverty and a more modest additional effect of homelessness on children’s mental health and behavior. There were no consistent differences by age of children studied. Shinn and colleagues (2008) found small differences favoring continuously housed over formerly homeless children five years after the homeless children entered shelter on both maternal report and diagnostic interviews, but the differences were largely accounted for by recent stressors rather than past homelessness.</p>

<p>A more recent study (Gewirtz et al., 2008) examined 454 children living in 16 supportive housing programs. Staff had concerns about the psychosocial well-being of 36 percent of the children but, because the study did not use standard measures and had no comparison group, it is hard to know what to make of this percentage. However, the fact that over half of the 100 children age 12–19 had behaved in ways that led to school suspensions would seem to support the staff assessments. Problems in this study increased with the age of the child (Gewirtz et al., 2008). Families of children in this study were eligible for permanent supportive housing because mothers had mental illness, substance abuse problems (most programs), HIV, or experience of domestic violence (one program each), so children were exposed to risks beyond homelessness.</p>

              <p>Nine studies reviewed by Buckner (2005, 2008) examined attendance, achievement, and other academic outcomes for homeless children using a variety of measures (Table 2 Part D). All but one study found homeless children worse off than general population samples; and six of seven studies found them worse off than housed children. The one study that found homeless children equivalent to both housed children and the general population was conducted after the EHCY program was established, reducing school mobility and barriers to school enrollment for homeless children. The age of the children did not appear to be related to findings. In the study of children in supportive housing programs, 22 percent of children age 12–19 but only 8 percent of younger children attended school less than 80 percent of the time.</p>
<p>An important exception to the generalization that studies of homeless children are confined to those who experience shelter is a study in the Minneapolis public schools (Obradovic, Long, Cutuli, Chan, Hinz, Heistad, &amp; Masten, 2009). Children in four primary school grade cohorts who met the criteria for homelessness under the ED definition or who moved three or more times in a 12-month period were classified as “homeless and highly mobile” and were compared to children who were poor (eligible for free or reduced-price lunch) but not homeless or highly mobile, and children who were neither homeless nor highly mobile at any time during the three school years of the study. Homeless and highly mobile children, who made up 9.5 percent of the 14,754 students in the sample, scored significantly lower on both reading and math than other poor children, and both groups fell well below more socioeconomically advantaged peers. In the three oldest cohorts of children, either reading (5<sup>th</sup> grade cohort) or math (3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> grade cohorts) scores also increased faster for advantaged students than for the two disadvantaged groups. There was considerable variability within the homeless and highly mobile group, with approximately 20 percent of students scoring at or above national means, but 40 percent scoring a standard deviation or more below those means.</p>

              <p>Huntington, Buckner, and Bassuk (2008) found that homeless children in Worcester, Massachusetts, could be classified into two distinctly different subgroups based on measures of behavior problems, adaptive functioning, and academic achievement, using cluster analysis. Almost half of the sample was doing well across each of these domains, despite the stressors they faced, while slightly over half of the group was doing more poorly across each of these three realms. These findings were similar for both preschool-age (2–5 years) and school-age children (6–17). This study suggests that homeless children are not a homogenous group and that interventions should be targeted toward those experiencing the most problems.</p>

              <p>Problems of children living in homeless shelters may diminish over time. Buckner, Bassuk, Weinreb, and Brooks (1999) found in a cross-sectional analysis that children’s psychiatric symptoms peaked after about four months in shelter; thereafter, children seemed to adapt to the shelter environment. One to two years after living in shelter, the initial effects of homelessness on children's internalizing problems that were noted by Buckner and colleagues (1999) had diminished (Buckner, Beardslee, &amp; Bassuk, 2004). Longitudinally, they observed exposure to violence, which can impact homeless and housed children alike, to be a more potent predictor of children's mental health problems over time than homelessness. And in a longitudinal study, Shinn and colleagues (2008) found only modest differences across all domains between housed poor children and homeless children who remained with their families five years after shelter entry, by which time most families were re-housed. Differences between groups were more strongly related to current stressors than to past homelessness. Using a city’s Board of Education records for children in the same sample, Rafferty and colleagues (2004) found that the about-to-be homeless children did not differ from continuously housed children in achievement before the homeless children entered shelter. Rather, the homeless children’s performance dropped while they were in shelter and partially recovered after they were re-housed, so that they no longer differed significantly from the other poor children. Over the five years following shelter entry, the homeless youth had more school mobility and greater grade retention (repeating a grade) than poor, continually housed youth.</p>
<p>The eight sites of the Homeless Families Program funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) enrolled over 1,100 children ages 2–16 years while they were living in shelter and followed them (and their mothers) for 15 months. Families were eligible if mothers had a mental illness or substance problem. Children's behavior problems were measured repeatedly over four time points. A fairly similar pattern was observed in which behavior problems were initially elevated when children were assessed in a shelter environment but then moderated in severity over time as families became re-housed (Buckner, Weinreb, Rog, Holupka, &amp; Samuels, in press). Five subgroups of children were identified by these investigators. The trajectory of behavior problems over time looked virtually identical across these groups (some initial elevation followed by improvement). What was different was the initial level of behavior problems these different groups had (ranging from virtually none to severe). Such findings are consistent with the Huntington, Buckner, and Bassuk (2008) finding that homeless children are not one homogenous group. Finally, Shinn, Samuels, and Fischer (under review) randomized homeless families in which the mother had a mental illness or substance problem to a Family Critical Time Intervention (described below) or to usual care, and followed them over time. The most dramatic finding was an improvement in children’s mental health and school outcomes in both experimental and control groups from 3 months to 24 months following shelter entry. Improvements were observed across all age groups from preschool to adolescence and in both mother and child reports.</p>

          Children separated from homeless families      </h4>

              <p>One frequent consequence of homelessness among families is separation of children from their parents. In a national survey, 60 percent of homeless women and 41 percent of homeless men had at least one minor child, but only 39 percent of women and 3 percent of men lived with any children (Burt et al., 1999). Some separations occur in shelter systems that do not allow men or older boys to be housed with women and younger children. But separations are common even in cities where families can be housed together. Some separations are associated with formal placements in foster care; probably more are informal arrangements where children stay with relatives or friends. For example, Park and colleagues (2004) found that 16 percent of 8,251 children under 16 who entered shelters with their families in New York City for the first time in 1996 spent some time in out-of-home placements in the child welfare system (before shelter or in the next five years). In the same city, Cowal and colleagues (2002) used interview data that tracked informal as well as formal placements in a smaller sample of 543 homeless and low-income housed families sampled in 1988. They found that five years after entering shelter in New York City in 1988, 44 percent of mothers experiencing homelessness had become separated from one or more of their children, compared to only 8 percent of continuously housed mothers. Consistent with Park and colleagues (2004), fewer than half of these separations were the result of actions by child welfare authorities or the courts, and many children were in informal placements. Similarly, Bassuk and colleagues (1997) in a study of 167 homeless and low-income families found that 19 percent of preschool-age children in homeless families had been placed in foster care, as compared to 8 percent of the low-income children.</p>
<p>There is some literature on the circumstances of family separations. Cowal and colleagues (2002) found that the mother’s drug dependence, institutional placement (most often for drug treatment), and experience of domestic violence each made independent contributions to the prediction of separation. Homelessness did not augment the effects of other risk factors but was itself by far the most powerful risk factor for separation. A homeless mother with no other risk factor had about the same risk of becoming separated from a child as a housed mother who experienced domestic violence and was drug dependent. Barrow and Lawinski (2009), using qualitative interviews with homeless mothers with psychiatric or substance use disorders who had been separated from one or more children, confirmed these three factors and added partner abuse of children; substance use by others in household, building, or neighborhood; and children’s needs. They also documented mothers’ problem-solving efforts in an attempt to find the best choices for their children, often among a set of undesirable alternatives.</p>
<p>Barrow and Laborde (2008) focused on homeless mothers who were separated from their children and recruited in single shelters for women with psychiatric problems or substance abuse problems. All 20 of the women they interviewed were actively involved in parenting their children, and most hoped to be reunited, although none were currently living with them. Barrow and Laborde describe women who were caught between demands and conflicting expectations of multiple systems, including shelters, child welfare, foster care, and family courts. Although the researchers did not interview children, they documented multiple cases in which children were shifted repeatedly among relatives or foster care placements and where both shelters and foster care agencies canceled or changed plans for visitation.</p>
<p>Model child welfare guidelines state that homelessness is not by itself a reason to remove children from homes (Williams, 1991), but empirically, it played a large role in these studies both as a cause of initial separations and as a barrier to reunification. A handbook published by the New York State Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (1990) (during the time of the study by Cowal et al.) listed poverty and homelessness as risk factors that “may predispose an individual to abuse or neglect a child” (p. 21). Research suggests that observers rate the same parental behaviors as more abusive in low-income rather than middle-income families (McLoyd, 1990), and it is possible that homeless families were judged more harshly than comparable families that were not homeless. Freidman (2000) and Park and colleagues (2004) note that homeless parents must do their parenting “in a fishbowl” under the watchful eye of shelter and social service staff who may not forgive lapses that go unobserved for housed families. Further, homeless shelters are difficult places to parent due to financial stress, crowding, lack of privacy, and the fact that staff often usurp parental functions, such as providing meals or setting curfews (e.g., Boxhill &amp; Beaty, 1990; Hausman &amp; Hammen, 1993; Lindsey, 1998).</p>
<p>Studies have not examined the effects of separations of children from homeless families on the children themselves. A hint of the effects of separation more generally may be found in a study that compared two groups of 4<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade children from highly stressed families: those deemed stress-resilient on the basis of “wholesome adjustment in the face of profound life stress” and those deemed stress-affected by both teacher and parent report. An important predictor of resilience was lack of separation of the child and the primary caregiver during the first two years of the child’s life (Cowen, Wyman, Work, &amp; Parker, 1990). A number of studies have documented that childhood separation is a predictor of future homelessness in adults (cf. Rog &amp; Buckner, 2007). However, it is not clear to what extent separation serves as a marker of other factors that may lead families to become homeless or is itself causal. Childhood separations ceased to predict housing instability in adulthood in New York after access to subsidized housing was controlled (Shinn et al., 1998), suggesting that separations may reduce access or indicate the lack of access to familial financial and housing resources.</p>

          Interventions      </h4>

              <p>Interventions for homeless families include subsidized housing, permanent supportive housing, and transitional housing. There are very few studies on any of the interventions, and those that exist are primarily descriptive. Few studies are rigorously designed, most lack comparison groups, and most lack data on children.</p>
<p>Subsidized housing with or without services clearly reduces repeat episodes of homelessness for families. Studies in New York City have found that homeless families that received subsidies were far less likely to return to shelter (Wong et al., 1997) and far more likely to attain long-term stability (Shinn et al., 1998). The policy of providing subsidies to families in shelter also reduced shelter populations in New York (Cragg &amp; O’Flaherty, 1999; O’Flaherty &amp; Wu, 2006) and Philadelphia (Culhane, 1992).</p>
<p>The Homeless Families Program, sponsored by HUD and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, offered Section 8 certificates along with various packages of services to families selected for their recurrent histories of homelessness and other risk factors in nine cities. Housing retention was excellent — 88 percent of the 601 families remained in housing for up to 18 months in the six cities where follow-up data were available — but cities with more intense service packages did not have higher rates of housing stability (Rog et al., 1995a, 1995b). Informal discussions with providers suggested that failure to renew Section 8 certificates was one reason for returns to shelter (Rog &amp; Buckner, 2007).</p>
<p>Intensive permanent supportive housing programs have also shown excellent housing stability and modest rates of parental employment or participation in education programs (e.g., Nolan et al., 2004; Philliber Research Associates, 2006; see also summary by Bassuk et al., 2006). However, these studies have not included comparison groups, making it hard to know whether families would have done as well with less intensive interventions. More restrictive programs had lower retention rates but may have had benefits for family self-sufficiency and reunification with children who were separated (Bassuk et al., 2006; Philliber Research Associates, 2006). But again, without studies where comparable groups are assigned to different programs, this is difficult to judge. It is also not clear what proportion of families would benefit from these intensive programs.</p>
<p>A large-scale study of transitional housing, the Sound Families Program in the Seattle area, which served 1,487 families between 2000 and 2007, was primarily descriptive (Northwest Institute for Children and Families, 2007). A quarter of families (25 percent) were asked to leave (Northwest Institute for Children and Families, 2006). However, consistent with results in both experimental and control groups of the SAMHSA Homeless Families Program (described on p. 16), families that stayed showed gains over time in employment, income, and attendance and school stability for children. </p>
<p>Shinn, Samuels, and Fischer (under review), randomized homeless families in which the mother had a mental illness or substance problem to a Family Critical Time Intervention or to usual care in Westchester, New York. The intervention involved rapid re-housing in the community and caseworkers who followed families from shelter to housing in the community in a nine-month program designed to establish a relationship with the mother, link the family to community services, and withdraw. The comparison group also received casework services, but from multiple workers, and were provided housing, but not as quickly as that provided the experimental group. Children in the experimental group did modestly better or showed greater improvements on mental health and school outcomes than children in the comparison group. Effects of the intervention were less consistent than children’s general improvement over time in both groups as their families left shelter and returned to the community.</p>
<p>There is a dearth of rigorous studies of child outcomes of interventions for homeless families. However, HUD has funded a large-scale study (conducted by Abt Associates) to randomize 2,400 homeless families across 12 sites to four housing and service interventions: subsidy only, rapid re-housing, transitional housing, and usual care. The study will include a small amount of data based on parent report on one target child per family.</p>
<p>Finally, homeless children are likely to benefit from the same sorts of interventions that help other poor children. For example, Schteingart, Molnar, Klein, Lowe, and Hartmann (1995) found that early childhood education improved the developmental status of both homeless and housed preschoolers (although both groups fared poorly compared to norms); however, there were no differences between the homeless and housed groups.</p>

              <p>Housing subsidies can prevent homelessness for poor families. A national random assignment study showed that provision of housing subsidies to families receiving public assistance reduced subsequent homelessness by 74 percent (Wood et al., 2008). This analysis took into account the fact that not all families that were offered vouchers utilized them for a lease. Cross-city studies of rates of subsidized housing and rates of homelessness have mixed results. Some researchers find clear benefits to subsidies (Mansur et al, 2002); others do not, perhaps because housing subsidies are not well targeted to those in need of them (Early, 1998, 2004; Early &amp; Olsen, 2002).</p>
<p>Other studies of prevention of family homelessness with strategies such as eviction prevention are poorly designed and lack comparison groups so it is difficult to tell how much they help (e.g., Shinn, Baumohl, &amp; Hopper, 2001). New York City has funded an experimental evaluation of its community-based prevention services, but the dependent variable will be prevention of shelter entry, with the possible addition of information on child protective services. Only record data, no interview data with parents or children, will be included.</p>
