<p>Restreint</p>
<p>	ECO 291<br />

<p>Common Position (EC) No /95<br />
	Adopted by the Council on 20 February 1995<br />
	With a View to Adopting<br />
	Directive 94/ /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council<br />
	on the Protection of Individuals<br />
	With Regard to the Processing of Personal Data<br />
	And on the Free Movement of Such Data</p>
<hr /><p style="text-align:left">On the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data</p>
<p style="text-align:left">The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Having regard to the proposal from the Commission ([1]),</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee ([2]),</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189b of the Treaty ([3]),</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the objectives of the Community, as laid down in the Treaty, as amended by the Treaty on European Union, include establishing an ever closer union among the people of Europe, fostering closer relations between the States belonging to the Community, ensuring economic and social progress by common action to eliminate the barriers which divide Europe, encouraging the constant improvement of the living conditions of its people, preserving and strengthening peace and liberty and promoting democracy on the basis of the fundamental rights recognized in the constitutions and laws of the Member States and in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas data-processing systems are designed to serve man; whereas they must, whatever the nationality or residence of natural persons, respect the fundamental freedoms and rights of individuals, notably the right to privacy, and contribute to economic and social progress, trade expansion and the well-being of individuals;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the establishment and functioning of an internal market in which, in accordance with Article 7a of the Treaty, the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured require not only that personal data should be able to flow freely from one Member State to another, but also that the fundamental rights of individuals should be safeguarded.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas increasingly frequent recourse is being had in the Community to the processing of personal data in the various spheres of economic and social activity; whereas the progress made in information technology is making the processing and exchange of such data considerably easier;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the economic and social integration resulting from the establishment and functioning of the internal market within the meaning of Article 7a of the Treaty will necessarily lead to a substantial increase in cross-border flows of personal data between all those involved in a private or public capacity in economic and social activity in the Member States; whereas the exchange of personal data between undertakings in different Member States is set to increase; whereas the national authorities in the various Member States are being called upon by virtue of Community law to collaborate and exchange personal data so as to be able to perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State within the context of the area without internal frontiers as constituted by the Internal Market;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, furthermore, the increase in scientific and technical cooperation and the coordinated introduction of new telecommunications networks in the Community necessitate and facilitate cross-border flows of personal data;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the difference in levels of protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, notably the right to privacy, with regard to the processing of personal data afforded in the Member States may prevent the transmission of such data from the territory of one Member State to that of another Member State; whereas this difference may therefore constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of a number of economic activities at Community level, distort competition and impede authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities under Community law; whereas this difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of a wide variety of national laws, regulations and administrative provisions;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, in order to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of such data must be equivalent in all the Member States; whereas this objective is vital to the internal market but cannot be achieved by Member States alone, especially in view of the scale of the divergences which currently exist between the relevant laws in the Member States and the need to coordinate the laws of the Member States so as to ensure that the cross-border flow of personal data is regulated in a consistent manner that is in keeping with the objective of the internal market as provided for in Article 7a of the Treaty; whereas Community action to approximate those laws is therefore needed;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, given the equivalent protection resulting from the approximation of national laws, the Member States will no longer be able to inhibit the free movement between them of personal data on grounds relating to protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, and in particular the right to privacy; whereas Member States will be left a margin for manoeuvre, which may, in the context of implementation of the Directive, also be exercised by the business and social partners; whereas Member States will therefore be able to specify in their national law the general conditions governing the lawfulness of data processing; whereas in doing so the Member States shall strive to improve the protection currently provided by their legislation; whereas, within the limits of this margin for manoeuvre and in accordance with Community law, disparities could arise in the implementation of the Directive, and this could have an effect on the movement of data within a Member State as well as within the Community;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the object of the national laws on the processing of personal data is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, notably the right to privacy, which is recognized both in Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and in the general principles of Community law; whereas, for that reason, the approximation of those laws must not result in any lessening of the protection they afford but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection in the Community;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the principles of the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, notably the right to privacy, which are contained in this Directive, give substance to and amplify those contained in the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the protection principles must apply to all processing of personal data by any person whose activities are governed by Community law; whereas there should be excluded the processing of data carried out by a natural person in the exercise of activities which are exclusively personal or domestic, such as correspondence and the holding of records of addresses;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the activities referred to in Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union regarding public safety, defence, State security or the activities of the State in the area of criminal law fall outside the scope of Community law, without prejudice to the obligations incumbent upon Member States under Article 56(2), Article 57 or Article 100a of the Treaty establishing the European Community; whereas the processing of personal data that is necessary to safeguard the economic well-being of the State does not fall within the scope of this Directive where such processing relates to State security matters;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, given the importance of the developments under way, in the framework of the information society, of the techniques used to capture, transmit, manipulate, record, store or communicate sound and image data relating to natural persons, this Directive should be applicable to processing involving such data;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the processing of such data is covered by this Directive only if it is automated or if the data processed are contained or are intended to be contained in a filing system structured according to specific criteria relating to individuals, so as to permit easy access to the personal data in question;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the processing of sound and image data, such as in cases of video surveillance, does not come within the scope of this Directive if it is carried out for the purposes of public security, defence, national security or in the course of State activities relating to the area of criminal law or of other activities which do not come within the scope of Community law;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas as far as the processing of sound and image data carried out for purposes of journalism or the purposes of literary or artistic expression is concerned, in particular in the audiovisual field, the principles of the Directive are to apply in a restricted manner according to the provisions laid down in Article 9,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, in order to ensure that individuals are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this Directive, any processing of personal data in the Community must be carried out in accordance with the law of one of the Member States; whereas, in this connection, processing carried out under the responsibility of a controller who is established in a Member State should be governed by the law of that State;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas establishment on the territory of a Member State implies the effective and real exercise of activity through the means of a stable set-up; whereas the legal form of such an establishment, whether a simple branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determinate factor in this respect; whereas, when a single controller is established on the territory of several Member States, particularly be means of a subsidiary, he must ensure, in order to avoid any circumvention of national rules, that each of the establishments fulfils the obligations imposed by the national law applicable to its activities;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the fact that processing is carried out by a person established in a third country must not stand in the way of the protection of individuals provided for in this Directive; whereas, in these cases, the processing should be governed by the law of the Member State in which the means used are located, and there should be guarantees to ensure that the rights and obligations provided for in this Directive are respected in practice;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas this Directive is without prejudice to the rules of territoriality applicable in criminal matters;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas Member States shall more precisely define in the laws they enact or when bringing into force the measures taken under this Directive, the general circumstances in which processing is lawful; whereas in particular Article 5, in conjunction with Articles 7 and 8, allows Member States, independently of general rules, to provide for special processing conditions for specific sectors and for the various categories of data covered by Article 8;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas Member States are empowered to ensure the implementation of the protection of individuals both by means of a general law on the protection of individuals against the processing of personal data and by sectorial laws such as those relating, for example, to Institutes for Statistics;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the legislation concerning the protection of legal persons with regard to the processing of data which concern them is not affected by this Directive;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the principles of protection must be reflected, on the one hand, in the obligations imposed on persons, public authorities, enterprises, agencies or other bodies responsible for processing, in particular regarding data quality, technical security, notification to the supervisory authority, and the circumstances under which processing can be carried out, and, on the other hand, in the rights conferred on individuals, the data on whom are the subject of processing, to be informed that processing is taking place, to consult the data, to request corrections and even to object to processing in certain circumstances;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the principles of protection must apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable person; whereas, to determine whether a person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means likely reasonably to be used either by the controller or by any other person to identify the said person; whereas the principles of protection shall not apply to data rendered anonymous in such a way that the data subject is no longer identifiable; whereas codes of conduct within the meaning of Article 27 may be a useful instrument in providing guidance as to the way in which data may be rendered anonymous and retained in a form in which identification of the data subject is no longer possible;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the protection of individuals must apply as much to automatic processing of data as to manual processing; whereas the scope of this protection must not in effect depend on the techniques used, otherwise this would create a serious risk of circumvention; whereas, nonetheless, as regards manual processing, this Directive covers only filing systems, not according to specific criteria relating to individuals allowing easy access to the personal data; whereas, in line with the definition in Article 2(c) the different criteria for determining the constituents of a structured set of personal data, and the different criteria governing access to such a set, can be laid down by each Member State; whereas files or sets of files as well as their cover pages, which are not structured according to specific criteria, shall under no circumstances fall within the scope of this Directive;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas any processing of personal data must be lawful and fair to the individual concerned; whereas, in particular, the data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are processed; whereas such purposes must be explicit and legitimate and must be determined at the time of collection of the data; whereas the purposes of processing further to collection shall not be incompatible with the purposes as they were originally specified;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the further processing of personal data for historical, statistical, or scientific purposes is not generally to be considered incompatible with the purposes for which the data have previously been collected provided that Member States furnish suitable guarantees; whereas these guarantees must in particular rule out the use of data for taking measures or decisions regarding any particular individual;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, in order to be lawful, the processing of personal data must in addition be carried out with the consent of the data subject or be necessary with a view to the conclusion or performance of a contract binding on the data subject, or be required by law, by the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, or by the interest of a natural or legal person provided that the interests or the rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding; whereas, in particular, in order to maintain a balance between the interests involved while guaranteeing effective competition, Member States remain free to determine the circumstances in which personal data may be used or disclosed to a third party in the context of the legitimate ordinary business activities of companies and other bodies; whereas Member States may similarly specify the conditions under which personal data may be disclosed to a third party for the purposes of marketing whether carried out commercially or b a charitable organization or by any other association or foundation, of a political nature for example, subject to the provisions allowing a data subject to object to the processing of data regarding him, at no cost and without having to state his reasons;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the processing of personal data must equally be regarded as lawful where it is carried out in order to protect an interest which is essential for the data subject's life;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas it is for national legislation to determine whether the controller performing a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority should be a public administration or another national or legal person governed by public law or by private law or such as a professional association;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas data which are capable by their nature of infringing fundamental freedoms or privacy should not be processed unless the data subject gives his explicit consent; whereas, however, derogation from this prohibition must be explicitly provided for in respect of specific needs, in particular where the processing of these data is carried out for certain health-related purposes by individuals subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy or in the course of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the purpose of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas Member States must Also be authorized, when justified by grounds of important public interest, to derogate from the prohibition on processing sensitive categories of data where important reasons of public interest so justify in areas such as public health and social protection, especially as regards the assurance of quality and cost-effectiveness, and as regards the procedures used for settling claims for benefits and services in the health insurance system, scientific research and government statistics; whereas it is incumbent on them, however, to provide specific and suitable safeguards so as to protect the fundamental rights and the privacy of individuals;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, moreover, the processing of personal data by official authorities for achieving aims, laid down in constitutional law or international public law, of officially recognized religious associations is carried out on important grounds of public interest;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas where, in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system requires in certain Member States that political parties compile data on people's political opinions, the processing of such data can be permitted for reasons of important public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the processing of personal data for purposes of journalism or for purposes of literary or artistic expression, in particular in the audiovisual field, should qualify for exemption from the requirements of certain provisions of this Directive insofar as this is necessary to reconcile the fundamental rights of individuals with freedom of information and notably the right to receive and impart information, as guaranteed in particular in Article 10 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; whereas Member States should therefore lay down exemptions and derogations necessary for the purposes of balance between fundamental rights as regards general measures on the legitimacy of data processing, measures on the transfer of data to third countries and the powers of supervisory authority; whereas this should not, however, lead Member States to lay down exemptions from the measures to ensure security of processing; whereas the supervisory authority responsible for this sector should also be provided at least with certain ex-post powers, e.g. to publish a regular report or to refer matters to the judicial authorities;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, if the processing of data is to be fair, the data subject must be in a position to learn of the existence of a processing operation and, where data are collected from him, must be given accurate and full information, bearing in mind the circumstances of the collection;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas certain processing operations involve data which the controller has not collected directly from the data subject; whereas, furthermore, data can be legitimately disclosed to a third party, even if the disclosure was not anticipated at the time the data were collected from the data subject; whereas, in all these cases, the data subject should be informed when the data are recorded or at the latest when the data are first disclosed to a third party;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, however, it is not necessary to impose this obligation if the data subject already knows the information; whereas, moreover, this obligation is not provided for if the recording or disclosure are expressly provided for by law or if the provision of information proves impossible or involved disproportionate efforts, which could be the case where processing is for historical, statistical or scientific purposes; whereas, in this regard, the number of data subjects, the age of the data, and any compensatory measures adopted may be taken into consideration;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas any person must be able to exercise the right of access to data relating to him which are being processed, in order to verify in particular the accuracy of the data and the lawfulness of the processing; whereas, for the same reasons, every data subject must also have the right to know the logic involved in the automatic processing of data concerning him, at least in the case of the automated decisions referred to in Article 15(1); whereas this right must not be adversely affect business confidentiality or intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting the software; whereas these considerations must not, however, result in the data subject being refused all information;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas Member States may, in the interest of the data subject or so as to protect the rights and freedoms of others, restrict rights of access and information; whereas they may, for example, specify that access to medical data may be obtained only through a health professional;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas restrictions on the rights of access and information and on certain obligations of the controller may similarly be imposed by Member States insofar as they are necessary to safeguard, for example, national security, defence, public safety, or important economic or financial interests of a Member State or the Union, as well as criminal investigations and prosecutions and action in respect of breaches of ethics in the regulated professions; whereas the list of exceptions and limitations should include the tasks of monitoring, inspection or regulation necessary in three last-mentioned areas concerning public security, economic or financial interests and crime prevention; whereas the listing of tasks in these three areas does not affect the legitimacy of exceptions or restrictions for reasons of State security or defence;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas Member States may also be led, by virtue of the provisions of Community law, to derogate from the provisions of this Directive concerning the right of access, the obligation to inform individuals and the quality of data, in order to safeguard certain purposes among those referred to above;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, in cases of processing lawfully data pursued on grounds of public interest, official authority or the legitimate interests of a natural or legal person, any data subject should nevertheless be entitled, on legitimate and compelling grounds relating to his particular situation, to object to the processing of any data relating to himself; whereas Member States nevertheless have the possibility of laying down national provisions to the contrary;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects with regard to the processing of personal data requires that appropriate technical and organizational measures be taken, both at the time of the design of the processing system and at the time of the processing itself, particularly in order to maintain security and thereby to prevent any unauthorized processing; whereas it is incumbent on the Member States to ensure that controllers comply with these measures; whereas these measures must ensure an appropriate level of security, taking into account the state of the technology and the cost of its use in view of the risks inherent in the processing and the nature of the data to be protected;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas where a message containing personal data is transmitted by means of a telecommunications or electronic mail service, the sole purpose of which is the transmission of such messages, the controller in respect of the personal data contained in the message will normally be considered to be the person from whom the message originates, rather than the person offering the transmission services; whereas, nevertheless, those offering such services will normally be considered controllers in respect of the processing of the additional personal data necessary for the operation of the service;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the notification procedures are designed to ensure disclosure of the purposes and main features of any processing operation for the purpose of verification that the operation is in accordance with the national measures taken under this Directive;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, in order to avoid unsuitable administrative formalities, exemptions from the obligation to notify and simplification of the notification required may be provided for by Member States in cases where processing is unlikely to adversely affect the rights and freedoms of data subjects, provided that it is in accordance with a measure taken by a Member State specifying its limits; whereas in an equivalent way exemption or simplification can similarly be provided for by Member States where a person appointed by the controller ensures that the processing carried out is not likely adversely to affect the rights and freedoms of data subjects; whereas such an official, whether or not an employee of the controller, must be in a position to exercise his functions in complete independence;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas exemption or simplification could be provided for in cases of processing operations whose sole purpose is the keeping of a register intended, according to national law, to provide information to the public and open to consultation by the public or by any person demonstrating a legitimate interest;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, nevertheless, simplification or exemption from the obligation to notify shall not release the controller from any of the other obligations resulting from this Directive;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, in this context, ex post facto verification by the competent authorities must be in general be considered a sufficient measure;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, however, certain processing operations are likely to pose specific risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects by virtue of their nature, their scope or their purposes, such as the purpose of excluding individuals from a right, benefit or contract, or by virtue of the specific use of new technologies; whereas it is for Member States, if they so wish, to specify such risks in their legislation;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas with regard to all the processing undertaken in society, the amount posing such specific risks should be very limited; whereas Member States must provide that the supervisory authority, or the data protection official in cooperation with the authority, check such processing prior to it being carried out; whereas following this prior check, the supervisory authority may, according to its national law, give an opinion or an authorization regarding the processing; whereas such checking may equally take place in the course of the preparation of a legislative measure adopted by the national parliament or on the basis of such a measure, defining the nature of the processing and specifying suitable safeguards;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, if the controller fails to respect the rights of data subjects, national legislation must provide for a judicial remedy; whereas any damage which a person may suffer as a result of unlawful processing must be compensated for by the controller, who may be exempted from liability if he proves that he is not responsible for the damage, in particular in cases where he reports an error on the part of the data subject or in a case of force majeure; whereas sanctions must be imposed on any person, whether governed by private or public law, who fails to comply with the national measures taken under this Directive;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas cross-border flows of personal data are necessary to the expansion of international trade; whereas the protection of individuals guaranteed in the Community by this Directive does not stand in the way of transfers of personal data to third countries which ensure an adequate level of protection; whereas the adequacy of the level of protection afforded by a third country must be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding the transfer operation or set of transfer operations;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, on the other hand, the transfer of personal data to a third country which does not ensure an adequate level of protection must be prohibited;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas provision should be made for exemptions from this prohibition in certain circumstances where the data subject has given his consent, where the transfer is necessary in relation to a contract or a legal claim, where protection of an important public interest so requires, for example in cases of international transfers of data between tax or customs administrations or between services competent for social security matters, or where the transfer is made from a register established by law and intended for consultation by the public or persons having a legitimate interest; whereas in this case such a transfer should not involve the entirety of the data or entire categories of the data contained in the register and, when the register is intended for consultation by persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer should be made only at the request of the same persons or if the latter are the recipients;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas particular measures may be taken to compensate for the lack of protection in a third country in cases where the person responsible for the processing offers appropriate assurances; whereas, moreover, provision must be made for procedures for negotiations between the Community and such third countries;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, in any event, transfers to third countries may only be effected in full compliance with the provisions adopted by the Member States pursuant to this Directive, and in particular Article 8 thereof;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas Member States and the Commission, in their respective spheres of competence, must encourage the trade associations and other representative organizations concerned to draw up codes of conduct so far as to facilitate the application of this Directive, taking account of the specific characteristics of the processing carried out in certain sectors, and respecting the national provisions adopted for its implementation;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the establishment in Member States of supervisory authorities, exercising their functions with complete independence, is an essential component of the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas such authorities must have the necessary means to perform their duties, including powers of investigation and intervention, particularly in cases of complaints from individuals, and powers to engage in legal proceedings; whereas such authorities must help to ensure transparency of processing in the Member States within those jurisdiction they fall;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the authorities in the different Member States will need to assist one another in performing their duties so as to ensure that the rules of protection are properly respected throughout the European Union;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, at Community level, a Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data must be set up and be completely independent in the performance of its functions; whereas, having regard to its specific nature, it must advise the Commission and, in particular, contribute to the uniform application of the national rules adopted pursuant to this Directive;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas, with regard to the transfer of data to third countries, the application of this Directive calls for the conferment of powers of implementation on the Commission and the establishment of a procedure in accordance with the procedures laid down in Council Decision 87/373/EEC(1)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the principles set out in this Directive regarding the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, notably their right to privacy, with regard to the processing of personal data may be supplemented or clarified, in particular as far as certain sectors are concerned, by specific rules based on those principles;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas Member States should be allowed a period of not more than three years from the entry into force of the national measures transposing this Directive in which to apply such new national rules gradually to all processing operations already under way; whereas, in order to facilitate cost-efficient implementation, a further period expiring twelve years after the date on which this Directive is adopted will be allowed to Member States to ensure the conformity of existing manual filing systems with certain of the Directive's provisions; whereas data contained in such filing systems actively processed during this extended transition period should nevertheless be brought into conformity with these provisions at the time of such further active processing; Whereas an agreement on a "modus vivendi" between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission concerning the implimenting measures for acts adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the EC Treaty was reached on 20 December 1994,</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas it is not necessary for the data subject to give his consent again so as to allow the controller to continue to process, after the national provisions taken pursuant to this Directive enter into force, any sensitive data necessary for the performance of a contract concluded on the basis of free and informed consent before the entry into force of these provisions;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas this Directive does not stand in the way of a Member State's regulating marketing activities aimed at consumers residing in its territory insofar as much as such regulation does not concern the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data;</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Whereas the Directive allows the principle of public access to official documents to be taken into account when implementing the principles set out in this Directive,</p>
