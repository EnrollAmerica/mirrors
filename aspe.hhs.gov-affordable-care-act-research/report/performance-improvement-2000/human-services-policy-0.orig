    <p><strong>Adolescent Decision Making: Implications for Prevention 		Programs</strong></p>
<p>Efforts to reduce teen marijuana use, smoking and pregnancy are not new, 		but they are now being debated in a policy climate characterized by frustration 		at past attempts to address teen behavior and renewed efforts to take strong 		actions to reduce these behaviors. The role of decision making processes in 		these interventions is a topic that has generated a substantial core of new 		research. This project convened a January workshop and prepared a summary 		report to: 1)identify the major lessons learned from the last decade of 		research on adolescent decision making, particularly as they bear on efforts to 		reduce behavior among adolescents; 2)discuss the results of research on efforts 		to intervene in adolescent behaviors; and 3)discuss the implications of this 		research for alternative approaches to reducing behavior among the Nation's 		youth, particularly in the areas of substance abuse and sexuality. The report 		covers the following topics: the decision-making framework, the world of 		adolescence, media influences, programs for adolescents, and issues for youth 		programs. </p>

<p><strong>Blending Perspectives and Building Common Ground 		</strong></p>
<p>Many in the child welfare field have recognized for years that substance 		abuse is central to child welfare issues. But with the implementation of the 		Adoption and Safe Families Act and renewed emphasis on achieving permanency for 		children in the child welfare system, finding effective ways to address 		concurrent substance abuse and child maltreatment problems in families takes on 		renewed importance. This report grew out of a request by the Congress for more 		information to guide Federal policies that would allow child welfare agencies 		and partners in the substance abuse treatment field to better address the needs 		of parents whose substance abuse problems rendered them unable to care for 		their children. This report fulfills the legislative mandate that requested the 		Department of Health and Human Services to: describe the extent and scope of 		the problem of substance abuse in the child welfare population; the types of 		services being provided; the outcomes resulting from the provision of such 		services; and to include recommendations for any legislation that may be needed 		to improve coordination in providing such services to such population. The 		findings and conclusions reached by the report indicate: it is clear that 		throughout the child welfare system, but especially with respect to children in 		foster care, alcohol and other drug abuse is recognized as a major contributing 		factor to child neglect and abuse and as one of the key barriers to family 		reunification; timely substance abuse services are key to achieving permanency 		for children; collaboration between child welfare and substance abuse treatment 		agencies must be improved. </p>

<p><strong>Enhancing the Well-Being of Young Children and Families 		in the Context of Welfare Reform: Lessons from Early Childhood, TANF, and 		Family Support Programs  </strong></p>
<p>Roughly two-thirds of the recipients of federally-subsidized cash 		assistance are children, nearly half of whom are under the age of six. While 		such children grow up in an environment which puts them at risk, a decade of 		cumulative research suggests that child development and family support programs 		can make a difference. This report identifies and presents profiles of 		promising Federal, State, and/or community-based health and human services 		programs believed to be enhancing the health and development of children in the 		context of welfare reform. It seeks to answer three questions: How are child 		development and family support programs serving low-income families with young 		children responding to new welfare policies and practices? What kinds of 		partnerships (e.g., state-local, public-private, interagency) are developing 		between those serving low-income families with young children and those 		implementing welfare changes? What opportunities and challenges are emerging 		for early childhood programs and agencies implementing welfare changes as they 		strive to improve outcomes for both adults/parents and young children? The 		report examines case management strategies, child assessment programs, links 		between pre-kindergarten and child care programs, school-readiness programs, 		assistance for families who are coping with domestic violence, substance abuse, 		and other risk factors, and other workings of these programs. </p>

<p><strong>Estimated Effects of the Optional Review of Child 		Support Orders for TANF Cases</strong></p>
<p>The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 		1996 made the review and modification of child support awards for those 		receiving welfare assistance optional, a change from prior law which required 		such reviews every three years. Given that States now have a policy choice, 		this project sought to inform that choice by developing national estimates of 		the financial effects of not reviewing child support awards for welfare 		recipient families on State child support collections. This project provided 		estimates of the financial effects on the Federal and State governments (how 		such a discontinuance would affect child support offsets to cash assistance 		payments.) First, the study compared the two policy regimes, estimating 		government savings from several sources. Then these estimated savings were 		combined with estimates of the cost of reviewing and modifying orders to get a 		total net fiscal effect. Finally, the study examined the separate effects on 		each state and the federal government, factoring in changes in incentive 		payments. The study pointed out that the effects on governmental revenues are 		not the only relevant factors to consider in evaluating optional versus 		mandatory child support award reviews. For example, if mandatory review 		increases collections but they accrue to the resident parent family rather than 		the government, the policy may still be advantageous in terms of increasing the 		well-being of economically vulnerable families. </p>

<p><strong>Evaluating Welfare Reform: A Framework and Review of 		Current Work</strong></p>
<p>The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act 		(PRWORA) of 1996 changed the nation's social welfare system by replacing a 		federal entitlement program for low-income families called Aid to Families with 		Dependent Children (AFDC) with state-administered block grants, the Temporary 		Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. The Office of the Assistant 		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) of the Department of Health and 		Human Services (DHHS) asked the National Research Council to convene a panel to 		study and recommend the best strategies for evaluating the effects of welfare 		reform programs and the data needs for conducting useful evaluations. The 		interim report from the panel made the following recommendations that were 		consistent with HHS's research agenda: (1) DHHS should be proactive in 		identifying important current and emerging issues for welfare policies at both 		federal and state levels, a strategy which may, in turn, lead the way to 		establishing priorities for investment in data and research. (2) DHHS should 		define the key populations of interest for welfare policy analysis in its 		research agenda and assure that its grant and contract research programs 		adequately cover all important population groups for welfare reform. In 		particular, to consider the effects of changes in welfare policies on the 		outcomes of low-income populations, it is important to study not only those who 		leave the system but those who stay as well as potential applicants who are 		diverted from programs or who do not apply. (3) DHHS should make improving 		capabilities for data collection and research on social welfare programs on 		both state and federal levels a priority. (4) DHHS should exercise leadership 		in working with states, localities, and research organizations to achieve both 		intra- and inter-state comparability of data and research on the effects of 		welfare reform. (5) DHHS should document TANF policies in each state and 		localities. </p>

<p><strong>Exits from Welfare and Local Entry-Level Labor 		Markets</strong></p>
<p>The current debate surrounding welfare reform pits those who view 		long-term welfare participation as a problem of "welfare dependency" resulting 		from poor work attitudes against those who view it as a problem of "working 		poverty" with poor, time- constrained single mothers using welfare to 		supplement low-wage and contingent employment. Presented in this report are 		estimates of the relative influence of individual characteristics, family 		structure and local entry-level labor market conditions on welfare durations 		and transitions into work. Contrary to previous research, the findings suggest 		that: (1) local labor market conditions are more important than individual and 		family level factors in predicting exits from welfare; (2) most women on 		welfare are working before, during and after a welfare spell; and (3) 		long-term, intermittent welfare participation may be more accurately understood 		as a problem of "working poverty." </p>

<p><strong>Fixing to Change: A Best Practices Assessment of 		One-Stop Job Centers Working With Welfare Recipients</strong></p>
<p>This study was undertaken in an effort to assess the impacts of recent 		policy, organizational, and technology changes on the delivery of employment 		services to welfare recipients. The study examines five of the most developed 		and promising One- Stop Job Centers around the country to find out what makes 		them work well, and to understand their potential for moving people from 		welfare to self-sufficiency. This study does not provide a formal evaluation of 		these model programs, but identifies those approaches and practices that seem 		to be working well in various locations. The report identified three key 		factors which tend to contribute to the success of the One-Stop Job Center: the 		degree of integration of services, locating welfare and employment services in 		the same place, and individualized attention to clients. The centers 		experienced common problems in such areas as quality and design of data systems 		as well as such common challenges in reaching the welfare population as 		substance abuse mental illness. Welfare-to-work programs tended to place a 		their clients in a fairly limited set of typical occupations, including: 		certified nurse assistant, clerical support, light manufacturing, sorting and 		packaging, retail trade, and self employment. Based on limited data that varies 		from site to site, the employment and wage outcomes reported for a sample of 		welfare clients referred to a One-Stop center during a given 12-month period 		hovers between 40 and 50 percent, with wages typically averaging between $5.50 		and $6.50 an hour. These jobs were clearly dominated by entry-level work and 		not sufficient to support a family without continued public assistance. </p>

<p><strong>Getting off the Ground: Early Implementation Findings 		about Child Support Enforcement, Head Start, and Child Care Collaboration 		Demonstrations</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to provide early findings on the 		implementation of five State-initiated demonstrations designed to explore 		collaborations between child support enforcement, Head Start, and child care 		programs. The early findings indicate that the demonstration projects are 		making progress in meeting their goals. Also, the partner's agencies have 		gained an enhanced understanding and trust, and the knowledge base of Head 		Start and child care staff about child support services and vice versa, has 		broadened. The second goal of the project, to increase the access of families 		to child support services through the cooperation and assistance of child care 		and Head Start programs is being realized. These demonstration grants have 		increased the willingness and ability of Head start and child care staffs to 		collaborate with child support agencies. Some agreement has also been reached 		toward the third goal of the project--to increase child support staff's 		understanding about the importance of father's nonfinancial involvement in the 		lives of their children. An important task remaining for the demonstrations is 		to find ways that child support staff can assist child care and Head Start 		staffs in increasing voluntary establishment of paternity and payment of 		support. </p>

<p><strong>Indicators of Welfare Dependence: Annual Report to 		Congress, October 1998</strong></p>
<p>The Welfare Indicators Act of 1994 requires the Department of Health and 		Human Services to prepare annual reports to Congress on indicators and 		predictors of welfare dependence. This Annual Report on Welfare Indicators, 		October 1998 is the second of these annual reports. Welfare dependence, like 		poverty, is a continuum, with variations in degree and in duration. The 		bipartisan Advisory Board on Welfare Indicators proposed the following 		definition of dependence on welfare: A family is dependent on welfare if more 		than 50 percent of its total income in a one-year period comes from AFDC/TANF, 		Food Stamps and/or SSI, and this welfare income is not associated with work 		activities. Welfare dependence is the proportion of all families who are 		dependent on welfare. This report includes a number of indicators addressing 		welfare recipients, dependence, and labor force attachment. Selected findings 		include the following: In 1994, the more recent year for which SIPP data are 		available, 5.6 percent of the total population were dependent. This is 		approximately the same rate as the previous two years; long-term dependence is 		relatively rare. Only 4 percent of those who were recipients in 1982, or less 		than 1 percent of the total population, received more than 50 percent of their 		income from AFDC and Food Stamps in 9 or 20 years over the next decade; in 		1994, 46 percent of AFDC recipients, 38 percent of SSI recipients and 57 		percent of Food Stamp recipients were in families with at least one person in 		the labor force; and individuals who receive AFDC or Food Stamps as children 		are more likely to receive benefits as adults. </p>

<p><strong>Positive Youth Development in the United States: 		Research Findings on Evaluations of Positive Youth Development Programs 		</strong></p>
<p>The past 30 years have seen widespread proliferation of prevention and 		positive youth development programs. During this time, prevention programs have 		been the subject of much evaluative study. More recently, the field has 		witnessed a greater focus on evaluation of programs emphasizing positive youth 		development. Interest in positive youth development has grown as a result of 		studies that show the same individual, family, school and community factors 		often predict both positive and negative outcomes for youth. Such factors as 		developing strong bonds with healthy adults and maintaining regular involvement 		in positive activities not only create a positive developmental pathway, but 		can prevent the occurrence of problems. While encouraging, these findings 		highlight the need for systematic review across programs to further their 		general acceptance by the field. Accordingly, the goals of this study were to: 		(1) research and establish both theoretical and empirical definitions of 		positive youth development and related concepts; (2) document and describe 		common denominators between risk and protective factors implicated in youth 		problem behavior; (3) identify and summarize the results of evaluations of 		positive youth development interventions; and (4) identify elements 		contributing to both the success and lack of success in positive youth 		development programs and program evaluations, as well as potential improvements 		in evaluation approaches. </p>

<p><strong>Post-Exit Earnings and Benefit Receipt Among Those Who 		Left AFDC in Wisconsin</strong></p>
<p>From July 1995 to July 1996, single-parent Aid to Families with 		Dependent Children (AFDC) caseloads in Wisconsin declined sharply, by 23 		percent. This is the third and final report in a series that explores the 		characteristics of those mother- headed families who left AFDC after July 1995 		("leavers"), compared to those who remained ("stayers"), and examines how they 		fared during the 15 months after they left the Wisconsin AFDC program. 		Specifically, this study asks: (1) What proportion of leavers returned to AFDC, 		and what characteristics are most closely associated with that return? (2) Did 		AFDC leavers and their families have incomes greater than (a) the maximum 		benefits they would have received under AFDC or (b) their incomes immediately 		before leaving AFDC? (3) Did leavers and their families escape poverty after 		leaving AFDC? (4) How much did leavers use other public assistance programs, 		and what household characteristics most affected the likelihood that they would 		do so? (5) To what extent did leavers work and earn after they left AFDC, and 		how did these trends compare to the work and earning patterns of the stayers? 		(6) Did the earnings of the leavers grow over time, and, if so, to what extent? 		(7) What family and economic characteristics among leavers were most closely 		related to the probability of working at all, and of obtaining relatively high 		earnings? and (8) What kinds of jobs did leavers find, and which jobs seemed to 		offer the highest wages? </p>

<p><strong>State Child Access and Visitation Programs: A 		Preliminary Report for Fiscal Year 1997 Funding</strong></p>
<p>This report presents preliminary findings for 131 local projects in 28 		States and two Territorities receiving funding for Child Access and Visitation 		Grants under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation 		Act of 1996. Nearly 20,000 individuals were served during the first year of 		this new grant program, and this figure is expected to rise, significantly, 		when all States report. Wide discretion is permitted in States' determination 		of the activities to fund at the local level. Most States and their local 		projects report providing a mix of services. There are services provided with 		respect to urban, suburban, and rural locations and administration by state and 		county agencies, courts, and non-profit organizations. There is also a balance 		regarding the racial and ethnic mix and marital status--divorced, separated, 		never-married-- of the population served. Most individuals received parenting 		education, assistance in developing parenting plans, and mediation services, 		and the majority of individuals referred completed their program 		activities.</p>

<p><strong>State Financing of Child Support Enforcement Programs: 		Final Report</strong></p>
<p>The primary goal of the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program is to 		ensure that children are supported financially by both parents. This program is 		a shared undertaking involving Federal, State, and local efforts. The subject 		of this report is how states finance their share of the cost of program 		activities. The following questions are addressed: (1) what are the various 		sources of funding for the State and local share of Title IV-D expenditures, 		and what share of expenditures does each source represent? (2) how is the State 		share of retained Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program 		collections allocated at the State and local level? (3) how are Federal 		incentive payments allocated at the State and local level? Information was 		collected through telephone contacts with State IV-D Directors and/or IV-D 		fiscal staff in every state. The results show that: (1) most programs utilize 		at least three different funding sources to finance the State and local share 		of CSE expenditures; (2) State and local CSE financing structures are diverse 		and their funding sources are mixed in a variety of ways. </p>

<p>This report examines research about the outcomes of family preservation 		and family reunification programs, about relationships between service 		characteristics and outcomes, and the response of subgroups of clients to 		services. The report finds that: (1) little evidence exists to show that these 		programs have their intended effects; (2) problems with study construction and 		sampling issues contribute to a general lack of information about the effects 		of these programs in preserving or reunifying families, on preventing 		maltreatment, and on foster care placements; (3) in general, a review of 		research suggests that family preservation programs have very modest effects on 		family and child functioning; (4) evaluations of family reunifications are in a 		nascent stage, and require further elaboration of goals and expected outcomes 		of the programs; (5) evaluations must use the most rigorous methods whenever 		possible (i.e., randomized experimental designs) because early uncontrolled 		studies yielding misleading findings; and (6) more research must be done on the 		differential impact of these programs on various subgroupings of families. 		Furthermore, the report finds that outcomes other than placement should be used 		to detect potential benefits of these programs, and that more attention should 		be placed on contextual factors affecting outcomes, including community 		characteristics and the availability of community services.
