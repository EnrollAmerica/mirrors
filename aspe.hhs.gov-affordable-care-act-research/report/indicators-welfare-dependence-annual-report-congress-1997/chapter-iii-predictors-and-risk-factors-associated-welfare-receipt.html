    <p>The Welfare Indicators Act challenges the Department of Health and Human Services, and indirectly the Advisory Board on Welfare Indicators, to identify and set forth not only indicators of the rate and degree welfare dependence and duration of welfare receipt, but also predictors of welfare receipt and causes of welfare receipt. The state of welfare research is such that definitive causes of welfare dependence have not been clearly established. However, research has identified a number of risk factors associated with welfare utilization. For purposes of this report, the terms predictors and risk factors are used somewhat interchangeably, although the differences between them are acknowledged.</p>
<p>Where the Advisory Board recommended narrowing the focus of dependence indicators, it recommended an expansive view toward predictors and risk factors. The range of possible predictors is extremely wide, and until they are measured and analyzed over time as the PRWORA changes are implemented, their value will not be known. Some of the "predictors" included in this chapter may turn out to be simply correlates of welfare receipt, some may have a causal relationship, some may be consequences, and some may have predictive value.</p>
<p>For purposes of this report, the predictors/risk factors included in this chapter are loosely grouped into three categories. The first group includes measures associated with economic security. This group encompasses poverty measures (including poverty trends, child poverty trends, and pre- and post-cash transfers poverty rates for children and all individuals), receipt of child support, incidence of food insecurity, health care coverage, and housing and adult incarceration measures. For ease of presentation, the tables and figures illustrating measures of economic security are labeled with the prefix ECON throughout this chapter.</p>
<p>The second grouping (labeled with the WORK prefix) includes factors related to employment and barriers to employment. Data on labor force attachment and labor force attachment and earnings for low-skilled workers are included, as are data on barriers to work. The latter category includes incidence of adult disabilities and children with chronic health conditions, adult substance abuse, levels of educational attainment and school drop-out rates, and child care costs.</p>
<p>The final group addresses behavioral issues primarily affecting teenagers. This category includes out-of-wedlock childbearing data, onset of sexual activity, teen substance abuse and arrest data, and information on teens who are neither in school nor working. The tables and figures in this subsection are labeled with the TEEN prefix.</p>
<p>Several of the measures associated with child well-being that were included in last year's <em>Interim Report</em> have been deleted from this annual report. In all cases, those measures are either included in other Departmental publications (principally <em>Trends In The Well-Being of America's Children and Youth</em>) or they were determined not to be highly correlated with welfare receipt or dependence. A table listing the indicators and predictors contained in the Interim Report and their disposition in this report is included as Appendix C.</p>
<p>As noted above, the predictors/risk factors included in this chapter do not represent an exhaustive list of measures. They are, in fact, a sampling of available data that address in some way a family's circumstances on the deprivation/well-being scale. These are necessary to the dependence discussion since changes in the dependence measures can result from the elimination of assistance due either to increased work activity (which should improve the material circumstances of a family) or to time limits or sanctions (which may reduce the family's material circumstances).</p>

The official rate measures it in terms of cash income plus social security and means-tested cash transfers. The post-transfer rate measures poverty after adding not only social security and means-tested cash transfers but also the market value of food and housing benefits plus taxes (including the refundable EITC as well as Federal payroll and income taxes); it does not include the fungible value of Medicare and Medicaid.</p>

<ul><li>Table ECON 7 shows that a substantial percent of the poor population was removed from poverty by transfers in all years shown. After declining from 37 percent in 1979 to 19 percent in 1983, the percent of persons removed from poverty due to transfers consistently increased in the years reported. In 1995, 35 percent of all poor persons were removed from poverty due to transfers.</li>
<li>Table ECON 7 shows that the percent of the poor population removed from poverty due to food and housing benefits is much larger in all reported years than the percent removed due to other transfers. In 1995, 13 percent of the poor population was removed from poverty due to food and housing benefits.</li>
<li>Table ECON 7 also shows that whereas the EITC and Federal payroll and income taxes did not remove any poor individuals from poverty in 1979, 1983 and 1989, the trend reversed in 1993.

<ul><li>From FY 1984 through FY 1996, the first $50 dollars of each month's child support collection was passed-through to families that were receiving AFDC benefits. The "Collections Paid to Families" shown in Figure ECON 8a reflects the $50 pass-through and other benefit adjustments. Because the pass-through payment was capped at $50, the increase in payments was mostly attributable to increases in the number of families receiving collections and not to increases in the amount of child support passed-through to individual families.</li>
<li>Over 80 percent of AFDC collections (collections on behalf of AFDC recipients and for past due support assigned to the state by former AFDC recipients) was retained to reimburse the state and federal government for the cost of welfare benefits paid to the family.</li>

<ul><li>Figure ECON 8a represents the average annual payment of current support by non-custodial parents for families receiving services through the child support enforcement system. Payments on behalf of families not receiving AFDC were about twice as large as those payments for families receiving AFDC. (Note that many families not on AFDC may have received AFDC sometime in the past.)</li>
<li>Annual payments on behalf of AFDC and non-AFDC families have increased by about 33 percent in current dollars between FY 1986 and FY 1996. However, when converted to constant dollars, per capita payments have not quite kept pace with inflation (ECON 8a).</li>
<li>In FY 1996 collections were received from about 60 percent of the cases with orders and those collections represented about 52 percent of the current child support due (Table ECON 8b2). About 32 percent of the current support due on behalf of AFDC families was collected, compared to 60 percent collected on behalf of non-AFDC families.</li>

This increasing rate of paternity establishment kept the overall proportion of children with paternity established at 40 percent even though the number of children born outside of marriage was increasing over time.</li>
<li>The proportion of all children under age 18 with paternities established has increased slightly over the past three years, increasing to nearly 46 percent by 1996. This increase reflects the additional paternities now being established in the hospitals at the time of the birth of the child.</li>
<li>Reporting of in-hospital paternity establishments is voluntary and reflects reports from only 32 states, therefore the rate of increase in paternity establishments over the past three years may be underestimated.</li>

<li>About 4 percent of the 100 million households were classified as food insecure with hunger. Thus, one or more adult members of some 4.2 million households were estimated to have experienced reduced food intake and hunger as a result of financial constraints in the year ending April 1995.</li>

<li>A large gap exists between the mean weekly wages for white and black men, although it has been narrowing over time. In 1970 the mean weekly wage for white men working full-time was the equivalent of $615 in 1995 dollars, $183 higher than the average for blacks, $432. In 1994 the difference was $93, with white men receiving a mean wage of $539 and black men $446. In 1994 full-time working black men received 82 percent of the weekly wages of white men; in 1970 they received only 70 percent of the wages. The narrowing of this gap is predominantly a result of the declining value of white men's mean wages.</li>

Functional disabilities were defined as either: (1) limitations in or inability to perform a variety of physical activities (i.e. walking, lifting, reaching); (2) serious sensory impairments (i.e. inability to read newsprint even with glasses or contact lenses); (3) serious symptoms of mental illness (i.e. frequent depression or anxiety; frequent confusion, disorientation, or difficulty remembering) which has seriously interfered with life for the last year; (4) use of selected assistive devices (i.e. wheelchairs, scooter, walkers); (5) developmental delays for children identified by a physician (i.e. physical, learning); (6) for children under 5, inability to perform age-appropriate functions (i.e. sitting up, walking); and, (7) long-term care needs. Work disability is defined as limitations in or the inability to work as a result of a physical, mental or emotional health condition. Perceived disability is a new disability measure based on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and includes individuals who were perceived by themselves or others as having a disability. Disability program recipients include persons covered by Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Special Education Services, Early Intervention Services, and/or disability pensions.</p>

<ul><li>The percent of children born outside of marriage is affected by several factors: the rate at which women marry, the rate at which unmarried women have children, and the rate at which married women have children.</li>
<li>While the percent of births within each age group that are to unmarried women has been increasing for many years, it has recently leveled off. Although the percent of births within each group that are to unmarried women decreased in 1995 and then increased in 1996, these changes were small. This is true for both adult and teen women, as well as for black and white women. See Appendix D for data on the percent of births within each age group that are to unmarried women by race.</li>
<li>As Table TEEN 1 shows, the percent of children born outside of marriage remains relatively high. Among teens, over three-quarters of children were born outside of marriage in 1996, compared to just over one-tenth in 1940. Among all women, nearly one-third of children were born outside of marriage, compared to 4 percent in 1940.</li>

<ul><li>The percent of all births that are to unmarried teens is affected by several different factors: the age distribution of the population, the marriage rate among teens, the birth rate among unmarried teens, and the birth rate among all other women.</li>
<li>The percent of all births that were to unmarried teens leveled off over the last three years for both white and black women.</li>
<li>Between 1970 and 1994, the percent of all births that were to unmarried teens had been increasing steadily among white women.</li>
<li>Among black women, the percent of all births that were to unmarried teens varied greatly during the same period, peaking in 1975, then falling until the early 1990s. The sharp increase in the percent for black women in the early 1970s reflects a rise in nonmarital teen births concurrent with a decline in total black births.</li>

<ul><li>Violent crime arrest rates for youth age 15 were lower than the rates for older teens and this differential was much larger in 1994 than it was in 1965.</li>
<li>As shown in Table TEEN 8, arrest rates for violent crime for all youth age 10 to 18 increased substantially from 1965 to 1980 (from 58 to 163 per 100,000 teens). The arrest rate dropped to 139 per 100,000 teens in 1985 and rose again to 195 per 100,000 teens in 1991. After declining somewhat in 1992, the arrest rate again increased to 231 arrests per 100,000 teens in 1994.</li>
<li>Table TEEN 8 shows that violent crime arrest rates increased for both white and non-white youth during this period, however, the arrest rates for non-white youth fluctuated more over the time period and were substantially higher in all years.</li>
<li>Table TEEN 8 also shows that, as expected, violent crime arrest rates were consistently much higher among males than among females for all ages over the time period.</li>
