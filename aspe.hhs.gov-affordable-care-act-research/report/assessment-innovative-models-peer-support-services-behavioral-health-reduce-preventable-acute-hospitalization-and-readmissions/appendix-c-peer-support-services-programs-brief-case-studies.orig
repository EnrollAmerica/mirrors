				Baltic Street, AEH, Inc. (Baltic Street), established in 1996, is a peer-run, not-for-profit corporation dedicated to improving the quality of life for people living with mental illness. Baltic Street offers many types of support including programs focused on supported housing, self-help, employment, and Bridger programs. All programs are recovery-oriented to help recipients obtain jobs, housing, social supports, education, vocational training, entitlements, and other life-enhancing services. The Baltic Street Bridger Programs work with mental health recipients as they move from longer term state hospital residence into the community. Bridger staff initiate contact with the client while in the hospital and maintain contact once they transition into the community. The Bridger staff also work as a team to be a "special bridge" that helps recipients go back to living in the community and develop adequate community connections.</td>

				The Georgia Mental Health Consumer Network (GMHCN) is a non-profit corporation founded in 1991 by consumers of state services for mental health, developmental disabilities, and addictive diseases. While the GMHCN has a number of impressive peer-based programs, our discussion focused on their well-established Peer Support Wellness Center (PSWC). PSWCs are peer-run alternatives to a traditional mental health day program and psychiatric hospitalization and include a limited number of respite beds for those that are in crisis. PSWCs began in Decatur, Georgia in 2007. Two more PSWCs were opened in 2010 (Cleveland and Cartersville), and additional sites were started last year (Moultrie and McDonough). Each PSWC hosts daily wellness activities, a 24-hour warm telephone line, and 3 bedrooms for respite guests who receive 24 hour/day care for up to 7 days.</td>

A case management software program is used to track peer specialist contact with clients and what occurs at each contact. Some specific outcomes include: 90% of their clients do not seek hospitalization for psychiatric problems. Annual recipient surveys for the past 10 years have shown that 90% or more have less need for crisis intervention. In their program for transitioning individuals from long-term state hospitals into the community, more than 70% of the individuals have remained in the community for over 1 year.

MHASP programs are mostly community-based and focus on 5 domains: advocacy, direct support to individuals, training and education, information and referral, and technical assistance. Its programs include Peer Support Teams, a Self-Directed Care Project, and Recovery and Education Centers. This case study focuses on their community Self-Directed Care Project and other similar community-based services provided in the state since the data collection is more robust for those programs. Generally, clients receive Medicaid and are referred to services. A fee-for-service model is used and Peer Specialists (PS) work with clients in the community or in a client's home.

In collaboration with the managed care companies, NYAPRS had adapted the Peer Bridger Program to focus on transitioning individuals in non-state hospitals (stays up to 21 days) into the community.</td>

				There are 3 funding streams for NYAPRS Peer Services. They have contracts with OMH, Optum Health, and Healthfirst. Currently, contracts do not tie funding to specific clients. However, clients are identified through referrals from the state or managed care companies. Services covered include outreach, engagement, and PSS delivery. Once Medicaid funding is available (estimated Summer 2015), there may be some changes to how services are financed.</td>
</tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Data and Outcome</em></strong>:<br />
				In 2008, the Peer Bridger Project looked at the hospital records for 176 individuals who participated in the program to transition from state hospitals into the community. These data showed that approximately 71% of the people were able to stay out of the state hospital in 2009. NYAPRS has access to and analyzes the state data at intervals. NYAPRS focuses on recovery variables, measures of outreach and engagement, and hospitalizations. Optum and Healthfirst analyze data independently of NYAPRS and look at hospitalization rates.</td>
</tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Service Recipients</em></strong>:<br />
				All clients engage in the program voluntarily and have a history of mental health and/or substance use conditions. Through the New York OMH contract, peer specialists meet with and work with clients in the state hospitals and then in the community. Through the managed care contracts, peer specialists work with telephonic case managers to identify individuals who have had 2 or more hospitalizations within 6 months. Much of the time is spent on outreach and engagement of these clients. In all programs, clients are increasingly self-referred.</td>

				Optum is a UnitedHealth Group platform that focuses on population health management, care delivery and improving the clinical and operating elements of the health care system. Since 2009, Optum has served as the RSN for Pierce County, Washington. As the RSN, Optum coordinates mental health care for Medicaid beneficiaries (an eligible monthly population of approximately 135,500) through a network of inpatient, outpatient, and residential treatment providers. Through direct contracting with providers, Optum has changed the orientation of the Pierce County mental health system to be recovery oriented and staffed by a growing portion of Certified Peer Counselors (a.k.a., Peer Specialists) who work alongside of traditional mental health providers. Within the RSN, peers work in ED settings, in crisis centers, and in outpatient provider settings. Peers work with adults, youths, and families. Of particular interest to our study is their crisis stabilization unit, where 50% of the staff are peers, and which receives 220 referrals a month. Also of interest are their mobile crisis unit and living room program.</td>

				Projects to Empower and Organize the Psychiatrically Labeled, Inc. (PEOPLe) is a peer-run 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization that advocates for and provides services to people living with a mental health diagnosis. The organization is 100% peer-run. PEOPLe operates a number of PSS programs including crisis lines, warm lines, Bridger programs and hospital diversion programs. The various components work together and staff work across programs. Of particular interest to our study is the Rose House. The Rose House was developed in 2001 by PEOPLe and is a peer-operated hospital diversion program designed to alleviate emotional distress in a homelike safe and secure environment. This diversion program now has 4 locations/houses. The Rose House locations offer overnight stays of up to 5 days to assist individuals to develop new skills to maintain wellness. Peer specialists (PS) called "Peer companions" are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to address the needs of guests as they arise. Peer specialists are the key ingredient in helping guests learn the self-help tools. Peer specialists are compassionate, understanding and empowering. Peer specialists also maintain contact and support for guests, at their request, after they finish their stay at Rose House. Participation in the program is completely voluntary and free of charge. Guests are self-referred and may come and go as they please. A professional or family member may assist this process. A guest pre-registration screening process is used to ensure the comfort of other guests as well as the appropriateness of the program.</td>

In addition, Putnam County took notice of the services offered and has supplied county dollars to the program. In order to supplement these funding streams, PEOPLe raises funds through consulting services they offer to others interested in setting up similar respite-type houses in their communities.</td>
</tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Data and Outcome</em></strong>:<br />
				Most of the data collected at the Rose Houses are self-reported by guests. Rose House staff survey guests on a daily basis to measure what activities are most utilized and effective. Most of the questions are qualitative in nature, such as, are they feeling better emotionally, mindful of their own thoughts and behaviors, or breaking internal barriers? Program efficacy is measured based on how many individuals PEOPLe is able to keep out of the hospital, specifically the ED. These data are also self-reported and collected from the individuals during follow-up interviews. The program does a 30-day callback of the diversion program participants to see if individuals have used the hospital since they left the diversion program. At the 30-day mark, nearly 100% report that they did not return to the hospital since leaving the diversion house. Recently, individuals who had used the diversion house were called back 2 years after they used the services. Approximately 90% have not needed to go to the hospital for psychiatric problems since receiving diversion services. Local estimates show that each diversion house is saving the system $4 million a year. Local area hospitals were measuring their recidivism rates to be about 25%. PEOPLe utilizes these collected data for their state reports. They have also worked with the College of St. Rose to analyze satisfaction data. Individuals who have stayed at Rose House rate it at a very high satisfaction level.</td>

				Annual revenues of $12 million come from the State of Arizona Department of Health Services through a contract with the RBHA for Maricopa County, the Arizona Rehabilitation Services Administration, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Peer Community Connections program is covered through a contract with Magellan and is open only to people who have Non-Title 19 services in the Magellan SMI Program. Non-Title 19 SMI services are behavioral health services for persons who have SMI but do not qualify for Arizona's Medicaid program (Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System). There is a children and adolescent program out of Phoenix Children's Hospital that is funded through Aetna. RI bills a flat fee-for-services to Medicaid. Most programs will serve anyone who presents themselves regardless of insurance or state residency. They do not bill third-party insurance. Peer specialists provided over $6 million in reimbursable services at RI during 2006.</td>
</tr><tr><td colspan="2" style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Data and Outcome</em></strong>:<br />
				Since this is a medical facility, Level 1 Sub-Acute Health care facility and licensed by JACO, there are medical records and records of peer specialists are integrated with other provider staff. The program collects information during the intensive intake process (for the inpatient clinic), including social history and where service recipients go to live after they leave the inpatient or living room programs. The inpatient program has a 72-hour follow-up with clients. The program states that their data show that the PSS programs have saved the state over $10 million by helping people stay out of the hospital. Since the implementation of a recovery mission, hospitalizations have decreased to the current rate of 4%. In 2 other counties where RI has provided PSS training, the data show that they have reduced hospitalization rates by 25% within 6 months. (Data from 2003-2004.)</td>
