The case studies highlight program-specific information corresponding with key study questions. They are intentionally uniform in their headings and sections; provide summary level information; and are not meant to exhaustively include the information gathered during the site visit.</p>
<p>Each of the case studies includes a table of a service framework that was developed for this study. The table lists three categories of PSS that are likely to impact preventable hospitalizations, readmissions, and ED utilization. The table also highlights the service programs offered by each of the organizations within the three categories. Additionally, each of the organizations participating in the site visits had the opportunity to review the case summaries and correct any inaccuracies.</p>

<p>The <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#GMHCN">GMHCN</a> is a non-profit corporation founded in 1991 by Georgia consumers of mental health, developmental disabilities, and addictive disease services. The GMHCN PSS program was initiated through consumer grass root efforts and collaboration with state leaders. The GMHCN's strong relationship with state leadership helped make Georgia the first state to authorize Medicaid reimbursement for PSS. GMHCN continues to work with the state to foster a recovery oriented framework for services, including collaboratively drafting of state service definitions. The PSS programs offered by GMHCN are embedded within the larger Georgia provider network in which peers are employed. There are over 1,200 certified peer specialists in Georgia, and training and certification of the workforce is coordinated through GMHCN.</p>

<p><em><strong>Peer Support Services Model</strong></em></p>
<p>The <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#GMHCN">GMHCN</a> uses a hybrid model of services that draws from the Intentional Peer Support (IPS) model to guide PSS programs (<a href="http://www.intentionalpeersupport.org/what-is-ips/">http://www.intentionalpeersupport.org/what-is-ips/</a>) and other mutual support principles. They also use the WHAM program to support integrated health goals and services. The training manual for certifying Peer Support Specialists was developed by the ACG.</p>
<p><em><strong>Service Recipients</strong></em></p>
<p>Individuals must be at least 18 years of age and self-identify as a person in recovery from mental health challenges. All individuals are self-referred and are welcome, regardless of insurance status. No financial or insurance information is requested from service recipients.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Training and Certification of Peers</h3>
<p><a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#GMHCN">GMHCN</a> provides Certified Peer Specialist training for consumer peers within Georgia. The Certified Peer Specialist training curriculum was developed by the ACG. The training registration fee is $85 per-person, although it can be waived, as needed. The training is manualized. The GMHCN provides approximately five trainings per year. GMHCN reports great demand for the trainings, with 100-300 applicants for each training session. Training sessions can accommodate up to 45 consumers. The initial training lasts 9 days. Twelve hours of Continuing Education Credits are required annually to retain certification.</p>
<p>Advanced training for peers who have completed the Certified Peer Specialists Training are also offered through <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#GMHCN">GMHCN</a> and include WHAM, Mental Health First Aid, and peer services for working with prison/forensic populations, older adults, and homeless populations.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Financing Services</h3>
<p>Many <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#GMHCN">GMHCN</a> peer programs are in partnership with, and funded through, service contracts with the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities. Unlike many other PSS providers within Georgia, GMHCN does not bill Medicaid directly. Instead, GMHCN submits monthly reports to the state that are used to monitor contract compliance. Reimbursement for services is paid by the state retrospectively, after processing the GMHCN monthly report. There are no per-person costs that are billed to any payer. Peer specialists do not contribute to medical records or bill for their activities or time with service recipients. Peer specialists do document their interaction with consumer clients, but these records are primarily used for supervision purposes and contribute to the GMHCN monthly report to the state. The monthly report to the state requires that certain deliverables are met. Example deliverables include: an average number of two respite beds are filled per day; an average of ten calls are received at the call center per day; and an average of five participants participate in daily programming. GMHCN follows compliance regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] and CFR-42) as part of their state contract.</p>

<p><em><strong>Peer Support Wellness Centers</strong></em></p>
<p>The <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#GMHCN">GMHCN</a> operates five Peer Support Wellness Centers across the State of Georgia. The role of these Centers is to provide support before a crisis occurs or as someone is adjusting after a mental health crisis. The GMHCN describes their services as "preventative" (of hospitalization or ED use). Individuals who participate in the Center programs are self- referred. Individuals are encouraged to engage in Center services when they feel as if they might be getting close to a crisis or feel they need a safe place that is an alternative to hospitalization. Individuals are welcome to walk out and leave whenever they want.</p>
<p>The Centers each have three beds -- two beds that are set aside for first time visitors and one bed that is set aside for "an old friend." An old friend is someone who has had a prior stay at the Center and would like to return for a short-term stay. Center staff report that there is a consistently high demand for the "old friend" beds, and there is often a waiting list. The center is staffed 24 hours per day by a peer specialist. Staff report that individuals rarely need to be transported form the Center to the hospital.</p>
<p>Funding for the Centers is provided by the state and requirements include that each crisis center fill a minimum of two respite rooms each night. As part of the contractual requirements with the state, centers provide encounter and consumer self-report information.</p>
<p>All of the wellness centers provide open access to computers, educational programing, and other resources to promote wellness and recovery.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in"><em>-- A GMHCN Peer Mentor</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Wellness Activities</strong></em></p>
<p>Wellness activities and classes are offered at each of the five Peer Support Wellness Centers. The scheduled activities and classes are offered daily and are open to individuals who are in residence at the Centers and mental health consumers living in the community. There are generally three Wellness Activities offered daily. Wellness activities cover topics such as WRAP, housing, financing and budget assistance, and vocational and educational help.</p>
<p><em><strong>Warm Line</strong></em></p>
<p>The <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#GMHCN">GMHCN</a> provides a 24/7 "warm line." The call center for this service is housed within each of the five Peer Support Wellness Centers, and staffed by on-site peer specialists. Peer specialists who are employed to provide this service receive additional training and use a training manual that guides the services provided by this program. Inbound calls generally last no more than 20 minutes. Crisis calls that are more acute than the warm line can accommodate are rerouted to a statewide crisis line that is staffed by traditional service providers. Callers to the warm line cannot request specific staff, but can request the availability of staff by gender.</p>
<p><em><strong>Peer Mentor Program</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#GMHCN">GMHCN</a> operates a Peer Mentor program that is designed to help transition individuals who are receiving care in state facilities to community living. The State of Georgia originally maintained seven state hospital facilities and there were two Peer Mentors assigned to each hospital. Currently there are now five hospitals and 14 Peer Mentors. Individuals are referred to the program by the state and GMHCN assigns a Peer Mentors for each individual assigned to the program. The peer specialists employed within this are required to complete 40 hours of training, in addition to their Georgia peer certification training. Many of the individuals who receive the Peer Mentor Program services have had multiple readmissions to the state hospitals and many have been in the hospital for more than 60 consecutive days. The Mentor meets with the individual at the hospital initially and follows their transition into the community. There is no time limit for how long someone can be engaged in this program.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Data and Outcomes</h3>
<p>The <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#GMHCN">GMHCN</a> collects information on utilization of services as part of their monthly reporting requirements with the state. The monthly reports have not been analyzed to measure impact on hospitalization rates and ED use. GMHC reports that they have results from an annual self-report consumer survey of their GMHCN Peer Mentor Program (2013-2014 survey). The latest survey shows that only 37 percent of the respondents said that they were re-hospitalized after being involved in the program, and 90 percent said peer mentor helped improve their quality of life. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity within the sample of program participants did not allow for the survey to assess whether meaningful engagement with program had any effect on re-hospitalization. Georgia state leaders report that in 2014 the Peer Support Wellness Centers and the Peer Mentor Program have successfully reduced hospitalizations below the state's baseline targets. Unfortunately, no further data is available since services are not racked on an encounter basis.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><h3 style="text-align:center">Program Background</h3>
<p>The New York Association of Psychiatric Rehabilitation Service's (<a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#NYAPRS">NYAPRS</a>) Peer Bridger Program was established in 1994 through a contract with the State of New York. NYAPRS is recognized nationally as the initiators of the original Peer Bridger Program. There are a number of other organizations that offer similar services, but many are not affiliated with, nor follow, the NYAPRS model. Initially, NYAPRS was funded to provide PSS to individuals who had a history of lengthy stays at one of five New York State psychiatric hospitals. The peer specialists, known as "Peer Bridgers," work with individuals in the hospital and then continue to work with them in the community. Recent changes in the state's reimbursement mechanism have influenced NYAPRS to accommodate changes to their original model. For example, in 2009 NYAPRS partnered with the Optum Health managed care organization in a Chronic Illness Demonstration Project to serve Medicaid populations. Following that partnership, NYAPRS partnered with Optum Health in a long-term program to implement the Peer Bridger model throughout New York City and Long Island. The goal of this collaborative project is to find individuals who are high users of EDs and crisis centers and to provide them with Peer Bridger services. Unlike the traditional Peer Bridger Program, Peer Bridgers who work in the Optum program often have to find and engage individuals within the community, rather than starting in an inpatient setting. Similarly, in 2014, Health First, another Medicaid managed care payer, also contracted with NYAPRS for Peer Bridger services. The Health First service contract shares many of the features of the Optum Health program including engagement of individuals within the community. The Health First contract includes a telephonic case manager that works with peer specialist in the coordination of an individual's care.</p>

<p>Through contracts with the State of New York, <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#NYAPRS">NYAPRS</a> delivers Peer Bridger services in the following counties: Albany, Broome, Queens, Suffolk, and Westchester.

<p><em><strong>Peer Support Services Model</strong></em></p>
<p>The manualized components of the Peer Bridger program were developed by <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#NYAPRS">NYAPRS</a>. Information on the components of the NYAPRS Peer Bridger Model are described in subsequent pages of this case study.</p>
<p><em><strong>Service Recipients</strong></em></p>
<p>Individuals who receive Peer Bridger services engage in the program voluntarily and have a history of mental health and/or substance use conditions. Through the New York OMH contract, Peer Bridgers meet with and work with clients in the state hospitals and then in the community.</p>
<p>Through the managed care contracts, individuals with frequent and recent hospitalizations are referred to the Peer Bridger program. In most cases, Peer Bridgers first engage the individual in the community. Much more time is spent on outreach and engagement of referred individuals.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Training and Certification of Peers</h3>
<p>The State of New York is currently in the process of developing training, certification and reimbursement standards for PSS. However, as of July 2014, the State of New York has not implemented any requirements for training and certifications of peer specialist; peer specialist services are not Medicaid reimbursable in New York. <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#NYAPRS">NYAPRS</a> has established their own training and supervision requirements for individuals who work as Peer Bridgers in their programs. Peer Bridgers are trained using an established manualized training curriculum that includes 40 hours of training and covers the core competencies for the NYAPRS' Peer Bridger Program. Once training is completed, Peer Bridgers are provided with weekly telephonic supervision and in-person meetings every 2-3 weeks with the Director of the NYAPRS' Peer Bridger Program. NYAPRS also offers Peer Bridgers additional training on housing, entitlements, working with individuals with substance use problems, and whole health peer support service models.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Financing Services</h3>
<p><a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#NYAPRS">NYAPRS</a> maintains contracts with the state and two managed care entities to provide Peer Bridger services. The managed care contracts include Optum Health and Health First, both serving Medicaid-covered lives. Each contract has different criteria for covered services. Clients are identified through referrals from the state or managed care companies. Historically, NYAPRS has received bundled payments for services to designated populations. NYAPRS leadership note that as the New York State Medicaid system evolves, it is likely that reimbursement for PSS will change. Changes may include billing for fee-for-service reimbursement and establishing electronic health record capabilities. Additionally, New York is expected to begin certifying and reimbursing peer specialists in late 2015.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Peer Bridger Model</strong></em></p>
<p>Peer Bridger services are a time-limited model of care. The length of stay in the program varies by contract and service recipient needs. The model has four distinct, yet overlapping, phases. Peer Bridgers work with individuals to get through the phases, often starting the Peer Bridger relationship while the person is still in the hospital. The phases are:</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Engagement</strong>. Ideally, the engagement process begins when an individual is still in the hospital. However, this is not always feasible and then engagement begins with outreach in the community. In this phase the Peer Bridger helps establish a relationship that is grounded in recovery principles and supports a transition to community living. The Peer Bridger does not rely on existing medical records or other clinical summaries to understand the individual that they are working with. Instead, the engagement is developed through a direct relationship with the individual, and not diagnosis or prior service based.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2: Crisis Intervention</strong>. Recognizing that the transition from the hospital to the community is difficult, the Peer Bridger Model defines it as a "crisis transition." Psychiatric hospitalizations can be a traumatizing experience, and can also exacerbate earlier life traumas. Regardless of whether the first contact is initiated within a hospital setting or in the community, during this phase the peer specialist works with the individual to determine their immediate needs and assess their immediate and short-term plans and goals. Helping to stabilize the person's life during this phase is the most important goal. Discretionary one-time use support funds are generally available to help during this phase.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 3: Activation of Wellness Tools</strong>. The individual has completed Phase 1 and 2. They are living in a stable environment within their community. In this phase, the development of wellness and self-management skills are the key tasks. The Peer Bridger works with the individual to promote the principles of recovery using structured programs like the WRAP. Self-directed goals and ongoing plans are developed. Peer Bridgers are trained in the Stages of Change model, and they use Motivational interviewing skills.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 4: Disengagement</strong>. In the final phase of the Peer Bridger Model, the focus is on completing the process of community integration and comfortably disengaging from Peer Bridger services. As the individual successfully transitions to their life in the community and natural supports are established, then the evolution from the hospital back to daily life is complete.</p>
<p><em><strong>Adapted Peer Bridger Model</strong></em></p>
<p>In recent years, <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#NYAPRS">NYAPRS</a> has adapted their original model to accommodate the changing health care environment. Unlike the original Peer Bridger Model where a Peer Bridger initially engages with the person in a hospital setting, recent adaptations include client referrals that require Peer Bridgers to first engage with an individual within the community. More often the individuals they are asked to work with are identified by Medicaid managed care companies as high utilizers of EDs and have a history of repeated psychiatric hospitalizations. These individuals often have complex needs, including co-occurring substance abuse and homelessness. Peer Bridgers working within these programs are trained as "recovery coaches" to address substance use issues, as well as mental health conditions; they are also educated as housing specialists. All program participants are voluntary, but referred by the state, Optum Healthy, or Health First.</p>
<p>In the Health First program there is a telephonic case manager who alerts the Bridger program of a new enrollee in the program. Peer Bridgers and the Health First case managers have biweekly meetings where they discuss specific "members" (consumers) that they share, and reach out to one another while working with the consumer.</p>
<p>Housing has been a growing challenge for the individuals that <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#NYAPRS">NYAPRS</a> Peer Bridgers work with. To address this challenge, NYAPRS has recently implemented the Critical Time Intervention (CTI) Housing Program. CTI is a well-researched practice designed to prevent homelessness among people suffering from severe mental illness. CTI is a time-limited intervention, lasting nine months. The phases of CTI, Transition to Community, Try-Out, and Transfer of Care, are each roughly three months. CTI targets repeat and high-cost users of inpatient services.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Data and Outcomes</h3>
<p>The <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#NYAPRS">NYAPRS</a> Peer Bridger program does reduce the rate of re-hospitalization. The Optum Health's behavioral health sciences group reports that after including NYAPRS Peer Bridgers into their managed care program, there was a 47.9 percent decrease in the use of inpatient services; the average number of inpatient days decreased by 62.5 percent, from 11.2 days before NYAPRS involvement to 4.2 days after NYAPRS Peer Bridger involvement; and outpatient visits increased by 28 percent among individuals served by Peer Bridgers. The overall behavioral health cost decreased by 47.1 percent (report from July 2013). In a previous study of the NYAPRS Peer Bridger program, a cohort of 176 individuals who participated in the NYAPRS Peer Bridger Program to transition from the New York State hospital into the community were assessed 1 year after leaving the hospital setting (from 2008-2009). These data show that approximately 71 percent of the individuals were able to maintain their tenure in the community and were not re-hospitalized.</p>

<p>Since 2009, Optum has served as the RSN (<a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#Optum">Optum</a> Pierce RSN) for Pierce County, Washington. As the RSN, Optum coordinates mental health care for Medicaid beneficiaries (an eligible monthly population of approximately 135,500) through a network of inpatient, outpatient and residential treatment providers. In this role they are responsible for developing the health care system that serves the most severely ill behavioral health consumers in region. In the past 6 years, Optum Pierce RSN has made a commitment to integrating PSS into their service provider networks. Through direct contracting with providers, Optum Pierce RSN has changed their county mental health system to be recovery oriented and staffed by a growing portion of Certified Peer Counselors (a.k.a., peer specialists) who work alongside traditional mental health providers and within systems of care. Within the Optum Pierce RSN, peer specialists work in ED settings, in crisis centers, and in outpatient provider settings. Peer specialists work with adults, youths, and families. Optum has worked with the state to establish certification guidelines for peer specialists and helped to train this workforce in Pierce County and in other parts of the state.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Training and Certification of Peers</h3>
<p>As of June 1, 2015, RI's Recovery Opportunity Center has trained over 7,000 Peer Specialists worldwide. Their training curriculum includes 80 hours of training over 2 weeks. All staff (including non-peers) must complete 40 hours of recovery oriented new employee training as a requirement of <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#RI">RI</a> employment. The Recovery Opportunity Center Peer Employment Training program costs $1,295 per-person. However, in Arizona, any individuals who receive a referral from the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation are eligible to have their training paid for, if it is part of their service plan. The RI Peer Employment Training curriculum is a proprietary manualized program. RI has cross-walked the training requirements with their Arizona certification requirements, as well as those of many other states that certify PSWs, to ensure that certification requirements are fully met. RI has contracts to conduct peer specialist training in the states of Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Tennessee, California, Delaware, North Carolina, and is the primary trainer for the VA.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Financing Services</h3>
<p><a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#RI">RI</a> reports annual revenues of over $63 million across the company. Funding sources within Maricopa County include the State of Arizona Department of Health Services through a contract with the Mercy-Maricopa Integrated Care/AETNA Regional Behavioral Health Authority (RBHA), the Arizona Rehabilitation Services Administration, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The RBHA is a Medicaid-funded program, and RI serves as a crisis and recovery-based services provider. As a requirement of Medicaid funding, all services must be compliant with HIPAA. The RI programs have been able to sustain contracts with the RBHAs despite changes to the RBHAs entity. According to RI leadership, this is due in large part to RI's reputation and ability to effectively manage community-based recovery services. In other states, RI contracts with various funding authorities to provide a range of programs including crisis services, peer specialist training, housing, respite, and resource development. RI does not bill third-party private health insurance plans.</p>

<p><em><strong>Recovery Response Centers</strong></em></p>
<p>The Recovery Response Centers is a three-facility program with the following components: Front Room (walk-in crisis center); Retreat (a 23-hour observation center); and the Living Room (licensed as a crisis stabilization facility). Peer specialists work alongside other health care professional within the Centers.</p>
<p>In the Front Room the initial behavioral health assessment is completed. A peer specialist is the first person the individual meets when they enter the Front Room. Individuals who are seen in the Front Room and need additional time to plan next steps are invited to stay in the 23-hour Retreat. Those who need longer stays are registered in the Living Room, where they can stay several days.</p>
<p>The Living Room Concept was created by <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#RI">RI</a> as an alternative to traditional crisis services. The Living Room provides a space where individuals who are having a difficult time can become a guest. They receive comfort and hope from a team of peer support specialists.</p>
<p>The Centers emphasize a strength-based approach to all services. For example, the rooms in the Center where participants stay are labeled with a recovery-based name such as hope, strength, and resiliency. Staff in these programs are based in open areas, and engagement with the participants is encouraged at all times. These Centers are accredited by JACO.</p>

Their goal is to work with individuals who are currently in the hospital and help in the development of recovery-oriented discharge plans and ongoing recovery plans to support re-integration into the community. These services are intended to reduce the need and likelihood of hospital readmissions. The Peer Advocacy services work with the Peer Recovery Teams to coordinate and provide PSS in the community to foster resiliency and promote recovery. On average, Peer Specialists on the Recovery Team will maintain a caseload of about 30 participants. The hospital tracked outcomes the first year that Peer Support came into the hospital through RI. Those outcomes included a 56 percent reduction in recidivism, a 47 percent reduction in restraint use, and a 36 percent reduction in seclusions.</p>

<p><em><strong>Wellness City</strong></em></p>
<p>The <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#RI">RI</a> Wellness City programs are open to individuals who have RI services built into their treatment plan. Participants in these services (referred to as "citizens") have a wide array of programs and activities that support recovery including: educational life skills classes, city hall meetings, employment support, career workshops, linkage to community resources, housing support, personal wellness coaching, computers access and social events. Fitness rooms, exercise equipment, and health-related programs are also available.</p>
<p><em><strong>Recovery Education Center</strong></em></p>
<p>The Wellness City also includes the Recovery Education Center. The Center offers a variety of educational classes and workshops. Participants can earn Vocational Educational Certificates by enrolling in specific programs. The Center is classified as an Arizona Licensed Private Postsecondary Vocational School. The Center meets GED testing requirements and supports participants' educational advancement.</p>
<p><em><strong>Housing Services</strong></em></p>
<p>This program is designed for persons on Medicaid with mental health problems. Every person in this program has a peer specialist assigned to them. Individuals meet with their peer specialistweekly at first for 1-1.5 hours a week, reducing duration and frequency of meetings over time. Individuals may graduate after 1-2 years from the program. This program has fidelity to SAMHSA Supportive Housing model. Use of peer specialist is what makes it unique. <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#RI">RI</a> has replicated this program with peer specialist in other states.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Data and Outcomes</h3>
<p>While <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#RI">RI</a> maintains medical records for the consumers they serve, they do not specifically track data on ED use and hospitalization. The data directly tracked by RI are related to contract requirements and JACO accreditation standards. However, they note that sometimes the agencies that contract with RI will provide data. For example, in Maricopa County, the RBHA reports that following implementation of a recovery mission and Recovery Response Center in 2002, hospitalizations decreased from a high of 24 percent to 10 percent within a year (diversion of 1,080 hospital admissions), representing an estimated savings in hospitalization costs of $10,000,000. Of those individuals who are served at one of RI's Crisis Respite Centers, less than 25 percent are hospitalized. Between 2003 and 2004, <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#RI">RI</a> was able to reduce hospitalization rates by 25 percent within 6 months in two other locations where they implemented Recovery Response Center crisis services.</p>
<p>Outside of Arizona, <a href="appendix-c-peer-support-services-programs-brief-case-studies.html#RI">RI</a> reports that for one of their contract sites in Ellendale, Delaware (Beebe General Hospital), reported that after the RI Recovery Response Center began to do business in their community, ED dropped by 50 percent for persons with behavioral health conditions. Likewise, in July 2010, RI was contracted by Wenatchee, Washington. In the first 6 months of RI operations, the number of persons enrolled in Medicaid increased by 40 percent and the number of hospitalizations decreased by a third of its previous level.</p>
