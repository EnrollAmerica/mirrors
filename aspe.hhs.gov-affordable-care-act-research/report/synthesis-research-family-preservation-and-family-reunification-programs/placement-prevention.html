          Non-experimental Studies      </h5>

              <p>Many early evaluations of programs designed to prevent placement used non-experimental designs in which groups receiving these services were followed without comparing them to other groups or in which nonequivalent comparison groups were used.<sup>5</sup> The studies of only groups receiving services appear to have had implicit "phantom" nontreatment control groups in which it was assumed that nearly all children would be taken into custody.<sup>6</sup> Such an assumption has been proven false in subsequent research.</p>
<p>The results of studies without control groups suggested that most families remain intact during and shortly after family preservation services. An early study of the Homebuilders' model (Kinney, Madsen, Fleming, and Haapala 1977) found that 97 percent of 80 families remained intact three months after the intervention had ended. Since then, evaluations of the Homebuilders program have found that 73 to 91 percent of families were intact at 12 months after referral for service (Kinney, Haapala, and Booth 1991). Studies of other programs have found that at least two-thirds of families remain together within a year after the end of services. For example, 66 percent of 747 families who received family preservation services in Iowa remained intact one year after termination (Thieman, Fuqua, and Linnan 1990). A study of family preservation services in Connecticut found that 69 percent of 591 families remained intact one year after services and 82 percent of the 1,588 children in these families were not placed during this period (Wheeler, Reuter, Struckman-Johnson, and Yuan 1993). Eighty-eight percent of 367 families in the In-home Family Care Program in northern California were intact one year after services ended (Berry 1992). Table 1 provides a summary of some other recent nonexperimental studies of placement prevention efforts.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>The Families First program in Michigan has received a great deal of attention because of its claimed success in preventing placement. An evaluation (Bergquist, Szwejda, and Pope 1993) compared 225 children referred to the program (thought to be at "imminent risk of placement") with a matched group of 225 children who had recently exited foster care.<sup>8</sup> It was found that 76 percent of the children in the Families First group remained in their homes at 12 months after the intervention while 65 percent of children in the comparison group remained in their homes for 12 months after they had returned from foster care. However, these groups cannot be considered to be comparable. Children in families entering a family preservation program and those recently discharged from foster care cannot be assumed to be similar in their likelihood of future placement.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Additional claims for the effectiveness of the Michigan program, made by the state, are based on a decrease in the number of children placed in foster care in 1992, four years after the initiation of the Families First program.<sup>10</sup> However, changes in foster care rates over a few years do not provide evidence of the effects of family preservation programs because such rates are affected by many other factors. In many jurisdictions, foster care caseloads have increased despite the presence of family preservation services; it is possible that these increases would have been greater in the absence of family preservation efforts. Alternatively, intensive in-home services may actually contribute to the rise in foster care rates because these services involve more extensive scrutiny of child rearing practices than occurs in their absence (Schuerman, Rzepnicki, and Littell 1994).</p>
<p>These findings have been used to suggest that family preservation programs reduce the need for out-of-home placement of children.<sup>11</sup> However, nonexperimental studies such as these do not provide convincing evidence of program effects, since it is not clear that families would have experienced placement of children in the absence of these services. Claims that children were at "imminent risk of placement" at the time of referral have not been supported by evidence. Referring workers may assert that placement is imminent in order to obtain intensive services for families.<sup>12</sup></p>
<hr /><p><sup>5</sup> Studies that did not employ comparison or control groups include Kinney, Madsen, Fleming, and Haapala (1977); Florida Office of the Inspector General (1982); Leeds (1984); Landsman (1985); Hinckley and Ellis (1985); Van Meter (1986); Bribitzer and Verdieck (1988); Fondacaro and Tighe (1990); Thieman, Fuqua, and Linnan (1990); Kinney, Haapala and Booth (1991); Smith (1991); Berry (1992); Wheeler, Reuter, Struckman-Johnson, and Yuan (1993); Bartsch and Kawamura (1993); and Scannapieco (1994). Studies which employed non-equivalent comparison group designs include Pearson and King (1987); Reid, Kagan, and Schlosberg (1988); Bergquist, Szwejda, and Pope (1993); Landsman, Richardson, Clem, Harper, Schuldt, and Nelson (1993); Schafer and Erickson (1993); Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Social Services, Administration for Children, Youth and Families (1994); Hoecker (1994); North Carolina Department of Human Resources, Division of Family Development (1994); Showell, Hartley, and Allen (N.D.); and Thieman and Dail (1993).</p>
<p>Previous reviews of this literature have been provided by Schuerman, Rzepnicki, and Littell (1994); Kaye and Bell (1992); Nelson and Landsman (1992); Wheeler (1992); Fraser, Pecora, and Haapala (1991); Rossi (1991); Davis (1988); Frankel (1988); Jones (1985); Stein (1985); and Magura (1981). See also Bath and Haapala (1994), Littell (1995), and Bath and Haapala (1995).</p>
<p>Studies of programs designed to prevent placement of status offenders (Nugent, Carpenter, and Parks 1993) or delinquent and emotionally disturbed children (Cunningham, Homer, Bass, and Brown 1993) have also relied on non-experimental designs.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup> The idea of phantom control groups is due to Rossi and Freeman (1993).</p>
<p><sup>7</sup> Table 1 was constructed by Larry Cohen.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup> To create the comparison groups, one child who was designated "at imminent risk of placement" within each Families First case was matched with a child who had exited foster care within 90 days of the date the Families First case was initiated. The pairs of children were also matched on age, county of residence, type of referral, and prior involvement with protective services.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup> It is not easy to sort out all of the problems here. The assumption appears to have been made that cases referred to the program would have been likely to have been placed in the absence of the program. The comparison group of children discharged from care presumably was composed of those deemed unlikely to need further care in the near future, otherwise they would not have been discharged. Hence, the groups could not have been considered comparable in placement propensities at the outset. However, a further complication is that the assumption that referrals to family preservation programs consist of imminent risk of placement cases has been proven incorrect in controlled studies, as we shall see below.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup> The Michigan Families First program began in 17 counties in 1988 and was quickly expanded to the rest of the state. According to data from the Michigan Department of Social Services (1993), the number of new foster care placements increased steadily from 6,490 in 1988 to 8,299 in 1991, followed by a decrease to 7,632 new placements in 1992. The foster care caseload in Michigan grew from 15,878 in 1988 to 17,124 in 1992. These data are somewhat at variance with data in the Multistate Foster Care Archive of the Chapin Hall Center for Children. Archive data indicate that there were 6,368 new admissions in 1988, increasing to 7,188 in 1991, with a decrease to 6,603 in 1992. Archive data on the foster care census in Michigan show a total of 10,901 at the end of 1988, increasing to 12,671 by the end of 1991, decreasing to 12,265 in 1992. During this period discharges from care steadily increased.</p>

          Overflow Designs      </h5>
    </a>

              <p>Overflow designs, in which a comparison group is composed of cases not served because programs are full, provide information about effects that is somewhat better than single group or non- comparable group designs. We review four such studies here.</p>
<p>FamiliesFirst in Davis, California, was an intensive, in- home service program based on the Homebuilders model (Wood, Barton, and Schroeder 1988). Families were referred to the project by child protective services staff. Eligible families had children who had been abused or neglected and were thought to be at risk of having at least one child placed out of the home. An overflow comparison study was conducted. One year after intake, 25 percent (15) of the 59 children in the in-home services group were placed compared with 53 percent (26) of 49 children in the comparison group (a statistically significant difference).</p>
<p>Family Preservation Services in Hennepin County, consisted of intensive home-based services delivered by eight "specially trained social workers" (Schwartz and AuClaire 1989; Schwartz, AuClaire, and Harris 1991). The service was intended to last for four weeks. The evaluation of this program involved a non-random comparison group. There were 58 cases in each group, selected during the period August through December 1985. Three of the experimental group cases were in placement during the entire follow-up period and were excluded from outcome analyses. Follow-up extended until December 31, 1986. Placement occurred in 56% of 55 experimental cases and 91% of the 58 comparison cases (a significant difference). Fifty-five percent of cases in the family preservation group and 64 percent of those in the comparison group experienced multiple placements.</p>
<p>The Bronx Homebuilders Program, modeled after Homebuilders, began accepting clients in May 1987 (Mitchell, Tovar, and Knitzer 1989). Cases were referred from two sources, the city Child Welfare Administration (CWA) and the Pius XII Court Designated Assessment Service (Pius). The average length of service was 35 days. A one year follow-up of 45 families referred in the first year was conducted. An overflow comparison group of 12 families was available for the Pius group, one of which was not followed up. Families in the overflow group had relatively fewer placements than those in the service group. At three months, 19 percent (4 of 21) CWA, 23 percent (5 of 22) Pius treatment, and 9 percent (1 of 11) Pius comparison families had experienced a placement. At 12 months, 24 percent (5) of the CWA, 27 percent (6) of the Pius treatment, and 18 percent (2) of the Pius comparison families had experienced placement. Apparently, all children who were placed were still in placement at the end of the follow-up period.</p>
<p>The Family-Based Intensive Treatment (FIT) Study concerned intensive home-based services based on the Homebuilders model in Utah and Washington State (Pecora, Fraser, and Haapala 1992). In Utah a 60-day service model was provided in two sites by the state child welfare department while in Washington a 30-day service was provided in four sites by Homebuilders (under contract with the state agency). The criteria for referral were risk of imminent placement, safety of the child with service, and willingness of at least one parent to cooperate with service. At termination, 9 percent of 172 Utah children and 6 percent of 409 Washington children in the treatment groups had been placed. At a 12 month follow-up, 41 percent of 97 Utah children and 30 percent of 245 Washington children had been placed. In an overflow comparison group of 27 Utah children, 85 percent were placed during the 12 month follow-up period.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, 54 percent of the cases served in the Washington project during the study period did not participate in the study.<sup>14</sup> In addition, 32 percent of the cases in the overflow comparison group were not tracked. The researchers attempted to deal with this problem by matching a subsample of program cases with cases in the overflow comparison group; however, the variables used in the matching design were only weakly related to placement and the number of matched pairs was quite small.</p>
<p>Missing data for the overflow comparison group seriously compromises the interpretation of differences. If few of the unstudied overflow cases were placed, between-group differences in placement rates would have been much smaller than the differences observed.<sup>15</sup></p>
<hr /><p><sup>13</sup> The overflow group consisted of 26 of the 38 families that were referred to the family preservation program but not served because program staff had full caseloads. They received traditional child welfare or mental health services. Twelve of the 38 families were referred to the program early on and could not be traced. The remaining 26 cases were tracked for one year or until a child at risk was placed, whichever came first (Pecora, Fraser, and Haapala 1991).</p>
<p><sup>14</sup> Of the cases that did not participate, slightly more than half (51%) were asked not to participate by their worker (for reasons that are not entirely clear), 24 percent refused to participate, 20 percent did not have the opportunity to participate because of research administration problems, and 5 percent were excluded for treatment reasons (Pecora, Fraser, and Haapala 1991).</p>
<p><sup>15</sup> Placed children in the overflow group may have been easier to track than unplaced children. If this was the case, the observed placement rate in the overflow group would have been biased upward.</p>

          Early Experimental Studies      </h5>

              <p>In the studies reviewed so far, rates of placement in the groups provided family preservation services were quite low. However, we cannot conclude from these results that the services were the cause of the low rates of placement. The reason for this is that we cannot be sure what would have happened to these cases in the absence of services. To determine this, we need comparison groups that are as similar as possible to the groups provided services. While the overflow studies did incorporate comparison groups, the overflow groups were often quite small and we cannot be certain that they were similar to treatment groups at the outset. The best assurance of initially equivalent comparison groups is to randomly assign cases that are referred for services to treatment and control groups.</p>
<p>Below we review the results of controlled studies of family preservation programs; these studies are described in greater detail in Table 2.<sup>16</sup> Early studies (those conducted in the late 1970s and early 1980s) involved smaller groups of clients than more recent evaluations.</p>
<p>The New York State Preventive Services Demonstration Project, conducted in the mid-1970s, foreshadowed later family preservation programs. It provided intensive services to families over approximately 14 months (Jones, Neuman, and Shyne 1976). During the Spring and Summer of 1974, the project served cases in which placement was thought to be imminent, families with children in placement, and those in which children had recently been returned home. The goals of the project were to prevent placement, reunify families, and prevent reentry into foster care. Here we focus on the subgroup of families in which children were living at home at the time of referral (the effort to reunify families with children in foster care is discussed below). Families of 525 children were randomly assigned to the program or a control group. At the end of treatment, placement rates were significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group (7% versus 18%). Six months after the termination of services 8 percent of children in the program group and 23 percent of those in the control group had been placed (Jones, Neuman, and Shyne 1976). A follow-up study of a subsample of 243 children in the experiment was conducted five years after the project ended. At that time, 34 percent of the children in the experimental group and 46 percent of those in the control group had been placed in foster care, a statistically significant difference (Jones 1985). Thus, the program appears to have had beneficial effects on placement, although the differences between the experimental and control groups were not large, and determination of long term effects is quite problematic because of sample loss at the time of the five-year follow-up (less than 50% were followed).</p>
<p>Special Services for Children, a public agency in New York City, provided intensive services to families with children "at risk of placement." A randomized experiment involved 120 families with 282 children (Halper and Jones 1981, reviewed in Stein 1985). Four percent (6) of the 156 children in the experimental group and 17 percent (22) of 126 in the control group were placed in substitute care during the project (a statistically significant difference).</p>
<p>The Hudson County (New Jersey) Special Service Project in the late 1970s served families whose children were thought to be at "risk of placement within the next two years" (Magura 1981, Stein 1985). Ninety families were randomly assigned to program and control groups. At the end of the three-year demonstration project, 24 percent (11) of families in the program and 18 percent (8) of those in the control group experienced placement of a child (a non-significant difference) (Willems and DeRubeis 1981).</p>
<p>Nebraska Intensive Services to Families at Risk served families at risk of placement because of actual or suspected child maltreatment (Nebraska Department of Public Welfare 1981, reviewed in Stein 1985). One hundred and fifty-three families were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. Experimental cases were more likely to be placed with relatives and friends than control cases which required more public foster care. Although the exact number of children placed is not known,<sup>17</sup> available data indicate that 4 percent (3) of 80 families in the experimental group and 11 percent (8) of 73 families in the control group had one or more children placed in out-of-home care (Stein 1985), a non-significant difference.</p>
<p>The Home Based Services Demonstration Project of the Ramsey County, Minnesota (St. Paul) child protective services department (Lyle and Nelson 1983) involved random assignment of 74 families to an experimental, family-centered, home-based unit or one of three traditional child protection units (Frankel 1988). Three months after services ended, 33 percent of families in the experimental group had experienced placement of one or more children, compared with 55 percent of families in the control group. Of the children who were placed, those in the experimental group spent significantly less time in substitute care (Frankel 1988).</p>
<p>The Family Study Project in Hennepin County, Minnesota (Minneapolis) involved random assignment of 138 cases to experimental and control units of the county agency (Hennepin County Community Services Department 1980, reviewed in Stein 1985). The families served had children under age 15 who "were at risk of placement, but who were judged by intake workers not to be at imminent risk of abuse or neglect" (Stein 1985, p. 116). The experimental group had a higher number of children placed in foster care (123 versus 84 children in the control group); however, the total number of children in each group was not reported (Stein 1985). Of those placed, children in the experimental group spent slightly fewer days in placement (mean of 199 days) than those in the control group (mean of 208 days).</p>
<p>A Social Learning Treatment Program in Oregon, involved parents with children between the ages of 3 and 12 who were considered at risk of placement because of child abuse and neglect. A randomized experiment compared the experimental services with regular child protective services (Szykula and Fleischman (1985). The experiment included families of 48 children.<sup>18</sup> Cases were identified as more or less difficult by workers, based on numbers of prior abuse reports and types of family problems.<sup>19</sup> Cases within each difficulty group were randomly assigned to program or control services. The experimental program appeared to reduce the risk of placement among less difficult cases: 8 percent (1 of 13) of the children in the less difficult experimental group and 38 percent (5 of 13) of those in the comparable control group were placed. However, there was no significant difference between program and control groups in placement rates for more difficult cases: 64 percent (7 of 11) of children in the more difficult experiment group versus 45 percent (5 of 11) in the control group. The overall effect of the program (for both groups) was not significant.</p>
<p>The results of early experimental studies of family preservation programs were mixed: some found little or no effects on placement while others found that the programs achieved slight reductions in placement. However, in all studies, relatively few control group families experienced placement. This means that services were generally not delivered to the target group of families at risk of placement.</p>

Other reviews of this literature have been provided by Jones (1985); Stein (1985); Frankel (1988); Fraser, Pecora, and Haapala (1991); Rossi (1991); Wells and Biegel (1991); Nelson and Landsman (1992); and Kaye and Bell (1992).</p>
<p><sup>17</sup> Data on informal placements with relatives and friends and on placements outside the project county were not available.</p>
<p><sup>18</sup> The authors describe another study, involving an A-B-A reversal design that focused on the numbers of substitute care placements in Jackson County, Oregon before, during, and after installation of a social learning treatment program. Although the authors suggest that placements declined during the nine month period in which the program was in operation, the results are not convincing since placement was a fairly low-incident event in this county (only 58 placements were recorded during the entire 49-month study period).</p>
<p><sup>19</sup> The "less difficult" group included families with fewer than three reports of abuse, no serious housing or transportation problems, and children with conduct problems. Those in the "more difficult" group had three or more prior reports; serious problems with employment, transportation, and housing; and "major problems outside of their relationship with their child" (Szykula and Fleischman 1985, p. 281).</p>

              <p>California's AB 1562 In-home Care Demonstration Project, in operation in eight counties from 1986 to 1989, was an intensive, in-home services program. Cases thought to involve "imminent risk of placement" due to abuse or neglect were referred by county child protective services offices.<sup>20</sup> Families were served for an average of 7 weeks in programs conducted in eight sites by seven private agencies and one public mental health agency. Data were collected on 709 (96%) of the 741 families served by these programs over a three year period (Yuan, McDonald, Wheeler, Struckman-Johnson, and Rivest 1990).</p>
<p>A sub-study in five of the eight counties involved the random assignment of cases to in-home services or to regular services of the county child welfare agencies. There were 152 families in each group. Cases were followed for 8 months after random assignment. Outcome data were available for 293 (96%) of the cases in the randomized experiment. In 20 percent of the control group families and 25 percent of the experimental group families a placement occurred between two and 8 months after referral--a non-significant difference.<sup>21</sup> (A similar proportion of the entire group of 709 families experienced placement in the study period.) There were no substantial differences in lengths of time in placement and costs of placement.<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>New Jersey Family Preservation Services (FPS), modeled after Homebuilders, provided services for a median of 6 weeks. Private agencies in five counties served families referred by local child welfare offices, county family court or crisis intervention units, and regional community mental health centers. The FPS programs served "several waves" of families before a randomized experiment was instituted by the state. Data are available on 117 experimental and 97 control cases that were randomly assigned in four of New Jersey's 21 counties (Feldman 1991). Another 33 families were "turned back" after random assignment to the experimental services (because they did not meet selection criteria, the caretaker refused to participate in the program, or the children were deemed at imminent risk of harm and were removed from the home); these cases were not included in the analysis. The exclusion of 22 percent of the cases assigned to the experimental group seriously compromises comparisons of the experimental and control groups. These cases are clearly different from those that remained in the experiment and comparable cases were not excluded from the control group. Since these cases are likely to have experienced placement, the observed placement rate in the experimental group is probably understated.</p>
<p>During the intervention period (approximately 6 weeks) 6 percent of families in the experimental group and 17 percent of the families in the control group experienced placement of at least one target child. At 6 months post-termination, 27 percent of families in the experimental group and 50 percent of control group families had experienced at least one placement.<sup>23</sup> At one year post-termination 43 percent of those in the experimental group and 57 percent of families in the control group had experienced placement. (Differences between groups were statistically significant at each point in time.)<sup>24</sup> There is some evidence that the program delayed placement but the magnitude of this effect dissipated over time. For the first target child to enter placement in each family, there were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups in types of placements,<sup>25</sup> numbers of placements, or duration of time in placement. We report below findings on measures of family functioning.</p>
<p>In the Family Support Project in Los Angeles families were referred by the county Department of Children's Services to two private child welfare agencies for in-home family support services. Referrals were based on "caseworker judgment about need for the services" and were not limited to cases in which children were thought to be at imminent risk of placement (Meezan and McCroskey 1993).<sup>26</sup> An evaluation involved random assignment of 240 families to in-home services or regular child protective services. Data on placements were available for 231 families. At the beginning of the project 37 (34%) of the 108 families in the in-home services group and 30 (24%) of 123 families in the control group had one or more children in placement. During the project, 19 (6%) of the 335 children in the experimental group were placed, compared with 34 (8%) of 424 children in the comparison group. At the end of the project (12 months after services ended), families in the experimental group had more children in out-of-home placements than those in the comparison group (38% versus 24%) (McCroskey and Meezan 1993). Below we report the study's findings regarding program effects on family functioning.</p>
<p>The Illinois Family First Experiment is the largest randomized experiment conducted in this area to date (see Schuerman, Rzepnicki, and Littell 1994). The primary goal of the Family First program was to prevent placements among families in which a child had been abused or neglected; other goals included reducing the risk of subsequent child maltreatment, improving child and family functioning, linking families to other community services, and closing cases in the child welfare system. Initially, families referred to the project were thought to be at imminent risk of placement. Family preservation services were provided by sixty private agencies under contract with the state. Data were collected on 6,522 families referred to the program between December 1988 and December 1992. Between April 1990 and April 1992, families in six sites (containing 18 Family First programs) were randomly assigned to intensive family preservation services or regular child welfare services.<sup>27</sup> (A seventh site was dropped from the experiment because 20% of the case assignments in that site were violated.) A total of 1,564 families participated in the experiment (995 were assigned to Family First and 569 to the control group). These cases were followed through March 1993.</p>
<p>Family First workers carried caseloads of 5 families on average, compared to average caseloads of 50 for workers who provided services to families in the control group. Overall, cases in the Family First program received far more intensive contact than those in the control group. Family First cases were much more likely to receive counseling, crisis intervention, advocacy, parent education, referrals for medical and specialized services, and an array of concrete services including transportation, material aid, and cash assistance. One-fifth of the cases in the control group were never opened for services in the state child welfare agency and 51 percent of those that were opened received no services of any kind during the first 90 days after random assignment. Interviews with a subsample of 278 parents in the program and control groups in three experimental sites were conducted to obtain longitudinal data on child and family functioning, parents' views of the services they received, major life events, social support, and further service utilization. These interview data support the conclusion that FPS cases received much more extensive help than cases in the control group.</p>
<p>Overall, the Family First program appeared to result in a slight increase in the risk of placement. At one year after random assignment, placement had occurred in approximately 27 percent of Family First cases and 21 percent of control cases. In the two experimental sites in the Chicago area, increases in the risk of placement for children in the Family First group were statistically significant (there were no sites in which the program produced a significant reduction in placement rates). Differences between experimental and control groups in placement rates were not significant once variations in case characteristics were taken into account. There were no significant differences between groups in the duration or types of placements (Schuerman, Rzepnicki, and Littell 1994).</p>
<p>The risk of placement among cases in this experiment was very low at the time of referral. Placement rates in the control group were approximately 7 percent at one month after random assignment, 17 percent at six months, 21 percent at one year, and 27 percent at two years. Since the program served few cases that would have experienced placement in the absence of family preservation services, we can conclude that Family First did not reach its target population of cases at "imminent risk of placement."</p>
<p>The Family First program had a net-widening effect in that it provided services to families that would not ordinarily have received services in the child welfare system (as noted above, 20% of the control cases were never opened for services). This effect was particularly striking in several sites. However, the program had no long-term effect on the duration of time families spent in the child welfare system.</p>
<p>The effects of the Family First program on subsequent maltreatment and on measures of child and family functioning are discussed below.</p>
<hr /><p><sup>20</sup> During the second year of the study, "imminent risk" was defined as the expectation (based on statements from the referral source) that action would be taken to remove the child(ren) within two weeks unless intensive services were provided. The researchers reported that many caseworkers found this definition too stringent and confusing.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup> Placements that terminated within 8 weeks of random assignment were not included in analyses of placement rates; in these cases, children were considered to be reunified with their parents during the intensive service period. A child-level analysis showed that 18 percent of children in the project group and 17 percent of children in the control group were placed between 2 and 8 months after random assignment.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup> Control group children tended to be placed more quickly than those who received intensive in-home services. Rossi (1991) has termed this the "moratorium effect" of family preservation programs in delaying, but not necessarily preventing, placement.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup> For control group cases, termination was defined as "6 weeks after referral to FPS or actual termination of community services, whichever came first" (Feldman 1991, p. 69).</p>
<p><sup>24</sup> Differences between groups were computed at termination and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-termination.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup> Types of placements included homes of relatives, foster homes, emergency and runaway shelters, residential centers, detention, independent living, mental health in-patient facilities, and teaching family homes.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup> The project also accepted some referrals from schools, hospitals, mental health clinics, and other community agencies. Compared with families referred by DCS, cases that were referred by other sources were seen by the in-home services workers as having less severe problems at referral (Meezan 1993).</p>
<p><sup>27</sup> The probability of assignment to family preservation services was .6. Thus, about 60% of the families were assigned to these services, the remaining 40% to regular services.</p>

          Relationships between Service Characteristics and Placement      </h5>

              <p>Several studies have examined correlations between service characteristics and placement outcomes. For example, Yuan et al. (1990) found that placement was more likely among families who received less intensive family preservation services. Nelson et al. (1988) reported that placement rates were lower in programs that offered more focused, shorter-term, office-based services to families with fewer risk factors (versus more comprehensive, in- home services for families with more risk factors). Nelson and Landsman (1992) found that placement was less likely when caretakers participated in most or all treatment sessions. In addition, the provision of paraprofessional services was correlated with reduced placement rates among child neglect cases, while reduced placement rates were related to the receipt of marital counseling in cases of physical abuse (Nelson and Landsman 1992).</p>
<p>Associations between characteristics of services and outcomes in these studies do not provide convincing evidence for the effects of these service characteristics. Characteristics of cases (such as family problems and their severity) determine the kinds of services provided and these characteristics are also likely to be related to outcomes, so that case characteristics become an alternative explanation for associations between services and outcomes. Again, the best way to determine the effects of service characteristics is to randomly assign cases to varying treatments, thereby eliminating the association between case characteristics and services provided. A weaker alternative approach is to model the relationship between case characteristics and service provision, using such models to control for the effects of case characteristics.</p>
<p>In the Illinois experiment, relationships between service characteristics and placement outcomes were analyzed using statistical controls for the effects of case characteristics on features of service provision and case outcomes (see Schuerman, Rzepnicki, and Littell 1994). There were no overall relationships between the duration of family preservation services, amounts of contact with caseworkers or parent aides in the first 90 days of services, or the number of concrete services provided and the likelihood of placement once the effects of case characteristics were taken into account. In a related study, separate analyses of relationships between service characteristics and outcomes were examined for specific subgroups of cases (Littell, Schuerman, and Chak 1994). The subgroups were: families with cocaine problems, families with inadequate housing problems, cases in which a parent had a serious emotional problem, and families with serious child care skill deficits. Once the effects of other case characteristics on service provision and case outcomes were controlled, it appeared that the duration, amount of contact with workers, number of concrete services, and specific types of services provided were not related to the risk of placement.<sup>31</sup></p>
<hr /><p><sup>31 </sup>This study examined the effects on placement of the following types of services for specific subgroups: provision of substance abuse treatment in cocaine cases, assistance in moving to new housing for families with housing problems, individual counseling in cases with serious emotional problems, and parent education and homemaking services in cases with serious child care skill deficits.</p>

              <p>Although many non-experimental studies have suggested that high percentages of families remain intact after intensive family preservation services, the results of randomized experiments provide more convincing tests of the extent to which "placement prevention rates" can be attributed to the effects of these programs. The findings of the controlled studies we reviewed are mixed: Seven of the eleven randomized experiments (Hennepin County Community Services Department 1981; Nebraska Department of Public Welfare 1981; Willems and DeRubeis 1981; Szykula and Fleischman 1985; Yuan et al. 1990; Meezan and McCroskey 1993; Schuerman, Rzepnicki, and Littell 1994) and one overflow group study (Mitchell, Tovar, and Knitzer 1989) found that the programs did not produce significant overall reductions in placement. Four randomized experiments (Jones, Neuman, and Shyne 1976; Halper and Jones 1981; Lyle and Nelson 1983; Feldman 1991) and three overflow comparison studies (Wood, Barton, and Schroeder 1988; Schwartz, AuClaire, and Harris 1991; Pecora, Fraser, and Haapala 1992) found significant reductions in placement in favor of the experimental groups.</p>
<p>In studies that found significant reductions in placement, differences between groups were relatively small. For example, in New Jersey, the difference between groups in the proportion of cases in placement at one year after treatment ended was 14 percent (Feldman 1991). Although larger differences were found in the overflow studies, questions about the comparability of groups in these studies remain and sample sizes were generally small. Small sample sizes are also a concern in the earlier experimental projects.</p>
<p>The fact that placement occurred within a short period of time after group assignment in less than half of the control or comparison cases in most studies suggests that these programs were generally not delivered to families with children at risk of placement. (The placement rate in a control group is an estimate of the risk of placement for both groups in the absence of experimental services.) When the risk of placement among family preservation clients is low, it is unlikely that a program will demonstrate significant reductions in placement. It is not meaningful to talk about preventing an event if the event wouldn't have happened anyway.</p>
<p>Finally, available evidence sheds little light on whether family preservation programs have differential effects on placement for different kinds of families or on the relative effectiveness of different approaches to placement prevention. Evidence of the effects of family preservation programs for specific subgroups of clients is scant and the results of available studies are somewhat contradictory. Although it is correlational in nature, the best available evidence suggests that features of services that are often considered among the hallmarks of family preservation programs--brevity and intensity of services and the provision of an array of concrete and specialized services--may not be critical.</p>
