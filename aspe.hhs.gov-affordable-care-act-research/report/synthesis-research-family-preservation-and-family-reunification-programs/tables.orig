<table align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td>STUDY</td>
<td><u>Arizona Department of Economic Security, Division of Social Services, Administration for Children, Youth and Families, 1993</u></td>
</tr><tr><td>STATE</td>
<td>Arizona</td>
</tr><tr><td>DESIGN AND SAMPLE SIZE</td>
<td>Descriptive report on 195 families with 567 children who received Family Preservation Services covering fiscal year 1993.</td>
</tr><tr><td>TARGET POPULATION</td>
<td>Families whose children are at risk of out-of home placement due to abuse or neglect.</td>
</tr><tr><td>PROGRAM SERVICES</td>
<td>Services were provided by nine private agencies in contract with the state. The average length of service for families who entered the program was 56 days. One provider operated a four week program; the remaining providers offered six to eight week programs. Each agency spent an average of 45 hours providing direct services (usually in-home counseling), and 41 hours providing indirect services (these figures are based on the 182 families who exited the program in fiscal year 1993). Up to $300 was available to each family for emergency assistance (i.e., for rent, utilities, food). Service delivery models varied somewhat among the provider agencies.</td>
</tr><tr><td>OUTCOMES</td>
<td>Investigators used three measures of success when analyzing outcome: a comparison of risk level at the beginning of family preservation services with risk level at completion of family preservation services, the number of new substantiated reports of child abuse or neglect that involved families who were receiving family preservation services (and at six months post-treatment), and number of out-of-home placements within families who were receiving family preservation services (and at six months post-treatment). Seventy-nine percent of families completed the program; risk status was reduced for 78 percent of families. In addition, almost 83 percent of families who entered and exited the program had no new substantiated reports of child abuse or neglect while receiving family preservation services. Eighty-six percent of the children who entered and exited the program during fiscal year 1993 did not experience out-of-home placement while participating in the program, and at six months following program completion.</td>
</tr><tr><td>STUDY</td>
<td><u>Cunningham, et al. (1993)</u></td>
</tr><tr><td>STATE</td>
<td><strong>Tennessee</strong></td>
</tr><tr><td>DESIGN AND SAMPLE SIZE</td>
<td>Descriptive report on 2,558 families referred for family preservation services (Tennessee Home Ties), 2,479 were accepted for services, from October 1989 to June 1992.</td>
</tr><tr><td>TARGET POPULATION</td>
<td>Cases in which placement was thought to be imminent. 22% referred from Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, 12.5% referred from Department of Youth Development, 50% referred from Department of Human Services. Nearly 41% were ordered by the court to out-of-home placements. Age 17 years or younger. 45% of the children at risk had been in prior out-of-home placement. These children had an average of 1.7 previous placements.</td>
</tr><tr><td>PROGRAM SERVICES</td>
<td>Services provided by 28 community service agencies. Behavioral-cognitive approach. Median length of service, 4 weeks. Crisis resolution, parenting education, child development training, advocacy, communication and negotiation skills, home maintenance skills, concrete services, job readiness training, linkages to other services.</td>
</tr><tr><td>OUTCOMES</td>
<td>At termination, of 2,795 children on whom information was available, 92% were not in state care. At a 12 month follow-up, 69% were not in state care. Cost avoidance analyses were performed. An analysis of a small overflow comparison group was to have been completed in 1993.</td>
</tr><tr><td>STUDY</td>
<td><u>Hoecker (1994)</u></td>
</tr><tr><td>STATE</td>
<td>Missouri</td>
</tr><tr><td>DESIGN AND SAMPLE SIZE</td>
<td>Descriptive report on 2,178 referrals for family preservation services (1,052 accepted for services) covering fiscal year 1994.</td>
</tr><tr><td>TARGET POPULATION</td>
<td>Cases in which placement was thought to be imminent. A child was considered at-risk of placement if they had been abused or neglected, were severely emotionally disturbed, or had been involved in delinquent behavior.</td>
</tr><tr><td>PROGRAM SERVICES</td>
<td>Services were provided by the Department of Social Services; 35 Family Preservation Sites were involved. In-home services were provided on a daily or weekly basis and emergency housing funds were available. Preservation services were delivered for a six week period, after which cases were referred for less intensive continuing family assistance services (Loman &amp; Siegel, 1994).</td>
</tr><tr><td>OUTCOMES</td>
<td>Of the 1,088 families that exited the program during fiscal year 1994, 918 were intact and 144 were not intact. Reasons for a family not being intact included child ran away, child moved out of home (not placed), child living with relative or guardian (court ordered), child in foster home or group home, child in residential treatment, child with Division of Youth Services, child in juvenile justice or child in in-patient psychiatric diversion. Of the 2,054 children considered at-risk within the 1,088 exiting families, 1,799 returned home, while 222 did not return home.</td>
</tr><tr><td>STUDY</td>
<td><u>North Carolina Department of Human Resources, Division of Family Development (1994)</u></td>
</tr><tr><td>STATE</td>
<td>North Carolina</td>
</tr><tr><td>DESIGN AND SAMPLE SIZE</td>
<td>Descriptive annual report on the family preservation services provided to 486 families during fiscal year 1993-1994 (756 families were referred for services, 486 families received services beyond intake). A limited number of qualitative case studies are also presented. One appendix provides instruments used in data collection.</td>
</tr><tr><td>TARGET POPULATION</td>
<td>Families with a child or children at risk of out-of-home placement into foster care, or a mental health, developmental disabilities or substance abuse facility, or training school.</td>
</tr><tr><td>PROGRAM SERVICES</td>
<td>In FY 1993-1994 15 Family Preservation Service Programs provided services in 32 counties. These programs were based in either county departments of social services, area mental health/developmental disabilities/substance abuse services programs or private non-profit agencies. Families received services for a six week period. Services provided included in-home family and individual counseling and parent skills training; several programs also provided transportation, food, housekeeping assistance, budgeting assistance, financial counseling, and substance abuse prevention services.</td>
</tr><tr><td>OUTCOMES</td>
<td>At program completion, 88% of families remained intact (children had not been removed or placed). Fifty-nine children were placed out-of-home; 7 children were placed in the mental health system, 6 children were placed in the juvenile justice system, 1 child was placed in a private placement, and 1 child ran-away.</td>
</tr><tr><td>STUDY</td>
<td><u>Pearson &amp; King, 1987</u></td>
</tr><tr><td>STATE</td>
<td>Maryland</td>
</tr><tr><td>DESIGN AND SAMPLE SIZE</td>
<td>Quasi-experimental design. At intake, cases were assigned to either Intensive Family Services or traditional family services based on an assessed "risk of placement" level. Cases assigned to Intensive Family Services were assessed as more at risk of placement. 180 families were referred for traditional services while 80 families were referred for Intensive Family Services.</td>
</tr><tr><td>TARGET POPULATION</td>
<td>Cases assessed at intake as being most at risk of foster care placement based on an assessed "risk of placement" level. Risk level was assessed through the use of a standardized risk assessment form completed by all workers at intake.</td>
</tr><tr><td>PROGRAM SERVICES</td>
<td>Staff were assigned six cases at a time. In-home services were provided by Intensive Family Services staff (a worker or aide) between 1.1 and 2.1 times per week on average during the first month of service and less than once a month during the second and third months of service. On average, 3.55 total contacts were made per week over a 3 month period. "Flex dollars" were available to assist with payment of rent or utilities, the purchase of furniture and clothing, and transportation/vehicle needs. Intensive Family Services were provided for approximately 90 days.</td>
</tr><tr><td>OUTCOMES</td>
<td>Of the 180 cases referred for traditional services, 33 percent experienced foster care placement within 6 months. 18 percent of the original 180 cases were immediately placed in foster care. Of the remaining 148 families who were referred for traditional services, 18 percent were placed within six months or at termination of services (six months or less). Of the 80 cases referred for Intensive Family Services, 7.5 percent were placed within 90 days or at termination of services (90 days or less). At 12 month follow-up, 8 percent of the 148 cases referred for traditional services were open in foster care, while 3 percent of the 80 cases referred for Intensive Family Services were open in foster care.</td>
</tr><tr><td>STUDY</td>
<td><u>Showell, Hartley and Allen (N.D.)</u></td>
</tr><tr><td>STATE</td>
<td>Oregon</td>
</tr><tr><td>DESIGN AND SAMPLE SIZE</td>
<td>Based on data collected in 1987, this descriptive study of 999 families reports on six types of family systems: 1) neglectful, 2) sexually abusive, 3) physically abusive, 4) suicidal, 5) adoptive, and 6) delinquent. The study also discusses findings related to high and low success in family treatment. Worker surveys provided family data at time of service termination, as therapists filled out anonymous questionnaires for each family served. Families were also surveyed, and the study reports on parent satisfaction measures.</td>
</tr><tr><td>TARGET POPULATION</td>
<td>Oregon maintains two family preservation programs. The first, Intensive Family Services, began in 1980 and is designed to serve families at risk of having a child removed from the home. The second, called High Impact, began in 1982 and is designed to serve families when they first enter the family services system; this program is designed to help prevent the threat of a child's removal from home.</td>
</tr><tr><td>PROGRAM SERVICES</td>
<td>Treatment is short term, lasting from 90 to 120 days. On average, monthly caseworker loads were between 8.73 and 11.1 families. Of Oregon's 36 counties, 29 were served by these programs. The specific nature of service offered is not clear, although the authors write: "the focus of treatment is on healing relationships between family members rather than attempting to heal what appears to be an emotional or behavioral flaw that intrinsically resides within a 'dysfunctional' family member" (p. 4).</td>
</tr><tr><td>OUTCOMES</td>
<td>Treatment success is discussed in relation to each of the six types of family systems outlined above; success is reported based on therapist judgement of the success of treatment and the likelihood of the family avoiding placement in the future. Therapist ratings of overall clinical success and overall likelihood of a family remaining intact in the future are also reported. Sixteen percent of families were rated as having a "poor" likelihood of remaining intact, 19% of families were rated as having a "fair" likelihood of remaining intact, 27% of families were rated as having a "good" likelihood of remaining intact, 21% of families were rated as having a "very good" likelihood of remaining intact, and 17% of families were rated as having an "excellent" likelihood of remaining intact. The authors conclude: "we are satisfied that the empirical data of actual placements...correlate with the subjective judgements of therapists about clinical success. Systemic family treatment is successful in improving family life. Families are better able to remain together" (p. 49).</td>
</tr><tr><td>STUDY</td>
<td><u>Thieman and Dail (1992); Thieman and Dail (1993)</u></td>
</tr><tr><td>STATE</td>
<td>Iowa</td>
</tr><tr><td>DESIGN AND SAMPLE SIZE</td>
<td>Descriptive statistics are provided on the approximately 1,828 families served by Iowa's Family Preservation Program during fiscal year 1992 (see 1993 report; the sample size used in the analyses may be smaller as families served under 10 days and cases with substantial amounts of missing data were dropped). A qualitative report is also included, based on interviews with a subsample of 39 families.</td>
</tr><tr><td>TARGET POPULATION</td>
<td>Exact criteria used for referral to preservation services is not clear. The authors report that 84% of families referred for services "were considered to be regular, non-emergency cases" (pp. 5-6, 1993) and "58% of the children were considered to be target children (in placement, immediate, or high risk), and 9% were actually living in an out-of-home placement" (p. 7, 1993). Case problem areas listed include child abuse or neglect, child's behavior, delinquency, chaotic environment and parental dysfunction. Cases were referred by a variety of institutions, including child abuse investigative units, schools, and the courts. Most cases were referred by a child abuse investigative unit (29%) or were self-referrals (30%).</td>
</tr><tr><td>PROGRAM SERVICES</td>
<td>Services were provided by 13 agencies, lasting on average 44.93 days. Services provided included face-to-face contact and availability of cash assistance (for rent payments, transportation needs and food).</td>
</tr><tr><td>OUTCOMES</td>
<td>Upon completing the preservation program, 77% of families remained intact, while 8% of children had been placed in "formal out-of-home placements" and 3% of children had been placed with a relative or friend. At 30 day follow-up, 76% of families remained intact, while 9% of children had been placed in "formal out-of-home placements" and 4% of children had been placed with a relative or friend. Placement was more likely for families who were referred on an emergency basis, who had a history of psychiatric care, who had experienced prior out-of-home placement, or who had children under court jurisdiction.</td>

<td>New York</td>
</tr><tr><td>DESIGN AND SAMPLE SIZE</td>
<td>Families of 525 children were randomly assigned to the program or a control group.</td>
</tr><tr><td>TARGET POPULATION</td>
<td>Cases in which placement was thought to be imminent, families with children in placement, and those in which children had recently been returned home (here we focus only on the first group).</td>
</tr><tr><td>PROGRAM SERVICES</td>
<td>Demonstration services were provided by seven voluntary agencies in New York City (through subcontracts with Special Services for Children), the Monroe County Department of Social Services, and the Westchester County Department of Social Services. Both the program and control groups received traditional child welfare services (including counseling, financial assistance, medical care, family-life education, and day care). Intensive services were provided to cases in the experimental group over approximately 14 months. Caseloads in the experimental group were usually 10 families per worker and the families in this group received significantly more in-person contacts with workers.</td>
</tr><tr><td>OUTCOMES:</td>
<td> </td>
</tr><tr><td>Placement</td>
<td>At the end of treatment, placement rates were significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group (7% versus 18%). Six months after the termination of services 8% of children in the program group and 23% of those in the control group had been placed. A follow-up study of a subsample of 243 children in the experiment was conducted five years after the project ended. At that time, 34% of the children in the experimental group and 46% of those in the control group had been placed in foster care, a statistically significant difference. Note that sample loss at the time of the five-year follow-up (less than 50% were followed) limits the usefulness of these data.</td>

<td>The families served had children under age 15 who "were at risk of placement, but who were judged by intake workers not to be at imminent risk of abuse or neglect" (Stein 1985, p. 116).</td>
</tr><tr><td>PROGRAM SERVICES</td>
<td>Staff in the experimental group carried a maximum caseload of 15 families, compared to caseloads of 22 to 40 families among workers in the control group. Experimental cases received an average of 40 hours of service, compared with 32 hours for control cases. All agency services were available to families in both groups; specific services provided to families were not described (Stein 1985).</td>
</tr><tr><td>OUTCOMES:</td>
<td> </td>
</tr><tr><td>Placement</td>
<td>The experimental group had a higher number of children placed in foster care (123 versus 84 children in the control group); however, the total number of children in each group was not reported (Stein 1985). Of those placed, children in the experimental group spent slightly fewer days in placement (mean of 199 days) than those in the control group (mean of 208 days).</td>

</tr><tr><td>PROGRAM SERVICES</td>
<td>Services were provided by Special Services for Children, the public child welfare agency in New York City. Families in both the experimental and control groups received counseling, homemakers, day-care, and recreational, medical, legal, financial, and family planning services. The primary difference between groups was the intensity of services provided: over a one year period, families in the experimental group had three times the number of in-person contacts with workers (an average of 39 versus 13) and almost 12 times the number of telephone contacts (39 versus 3.4). Project staff also had significantly more contact with collateral and provided emergency financial assistance, vocational counseling, and housing assistance to families. They carried caseloads of 11 to 12 families, while the average caseload size for workers in the control group was 18 families.</td>

</tr><tr><td>TARGET POPULATION</td>
<td>Families at risk of placement because of actual or suspected child maltreatment.</td>
</tr><tr><td>PROGRAM SERVICES</td>
<td>Services were provided by the public child welfare agency in Nebraska. Workers in the experimental unit spent about 30% of their time in direct contact with clients, while those in the control unit spent about 20% of their time in either in-person or telephone contact with clients. The main difference between these units is that staff in the experimental group were under less time pressure and had more support and direction in decision-making. Information on caseload sizes and specific services provided to experimental and control families was not available (Stein 1985).</td>
</tr><tr><td>OUTCOMES:</td>
<td> </td>
</tr><tr><td>Placement</td>
<td>Control cases required more public foster care, compared with experimental cases which were more likely to be placed with relatives and friends. Although the exact number of children placed is not known, available data show that 4% (3) of 80 families in the experimental group and 11% (8) of 73 families in the control group had one or more children placed in out-of-home care, a non-significant difference. Data on informal placements with relatives and friends and on placements outside the project county were not available.</td>

All families received referrals to community mental health, day care, family planning, health care, and homemaker services. Those in the experimental group had access to legal advocacy, group therapy, and emergency financial services and were more likely to be referred for employment services, homemaker or teaching services, housing services, legal aid, and welfare assistance. Workers in the experimental group carried caseloads of 11 families each; caseload size for the control group was not reported (Stein 1985). Families in the experimental group received more home visits and had more contact with workers in their offices.</td>
</tr><tr><td>OUTCOMES:</td>
<td> </td>
</tr><tr><td>Placement</td>
<td>At the end of the three-year demonstration project, 24% (11) of families in the program and 18% (8) of those in the control group experienced placement (a non-significant difference). Children in the control group were more likely to be placed in restrictive settings (such as residential treatment) and less likely to be placed with relatives than those who received more intensive services. While more control group children were returned to their families (7 versus 3), reunification in the control cases was described as "unplanned and unsuccessful."</td>

The remaining 24 families did not receive home-based services because of insufficient space in the program; these families received regular county child protective services.</td>
</tr><tr><td>TARGET POPULATION</td>
<td>Families were referred to the project by child protective services staff. Eligible families had children who had been abused or neglected and were thought to be at risk of having at least one child placed out of the home. Target children in the in-home services group were somewhat older than those in the comparison group (average of 8.9 years versus 5.4 years).</td>

Another 33 families were "turned back" after random assignment to the experimental services (because they did not meet selection criteria, the caretaker refused to participate in the program, or the children were deemed at imminent risk of harm and were removed from the home); these cases were not included in the analysis.</td>
</tr><tr><td>TARGET POPULATION</td>
<td>Referrals came from local child welfare offices, county family court or crisis intervention units, and regional community mental health centers. Referrals were reviewed by a local screening body; screening criteria included "risk of placement." 46% of the cases involved single-parent households. The family preservation group had a higher proportion of white families (51%) than the control group (33%). About 20% of the families in both groups had experienced placement prior to referral. The mean age of "target" children was 13 years. Reasons for referral were out-of-control behavior among target children (in 60% of the cases); abuse, neglect, or risk of abuse or neglect (25%); emotional disturbance or substance abuse among target children (13%); and emotional or substance abuse problems among parents (2%).</td>
</tr><tr><td>PROGRAM SERVICES</td>
<td>The Family Preservation Services (FPS) program was modeled after Homebuilders. Services provided by private agencies involved a median of 31 hours of face-to-face contact between families and workers over a median of 6 weeks of service. In the first week of services, families received a mean of 13 hours of direct contact with workers. The median number of total hours of contact (including telephone and collateral contacts) per family was 48 (mean of 58). There were significant differences across sites in duration of services. Concrete services were received by 68% of the families in the experimental group. No information was provided on caseload size. Referring agencies were responsible for determining the kinds of services that were provided to families in the control group. Families in the control group typically received "traditional community services," including less intensive counseling services, referrals to other community resources, youth advocacy services, monitoring by the state child welfare agency, family court interventions, and out-of-home placement. Services received by control group families were thought to be much less intensive than those in family preservation programs, but, unfortunately, there was no systematic data collection on the nature and amounts of services provided to families in the control group. It was suggested that the services provided to control cases were similar to the kinds of follow-up services received by families in the experimental group (after FPS termination).<br />

The average caseload for workers in the Family First placement prevention program was 5 families (compared to an average of 50 cases for public child welfare workers who provided services to families in the control group). Family preservation services generally began within 24 hours of referral and were provided in families' homes. Cases in the Family First program received more intensive services than controls (a median of 70.3 hours of face-to-face contact with workers in the first 90 days of service, compared with 2.5 for control cases). Family First cases were much more likely than controls to receive counseling (93% versus 37%) and concrete services (89% versus 31%), they also received a wider array of concrete services (median of 4 different types of concrete services versus a median of zero for the control group) and were more likely to receive cash assistance (74% versus 7%). Services provided to cases in the program included crisis intervention, parent education, transportation, advocacy, and referrals for material aid, substance abuse treatment, and medical care. Half of the Family First cases left the program within 108 days. Interviews with a subsample of 278 clients in the experiment support the conclusion that Family First cases received much more extensive help than cases in the control group. One-fifth of the cases in the control group were never opened for services in the state child welfare agency and 51 percent of those that were opened received no services of any kind during the first 90 days after random assignment.<br />

At one year after random assignment, placement had occurred in 27% of Family First cases and 21% of control cases. Increases in the risk of placement for children in the Family First group were statistically significant in the two experimental sites in the Chicago area (there were no sites in which the program produced a significant reduction in placement rates); however, differences between experimental and control groups disappeared once variations in case characteristics were taken into account.

A few statistically significant differences between groups were found (most were in favor of the program group), but these gains were modest and did not last over time.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Other</td>
<td>The Family First program had a net-widening effect in that it provided services to families that would not ordinarily have been served in the child welfare system (as noted above, 20% of the control cases were never opened for services).

Children's ages ranged from one to 17 years (mean age of 10.7 years); most were Caucasian. They had a mean of 2.8 prior placements; the total time in previous placements ranged from one to 88 months (mean of 12.1 months). The mean duration of the most recent placement was 8 months. Primary caregivers were 35 years old on average and they had a mean of 12 years of education. Most families were fairly mobile (they had changed residences a mean of 4 times in the past 5 years), 61% had at least one employed adult in the household, and 54% had annual incomes under $10,000.</td>

Caseworkers carried caseloads of no more than six families at a time (mean of 5.8) and spent an average of 3.1 hours per week with each family; contacts during the first two weeks of services were somewhat more intensive (an average of 5.4 hours per week). The program provided concrete services (financial assistance, transportation, clothing, food, and household repairs) and training in communication skills, parenting skills, and anger management. Follow-up services were arranged for all of the families in the treatment group. Families in the control group received services from regular foster care workers, who had average caseloads of 22 and were expected to visit families at least once a month.</td>
