  <div class="content clearfix node-book ">
    <p><i>Performance Improvement 1997</i> is the second annual report of the 		U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on its evaluation 		activities. As a report to Congress, it summarizes the findings of HHS 		evaluations completed in fiscal year (FY) 1996. In that year, HHS agencies 		produced 87 evaluation reports and supported more than 250 evaluation projects 		in progress. </p>
<p> In general, the report is intended for three audiences: decisionmakers, 		who need information on program results across the broad spectrum of health and 		human services; program managers, who need information on how they can improve 		program operations and outcomes; and the health and human services community, 		which can benefit by applying the knowledge and lessons learned from HHS 		evaluations. </p>
<p> In the Foreword, Secretary Donna Shalala and David Garrison, Principal 		Deputy Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, stress that evaluation 		is an important tool for producing the knowledge necessary to develop and 		improve the performance of HHS's activities to meet the needs of the 21st 		century. HHS program managers are continuously engaged in efforts to determine 		whether programs and services reach the intended populations or communities, 		perform efficiently, and achieve desired results. </p>
<p><strong>Chapter I</strong></p>
<p>Chapter I provides an overview of evaluation at HHS. It describes a 		variety of evaluation activities; sources of funding; and evaluation management 		policies, including planning and coordination, project management, quality 		assurance, dissemination, and effective use of results. The last section in 		this chapter discusses future directions for HHS evaluation. In the coming 		years, the Department will examine the transformations now taking place in 		health and human services. The transformations underscore the need of the 		Department to play a leadership role in developing performance measures for 		implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA). 		HHS agencies remain committed to seeking information to continuously improve 		the operation of their programs. </p>
<p><strong>Chapter II</strong></p>
<p>Chapter II highlights 11 evaluations completed during FY 1996 and 		identified by the panel of Senior Editorial Advisors as particularly useful to 		the public health and human services community. For the selection criteria, see 		appendix C. </p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of Child Access Demonstration Projects: Report to 		Congress</strong></p>
<p>This Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Office of Child 		Support Enforcement report evaluates different forms of interventions to bring 		noncustodial parents closer to their children after divorce and separation. The 		interventions included mediation, parenting training, counseling, enforcement 		of visitation, and monitoring of visitation. The report found that mediation 		where both parties attend resulted in parenting plans in 65 to 70 percent of 		the cases. These parenting plans stimulated more visitation by noncustodial 		parents and better compliance with child support. A majority of both parents 		were satisfied with mediation. Other forms of intervention for more longer term 		and problematic cases did not register impact. </p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of Child Support Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>This ACF report evaluated the implementation of State child support 		guidelines mandated by the Family Support Act of 1988. The investigation 		concluded that States need to increase the consistency of guideline 		application, including income verification procedures, extended custody and 		visitation arrangements, and consideration of multiple family situations, 		health insurance, and day care expenses in the calculation of child support 		awards. Adopting a standardized support order would improve documentation of 		departures from guideline award calculations. </p>
<p><strong>Serving Elders at Risk: The Older Americans Act Nutrition Programs. 		National Evaluation of the Elderly Nutrition Program, 1993-1995</strong></p>
<p>The Elderly Nutrition Program sponsored by the Administration on Aging 		provides grants to State units on aging to subsidize the provision of daily 		meals to people 60 years of age or older. This evaluation report describes 		participant characteristics, compares the characteristics of recipients of 		home-delivered meals with those receiving meals in congregate settings, 		assesses how well the program reaches disabled and poor elderly, estimates the 		impact on nutritional intake and social contacts of participants, and examines 		program costs and other sources of funding. Findings suggest that participants 		have higher daily intakes of nutrients and more social contacts per month than 		a comparable group of nonparticipants. The Elderly Nutrition Program succeeds 		in targeting older people who are poor, live alone, are nutritionally "at risk" 		because they are overweight or underweight, or are more functionally disabled 		than their age-group peers. Federal expenditures were found to be highly 		leveraged with State, local, and private funds. </p>
<p><strong>Oregon Consumer Scorecard Project (OCS)</strong></p>
<p>The final report on the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research 		(AHCPR)-supported Oregon Consumer Scorecard Project describes the Oregon 		Consumer Scorecard Consortium's development, pilot testing, and revision of a 		user-friendly guidebook, "A Consumer Guide to Selecting a Health Plan." The 		prototype scorecard was designed to help consumers choose a health plan 		consistent with their individual needs and their health care service delivery 		preferences. The model may also help purchasers and State policymakers develop 		their own comparative reports about health plan performance. </p>
<p><strong>Georgia State Clinic Assessments of Immunization Coverage: Impact of 		Management and Clinic Immunization Practices</strong></p>
<p>Between 1986 and 1994, the State of Georgia implemented a program of 		audits of the immunization practices of all State public health immunization 		clinics in an effort to improve child immunization rates. During this time, the 		immunization rate for preschoolers increased from 31 percent to 90 percent. The 		Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) evaluation of the program 		found that the performance of these audits was significantly associated with 		higher immunization rates for preschool children in the clinic catchment areas. 		This and other report findings formed the basis of CDC recommendations to all 		States. </p>
<p><strong>Ventilator-Dependent Unit Demonstration: Outcome Evaluation and 		Assessment of Post-Acute Care</strong></p>
<p>This Health Care Financing Administration evaluation assessed whether 		specialized units serving chronic ventilator-dependent patients deliver better 		clinical outcomes at a reasonable cost to Medicare than conventional hospital 		settings. Findings included improved patient outcomes for patients treated in 		ventilator-dependent units and lower hospital daily costs, yet higher overall 		costs to Medicare because of greater patient longevity. The analysis of costs 		and outcomes provides important information to policy makers and health care 		providers about a seriously ill population with intensive resource needs. </p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of the Bureau of Health Professions Strategic Directions: 		Development of a Cross-Cutting Performance Monitoring System</strong></p>
<p>This Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) evaluation 		reports on Phase II of a three-phase effort to develop a fully integrated 		computerized data system to facilitate planning and evaluation of the programs 		administered by the Bureau of Health Professions. A performance monitoring 		system is proposed to facilitate ongoing program management. Such a performance 		system is central to the ability of the Bureau of Health Professions to measure 		whether program support is meeting its national health workforce objectives, 		and to signal where program course correction is necessary. </p>
<p><strong>Analysis of the Effect of Regulation on the Quality of Care in Board 		and Care Homes</strong></p>
<p>This evaluation report, sponsored by the Office of the Assistant 		Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), assesses the effects of State 		board and care home regulations on the quality of care provided by those 		institutions. The investigation also attempts to identify the characteristics 		of the board and care environments in the States selected for the study and to 		determine whether licensed and unlicensed homes differed in terms of those 		characteristics, as well as in the quality of care provided. The evaluation 		concludes that extensive State regulation and licensure can improve the quality 		of care provided by board and care homes and can increase the number of these 		facilities that hold licenses. </p>
<p><strong>Health Care in Transition: Technology Assessment in the Private 		Sector</strong></p>
<p>This report sponsored by ASPE briefly describes a number of 		private-sector health organizations that are engaged in technology assessment. 		Technology assessment is one of a family of evaluative activities circulating 		within these health care organizations. Among private-sector organizations 		conducting technology assessment, rigorous evaluation of clinical effectiveness 		based on a systematic review of scientific and clinical evidence has become the 		norm, and technology assessment has increasingly become "full service," 		encompassing drugs, medical devices, and clinical procedures. </p>
<p><strong>Subacute Care: Policy Synthesis and Market Area Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The report of this ASPE study of subacute care presents an overview and 		historical perspective of subacute care, a description of the current state of 		the art and how it varies across selected market areas, and an examination of 		evidence about its cost and effectiveness. Findings suggest that the emerging 		concept of subacute care holds promise but also poses many challenges for the 		public and private sectors. </p>
<p><strong>Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine</strong></p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is one tool available to 		decisionmakers to help determine the relative value of different approaches to 		improving health or life expectancy. For a variety of reasons, however, CEA has 		not been widely used in health policy settings. This Office of Public Health 		and Science report represents a review of the methodological and theoretical 		aspects of CEA, its effectiveness, and its expected outcomes and uses. 		Recommendations are made regarding framing and designing such studies, 		identifying and valuing outcomes, assessing effectiveness, estimating costs, 		discounting, reflecting analytical uncertainty, and reporting analyses. </p>
<p><strong>Chapter III</strong></p>
<p>Chapter III provides an overview of the evaluation activities of the HHS 		agencies, including information on the evaluation program, a summary of 		evaluations completed during FY 1996 and evaluations in progress, and a 		discussion of future directions for agency evaluations. </p>
<p><strong>Administration for Children and Families</strong></p>
<p>ACF administers a broad range of programs to support children and 		families and targeted populations, such as the developmentally disabled and 		Native Americans. The objectives of ACF evaluations are to provide information 		on the program design and operations, to test delivery approaches of various 		services, to conduct policy analyses, and to disseminate and apply evaluation 		results. In FY 1996, evaluations were completed on child support guidelines, 		child access demonstration projects, Head Start family self-sufficiency 		initiatives, home-based services for runaway youth, gang families in public 		housing projects, foster youth mentors, child protective and preventive 		services, family-based placement prevention programs, and a case management 		enhancement project. Major evaluations in progress include the Arkansas 		prenatal and postnatal paternity project, responsible fatherhood initiatives, 		home visitor services for teen parents, community development demonstrations, 		the Head Start program, and foster care placement. Two new National Child 		Welfare Research Centers have also been established. </p>
<p><strong>Administration on Aging</strong></p>
<p>The Administration on Aging (AoA) supports studies that provide 		information on the implementation of the Older Americans Act of 1992. This 		year, AoA completed a major evaluation of the Elderly Nutrition Program, which 		provides an average of one million meals per day to older Americans. Results 		showed that the program has been successful in improving the nutritional 		intakes of elderly people and in decreasing their social isolation. The report 		also provided guidance to help the program change to meet future needs of the 		elderly population and adapt to changes under way in the health care system. 		AoA is now helping many State and area agencies conduct evaluations of programs 		supported by the Older Americans Act. </p>
<p><strong>Agency for Health Care Policy and Research</strong></p>
<p>The goals of the AHCPR evaluation program are to assess agency 		effectiveness in meeting major and long-term priorities; to obtain information 		to respond to critical agency and departmental concerns; and to conduct 		internal evaluations to improve the efficacy of key program areas. Evaluation 		projects completed in FY 1996 included an evaluation of practice guidelines and 		science-based measures of clinical quality; an evaluation of CONQUEST 1.0, a 		data base of clinical performance measures useful for matching measures 		appropriate for different clinical conditions; the Oregon Consumer Scorecard 		Project; and a synthesis of findings from AHCPR's Medical Treatment 		Effectiveness Program (MEDTEP). In progress during FY 1996 were evaluation 		activities to assess the health care environment; evaluations of AHCPR 		publications for research dissemination and training for minority health 		services researchers; and several evaluation design studies, such as an 		assessment of data release strategies for the AHCPR's Medical Expenditure Panel 		Survey. </p>
<p><strong>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</strong></p>
<p>CDC places high priority on evaluations seeking to answer policy, 		program, and strategic planning questions related to the Agency's mission. This 		year's major evaluations include data policy and surveillance studies, such as 		developing a comprehensive monitoring system to track the impact of health care 		reform. Program evaluations completed include CDC's National Nosocomial 		Infections Surveillance Program and the Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Prevention and 		Control Program in San Juan, Puerto Rico. CDC also assisted the State of 		Georgia in a study of immunization auditing procedures and found positive 		results for increasing child immunization rates. CDC's evaluations in progress 		include evaluations of data reporting systems, such as one for public health 		laboratories and CDC's National Electronic Telecommunications System for 		Surveillance. Program evaluations are under way in the areas of occupational 		health hazards, epidemiology training, and prevention centers. Other 		specialized projects are focusing on tuberculosis outreach workers, minors' 		access to tobacco, and violence prevention. </p>
<p><strong>Food and Drug Administration</strong></p>
<p>Evaluation at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is largely a 		line-management responsibility. Projects focus on performance management, 		customer participation, and rigorous rulemaking. In FY 1996, FDA continued to 		identify performance measures jointly with industry customers as part of the 		drug and biologic review processes necessary for implementing the Prescription 		Drug User Fee Act. In addition, FDA completed two evaluation projects on food 		labels. The first reports on the impact of the new food label regulations on 		consumers, and the second assesses the status of processed, packaged food 		labels subsequent to publication of the regulations. During FY 1996 FDA program 		managers were engaged in evaluating their performance measures in light of GPRA 		standards. Other evaluation projects at FDA include assessing FDA's 		penalty-reduction and inquiries assistance program for small businesses, 		influenza virus vaccines, and the national evaluation of x-ray trends. </p>
<p><strong>Health Care Financing Administration</strong></p>
<p>The Office of Research and Demonstrations performs and supports Health 		Care Financing Administration (HCFA) evaluations to develop new health care 		financing policies and to provide information on the impact of HCFA's programs. 		In FY 1996, HCFA completed evaluations of ventilator-dependent hospital unit 		care, Medicaid drug rebate policies, the Arizona health care cost-containment 		system, telemedicine, home health prospective payments, physician payment 		reform, and pharmacy benefit managers. HCFA has over 34 projects in progress, 		with 24 scheduled to be completed in FY 1997. These projects are monitoring the 		Medicare and Medicaid programs through demonstrations. Some of the 		demonstrations involve the Medicaid managed care programs or waivers, Medicare 		case management demonstrations, ambulatory patient groups, Medicaid uninsured 		demonstrations, rural health clinics, community-supported living arrangements, 		Medicare Alzheimer's disease demonstration, long-term care for persons with 		developmental disabilities, and health plan report cards. </p>
<p><strong>Health Resources and Services Administration</strong></p>
<p>The objectives of the Health Resources and Services Administration 		(HRSA) evaluation program are to improve program management and policy 		development and to provide information for strategic planning, budget 		decisions, and legislation. During FY 1996, HRSA continued to enhance its 		performance measurement capacity for all line programs, with a notable study 		completed at the Bureau of Health Professions. Special evaluation projects were 		performed on quality assurance procedures for Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS 		Recovery Emergency (CARE) Act grantees; managed care and the Federally 		Qualified Health Centers; the impact of case management in community health 		centers; emergency medical services for children; international medical 		graduates; advanced practice nursing education; and primary care residency 		programs. Ongoing evaluations in FY 1996 include managed care and community and 		migrant health centers; health maintenance organization, or HMO, staffing 		strategies in underserved areas; casemix differences in health centers; 		assessment of multilingual services offered at community and migrant health 		centers; the Healthy Start Program to reduce infant mortality; Ryan White CARE 		Act programs; organ transplantation; telemedicine; and the supply of nurses. 		</p>
<p><strong>Indian Health Service</strong></p>
<p>The Indian Health Service (IHS) evaluation program serves the agency's 		program and policy objectives, developed in consultation with the tribal 		communities. IHS's major evaluations completed in FY 1996 concentrated on 		developing a methodology for adjusting IHS mortality data for inconsistent 		classifications; the IHS adolescent regional treatment centers; and the second 		phase of an evaluation of alcohol and substance abuse services for American 		Indian and Alaska Native women. Projects in progress are focusing on the impact 		of a promotional initiative on elderly wellness and use of comprehensive 		services; a study of prior trauma care of intoxicated patients as a predictor 		of subsequently fatal injury; an assessment of Resource Requirements 		Methodology as an IHS management tool; the development of an IHS health 		services research agenda; and the continuing evaluation of alcohol and 		substance abuse treatment services for women. </p>
<p><strong>National Institutes of Health</strong></p>
<p>Evaluation is an integral part of the role of the National Institutes of 		Health (NIH) in supporting biomedical research, training, and public education. 		In FY 1996, NIH's evaluations focused on the NIH shared instrumentation grant 		programs, clinical research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive 		and Kidney Diseases, an evaluation of the Navajo alcohol rehabilitation 		demonstration, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse's study on the 		development of medications for the treatment of opiate and cocaine addictions. 		The major evaluations in progress during FY 1996 were an evaluation of the 		career status and satisfaction of NIH grant applicants with grant application 		processes and procedures; comprehensive school health programs in grades K-12; 		an evaluation of laboratory animal use; and the development of a data base for 		NIH-supported research in rare diseases. </p>
<p><strong>Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>The Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) functions as 		principal advisor to the secretary on policy development, conducting 		evaluations and policy research studies. It is also responsible for HHS-wide 		coordination of legislative, planning, and evaluation activities. During FY 		1996, ASPE's evaluations looked at health care technology assessment, 		information to guide physician practice, assumptions underlying insurance 		participation modeling, board and care homes, subacute care, integrating acute 		and long-term care for children with disabilities, interdisciplinary 		professional training on disabilities, substance abuse treatment for parents 		and welfare recipients, community response to domestic violence, minority male 		violence prevention, and American Indian demography. The major evaluations in 		progress include monitoring changes in health and human services, assessing 		data needs, managed care and people with disabilities, assisted living, family 		preservation services, moving welfare recipients to work, promoting involvement 		of fathers in family life, and trend data on the well-being of children. </p>
<p><strong>Office of Public Health and Science</strong></p>
<p>The Office of Public Health and Science (OPHS) provides advice, policy 		and program coordination, and leadership in the implementation, management, and 		development of HHS public health and science activities. Several major 		OPHS-supported evaluations were completed in FY 1996 on the cost-effectiveness 		methodology; quantification of State public health expenditures; health needs 		of recently arriving refugees; and scientific misconduct and the consequences 		of being accused. Evaluations and policy studies in progress include dietary 		supplement labels; framework for Healthy People 2010, school health programs, 		public health infrastructure, and public health performance measures. </p>
<p><strong>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</strong></p>
<p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) 		is committed to evaluating its programs and grant projects to assess the 		effectiveness of prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation approaches and 		system of care. In FY 1996, SAMHSA completed two evaluation projects. The first 		was an overview of addiction treatment effectiveness; the second was a study of 		the employment outcomes of indigent clients receiving alcohol and drug 		treatment in Washington State. Ongoing evaluations include evaluations of 		SAMHSA's demonstration programs, such as the Job Corps program of enriched 		substance abuse treatment for adolescents; the services integration experiment 		for chronically mentally ill homeless persons; and the National Treatment 		Improvement Evaluation Study. Evaluations are also under way to examine the 		impact of managed care on the access, cost, and quality of substance abuse 		treatment. </p>
<p><strong>Appendices</strong></p>
<p>A complete inventory of the 81 HHS evaluations completed in FY 1996 is 		provided in appendix A, and HHS agency projects currently in progress are 		listed in appendix B. Appendix C describes the Senior Editorial Advisor's 		review criteria for assessing program evaluations. A glossary of acronyms used 		throughout this report is presented in appendix D. </p>
