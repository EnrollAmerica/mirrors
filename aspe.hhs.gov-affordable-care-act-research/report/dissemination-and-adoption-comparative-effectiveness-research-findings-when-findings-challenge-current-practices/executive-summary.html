    <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">Insufficient evidence regarding the effectiveness of  medical treatments has been identified as a key source of inefficiency in the  U.S. healthcare system. Clinicians vary widely in their recommendation and use  of diagnostic tests and treatments for patients with similar symptoms or  conditions. This variation has been attributed to clinical uncertainty, since  the published scientific evidence base does not provide adequate information to  determine which treatments are most effective for patients with specific  clinical needs. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A dramatic federal investment in comparative effectiveness  research (CER) was made possible through the American Recovery and Reinvestment  Act of 2009 (ARRA), with the expectation that the results will not only influence  clinical practice but will also improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery. To  do this, CER must provide information that supports fundamental changes in healthcare  delivery and informs the choice of diagnostic and treatment strategies. Many new  tests and treatments commonly adopted today are not completely grounded in  scientific evidence. Some remain entrenched even when unambiguous scientific  evidence about superior alternative approaches emerges. Other new clinical  practices are not quickly adopted, either because information about them does  not reach decisionmakers in a usable format or because of other barriers to  their adoption. </p>
<p><strong>Study Objectives</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">The project described in this report had three main objectives:  (1) to develop a framework to help organize the array of barriers and enablers  that influence the translation of CER evidence into new clinical practices; (2)  to conduct case studies on the adoption of new clinical practices; and (3) to  identify policy options that might facilitate dissemination of CER-based  clinical practices. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We designed our organizational framework to isolate key  factors affecting each phase of the process of CER translation, beginning with  the generation of evidence and ending with the adoption of new clinical practices.  The framework was also intended to inform CER development and dissemination  activities, as well as future research on translation of CER into practice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We conducted case studies on the adoption of new clinical  practices following the release of five carefully selected CER studies  published in the past 15 years, applying our framework to identify key themes  relating to the pace of adoption of new practices. We sought information  through discussions with stakeholders representing a broad range of  perspectives and by examining the peer-reviewed literature associated with each  case study. Synthesizing common themes across case studies provided insight  into the root causes for the failure of CER to change clinical practice in a  timely manner.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We developed a set of policy options through consultation  with an expert panel and with partners at the Office of the Assistant Secretary  for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) that might facilitate dissemination of CER-based clinical  practices and thus maximize the effectiveness of the federal government’s  current investment in CER. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The methodology we developed might also be used to inform larger-scale,  prospective, in-depth qualitative and quantitative research on the impact of  the federal investment in CER.</p>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
<p><strong>Framework for CER Translation into Practice</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">Our conceptual framework posits that the process of CER translation  follows five key phases, shown in Figure S.1. While Figure S.1 suggests a generally  linear temporal process, the phases are actually somewhat concurrent, and there  appear to be multiple interactions between stakeholders at different phases. The  phases are described in Table S.1. </p>
<p><strong>Case-Study Research Approach</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">In selecting case studies, our preliminary intent was to  identify and include CER trials that produced results that challenged current  clinical practices. We used an environmental scan to develop a preliminary list  of case-study topics, which we narrowed to five, based on a number of  considerations. We wanted the topics to involve a high burden of illness, high  prevalence, high-quality studies, diversity of treatment modalities, and  diversity of treatment settings. The case-study topics chosen are shown in  Table S.2.</p>

</tr></table><p class="MsoNormal">After selecting the case-study topics, we examined the  peer-reviewed literature to obtain information on the extent to which the CER  evidence led to practice change, the key stakeholders engaged in translation,  and the specific dissemination activities involved. We developed a preliminary  list of potential discussants for each topic and extended invitations to a set  of discussants who, taken together, could provide perspective on all phases of  the CER translation process. We developed a core discussion guide that would  enable us to address key topics in a consistent manner across case studies and  conducted 53 discussions with individuals or groups, including researchers  involved with the CER studies, practicing physicians, leaders of professional  societies, representatives of funding agencies, patient advocates, decision  support developers, directors of quality improvement organizations, senior  executives of health plans, Medicaid directors, journal editors, and leaders of  integrated health systems.</p>
<p><strong>CATIE Case-Study  Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funded the  $42.6 million CATIE study in 1999 to compare the effectiveness of a first-generation  antipsychotic (perphenazine) to three second-generation medications: olanzapine,  quetiapine, and risperidone. CATIE was considered a landmark trial because of  its size, duration, and public sponsorship. Furthermore, it was designed to be  generalizable to real-world clinical settings by using limited exclusion  criteria, enrolling patients from diverse settings, and permitting flexible  dosing protocols. Prior to CATIE, the optimal choice of drug treatments for  patients with schizophrenia was disputed for at least four reasons: (1)  uncertainties surrounding effectiveness in controlling psychotic symptoms; (2) uncertainty  about the relative incidence of side effects, including tardive dyskinesia and  metabolic side effects; (3) some evidence that second-generation antipsychotics  improve cognition; and (4) the costliness of second-generation antipsychotics. These  concerns prompted many to call for a rigorous assessment of the overall value  of the second-generation antipsychotics.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">The initial results from CATIE were released in 2005, and they  surprised many. The trial found that perphenazine was as effective as  olanzapine in terms of time to discontinuation of medication for any cause, the  trial’s primary outcome. Patients randomized to olanzapine also had the longest  time to discontinuation of any group because of lack of efficacy, the largest  weight gain, and significant increases in other variables associated with the  metabolic syndrome. The CATIE investigators concluded that perphenazine could  not be rejected as an inferior treatment.<i> </i></p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">The CATIE case study highlighted the role of pharmaceutical  manufacturers in shaping and reinforcing beliefs about the relative superiority  of second-generation antipsychotics, both directly (through marketing and  detailing) and indirectly (through key thought leaders) well in advance of the conduct  of a CER study. By the time the CATIE results were released, these efforts had cemented  beliefs about the various classes of antipsychotics. Practice patterns do not  appear to have changed in the five years following the publication of the  trial’s results. Professional societies did not strongly advocate for practice  changes based on the results. Guidelines eventually changed but had limited  impact. Performance measures were not updated to reflect the trial’s findings  and may have continued to reinforce existing prescribing patterns. Professional  societies and advocacy organizations challenged the results of the trial in an  effort to protect provider autonomy and preserve access to medications,  respectively. Public payers were initially unwilling to enact policies that  might limit the treatment options of patients with schizophrenia, given the  relative lack of access to care for this population and the potential backlash  from advocacy organizations. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A number of strategies might be used in CER trials that share  some of the characteristics of CATIE to promote the uptake of results into  practice. With regard to CER generation, methodological choices (in CATIE, the  exclusion of patients with tardive dyskinesia from the perphenazine group) may  limit the perceived generalizability of the findings and cause physicians to  distrust the results. In the CATIE case, providers had strong prior negative  experiences involving adverse outcomes such as tardive dyskinesia. Failure to  design the trial to address one of the main beliefs driving use of a  treatment—e.g., that second-generation medications were safer with respect to  the incidence of tardive dyskinesia—meant that an issue important to  prescribing providers might be perceived as being inadequately addressed by the  study. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Interpretation and formalization faced formidable but  predictable difficulties given the strength of established beliefs about the superior  efficacy and safety of second-generation antipsychotics. Indeed, it proved  quite difficult to change the deeply ingrained belief system founded on  industry-funded studies. Interestingly, critiques of the study methodology that  did not address harms may not have significantly influenced prescribing  practices. Likewise, it should be borne in mind that professional societies can  be expected to generate guidelines reflecting their professional interests if  the study results leave room for such interpretations by failing to produce a  “clear winner.” Timely updates to quality measures that reflect the new CER  evidence may prove critical to motivating early changes in practice. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dissemination and implementation strategies should be  vigorous and multipronged. In the case of CATIE, academic detailing within  closed systems eventually proved effective in some cases, but early efforts  were constrained by doubts about the value of the findings, and even a clinical  decision support prompt faced initial resistance. A key element to success was presenting  physicians with their actual practice data, which often showed how far they  diverged from the ideal. Finally, future adverse-event surveillance systems (or  registries) may help to resolve lingering questions about the relative side-effect  risks of alternative antipsychotics, such as tardive dyskinesia, relative to  cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p><strong>COURAGE Case-Study Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">The COURAGE trial compared the risk of cardiovascular  events among patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) assigned to a  treatment strategy of intensive pharmacologic therapy and lifestyle intervention  (optimal medical therapy) alone and patients who were assigned treatment with percutaneous  coronary intervention (PCI) followed by optimal medical therapy. No study  before COURAGE had included the intensity of medical therapy attempted in the  trial, which included the use of aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, statins, and clopidogrel, as  well as diet, exercise, and smoking-cessation counseling. Medication doses were  repeatedly intensified in pursuit of aggressive blood-pressure and  LDL-cholesterol targets. The fundamental question addressed by COURAGE was  whether the use of PCI to reverse narrowing of the coronary arteries in  conjunction with optimal medical therapy would provide patients with stable CAD  a greater reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and death than  medical therapy alone. While PCI has been shown to provide substantial benefit  for patients being treated for emergency conditions, the benefit of the  procedure in the stable CAD population had not been conclusively demonstrated. In  the years preceding COURAGE, most clinical trials that assessed these end points  were small and underpowered. </p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">The COURAGE trial found that as an initial management  strategy in patients with stable CAD, PCI did not reduce the risk of death, MI,  or other major cardiovascular events when added to optimal medical therapy. The  findings reinforced existing practice guidelines, which stated that PCI can be  safely deferred in patients with stable CAD, even in those with extensive,  multivessel involvement and inducible ischemia, provided intensive,  multifaceted medical therapy is instituted and maintained. </p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">Both our discussions and a high-quality empirical analysis  indicate that the COURAGE trial did not have an impact on clinical practice. The  trial may have had an important indirect effect on practice by encouraging the  integration of appropriateness criteria for coronary revascularization into decision  support tools and into data collection for registries. How much these efforts  will facilitate practice change remains unclear. Efforts to use appropriateness  criteria in quality improvement are nascent, and while they have yet to be used  in an accountability or payment context, there is increasing interest in them among  policymakers. These initiatives will be most effective once reimbursement  systems create demand for them. Changes in the organization of cardiology  practices, driven in part by the movement toward  accountable-care-organization (ACO) payment models, may be the single most  important determinant of the future adoption of findings from COURAGE and other  CER evidence. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Several strategies may improve uptake for CER trials that  share some of the characteristics of COURAGE. In the generation phase, research  should focus on a decision point sufficiently upstream to meaningfully impact  decisionmaking. A critical driver of the use of PCI is the initial decision to  refer a patient to an interventionist, since this tends to create an  expectation that angiography and PCI will follow. The COURAGE trial did not  address the initial referral decision directly. Rather, it addressed a decision  point later in the pathway to PCI—after patients have undergone angiography—at which  the utility of decision support and patient decisionmaking aids may be  suboptimal. Current and proposed trials are focusing on decisions that occur  prior to angiography, and these may have a greater impact on clinical practice.  Other design problems to avoid include the potential for significant patient  crossover or excessive time to complete the study. However, discussions with  stakeholders suggest that criticisms of the trial design probably had only a  minor influence on practice patterns post-COURAGE. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Interpretation and formalization can languish if study  findings confirm current guidelines, even if they contradict current practice. Prior  to COURAGE, practice guidelines were based on very weak evidence, promoting  physicians’ inclination to disregard them, but since the COURAGE results  reinforced the guidelines, there was less impetus to revise them. A CER result  that necessitates a change in guidelines may have more impact. Similarly, unless  payers and other stakeholders have the ability to collect relevant appropriateness  data, they will have no incentive to develop reimbursement policies based on  guidelines or appropriateness criteria.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dissemination and implementation may be either advanced or  retarded by several factors, but in this case, psychological aspects appear  vital. For example, while registries may have influenced practice (by  incorporating performance measures and appropriateness criteria into their  design), their influence to date on appropriate use of elective PCI appears  modest. Similarly, payer limits on upstream diagnostic procedures may have  somewhat dampened demand for PCI, as might accountable-care reimbursement  schemes in the future. Psychological factors, including concerns about harm and  physician response to popular media coverage regarding PCI overuse, may have  more significantly modulated the tendency to intervene aggressively. However,  strong financial and psychological factors still incline both providers and  patients to favor PCI. As one discussant put it, even without financial incentives,  “inter-ventionalists love to intervene.” By all accounts, both clinicians and  patients may underestimate the effectiveness of optimal medical therapy, and  patients may not be informed of, fully understand, or seek out available  information on the benefits and risks of PCI. Patient decision aids may play a  key role in helping to address this information gap. However, to be maximally  effective, such decision aids will have to be implemented in settings where  financial incentives do not promote PCI and before patients have progressed to  the point where intervention becomes inevitable. </p>
<p><strong>SPORT Case-Study Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">The principal clinical question motivating SPORT was  whether surgical treatment options were superior to nonsurgical treatment for  patients with low back pain related to lumbar spinal disorders (disc  herniation, spinal stenosis, and degenerative spondylolisthesis). Our case  study focused only on the subpopulation with spinal stenosis. Prior to SPORT,  the Maine Lumbar Spine Study, a prospective cohort study enrolling 148  patients, was the largest study comparing the effectiveness of alternative  treatments for spinal stenosis, and it found that surgical patients had better  outcomes than patients receiving nonsurgical treatments. A 2005 Cochrane review  summarizing the evidence prior to 2000 suggested that the relative efficacy of  surgery was not established, because existing trials were small and enrolled  patients both with and without degenerative spondylolisthesis. A large,  randomized CER trial was considered necessary to provide stronger evidence on  the effectiveness of surgical treatment for spinal stenosis among patients who did  not have degenerative spondylolisthesis. </p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">SPORT’s intention-to-treat analysis showed that surgery was  more effective than non-operative treatment on the SF-36 bodily pain scale and  on patients’ self-reported ratings of symptom improvement but on few other  primary or secondary outcomes. However, patients with spinal stenosis had very  high rates of crossover after randomization (as was the case for the  subpopulations with disc herniation and degenerative spondylolisthesis). Only  67 percent of patients randomized to the surgical arm underwent surgery, while  43 percent of the patients randomized to nonsurgical treatment underwent  surgery within two years of the baseline assessment. For this reason, the data  from the randomized cohort were combined with data from an independent and  concurrent cohort study and analyzed as a single observational study comparing  patients who underwent surgery with those who did not (an “as-treated” analysis).  The observational analysis found that surgery was superior to nonsurgical  treatment across all primary and secondary outcomes, and the advantage was  sustained over two years of follow-up. </p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">SPORT appears to have had little impact on clinical  practice, and the seeds of its low impact appear to have been sown primarily in  the generation phase. The study design, which was unblinded, also allowed for  very large patient crossover. As a result, what was intended to be a randomized  controlled trial (RCT) with an “intention-to-treat” analysis had to also be treated  as an observational cohort study using an as-treated analysis. Analogous  studies have avoided these difficulties, suggesting that they are not inherent in  this type of CER but can be forestalled by careful study design and execution. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the interpretation phase, the RCT results suggesting limited  benefits from surgery were discounted because of high rates of patient  crossover. In contrast, the observational cohort study, at least within the  spinal surgery community, confirmed the relative advantage of surgery, which  was already the prevailing method of treatment. Interpretation was further  complicated by the study’s lack of detail on subgroups, which made it hard to determine  whom surgery would benefit most, as well as the (possibly erroneous) perception  that the surgical techniques used in the study were already outdated. While presenting  competing analyses may have opened the results to conflicting interpretation,  the observational results alone produced different interpretations regarding  the magnitude of the benefit provided by surgery.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The SPORT case study also highlights the challenges in  weighing the relative strengths and weaknesses of RCTs and observational cohort  studies and the selective use of evidence during the formalization phase. Multiple  specialty societies, possibly influenced by various levels of industry  sponsorship, issued competing and conflicting guidelines, while relevant data  from European studies were generally discounted or ignored. Registries might  help to bolster guidelines or generate appropriateness criteria, but since effectiveness  outcomes from spinal surgery are often subjective, registries may be best  suited to report on harms. Registry penetration appears quite low in orthopedic  surgery, and financial incentives are not aligned to promote participation by  surgeons.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While dissemination of the SPORT results appeared to be  far-reaching, messaging about them emphasized the benefits of surgery rather  than the significant clinical improvement among patients in the nonsurgical  group and the relatively small difference in clinical benefit between the groups.  Referring providers appear to be the optimal point for dissemination of the  results, since referral to a surgeon is usually followed by surgery. Intense  marketing of spinal hardware by the device industry may override the results of  clinical trials, and, as SPORT illustrates, messages may be vague and  selective, omitting key evidence provided by trials. Similarly, payers and  purchasers, faced with both the “positive” results from the observational  cohort analysis and the “equivalence” results from the intention-to-treat  analysis, appear to have accepted the primacy of the observational cohort  analyses and did not enact policies restricting the use of decompression  surgery. However, there are now some early examples of more nuanced and data-driven  reimbursement policies focusing on related procedures (e.g., fusion surgery).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nevertheless, at the implementation phase, strong financial  incentives favor surgical over nonsurgical treatment. The alignment of  financial incentives among physicians, hospitals, and device manufacturers  appears to have increased the use of complex procedures despite uncertainty  about their effectiveness and considerable evidence of greater risks.  Countering this trend are radiology benefits managers (RBMs), which may reduce  inappropriate upstream diagnostic procedures, and a potential future role for  patient decision aids. While the SPORT results can be viewed as both flawed and  confirmatory of current practice, the trial was successful in providing quality  data on the relative risks and benefits of surgery, and these data have been  integrated into patient decision aids. Those tools might ultimately change  clinical practice by more fully incorporating patient preferences into  decisions about surgery. Currently, few incentives encourage the use of such  shared decisionmaking or a more rigorous informed-consent process. The use of  these techniques early in the pathway leading to surgery will be critical to  their overall effectiveness. Incentives to promote the spread of patient  decision aids and efforts to improve the appropriate use of diagnostic imaging  represent the most important strategies for changing clinical practice in the  future. </p>
<p><strong>COMPANION Case-Study Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) can improve the  health status of patients with heart failure (HF) by electrically stimulating  the heart to improve synchronization of pumping. Most HF patients appear to be  at high risk for potentially fatal derangements in the heart’s electrical  activity. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) protect against sudden  death from ab-normal rhythms but do not reduce HF symptoms. The principal question  addressed by the COMPANION trial was whether adding CRT alone or combined with ICD  treatment (CRT versus CRT-D) to the medical management of HF patients with  conduction abnormalities not only improved functional measures but also reduced  hospitalizations and all-cause mortality <a href="executive-summary.html#_ENREF_16" title="Bristow, 2004 #1">(Bristow et al., 200</a>4). Previous studies did  not have sufficient power to detect a survival advantage from combined therapy.  </p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">The COMPANION trial showed that patients assigned to the  CRT group and the CRT-D group both had a statistically significant improvement  of 17 percent over medical therapy alone in the combined end point of death and  hospitalization from any cause. While adding an ICD to CRT did not appear to  benefit patients more than CRT alone, it did show a trend toward reducing <br />  12-month all-cause mortality (12 percent versus 15 percent). The results of  this study imply a clear survival and quality-of-life benefit from adding CRT  (with or without CRT-D) to optimal medical therapy for patients who suffer from  HF with delayed ventricular conduction. This contrasted with the current  practice at the time, which was to use CRT for HF patients but withhold ICD  devices given both safety concerns and a lack of proven benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">Uptake of the CER results following publication of the  COMPANION study has been uneven. Recent estimates indicate that there is both  significant underuse of CRT among potentially eligible HF patients and also  fairly frequent CRT-D use in patients who lack an indication for it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In contrast to the other CER case studies, COMPANION  generated relatively few controversies in the generation and interpretation  phases. The results were fairly readily accepted, the main disputes being over  the degree to which they could be generalized to HF patients who did not meet  the original inclusion criteria. Formalization of the COMPANION results was  relatively rapid: specialty-society guidelines were updated promptly, which  promoted their uptake, at least among proceduralists and HF-management  specialists. No primary-care specialty-society guidelines were issued. In  addition, the specialty-society guidelines left open the appropriateness of  CRT-D. This and other factors would in turn contribute to an ineffective  dissemination phase.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This case study illustrates the critical role dissemination  plays in translating CER research into practice. Essentially all dissemination  activities focused on interventional cardiologists and HF specialists rather  than referring physicians. Specialty societies, industry, and other continuing-medical-education  (CME) producers all directed their educational efforts toward those groups. Most  primary-care providers (who manage many HF patients) remain unaware of the  COMPANION results. In addition, those primary-care providers and general  cardiologists who took an interest in the study findings were confronted with conflicting  and ambiguous guidelines. This generated considerable confusion and a reported  reluctance to refer patients for CRT. Future similar CER dissemination should  focus significant effort on providers further upstream in the decision pathway  and on delivering clear, unambiguous referral criteria. However, the COMPANION  case is not only a cautionary tale. HF registries have had a significant  positive impact through publication of high-profile studies illustrating  inappropriate ICD use. Similarly, recent limited experience with clinical decision  support tools shows that they can be very effective in prompting appropriate  referrals and discouraging inappropriate procedures, but such tools for CRT or  CRT-D appear to be rare.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the implementation phase, imprecise guidelines and  evidence-neutral reimbursement policy may contribute to the use of CRT-D for  inappropriate indications. Reimbursement policies, particularly those of Medicare,  significantly favor CRT-D implantation over CRT alone, despite evidence that  adding the ICD has a very high marginal cost relative to the benefits it  confers. As with other studies, referral to an interventionist is also  tantamount to ordering the procedure. This tendency is compounded by open  guidelines that allow the CER results to be cited as justifying use in patients  who would not meet study inclusion criteria. While primary-care physicians and  some general cardiologists fail to refer many potentially eligible patients,  dedicated HF clinics have been much more successful in achieving appropriate  referrals, as well as avoiding inappropriate ones. Such clinics may serve as a  model for implementing analogous CER results. Currently, patients are not  generally equipped to participate as fully informed partners in the clinical  decision, and decision aids are not readily available, but it is likely that  such decision aids could significantly improve appropriate use of CRT if  physicians were given stronger incentives to use them.</p>
<p><strong>CPOE Case-Study Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">During the 1990s, experts debated the optimal approach to reducing  medication errors. Some were not persuaded that traditional paper-based  ordering systems were a significant problem or that computer-based ordering  systems alone (e.g., for medications and lab tests) would be more effective in reducing  the rate of medication errors than nurse-focused, pharmacist-focused, or  team-based interventions. The principal CER question leading up to Bates’s 1998  study was whether computerized physician order entry (CPOE) could reduce  medication errors and medication-related adverse events among hospitalized  patients more effectively than other interventions. To address this question,  Bates and colleagues compared the effectiveness of CPOE alone with CPOE plus a  team intervention for reducing the number of unintercepted serious medication  errors. The study, conducted within six units at Brigham and Women’s Hospital  (Boston, Mass.), used a pre/post design, where the rates of medication errors  prior to CPOE adoption were compared with the rates during the ten months  following CPOE adoption. The CPOE system allowed physicians to select from a  menu of medications defined by the hospital formulary, with default dose and  dose ranges provided for each medication, as well as automatic checking for  common drug allergies and drug-drug interactions. The team intervention  centered on pharmacy-specific process changes, including changing the role of  the pharmacist, standardizing labeling of intravenous bags, and implementing a  pharmacy communication log so that the nursing staff could better communicate  with pharmacy staff.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">The analysis indicated that the team intervention had no  incremental benefit over the implementation of CPOE alone, so the intervention  arms were pooled. Between pre and post periods in the same hospital units, unintercepted  serious medication errors (the study’s primary end point) decreased by 55  percent. Unintercepted potential adverse drug events (ADEs)—a secondary end point—declined  by 84 percent. The authors of the study concluded that, on the basis of these  results, other hospitals should consider CPOE adoption as the principal  intervention to reduce unintercepted serious medication errors.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">In contrast to the adoption of a new medication or device that  does not require significant changes to the work of clinicians and staff but  instead funnels through the existing workflow, the adoption of quality  improvement strategies faces serious barriers because they may require  significant changes to organization, financing, and staff work. These barriers  may neutralize the impact of even outstanding CER evidence. While we selected  CPOE as an example of a delivery-system intervention for which there is  published CER evidence, it is worth noting that although CPOE has features that  are typical of many such interventions, it also has distinct features that may  be easier to implement. The CPOE case study suggests a number of lessons about  translating delivery-system-related CER into new practices. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First, CPOE is both a new technology and a new set of workflow  requirements. These features of the intervention are complex and require  substantial up-front investment, as well as coordination, communication, and  long-run commitments from numerous stakeholders with potentially conflicting  goals. The staff involved in implementation of CPOE must make nontrivial  changes in workflow; like other technology-based delivery-system interventions,  CPOE requires dramatic changes in individual process and social interactions  with peers. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Second, CPOE is a variable technology with evolving features  and functionalities. It has numerous meanings across a wide range of hospitals  and different vendors, depending on their needs and existing health information  technology (HIT) capabilities. This poses challenges for end users (particularly  hospital executives) who wish to use CER evidence for decisionmaking. Our case  study suggests that these individuals often struggle to conceptualize the  intervention and consequently may find it difficult to assess the applicability  of the results to their own settings. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Third, the financial investment in CPOE is substantial, and  key leaders must have clear reasons and plans for implementation to overcome  resistance from staff. Successful CPOE implementation appears to require  financial incentives to improve the business case, and the experience of early  adopters suggests that organizational factors and missions can be significant  enablers even when financial incentives are not aligned. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fourth, the target stakeholders for CER results concerning CPOE  are more diverse than the typical users of other types of CER studies. They  include hospital executives and technology vendors, in addition to physicians,  pharmacists, and other clinical staff. This may increase the complexity of  messaging to achieve effective and consistent dissemination of the CER results.  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Despite the unique features of CPOE, similar delivery-system  interventions based on CER evidence (particularly those that improve patient  safety) may also benefit from some combination of strong mandates, systematic  standards, and financial incentives that improve the business case for  implementation. </p>
<p><strong>Root Causes of CER Failure to Rapidly Change  Clinical Practice</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">A myriad of factors influence whether CER is successfully translated  into clinical practice. However, our synthesis suggests that some of these  factors are “root causes” in the sense that they are fundamental and may  represent high-leverage points for action to improve adoption of a new  practice. We identified five root causes of failure when CER is slow to change  clinical practice. These root causes manifest themselves in somewhat different  ways across the case studies, appear to explain the strategies of the many  stakeholders with an interest in CER, and typically exert their effects over  multiple phases of the CER translation process. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b> </b></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0"><b>1.<i> Financial incentives are primary drivers of  adoption of new clinical practices whether or not the practices are supported  by CER evidence. CER results that threaten the financial interests of a stakeholder  will be challenged at all phases of the CER translation process. </i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The most fundamental determinant of successful CER  translation is the extent to which the economics of adopting a new clinical  practice are favorable to providers and patients. Our case studies on the  comparative effectiveness of interventional and noninterventional procedures  highlight the perverse consequences of fee-for-service reimbursement as a  driver of the use of procedures that CER evidence shows have little or no  marginal benefit. Once patients are referred to interventional specialists,  even if only for consultation, there is a high likelihood that they will receive  an invasive procedure. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our case studies highlight the role of financial incentives  in influencing more than only the implementation phase of the CER translation  process. In particular, financial incentives may supersede CER evidence in  influencing the adoption of new clinical practices in the following ways:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoListBulletCxSpFirst">·         Stakeholders with a financial interest in the outcome of a CER  study may seek to influence its design in order to increase the odds that its  results will favor them, or they may initiate efforts to critique and thus  undermine potentially unfavorable CER studies at the time the studies are enrolling  participants. Critiques of a CER study design by interested stakeholders may  peak when the results are released to maximize the likelihood that the study will  be viewed as methodologically weak. </p>
<p class="MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle">·         The interpretation of CER results through a dynamic scientific  debate among stakeholders appears to be influenced by financial incentives of  the participants. </p>
<p class="MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle">·         The formalization of guidelines and measures based on CER  evidence may be influenced in subtle ways by financing, and professionals have  few financial incentives to facilitate the development of performance measures  unless they will be paid based on the measure results. If guidelines do not  evolve with the CER evidence, other formalization activities such as the  modification of quality measures will be delayed or simply fail to occur. </p>
<p class="MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle">·         The dissemination of new practices is expensive, and the lack of  financing for dissemination activities to support CER-based practices may be an  important impediment to change. Aggressive dissemination activities directed  toward payers may cause them to focus narrowly on areas where practice  variation is extensive, where evidence clearly does not support a practice, and  where risks to patients are unambiguous. </p>
<p class="MsoListBulletCxSpLast">·         Physicians working within a larger organizational context may be  more likely to use performance measurement and feedback, patient decision aids,  clinical decision support tools, and registries, all of which have the  potential to increase responsiveness to CER. </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-left:.75in"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Despite the seemingly powerful influence of financial  incentives favoring both the status quo and an accelerating panoply of new  procedures, recent trends, including the emergence of innovative payment models  and new types of physician organizations, provide some basis for optimism that  CER evidence can be more influential in the future. In addition, activities  that curtail the influence of financial interests in each of the phases of CER  translation (such as the recent Institute of Medicine [IOM] report calling for  greater transparency and integrity in the guideline development process) may  reduce the countervailing forces that work to undermine or neutralize even the  best CER evidence. Payers are also actively engaged in horizon-scanning for CER  evidence that may form the basis of policies before practices become widespread  in the community. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="LeftFlush0"><b>2.<i> Even the best CER studies may fail to produce an  unambiguous “winner,” so it may be difficult to achieve a consensus  interpretation of the results. </i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">CER studies that produce clear “winners” (i.e., showing  unambiguously that one treatment is better than another or that two treatments  have essentially equivalent effectiveness) should be more likely to change  practice because they are difficult to challenge. However, our case studies  suggest that even among the best-designed and -conducted CER studies,  unambiguous outcomes are likely to be rare. Many factors increase the risk of  an ambiguous result from a CER study, including design factors (e.g., use of  active comparison groups rather than placebos), differential weighting of end points  by stakeholders, and differences in provider equipoise for recommending  treatments. Persuading stakeholders about treatment equivalence may be much  more difficult than persuading them of treatment superiority. CER studies that  produce ambiguous results open the door to selective interpretation, may  undermine consensus interpretation of the results, and may fail to promote  guideline updates by professional societies or the formation of coverage  policies by payers. In cases where one treatment is found to be unambiguously  harmful (e.g., the Women’s Health Initiative), clinical practice has been known  to change rapidly, and our findings confirm to some extent that general rule,  based on anecdotal reports suggesting decreased use of olanzapine in the  post-CATIE period. Adverse-event data from registries may help to identify more  unambiguous “losers” over time. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While ambiguity may lead to incomplete use of CER results  and may limit the potentially attainable change in clinical practice, the lack  of “winners” does not invariably mean that the CER fails to have an impact on  clinical practice. Many discussants indicated that the goal of CER is not identifying  “winners,” but generating information to help physicians and patients arrive at  satisfactory treatment decisions. Several of our case studies might have reassured  physicians and patients that moderate-dose conventional antipsychotics or less-aggressive  ther-apies can have benefit comparable to that of more-aggressive therapies. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="LeftFlush0"><b>3.<i> Cognitive biases play an important role in  stakeholder interpretation of CER evidence and may be a formidable barrier to clinical-practice  change. </i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At least three cognitive biases may influence the way in which  physicians and other stakeholders interpret new CER evidence. First,  confirmation bias, the tendency for a stakeholder to embrace evidence that  confirms preconceived notions of treatment effectiveness and reject evidence to  the contrary (while typically criticizing the studies on methodological  grounds), may reinforce established practice patterns. Stronger study designs  (emphasizing particularly the generalizability of findings) and careful  monitoring of study conduct (particularly to prevent crossover for randomized  study designs) may preempt these critiques and counteract the influence of  confirmation bias. A second bias is the belief that intervening aggressively is  better than inaction, even when the marginal benefit is small. This bias may be  reinforced by perverse financial incentives and by providers’ perceived risk of  malpractice liability if they fail to act; however, more complete data on  treatment harms or heterogeneity of benefits may promote greater equipoise  among both physicians and patients. A third cognitive bias, which may be  reinforced through messaging by interested stakeholders, is the tendency to  perceive new technologies as superior to older technologies—a problem with lengthy  CER studies, during which technology often advances. Adaptive study designs  could provide the flexibility to allow the evolution of treatments through the  course of a trial, but these approaches were not used in any of the trials we  studied, with the exception of CATIE. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Strategies for mitigating cognitive biases are available,  but their effectiveness is not completely clear. Enhancing the transparency of  stakeholder positions by using approaches that foster explicit formal  decisionmaking processes is one approach to mitigating cognitive biases in a  policymaking context. Disclosure of financial and intellectual conflicts of  interest is another strategy used by the IOM and others. Regulation of detailing  and direct-to-consumer advertising may also be effective. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="LeftFlush0"><b>4.<i> The questions posed by a CER study and its design  may not adequately address the needs of end users or focus adequately on the  clinical decisionmaking opportunities that have the greatest potential to  influence clinical practice. </i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our case studies suggest that CER faces potentially  unrealistic expectations on the part of multiple end users. First, there is an  unavoidable tension in the design of CER studies between supporting  personalized medicine and supporting clinical policymaking, which requires  generalizable results on larger populations. Second, as demonstrated in CATIE,  CER studies may not be designed with a comprehensive or explicit understanding  of the beliefs and concerns of clinical practitioners, such as their  preoccupation with the relative safety of classes of antipsychotics rather than  their relative effectiveness. Third, head-to-head  comparisons of treatments may help providers select appropriate treatments in  the later stages of clinical decision algorithms, but CER concerned with  upstream diagnostic tests or procedures may have a larger impact on patient  outcomes and the overall value of care. If distinct providers (e.g., primary-care  providers) are responsible for upstream decisions to refer, and if both  providers and patients face weaker incentives to choose an intervention  (compared to interventionists), their decisionmaking may be more readily  influenced by evidence. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b> </b></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0"><b>5.<i> Clinical decision support and patient decision  aids can help to align clinical practice with CER evidence, but they are not  widely used. </i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Perverse financial incentives and lack of accountability for  implementation have limited the production and dissemination of both clinical decision  support tools and shared-decisionmaking aids. Decision support tools to promote  evidence-based diagnostic testing and appropriate referral to specialists are uncommon,  although both may lead to the use of treatments that are better aligned with  CER evidence. Well-informed patients who make treatment decisions according to  their preferences may ultimately serve as a counterweight to providers who lack  equipoise. However, the prevalence of direct-to-consumer advertising has grown,  and this may create or reinforce misconceptions about treatments. Even if  incentives for adopting these tools were better aligned, the challenge of integrating  them seamlessly into clinical practice has not been solved, and limited HIT  infrastructure and inadequate provider training on shared decisionmaking may  continue to pose barriers to the implementation of these tools in the coming  years. </p>
<p><strong>Limitations of This Study</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">Because our primary objective was to identify and synthesize  themes across case studies, we struck a specific balance between depth of  content and breadth of inclusion of case studies. Our sample of expert  discussions and stakeholder perspectives for each of the case studies was  limited, and a larger sample of end users of CER from a diversity of practice  settings could have identified additional barriers and enablers. The  perspectives of the device industry and, to a lesser extent, the pharmaceutical  industry are also underrepresented, despite considerable outreach efforts. Most  potential discussants declined to participate, citing concerns about the  sensitivity of the information they might be asked to share. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We chose not to use a formal qualitative research  methodology that included the coding of themes with the use of specialized  analytic software. Biased interpretations of the data by the research team were  mitigated by requiring a minimum of three investigators to be present for each  discussion, and we used email follow-up for areas that needed clarification. Our  root-cause analysis drew primarily on themes that were mentioned repeatedly by  stakeholders. Because of the limited scope of topics and the limited number of  discussions we were able to hold, some of our findings regarding the root  causes of failed CER translation or the facilitators of practice change may not  be generalizable to other topics or to a broader range of practice settings. </p>
<p><strong>Policy Implications</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0">While the root causes of failure to translate CER evidence  into clinical practice are formidable, they are not insurmountable. After  reflecting on the policy implications of our case studies, we identified a  range of policy options that can address the root causes and promote more effective  translation of CER evidence into clinical practice. Each of these policy  options can be categorized into one of the following domains: governance,  standards, financing, profession-alism, marketing and education, and research  and evaluation. Each of the policy options would be optimally deployed within a  healthcare system having a CER-enabling infrastructure that</p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpFirst">1.     Enables  generation of CER that is more relevant to decisionmakers</p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpFirst">2.     Enables  more-effective translation of research into practice</p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpLast">3.     Enables  more-effective evaluation of the impact of translation activities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The policy options presented here are not intended to create  a centralized command-and-control infrastructure that determines the CER agenda.  Changes in the translation process, such as reengineering financial incentives,  must be carried out by a diverse set of public and private stakeholders, and  the changes must address a remarkable diversity of payment arrangements. The  policy options we suggest could bring greater coherence and transparency to the  process of CER translation, achieve greater balance of the influence of  stakeholders participating in CER translation, and enhance the voice of the  public and patients whose health outcomes depend on effective, safe, and  affordable care. Enacting some or all of these options could be expected over  time to modify the financial and other incentives that shape clinical  decisionmaking so that decisions will be increasingly based on evidence rather  than other considerations. </p>
<p><strong>Governance</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0"><b>Create a transparent governance mechanism with oversight  of the CER translation process:</b></p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpFirst">1.      <i>Include patient or consumer representatives. </i>Patients are  ultimately the financers of CER and the key beneficiaries of the clinical  practices guided by the research. They should be engaged to ensure that the CER  translation process is well informed by the end-user perspective and to provide  a counterbalance to other stakeholder interests.</p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle">2.      <i>Include public and private payer and purchaser representatives.  </i>As stewards of the financing of healthcare and representatives of their  member or customer interests, payers and purchasers may be able to identify the  specific opportunities for high-value care that would be especially amenable to  CER and for which modification of payment or coverage policies could be  especially effective in optimizing clinical practice. </p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle">3.      <i>Enable and support public comment opportunities. </i>Vigorous  solicitation of public comment with verification and full disclosure of the  potential conflicts of interest (both financial and intellectual) of those who  offer comments can enhance the credibility of the CER enterprise.<i> </i></p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle">4.      <i>Institute strong policies on disclosure and management of  potential conflicts of interest. </i>CER evidence that is perceived as biased  by financial interests will lose credibility and can impede the take-up of new  practices; it might also be countered by policies that identify and manage  potential financial, institutional, and intellectual conflicts of interest. </p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpLast">5.      <i>Use the governance mechanism to generate a prospective public  record of stakeholder expectations. </i>Documenting the positions of relevant  stakeholders at the outset of CER studies with respect to the study objectives  and the parameters around which the results should be interpreted creates a  public record of expectations of each stakeholder and may discourage post-hoc  efforts to undermine the credibility of studies that produce results contrary  to the interests of specific stakeholders.<i> </i></p>
<p><strong>Standards</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0"><b>Support and enhance creation of standards for CER generation  and translation:</b></p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpFirst">1.       <i>Incorporate data elements that are critical to translation activities  into the proposed national CER registry.</i> Creating explicit standards for  the description of CER study objectives, design, sampling,<i> </i>and causes of  heterogeneity in sampled populations within a CER registry may be useful to  guide formulation of a consensus interpretation of results and to avoid  post-hoc reframing of the questions and implications by stakeholders to serve  their interests. </p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpLast">2.       <i>Encourage development of standardized electronic clinical data  systems (clinical registries). </i>Standardized electronic clinical registries  can enable rapid and low-cost CER, can provide data for longitudinal tracking  systems to evaluate the impact of CER translation activities on clinical practice  patterns, and may better support decisionmaking because clinicians and patients  perceive data derived from them to be trustworthy. </p>
<p><strong>Financing</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0"><b>Encourage public financing of CER translation and  promote the use of CER evidence in payment programs:</b></p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpFirst">1.      <i>Provide direct and indirect support for formalization of CER  evidence and the dissemination of CER-based clinical practices. </i>Public  financing for both translation of high-profile CER evidence in guidelines,  quality measures, and clinical decision support and subsequent dissemination  activities could counteract the influence of industry in the process of  formalizing CER evidence that might otherwise undermine the evidence or  selectively promote less effective or more costly practices. </p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpLast">2.      <i>Promote the use of CER-based clinical practices through  payment policy and incentive programs directed toward providers and patients  (e.g., value-based purchasing).</i> Encouraging “prudent purchasing strategies”  for public-sector payers based on CER evidence can assure that the financial  incentives of providers and patients in the delivery of healthcare are well  aligned to support clinical practices based on CER evidence and discourage  practices that are not evidence-based. </p>
<p><strong>Professionalism</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0"><b>Supporting professional consensus across the phases of  CER translation:</b></p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpFirst">1.       <i>Foster and support a broad vision of professionalism in the  governance of CER translation. </i>Broadly constituted professional committees  may be able to produce balanced, consensus interpretations of CER results and  may resolve differences of opinion about interpretation of those results in a  transparent manner. Multispecialty clinical registries and health-information  exchange may counteract the tendency to focus on narrowly defined subspecialty  interests. </p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpLast">2.       <i>Include training for professionals on the role of cognitive biases in  diagnostic and treatment decisionmaking. </i>Training in the nature, role, and  impact of cognitive biases can enable professionals to recognize the  circumstances under which decisions and clinical recommendations are prone to  cognitive biases and to employ specific techniques that modify the decisionmaking  context to compensate for these biases. </p>
<p><strong>Marketing and Education</strong></p>
<p class="LeftFlush0"><b>Promote demand for  CER-based clinical services through public education and marketing:</b></p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpFirst">1.       <i>Promote patient demand for CER-based clinical services through shared  decisionmaking that includes formal patient decision aids.</i> Shared  decisionmaking involving the use of formal decision aids is the most prominent  approach for assuring that patients can receive the best available evidence  about alternative tests and treatments in a usable form. Decision aids could  counter the messages that promote suboptimal clinical practices. </p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpLast">2.       <i>Support “social marketing” campaigns for high-profile CER results to  counteract the effects of industry-sponsored detailing and direct-to-consumer  advertising. </i>Marketing campaigns, including detailing to clinicians and  direct-to-consumer advertising, are generally aimed at exploiting cognitive  biases, and this may impede the uptake of CER-based clinical services. Social  marketing—the application of marketing techniques to promote behavioral  change—has the potential to increase awareness and demand for evidence-based  healthcare services by promoting greater patient engagement in medical  decisionmaking.</p>
<p><strong>Research and Evaluation</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpFirst">1.       <i>Support research to identify the gaps in clinical decisionmaking that  are the highest-priority topics for end users of CER. </i>Research on end-user  needs can help identify high-priority topics and increase the relevance of CER  to payers, professionals, and the public while fostering the selection of  approaches for disseminating CER results tailored to the expectations of key  stakeholders. </p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle">2.       <i>Promote integration of CER registries with clinical registries to  support evaluation of the impact of CER studies and the factors associated with  successful translation. </i>Prospective evaluation of the impact of CER could  be strengthened if available data sources can provide valid and reliable  estimates of current clinical-practice patterns, which may be found in clinical  registries. Clinical registries that are capable of providing longitudinal data  on patients may enable these more complex studies and increase the relevance of  results for end users. </p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle">3.       <i>Support projects that develop unbiased and efficient methods for  formalization of CER results. </i>Methods for developing and refining  guidelines, performance measures, and clinical decision support tools are still  a work in progress. Support for research and demonstration projects that  develop and study new methods for formalization could lead to more effective,  efficient, and unbiased tools. </p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle">4.       <i>Support projects that enhance the utility of CER results by  demonstrating and evaluating models for the use of decision aids by clinicians  and patients. </i>Creating more effective decision aids, training professionals  to use them, and developing strategies for embedding them in routine practice  have all proven challenging. Research and evaluation projects that lead to  better decision aids and their more effective use could increase the impact of  CER. </p>
<p class="MsoListNumberCxSpLast">5.       <i>Support research into the ways in which CER evidence is used by  integrated delivery systems. </i>Integrated systems may have unique  perspectives on which CER topics are likely to have the greatest impact on  clinical practice, and their CER translation experience may be invaluable. Future  studies might involve engaging these organizations to elicit best practices in  CER translation and evaluating which strategies may be transferrable to  nonintegrated delivery settings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The federal government is making a  sizable investment in CER in the hope that the results will influence the  decisions of clinicians and patients, optimize the quality of care, and lower costs.  Given these goals, attention to the root causes of ineffective translation of  CER evidence into practice seems critical. The list of policy options we have  outlined is not exhaustive, but we believe that these options may provide  guidance to a broad set of policymakers concerned with the organization and  financing of healthcare. Taken together, the options suggest a number of  different paths forward. Exploring multiple approaches may be appropriate in  view of the large number of factors that impede CER translation. As the  ARRA-financed CER portfolio begins to produce new evidence, a number of  opportunities will arise in the near term to experiment with these strategies.</p>
