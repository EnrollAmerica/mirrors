              <p>The major SIME/DIME results are presented under three headings.  First, the effects of the experiment on work effort or labor supply are presented.  The primary focus is the effect of eligibility for a negative income tax plan, but the analysis sample used to obtain these findings includes all families enrolled in the experiments, including those families enrolled only in the counseling/training subsidy treatment.  Second, the effects on hours worked and earnings of the counseling/training subsidy treatment are discussed specifically.  Third, the effects of the experimental treatments on "marital stability" are described.  Recall that marital stability is not used in the literal sense here since couples were not required to be legally married.</p>
<p>For the marital stability research, the analysis sample included those who were eligible for the negative income tax and counseling/training subsidy treatments alone plus those who were eligible for both, as well as those eligible for neither — the control group.  Many other types of behavioral response to the experimental treatments have also been analyzed and are discussed in the <em>Final Report</em>. Tables of Contents for Volume I (the research findings) and Volume II (the administration of the experiment) are included at the end of this overview as a guide for readers wishing to pursue issues not covered here.</p>
<p>In all cases, unless otherwise noted, the results presented in this overview are experimental-control differences, adjusted by statistical methods to control for the variation in sample characteristics across treatment combinations.</p>

          Cash Transfer Effects on Labor Supply      </h4>

              <p>The labor supply results for husbands, wives, female family heads, and youth will be summarized in turn.  For each group, the overall response to the SIME/DIME negative income tax plans taken together is described first.  A discussion of differences in response among the different NIT plans follows.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the samples used for the labor supply analysis include families that were eligible for the counseling/training subsidy treatment.  There is no statistically significant evidence that the counseling/training subsidy treatment altered the effect of the negative income tax treatment on labor supply behaviors.  Consequently, the labor supply analysis can statistically separate the effect of the two treatments, and the results described in this section can be interpreted as the effect of just the negative income tax plans on work effort.</p>
<p>The NIT treatment was administered for two different lengths of time (three and five years) to get some information both on how long the family members took to adjust their behavior to the change and on whether a long-term program might have a different effect from a shot-term one.  Obviously the experiment could not go on indefinitely.  The hope was, however, that any differences between the responses of the three- and five-year sample wold help predict long-term program effects.  In addition, interview information was collected for at least one post-experimental year in order to measure any effects of the cessation of benefits.</p>
<h4>Husbands</h4>
<p>The results for husbands show that the combination of negative income tax plans tested in SIME/DIME — which, as already mentioned, represents on average a relatively generous cash transfer program with a guarantee of 115% of the poverty line and a tax rate of 50% — has a significant negative effect on hours worked per year.  Table 4A shows the findings by experimental year and duration of treatment.  The best measure of the overall labor supply effect for the combination three- and five-year samples is probably the disincentive effect as measured in the second year — after all the experimentals have had time to adjust to the treatment but before the three-year families start preparing for the treatment to end.</p>
<p>This percentage reduction in hours of labor supplied for the three- and five-year families combined, as measured in the second experimental year, is about 9%.  For the three-year sample, the maximum labor supply response is a 7.3% decline, occurring in both the second and third years.  For the five-year sample, the maximum response is a 13.6% decline, occurring in the fourth year of the five-year treatment period.  These maximum percentage responses represent in absolute terms a decline of about 133 and 234 hours of work per year, respectively.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p>The larger response for husbands enrolled in the five-year group suggests that the response to a long-term national program of comparable generosity might be higher than the response measured by the three-year sample, or even for the combined three- and five-year sample.  It should be noted, however, that no general statement about the effect of treatment duration on response can be made, since this effect depends critically on the generosity (i.e., the guarantee/tax rate combination) of the NIT.</p>
<p>By the end of the first post-treatment year, labor supply for NIT-eligible husbands had again returned essentially to the same level as that for controls, indicating strongly both that the observed response was indeed a result of the treatment and that husbands can adjust their labor supply fairly rapidly to changed incentives.  Average work reductions were observed to be larger among Black and Chicano men than among White men.  However, these results were not statistically significant.  Similarly, work reductions were observed to be larger in Denver (which had a tight labor market during the experiment) than in Seattle (which had high unemployment during most of the experiment).  Again, these results failed to be statistically significant.</p>
<p>When the results for all 11 negative income tax plans are estimated separately, as shown in Table 4B, we begin to see how the pattern of response changes with changes in the negative income tax plan.  As the guarantee becomes more generous, the labor supply response becomes generally more negative.  Response does not, however, change in any clear pattern as the tax rate changes.  This result may at first appear surprising.  However, recall that plans with higher tax rates — and greater associated work disincentives for NIT recipients — also have lower breakeven levels.  Consequently, higher tax plans will have fewer recipients, and a smaller fraction of the population will be affected by their work disincentives.</p>
<p>When the plans are grouped according to relative overall generosity as measured by the breakeven level (not shown), the magnitude of the labor supply reductions for husbands increases as the generosity of the plan increases.  Findings by plan again indicate greater responses for the five-year sample than the three-year sample.  In addition, although the response is uniformly greater for the five-year sample than the three-year sample, the difference between the two is less for the lower than for the higher generosity plans.</p>
<p>What form did the decrease in annual hours worked take?  Was it mainly that people worked with the same regularity but for fewer hours each week, or was it that they spent more time not working at all — that is, unemployed or out of the labor force?  Experimental husbands did work significantly fewer weeks than control husbands:  annual weeks worked were 2.8 less during the second year.  Most of this reduction came about through a significant increase in unemployment.<sup>(7)</sup>  Weeks unemployed for experimental husbands were on average 2.2 more than for controls.  One interpretation of this result might be that the cash transfer program enabled husbands to take more time to find a better job.  However, other findings from the experiment show that husbands in the experimental group did not find measurably better jobs than their control counterparts, at least as judged by the wage rate.  Disregarding the distinction between unemployment and out of the labor force, a safer conclusion is that NIT eligibility induced men who were out of work to spend more time between jobs than men in the control sample.  For a few men, the time spent out of employment was increased quite considerably.  For example, during the second experimental year the proportion of men in the NIT-eligible group who worked at least one week during the year dropped by 7 percent in comparison to that observed in the control group.  For those experimentals who did work, there was a significant reduction in the proportion who worked full time, but no significant impact on the proportion working overtime or only part time.</p>
<p>A question remains as to whether the missing observations of those who dropped out during the experiment and/or possible misreporting bias cause the estimates presented above to be distorted in any measurable way.  This is, by its very nature, a difficult question to answer.  Examination of other earnings records (particularly from Social Security, but also, on a more fragmentary basis, from the Washington and Colorado Department of Employment Security) on both experimental and control families suggests that for husbands any attrition and misreporting bias is probably small.</p>
<h4>Wives</h4>
<p>The labor supply response of wives to the SIME/DIME negative income tax treatment was significantly negative and larger in percentage terms than the response of husbands, at least when that response is measured with SIME/DIME interview data.  As shown in Table 5A, the average work reduction for the three- and five-year samples taken together, as measured in the second experimental year, is about 20%.  For the three-year sample the maximum effect was a decrease in annual hours of 16.5% in hours worked, occurring in the second year.  For the five-year sample, the maximum effect was a decrease in annual hours of approximately 27.1%, occurring in the fourth year.  In absolute terms these decreases — just over 100 hours a year and just over 200 hours per year, respectively — are smaller than for husbands.  The larger percentages decreases should be interpreted in the context of the smaller average hourly commitment of these women to market work than the average hourly commitment of their husbands.  Wives readjusted at the end of the experiment as quickly as husbands, with the wives in the three-year sample even showing a tendency to work more then comparable control families during the second post-experiment year.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p>When response is estimated separately for the eleven plans tested (see Table 5B), the response for wives, as for husbands, generally increased in magnitude as the guarantee became more generous and, again as for husbands, showed a somewhat inconsistent pattern with respect to the tax rate.  When plans are arrayed by generosity of the breakeven level, wives show the expected pattern of generally increasing response magnitude as generosity increases.  The five-year responses are uniformly, although not significantly, larger than the three-year responses for wives.  The treatment duration differences that do exist are again smaller for less generous NIT plans than for plans with higher breakeven levels.</p>
<p>There are some interesting differences between the behavior of wives and husbands with respect to the form the decrease in work actually took.  Weeks worked per year were about 3.8 less for experimental wives than for control wives in the second experimental year.  Virtually all of this difference took the form of an increase in weeks out of the labor force (rather than weeks unemployed as was the case with husbands).<sup>(8)</sup>  The probability of working at least one week during the year was also significantly less for experimental wives during the second experimental year.  With respect to changes in the amount worked by those who do work, there was a significant reduction in the probability of both full-time and part-time work.</p>
<p>Analyst have investigated the importance of misreporting and attrition biases on the experimental results for wives.  Employment and earnings checks with the same records used to validate the results for husbands suggest that both the attrition bias and the misreporting bias for wives may be substantially — with both working in the direction of exaggerating observed experimental control differences.  Once again, incomplete date makes it impossible to come up with precise estimates of the magnitude of the biases, though examination of the Social Security and unemployment insurance records suggests that as much as half of the measured response may be attributable to differential attrition bias and that a large fraction of the remaining response may represent misreporting bias.  The reader should therefore be cautioned that the observed labor supply response for wives might overstate the work reduction that actually occurred.</p>
<h4>Female Family Heads</h4>
<p>As with the previous two groups, female family heads responded to the SIME/DIME negative income tax treatment by reducing work effort significantly.  The overall response of the three-year and five-year samples taken together, as measured in the second treatment year, was 14%.  Their maximum response was larger in absolute and percentage terms than that of either husbands or wives.  For the three-year sample (see Table 6A) the maximum reduction was about 22%, occurring in the final treatment year; for the five-year sample the maximum response was about 32%, also occurring in the final treatment year.  These correspond to absolute reductions of about 220 and 405 hours per year, respectively.  These maximum responses, it should be noted, are about double the average response.</p>
<p>Unlike husbands and wives, female heads do not seem to have responded differently to the three- and five-year treatments, since the responses for the two samples measured over the same period of time are not significantly different.  However, their adaptation both to the experiment and to its end appears to have been slower, suggesting that female heads adjust more slowly to changes in financial incentives than do husbands or wives.  This suggest that the response observable in any brief-duration experiment, such as three or five years duration, will understate the work reduction of female family heads relative to a permanent program.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p>When the responses are calculated separately for the eleven plans tested (see Table 6B) no obvious pattern of variation between the labor supply response and either guarantee or tax rate is found.</p>
<p>How did the average reduction in annual hours worked manifest itself in patterns of employment for female family heads?  First, as with the other two groups, there was a significant reduction in weeks worked.  For female heads this reduction was higher than for husbands but lower than for wives.  As with wives, but not husbands, this was accounted for by dropping out of the labor force rather than by being unemployed.  The probability of working at all during the year also decreased significantly for female heads — again, the magnitude of the labor force participation decline is between those for husbands and for wives.  With respect to changes in full-time, part-time, or overtime work by those who worked, female heads reacted more like the husbands than the wives.  The only significant change for those that worked was a decrease in full-time work.</p>
<p>With respect to the question of possible misreporting and attrition bias in the observed responses, comparison with other data records suggests that there was no misreporting bias.  There is, however, evidence of moderate attrition bias that goes in the other direction from that observed for wives.  When interpreting the results for female heads, therefore, it should be kept in mind that the observed responses might underestimate slightly the actual reduction.</p>
<h4>Youth</h4>
<p>Based on their own interview-reported hours and earnings, both male and female youth (at least age 16 but under age 21) appeared to respond to the negative income tax plans tested in SIME/DIME by reducing their labor supply significantly.  For the three- and five-year samples for males taken together, the observed reduction was substantial; reported hours worked per week decreased on average by about 24% and the proportion of the year during which they reported working decreased by about 17%.  Although the proportional reductions in work effort are large for both young men and women, the absolute reductions are quite small, since average work effort among teenagers is low.</p>
<p>When the labor supply response of youth is estimated for the three- and five-year samples separately, the differences between the two are not generally significant.  However, the fact that the observed effects for the five-year sample are larger (and, in the case of young men, sometimes much larger) than for the three-year sample suggests that the work effect of a permanent program might be larger than the observed response in this limited-duration experiment.  Differentiating response by plan yields the same lack of tax rate effect as appeared for the other groups; and for youth there is no systematic guarantee effect either.</p>
<p>Labor supply response does vary in an important respect according to whether the youth remained dependents or set up separate households.  For males who continued to live at home and for males who left their original family to form new, two-parent families (both eligible for continued payment), the observed work disincentive is substantial.  By the second half of the third experimental year, hours worked by the new husbands had declined by about 33% (mainly accounted for by increased unemployment), and the hours worked by those continuing to live at home had declined by about 43% (about equally accounted for by increased unemployment and increased time out of the labor force).  But for young men who left their parental family to live as single individuals, there is no significant work disincentive effect.  For females there is a significant work disincentive (about a 42% decrease in hours worked) only for those who continue to live with their parental family.  For none of the youth groups was the decrease in hours worked accompanied by an increase in time spent in school.  The observed work reductions tend to be largest for those who are not in school, but labor supply declines are not restricted to youths in that group.</p>
<h4>Generalizing to the National Population</h4>
<p>As emphasized earlier in this overview, the observed labor supply responses represented so far are effects that are specific to the population enrolled in SIME/DIME and relate only to NIT programs actually tested in that experiment.  In order to predict from the observed SIME/DIME responses the effects of national programs of differing generosity, the SIME/DIME analysts developed a more general form of the work disincentive response.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy pattern they found is that, although the decrease in hours worked by participants gets larger the higher the tax rate (holding the guarantee constant), the work disincentive for the U.S. population as a whole gets smaller.  This is because a higher tax rate implies a lower breakeven income level and a smaller number of participants.  The positive labor supply response among those losing eligibility is big enough to offset the larger negative response among the program participants.</p>

              <p>A unique feature of SIME/DIME among the four NIT experiments was the testing of a labor market counseling and training subsidy program in addition to a negative income tax transfer program.  The rationale for including these programs was to determine whether increased labor market information and increased education and training could offset the decline in work effort that was predicted to occur due to the negative income tax program.  As described at the beginning of this overview, the SIME/DIME counseling treatment was informational and non-directive in nature, and types of training deemed appropriate for subsidization were very flexibly defined.  The expectation was that the counseling would lead, at least eventually, to better labor market match of skills to jobs and thus higher wage rates, earnings, and possibly, job status.  The training subsidy was expected to lead to the same general outcomes, possibly after a brief period of decreased labor market activity in the short run as the extra training was acquired.</p>
<h4>Participation</h4>
<p>There was substantial participation in the counseling and subsidized training programs, particularly among single women.  Many of those who participated in the counseling program demonstrated interest in obtaining additional training, including even some who were not eligible for a training subsidy.  There was marked diversity in the goals of those who planned to seek training.  A majority chose relatively modest occupational and training objectives, but a substantial minority chose quite ambitious objectives that presumably held lower prospects for successful attainment.</p>
<p>Table 7 shows the proportions of the SIME/DIME sample that participated in the counseling and training subsidy programs.  Participation rates for counseling rose consistently as the amount of subsidy offered increased.  Husbands and wives participated at similar rates (nearly 40% for the counseling only group, just over 50% for the 50% subsidy group and about 60% for the 100% subsidy group).  Female heads participated in counseling at uniformly higher rates (54% for the counseling only group, 64% for the 50% subsidy group, and 72% for the 100% subsidy group).  A similar pattern emerges for participation in the training subsidy programs, though the percentages are lower.  Just over 20% of husband and wives chose to participate in the 50% subsidy option and 36% chose to participate in the 100% subsidy option.  For female heads, the figures are 35% and 47%, respectively.</p>

<p>With respect to the amount of schooling received, counseling-only did not make a difference.  The subsidies did tend, however, to increase the amount of schooling received — mildly for husbands, more strongly for wives, and most strongly for female heads.  For the latter two groups, the effects on schooling were generally stronger the more generous the subsidy.</p>
<h4>Impact on Labor Market Performance</h4>
<p>The counseling/training subsidy treatment did not have the expected positive effect for most groups.  The effects on average annual earnings and hours of work are shown in Table 8.  Earnings declined during the experimental period and, quite unexpectedly, the negative results tended to continue into the post-program period as well, though these post-program reductions were not statistically significant.  Not all results for all groups are statistically significant, but the negative pattern shows clearly through the estimates — in earnings, hours worked, and wage rates.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><p>Table 8 shows the results for the three- and five-year samples for years 1, 4, and 6, to indicate both in-program and post-program effects.  For husbands, the three-year counseling only program had virtually no impact on earnings.  In contrast, the five-year counseling program had a predominately negative impact on earnings, even in the sixth year when experimentals were no longer eligible for counseling.  In addition, eligibility for counseling resulted, for those husbands who were working, in consistently lower wage rates than those of their control counterparts.  The training subsidy programs led to substantial and significant first year decreases in earnings and hours.  The 50% subsidy for example, led to a $248 decrease in annual earnings for the three-year sample and a $398 decrease for the five-year sample.  The 100% subsidy, only administered to the three-year sample, led to a $317 decrease.  In year 4, the decrease in earnings was smaller and not significant; in year 6, it had practically disappeared.</p>
<p>Wives show a similar pattern of response to the counseling-only program with even larger negative effects.  Both the three-year and five-year counseling programs resulted in lower earnings and hours of work for wives in every year, and these effects are generally significant for the five-year program.  For example, in the first post-program year, wives eligible for the five-year counseling treatment earned $430 less than did comparable controls, a 19% reduction.  Wives eligible for the training subsidy programs also had lower earnings and worked fewer hours than did controls.  These effects tend to be significant in the early years, but are also large and negative in the later years.</p>
<p>For single female heads, the counseling only program probably did have positive results on earnings.  Although not statistically significant, the effect on earnings is substantial:  in the fifth year, female heads eligible for the counseling only program earned between $275 and $300 more per year than did controls, approximately a 10% increase.  Furthermore, the counseling only program did have some significant post-program impacts on the wage rates and hours of work of female heads.</p>
<p>For the combined counseling/training subsidy program, in contrast, the effects were negative for female heads, as for the other groups.  As for husbands and wives, female heads eligible for subsidies generally had lower earnings and worked fewer hours than did comparable controls even in the post-program period.</p>
<p>It would be instructive to be able to separate out the effect of the counseling from the effects of the training subsidies, to test the possibility that the counseling was the driving negative influence.  While no definitive conclusion on this point can be drawn, because counseling was a prerequisite to the subsidy program, it is possible to infer the separate impact of subsidies when added to an existing counseling program.  Here the results for female heads suggest strongly and those for husbands suggest weakly that the addition of a training subsidy program causes even larger earnings and hours reductions than counseling by itself.  For wives, the negative impact of counseling plus subsidies is approximately equal to the impact of counseling by itself.</p>
<h4>Possible Reasons for the Effects</h4>
<p>How did programs intended to improve the employment and earnings experiences of eligibles actually lead to lower earnings?  If the results had indicated no effects, one might be able to explain the results by hypothesizing that very little actually happened in the counseling and training programs.  The findings of negative effects, however, cannot be so dismissed.  Something did occur in counseling and in training that actually reduced the earnings prospects of participants.</p>
<p>Analysis of date gathered on the objectives of participants suggest that a substantial fraction of the subsidized training was oriented to achieving ambitious career goals.  For an important fraction of participants, the goals were evidently overambitious, and the training did not translate into higher earnings even though it may have provided immediate satisfaction to the participants.  Evidently, the SIME/DIME counseling/training subsidy program induced short-run reductions in earnings without supporting the type of training or education that would enable participants to secure better paying jobs, at least during the one- to three-year follow-up period.  This "training ineffectiveness argument" would explain a zero treatment response, but it doesn't really offer an explanation of the obvious negative response.  Perhaps the counseling and training experiences of those with ambitious upward mobility goals actually made it more difficult to pursue a career consisting of a series of relatively low-paying jobs.  In any case, a different type of counseling might have resulted in training and education decisions that were less ambitious, but this is entirely conjectural.</p>

          Effects on Marital Stability (9)      </h4>
    </a>
    
      <ul class="collapsibleChild level5" id="ajax-target-node-136136">
        
                      <li class="chapter_content without_highlight">
              <p>Although, as mentioned earlier, the experiment was not explicitly designed to test effects on marital stability, much attention was paid to the issue in terms of both data collection and analysis.  To the extent that the effects of the experiment on marital dissolution were expected to depend on the guarantee and the tax rate, and to the extent that they were expected to differ according to income, ethnicity, and family type, the experimental design was well suited to the task of determining such effects.  But to the extent that response might depend on other factors — such as presence or absence of children, degree of stigma attached to the programs, or tp some unanticipated combined effect of the cash benefit and counseling/training subsidy treatment — the design was not optimal for testing those hypotheses.  This nonoptimality implies only that the response is measured with less statistical efficiency than with an optimal design, not that the design affects the validity of the response analysis.</p>
<h4>Expected Effects</h4>
<p>Previous research on the possible determinants of marital stability had not reached as well defined a consensus on the expected effects of cash transfers on marital dissolution and the chain of causation through which these effects may occur, as was the case with respect to labor supply.  There was some theoretical basis in the literature for believing both that cash transfers would reduce marital dissolution and that they would increase it.</p>
<p>The "conventional wisdom" at the time the experiment began, however, was relatively unambiguous.  The widely held view then was that the welfare system might be contributing to marital dissolution.  AFDC was restricted largely to one-parent families.  The AFDC-UF program for which two-parent families with children were eligible was not available in every state and, even where available, was so highly restrictive in its eligibility requirements that few two-parent families actually participated.  The empirical evidence on whether AFDC increased marital dissolution was mixed, but the policy presumption was that, if it did, a negative income tax for which both one-parent and two-parent families were eligible would be stabilizing influence.  A negative income tax with universal eligibility would be available to all families as soon as their incomes fell below a certain level, regardless of who was part of the family.  Therefore, the argument went, the incentive to leave one's family in order to make them eligible for cash transfers would no longer exist.</p>
<h4>The Analysis</h4>
<p>As already noted, two-parent families with children did not have to be legally married, or even claim to be, in order to be eligible for SIME/DIME benefits.  All they needed was to be living together on a continuing basis.  Unmarried couples without children were ineligible for SIME/DIME.  The SIME/DIME rules also permitted persons who had left their original partner to retain SIME/DIME eligibility and continue receiving negative income tax payments if their current income were below the breakeven level given their new family size.  Thus, if an original two-parent family split up, the experiment permitted both halves of the original family to continue receiving (separate) NIT payments.  If a member of the original couple formed a new continuing relationship, the new person was counted after a short waiting period as an eligible family member in computing SIME/DIME benefits.</p>
<p>During the first three years of SIME/DIME, roughly one in five of the couples married at enrollment were observed to break up.  Table 9 shows the proportion of original marriages that dissolved during the first three payment years, broken down by duration of treatment and ethnic group.</p>
<p>The methodology used in statistical analysis of the SIME/DIME data is complex and need not be spelled out in this overview.  A number of points are worth keeping in mind as the analytical results are discussed below.  First, the estimation methodology properly places substantial emphasis not only on the number of events but also on their timing.<sup>(10)</sup>  Second, the analysts place more emphasis on their findings for the smaller number of families in the five-year treatment group than for the larger number of families in the three-year treatment group, arguing that the longer treatment more closely approximates a permanent program.  In addition, as the raw date in Table 9 suggest, the statistical analysis demonstrates that the different ethnic groups react differently to the treatments, and hence needs to be analyzed separately, thus reducing further the size of the samples used in the analysis.</p>
<p>Third, the treatment group on which the statistical results are based includes those who received both the negative income tax treatment and the counseling/training subsidy treatment, as well as those on the negative income tax treatment only.  The statistical procedure used in the marital dissolution analysis to adjust for the counseling/training subsidy treatment is basically the same as that used in the labor supply analysis.  Although the interaction between the NIT and counseling/training subsidy treatments is statistically significant for Whites (but not for Blacks or Chicanos), the analysts conclude that the unsystematic nature of the interactions is most plausibly explained by sampling variable.  An additional finding that leads the authors to discount the importance of the interaction between the two types of treatment is that when they used their statistical methodology to re-estimate rates of marital dissolution in the New Jersey income maintenance experiment, they found the NIT effects to be similar in New Jersey (where there was no counseling or training subsidy) and SIME/DIME.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><h4>The Overall Effect</h4>
<p>Table 10 shows the estimated effect of the negative income tax treatment for the three-year treatment and five-year treatment families, by ethnic group.  The rate of marital dissolutions among Chicanos is unaffected by the NIT.  As can be seen, the overall effect on marital dissolution rates is positive and substantial for Black and White families in both the three-year and five-year NIT treatment groups.</p>
<p>To confirm the observed effects for Blacks and Whites, the analysis differentiated the dissolution rates during the experiment from those occurring in the period after the treatments ended.  For this analysis, three time periods were used — enrollment to three years later, three years after enrollment to five years after, and five years after enrollment to seven years after (i.e., the post-experimental years for the five-year treatment group).  The impact of the NIT on marital dissolution effects for both the three-years and five-years treatments are again positive and significant for Blacks and Whites, but not for Chicanos.  In the post-treatment period, the experimental-control difference disappears altogether for both the three-year and five-year treatment groups.  Thus, the observed response in dissolution is clearly attributable to the experiment.</p>
<p>A separate analysis of the experimental effect on remarriage concludes that the NIT treatments did not affect remarriage rates for single White or Black women, but did reduce the rate by over 60 percent for single Chicano women.  Furthermore, after an analysis of how sample attrition may have biased estimates of the change in dissolution rates, the analysts concluded that the unadjusted estimates for Whites and Blacks, which range in Table 10 from 40 percent to 50 percent, should be reduced about 10 percentage points for Blacks and about 5 percentage points for Whites.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><h4>Explanation of Effects</h4>
<p>What is the reason for the experimental effect on Black and White marriages and single Chicano women, given that this effect is the differential effect of the SIME/DIME NIT treatment compared to the effect of the public assistance (AFDC) option present in the control environment?  The analysts began explaining the increase in marital dissolution rates by noting a surprising general pattern of the experimental effects when estimated separately by NIT plan.  There was no perfectly consistent pattern, but what pattern there was suggested the paradox that lower marital dissolution rates are associated with higher guarantees.</p>
<p>Grouping by guarantee confirms that the experimental effect tends to decrease as the generosity of the guarantee increases.  In fact, for White couples the effect is statistically significant only for the low $3,800 guarantee (an 82 percent increase in the rate of marital dissolution), and for Blacks the effect is statistically significant only for the $3,800 guarantee (a 60 percent increase) and the medium $4,800 guarantee (a 91 percent increase).  For neither Black nor White is the effect significant for the high $5,600 guarantee.  This pattern of effects is especially striking in view of the fact that the $3,800 guarantee most closely approximates the generosity of the AFDC and AFDC-UF programs available to the control group.</p>
<p>Recognition of two aspects of the situation may account for this pattern of findings.  First, according to the existing literature, an increase in cash transfers can be expected to have two opposing effects on the marital dissolution rate.  Increases in family income tend to stabilize marriages, giving rise to an <em>income</em> effect; but a cash transfer program that provides financial alternatives to marriage for low-income women also tends to destabilize marriage, causing an <em>independence</em> effect.  Depending on the strength of the two effects, which are opposite in direction, a negative income tax reform may increase marital dissolution, decrease it, or leave it unchanged.  Second, since the basic income support offered to low-guarantee experimentals is similar to that already available to controls with children, it is also clear that the relevant difference between the two environments must be non-pecuniary.</p>
<p>Three non-pecuniary differences between the NIT and existing welfare programs may be relevant.  Knowledge of the availability of benefits in the event of marital dissolution is likely to be greater for experimentals under the SIME/DIME rules than for controls who would have to go the local welfare office to apply for AFDC and food stamps.  The time and nuisance cost of becoming eligible for benefits in the event of a dissolution is lower for the experimentals.  Experimental families already had eligibility for SIME/DIME; the only change due to a dissolution would be noting a change in family composition and available family resources on the regular monthly income report form.  The necessary procedure for applying for AFDC and food stamp benefits is more difficult and more time consuming.  Finally, the social and psychological cost (or stigma) of applying for AFDC and using food stamps are likely to be higher.  The SIME/DIME payments process was largely private.  The use of food stamps or AFDC exposes applicants to public acknowledgment of dependence or to interaction with possibly condescending welfare workers.  One way to sum up these non-pecuniary differences between the programs is to say that a dollar from welfare is less attractive than a dollar from SIME/DIME.</p>
