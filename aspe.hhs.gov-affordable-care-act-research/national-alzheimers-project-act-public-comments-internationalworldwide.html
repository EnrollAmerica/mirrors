<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Good afternoon. My name is Ian Kremer and I serve as executive director of Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (the LEAD Coalition). The LEAD Coalition is a diverse and growing national coalition of 77 member organizations [<a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/">http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/</a>] including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, home and residential care providers, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. LEAD is co-convened by the Alzheimer's Foundation of America and USAgainstAlzheimer's. The coalition works collaboratively to focus the nation's strategic attention on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and to accelerate transformational progress in: detection and diagnosis; care and support to enrich quality of life; and research leading to prevention, effective treatment and eventual cure. For more information about the LEAD Coalition, please contact me.</p>
<p>Congratulations and best wishes to the newly appointed members of the Advisory Council. We look forward to you building on the strong legacy of your predecessors, forging even more productive bonds with your colleagues, and being the catalysts for truly transformational progress in the quality of life for people facing dementia and the scientific pursuit of a world without dementia.</p>
<p>For the past several years, I have said during the public comment portion of Advisory Council meetings that the National Plan needed to match the aspirational and transformative 2025 goal for biomedical progress with similarly aspirational and transformative goals for clinical care and long term services and supports. At the Advisory Council's July 27 meeting, that conviction appeared to have sunk in with quite a few of the Council members. In particular, I want to thank Laurel Coleman and Harry Johns for their expressions not only of exasperation but of determination that this Advisory Council, this National Plan, and this country must achieve vast improvements in quality of life for those living with dementia and for their families.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I'll offer a sample of a dozen actions that might help the Advisory Council get started (I'll be happy to flesh out any of these points):</p>
<ul><li>Because the National Plan should be about person-centered progress that improves lives, not about issuing reports, holding events, and delivering units of training or service: <strong>work with public and private stakeholders to establish an ambitious national goal -- with metrics and milestones -- for lowering rates (among people with dementia and their caregivers) of isolation; neglect, abuse, and exploitation; falls; wandering; premature institutional placement; depression; pain; impoverishment; and inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in home and community-based care settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Because transformative innovation requires multi-sector collaboration, strong coordination, and a purposeful confluence of priority-setting, resource commitment, and accountability: <strong>recommend that the National Plan include creation of a dementia care a services parallel to the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (being led by NIH in the biomedical research sphere)</strong>.</li>
<li>Because people living with dementia and family caregivers should have an easier time participating in and contributing to the Advisory Council process ("Nothing About Us Without Us"): <strong>the Advisory Council should conduct regularly scheduled public listening sessions in-person around the country or at least by web-conference and social media (e.g. Google Hangouts, Twitter Chats); add a "Comments" form to its ASPE website; add to each workgroup additional members (non-voting, if statutorily necessary) who are living with dementia or are caregivers; and consult with disabilities experts about other accommodations that would facilitate greater access and participation</strong>.</li>
<li>Because there is dignity in knowing your diagnosis and because diagnosis is the door to quality care, self-determination, and advancing social and biomedical research: <strong>work with public and private stakeholders to establish an ambitious national goal -- with metrics and milestones -- for rates of accurate, timely, and actionable diagnosis</strong>.</li>
<li>Because this is a national plan -- not a federal plan -- and quality of life issues are in no small measure defined by state and local policies and practices: <strong>actively engage in the National Plan process the National Governors Association, the National Council of State Legislatures, the National Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the National League of Cities to determine their capacity, interests, and best-practices</strong>.</li>
<li>Because, by statute and by common sense, Congress is a stakeholder in the NAPA process: <strong>work with the relevant congressional committees, the House and Senate Alzheimer's Task Forces, the congressional caregiver caucus, and the congressional neuroscience caucus to more deeply engage them in the advisory council's work whether by attending meetings, appearing as guest presenters, or simply making sure they receive meeting agendas, announcements and links to materials and meeting videos</strong>.</li>
<li>Because dementia is an enormous and under-addressed workplace challenge both for employers and employees: <strong>actively engage in the National Plan process the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, the Society of Human Resource Managers, and representatives of both the business and labor communities to quantify those challenges and identify best-practices to change outcomes</strong>.</li>
<li>Because most people living with dementia and their caregivers have additional health challenges: <strong>actively engage public and private stakeholders focused on commonly co-occurring medical conditions -- such as diabetes, cardio-vascular disease, mental health disorders, hearing loss, and mobility loss -- to participate in the NAPA process of developing recommendations and action plans to improve quality of life</strong>.</li>
<li>Because dementia does note respect state borders: <strong>help states not only to share best-practices but also to form inter-state collaborations to address the needs of people living with dementia and their families who cross those state borders for services and for reasons of shared family caregiving</strong>.</li>
<li>Because dementia does not respect international borders either in its challenges or its solutions: <strong>formalize the National Plan goals and objectives with milestones and metrics about fostering international collaboration on research investments and priorities, regulatory harmonization, and translation and scaling of clinical and care practices</strong>.</li>
<li>Because living with dementia and caregiving for people with dementia is hard enough under normal circumstances but far more difficult during, or in the wake of, natural disasters: <strong>encourage the Federal Emergency Management Agency to participate in the NAPA Process to help develop recommendations and action plans to meet the ongoing and emerging needs of individuals, families, and institutions</strong>.</li>
<li>Because the Advisory Council is a bully pulpit: <strong>be vocal, candid, and relentless is pressing Congress to end sequestration and lift the budget caps that do very real harm to millions of people living with dementia today and in the future</strong>.</li>
</ul><p>In closing, I offer my apologies for topics I have failed to address and I offer my thanks to others making public comments addressing such omissions. I offer my appreciation to Advisory Council members and staff who give of their minds and hearts beyond what words can express. I offer my hope to all those living with dementia and their loved ones that they will be heard, heeded, and healed through the work we all do together.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Good afternoon and thank you for your time today. My name is Grace Whiting and I am the Director of Strategic Partnerships at the National Alliance for Caregiving. The Alliance is a national non-profit organization dedicated to the mission of advancing family caregiving through research, innovation, and advocacy. By way of introduction to the new members of this body, we have over 40 national and multinational organizations in our membership, including four federal agencies and both not-for-profit and corporate organizations.</p>
<p>Together, we firmly believe that if our society is to rely on family caregivers to provide long-term care, then it is our duty to provide support for family caregivers -- at home, within models of healthcare delivery, in the workplace, and in the workplace. To that end, there are three comments I'd like to make today.</p>
<p>First, I would encourage you to consider international perspectives through your work on this council. As Secretariat of the International Alliance of CarerOrganizations, the Alliance often learns about new models of support for caregivers of people with Alzheimer's and related dementias. These models offer insight into how we can better support families in the United States who are managing this terrible disease.</p>
<p>For example, Scotland's "Focus on Dementia" model provides a meaningful framework for integrating a diagnosis for dementia into care and support. The Focus on Dementia model creates a "hub" for the patient and family to navigate the challenges of the disease. The hub has eight domains, including: a Dementia Practice Coordinator; therapeutic interventions; general health care; mental health care; environmental adaptations; community connections and engagement; personalized support; and support for caregivers. Diagnosis operates as a touchpoint to refer the individual with dementia to the Dementia Practice Coordinator, and it allows both that individual and their caregiver to become eligible for services. As many of these services are government-provided, there is data captured on both the caregiver and the care recipient (or patient) that can address the effectiveness of the support provided and received.</p>
<p>The Scotland model reminds us that diagnosis can serve as launching point for referral to information, resources, and caregiver supports. While our long-term care system is not as robust, there are existing community, private, and government resources that could help the newly diagnosed. For example, diagnosis could activate referrals to: disease-specific advocacy organizations; information about the National Family Caregiver Support Program and Lifespan Respite program; or information about family and medical leave or other workplace supports.</p>
<p>To the larger point at hand, Scotland's Focus on Dementia is an example of what we could learn from other nations. Groups like the Global CEO Initiative, the Global Dementia Framework, and caregiving groups like the International Alliance of Carers Organizations can offer insight into the issues this council is currently wrestling with.</p>
<p>Second, I would encourage the council to prioritize a national Care and Support Summit. It has been acknowledged by academic experts and drug innovators alike that we are still many years from a disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's and dementia. While we work towards research that will improve our future, there remains unmet needs now. Please remember the needs of families who are caring for individuals with dementia in our midst and the costs inherent in their contribution such as lost income, foregone retirement, and worsened health.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like you to join the Alliance and the Alzheimer's Foundation of America in an ongoing social media discussion during November on brain health and brain screenings. #TalkBrainHealth is an educational campaign to encourage family caregivers to talk with their families about brain screenings for older adults over the holiday season. We will be sharing a one pager that can be used as "talking points" for caregivers of older adults to discuss brain health and the role of screenings, which draws from key resources like the Institute of Medicine report on cognitive aging. More information is available at <a href="http://www.caregiving.org/talkbrainhealth">http://www.caregiving.org/talkbrainhealth</a> or you can find us on Twitter at #TalkBrainHealth.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your time and for your continued commitment to the people and families living with dementia.</p>

<p>Hello. My name is Matthew Sharp. I am the Program Manager for The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (or AFTD). I would like to take today's focus on the related dementias as an opportunity to share some more details about the work AFTD does and the resources and information available to help people living or working with FTD understand this complex disease and connect with others for help and support.</p>
<p>But first I want to acknowledge the time and attention given to the Related Dementias today and express AFTD's gratitude to this morning's speakers, for sharing their time, knowledge and expertise. Opportunities to hear from expert physicians with experience diagnosing and treating people with FTD or LBD are nearly as rare as these related dementias are. AFTD recognizes the council's commitment to understand the related dementias and appreciates the efforts made to find and invite this morning's speakers to today's meeting.</p>
<p>AFTD is a small, but growing, non-profit disease advocacy organization based outside of Philadelphia. We were founded in 2002 in order to support people living and working with FTD, provide current and accurate information about the disease and caring for a loved-one, and promote and support medical research to develop effective treatments and ultimately find a cure for FTD.</p>
<p>AFTD supports clinical and basic science research on FTD through a Pilot Grant program and a Post-doctoral Fellowship. We also offer a drug discovery grant in collaboration with the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) to accelerate and support innovative drug discovery programs and biomarker development for FTD. Our newest grant program, currently in development, will support an Economic Burden Study on FTD, to look at the toll FTD imposes across many levels of society and provide objective information to clarify the real costs of the disease.</p>
<p>AFTD is also excited to be one of the primary advocacy organizations involved with The Advancing Research and Treatment for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ARTFL) consortium. With funding awarded through NIH last fall, the ARTFL consortium will join advocacy organizations like AFTD together with academic research centers for the purpose of conducting clinical trials in FTD. The ARTFL consortium is, without a doubt, the most exciting and hopeful FTD research projects ever and AFTD is honored to be involved.</p>
<p>In addition to promoting research AFTD is dedicated to helping anyone coping with FTD find the support, information and resources needed to maintain as high a quality of life as possible for both themselves and their loved-ones. AFTD's website offers up-to-date and reliable information about the disease and appropriate care, and we will send printed material to anyone who requests it. All the medical information on the site is reviewed by expert physicians and neurologists from our Medical Advisory Board (which includes Dr. Lippa) and is updated as needed to reflect the progress being made by research on FTD and related neurological diseases. We also include regional listings of medical centers in the US (plus a few in Canada) with a special interest in FTD research. These centers offer diagnostic expertise for anyone worried about having FTD as well as opportunities for people with FTD to participate in clinical trials or other types of medical research. Whenever possible we include the name and contact information of the individual to follow-up with to enroll in a research study, schedule an appointment for a diagnostic evaluation, or access other services that may be available. I am pleased to report that we currently struggling to come up with the best way to respond to medical centers and neurological practices that ASK US to be listed on the website. For the first decade or so of AFTD's life we faced the opposite problem and didn't know enough centers doing FTD research as we would like to list on the website. And while there are still some large sections of the country without any specialized medical resources for FTD this is definitely a good problem to have and another sign of progress.</p>
<p>In addition to the website, the primary point of contact for people to learn more about the resources available from AFTD is our Helpline. The Helpline is not "live" but people may call (toll-free) or email the Helpline as needed with questions or concerns and an AFTD staff member will respond as soon as possible. On average, AFTD staff respond to about 40 Helpline cases per week, and provide answers and information, help finding necessary services or connecting to others for support, as well as material and resources as requested. If we cannot answer a question or find a resource we will try to connect callers to someone who can. While fewer than in the past, there are still too many Helpline calls for which we can only offer our time to listen with a sympathetic ear. It is our sincere hope that the number of these cases will continue to decrease as awareness spreads and resources grow, but, nothing else AFTDs Helpline still provides a doorway through which people struggling with FTD can connect to a growing network of caregivers, people with the disease, and knowledgeable professionals for help and support.</p>
<p>Thanks again for this opportunity to describe the resources available through AFTD, as well as the interest and attention given to FTD today. The Councils continued commitment to including the related dementias in the work and scope of NAPA is deeply appreciated.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Statement of:<br />
					Ian N. Kremer, Esq.<br />
					Executive Director<br />
					Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD Coalition)</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon. My name is Ian Kremer and I serve as executive director of Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (the LEAD Coalition). The LEAD Coalition is a diverse and growing national coalition of 76 member organizations [<a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/">http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/</a>] including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, home and residential care providers, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. LEAD is co-convened by the Alzheimer's Foundation of America and USAgainstAlzheimer's. The coalition works collaboratively to focus the nation's strategic attention on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and to accelerate transformational progress in: detection and diagnosis; care and support to enrich quality of life; and research leading to prevention, effective treatment and eventual cure. For more information about the LEAD Coalition, please contact me at: ikremer@leadcoalition.org.</p>
<p>Typically, my public comments at the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services meetings are based on what has been presented and discussed by Advisory Council members to that point in the meeting day. In light of the recent request for comments to be submitted several days in advance of the meeting, this document submitted on July 22 attempts to anticipate what I might wish to say on July 27. I hope that the Advisory Council will forgive me any extemporaneous remarks that I might offer during the public comment session on July 27.</p>
<p>I must begin by recognizing HHS staff and Secretary Burwell for the recently published <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease: 2015 Update</em> [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/NatlPlan2015.shtml">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/NatlPlan2015.shtml</a>]. The 2015 Update reflects enormous good work done to date and constructive work being planned. It is particularly valuable that the 2015 Update reminds us all that the National Alzheimer's Project Act called for a 'national' rather than 'federal' plan. While many of us outside government will continue to call for even more robust federal efforts in a number of areas (including and particularly areas in which the 2015 Update appears to come up short of the Advisory Council's recommendations), it is essential that those of us in the private sector continue to look for ways in which we can collaborate with federal partners and work to fill gaps in federal efforts. Exemplary of productive collaboration between private and federal partners is the recently announced launch of the Dementia Friendly America initiative [<a href="http://www.dfamerica.org/">http://www.dfamerica.org/</a>] to build dementia friendly communities across the country. More than 50 national organizations and several federal agencies have worked together closely to reach this starting point. Our success depends on that collaboration growing more robust, more imbedded in the organizational cultures of our public and private partners, and on us sustaining our moral and substantive commitment to be guided in our work by those who rightly measure our results: people with dementia and their loved ones whose quality of life we seek to transform. National organizations interested in learning more about the Dementia Friendly America initiative are encouraged to contact us at: partners@dfamerica.org.</p>
<p>I also want to take a moment to thank the organizers, sponsors, attendees, presenters, and journalists reporting on last week's Alzheimer's Association International Conference [<a href="https://www.alz.org/aaic/">https://www.alz.org/aaic/</a>]. It isn't enough that important science be conducted. It must be exposed to scrutiny, put in context, disseminated among colleagues, and understood by those who fund, who volunteer, who stand to benefit. Children wonder how Santa delivers all those packages in a single night; I wonder how Maria Carrillo herds 4,000 scientists for a week. Somehow -- perhaps with the help of Alzheimer's Association elves -- magic happens and we're all the better for it.</p>
<p>Today's Advisory Council meeting focus on non-Alzheimer's dementias [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/meetings.shtml#Jul2015">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/meetings.shtml#Jul2015</a>] -- while overdue -- is highly encouraging. I hope it represents a sustained commitment both to discuss and to substantively address these issues more consistently in the Advisory Council and National Plan Update processes. Certainly, the upcoming ADRD Summit organized by NINDS provides another important pivot point for the Advisory Council and Plan Update processes to engage non-Alzheimer's dementias more effectively.</p>
<p>While we all ought to be sympathetic to the limitations of time and other resources available to the Advisory Council, to make the Plan genuinely 'national' and not only 'federal,' it is essential to find creative, manageable and productive ways to add more -- and more diverse -- voices. A number of us have encouraged expansion of the Advisory Council to include both more appointees living with dementia and more representatives from non-Alzheimer's dementia communities. Those remain good, constructive, and achievable recommendations; as private sector stakeholders, we are ready to work with our federal partners to achieve the achievable. Similarly, I would encourage collaboration between private sector stakeholders and our federal partners to find new and better ways for people to participate in the Advisory Council process even if they are unable to attend the quarterly meetings in Washington or do not want to be limited to submitting written comments or watching a live-streaming video. While those options may be sufficient for some, clearly they are inadequate for many. Just to offer one example (and I have others), with support from private sector stakeholders, it ought to possible to conduct regularly scheduled public input listening sessions around the country, attended by Advisory Council members either in person or at least by video feed who then could report back to the full Advisory Council.</p>
<p>This is a time of great and deserved hope in dementia. No one could miss the depth and breadth of attention devoted to dementia throughout the White House Conference on Aging (thank you Nora Super, AARP, and everyone else who led and contributed). We all anticipate anxiously NIH's so-called "bypass budget" [<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/features/nih-estimate-total-funding-needs-alzheimers-research">https://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/features/nih-estimate-total-funding-needs-alzheimers-research</a>] recommendation for federal funding needed to reach the 2025 goal. The advocacy and research communities have been vigorous in encouraging NIH to be bold in its recommendation and take confidence in the legislation put forward by the House and Senate appropriations committees along with the 21st Century Cures legislation. Shortly after the Advisory Council's last meeting, 137 LEAD Coalition member organizations and other supporters submitted to HHS a recommendation that federal agencies and private sector stakeholders partner to organize and conduct a dementia care and services research summit [<a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/?wpfb_dl=158">http://www.leadcoalition.org/?wpfb_dl=158</a>]. HHS recently responded that Secretary Burwell will ask the Advisory Council for guidance so -- on behalf of those 137 signatories -- I'll take this opportunity to encourage the Advisory Council to advise the Secretary to be bold in collaborating with us to identify research gaps and priorities as well as opportunities to translate and scale what we know already to be effective in improving the quality of life for the most important stakeholders: people living with dementia and their care partners. And in the best interests of those most important stakeholders, we will begin now with our private sector partners to develop the resources necessary to conduct such a summit as soon as our federal partners are ready to join us.</p>
<p>The need for wide dissemination of effective care and services interventions is highlighted in part by the recently released report <em>Caregiving in the U.S. 2015</em> [<a href="http://www.caregiving.org/caregiving2015/">http://www.caregiving.org/caregiving2015/</a>]. I would encourage the Advisory Council to invite Gail Hunt from the National Alliance for Caregiving and Susan Reinhard from AARP to provide a briefing about the report at an upcoming Advisory Council meeting, with a particular focus on care involving people with dementia.</p>
<p>In closing, I offer my apologies for topics I have failed to address and my thanks to others making public comments addressing my omissions. I offer my appreciation to Advisory Council members and staff who give of their minds and hearts beyond what words can express. I offer my hope to all those living with dementia and their loved ones that they will be heard, heeded, and healed through the work we all do together.</p>

<p>Good afternoon. My name is Grace Whiting and I am the Director of Strategic Partnerships at the National Alliance for Caregiving. I appreciate the opportunity today to share some new research on family caregiving and to offer insight from the caregiving community. Thank you for giving me this time.</p>
<p>As you may know, the National Alliance for Caregiving was founded in 1996 by AARP, the American Society on Aging, the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, the National Council on Aging, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and our CEO, Gail Gibson Hunt. Currently, more than forty organizations are in our membership, all of whom support our mission to elevate the national conversation on family caregiving through research, innovation, and advocacy. Under Ms. Hunt's leadership, we conduct public policy research, support the development of state and local caregiving coalitions in the U.S., and convene an international coalition dedicated to caregiving issues across the globe.</p>
<p>As part of that mission, we conduct a report every five years with AARP on the state of caregiving in the United States. The 2015 edition of this report provides quantitative data on 1,248 family caregivers who currently provide or provided within the last year, unpaid support to a loved one. I have shared copies of the Executive Summary with each of you and the full study can be found at <a href="http://www.caregiving.org/caregiving2015">http://www.caregiving.org/caregiving2015</a>.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to this community are the findings related to caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's or dementia. Twenty two percent (22%) of America's 43.5 million family caregivers support a loved one with this disease, either as the primary reason for care or a secondary diagnosis. Those who provide care to someone with Alzheimer's, dementia, or other mental confusion often provide support for a variety of tasks, including helping with (on average) 2.2 Activities of Daily Living (such as bathing and dressing), 4.6 Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (such as running errands or managing finances), and medical or nursing tasks (such as wound care and giving injections). These caregivers are more likely than the average caregiver to help with other key activities such as monitoring health, advocating on behalf of the person with dementia, or communicating with health care and other service providers.</p>
<p>This care, although unpaid, does not come without cost. Dementia caregivers are more likely than others to have difficulty performing ADLs and medical/nursing tasks. Half report high emotional stress, and many say caregiving has adversely affected their own health. Typically, the dementia caregiver is a 53 year old who expects to continue providing care over the next five years, well into the time most begin preparing for their own retirement.</p>
<p>Likewise, other research has shown that the family caregiver's health declines as the care recipient's dementia advances. Caregivers have their own health and wellness needs that must be met to keep the person with dementia safe. This is not just a retread of what we already know but a fact that bears repeating, as projections about the availability of family caregivers by mid-century show that we face a "caregiving cliff." There are a declining number of family caregivers for every person who needs care. And we know that today, in 2015, nearly a third of caregivers across all disease states are doing more than their "fair share", providing an average of 62.2 hours each week providing care at no small personal cost. The issue of inadequate supply of family caregivers and growing demand will only worsen as family size in the U.S. continues to shrink and families continue to live apart at long-distances.</p>
<p>Other advocates in this space have urged this body to consider new solutions in care and support and we would second those recommendations. We would offer to be a resource where we can be helpful to this council and future members. Additionally, we would urge this body to continue identifying how new technologies and innovations can support caregivers and to look toward the example set by the Department of Veterans Affairs' Caregiver Support Program. New strategies need strong leadership, and we ask that this body continue to remember the needs of those families who are caring for individuals with dementia. Thank you.</p>

<p>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>Again, I want to commend the Council on its recommendations to "prepare a workforce that is competent to deliver care to persons with advanced dementia and their families." This, seemingly, was included in the 2015 Plan Update under Goal 2, Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care . Specifically, I think the information presented in several sections about the positive impact of the Geriatric Education Centers (GECs) highlights the great work that these institutes have achieved. As I mentioned in previous comments to this Council, the National Certification Board for Alzheimer Care (NCBAC) was encouraged that there would be a greater focus placed on the "training and education of the direct care workforce and lay/family caregivers".</p>
<p>As many of you know, HHS and HRSA announced on Monday at the White House Conference On Aging a new program that would do away with these GECs and replace them with a new 3-year round of funding entitled "Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program" (GWEP). I want to draw attention to the fact that this newly-announced funding has excluded many of the current GECs. Two cases in point: South Florida, with its 1.5 million residents aged 65 and older, which includes approximately 215,600 residents, and their care partners, who are believed to have Alzheimer's Disease or a related dementia, will no longer have access to educational funding through GWEP. Additionally, the State of Georgia, no longer will receive funding for its residents through the new GWEP funding. There are many other areas of the country that will not have access to funding for geriatric and Alzheimer/dementia education.</p>
<p>I bring this up so that this Council is aware that although there is an increase in annual funding to $35 million for workforce training, of which around $3.3 million annually was awarded for dementia education, the inequity of how the awards were granted according to geographic locations is <strong>puzzling</strong>. Less states and regions received funding. In total 23 of the currently funded GECs did not receive funding from the GWEP funding. I hope that the numbers of healthcare professionals and consumers served that were included in the 2015 Update will continue to improve for the 2016 Update, but I'm afraid the Administration will be forced to put an asterisk after these numbers stating that not all areas of the country benefitted from the GWEP funding.</p>
<p>Thank you, again, for the dedication that each of you brings to this devastating disease, of which the numbers are growing from a national and global perspective. I hope that one day there won't be a need to have these meetings because Alzheimer's disease and related dementias will be health concerns of the past!</p>

<p>What are we waiting for? This was just shared with me in a news article. Why does it take so long for us to just make the awareness? They had put this together in such a short time. We just keep talking. It's time to take action.</p>
<p>One million Dementia Friends The biggest ever social action movement to change perceptions of dementia happened on 21st February, celebrating creating one million Dementia Friends. Just over two years since it was launched, Alzheimer's Society's Dementia Friends programmeis now transforming the way the nation thinks, talks and acts about the condition. Dementia Friends is one of the many ways that Alzheimer's Society is changing the lives of people with dementia for the better. As well as the development of Dementia Friendly Communities, the charity has committed to spend £100 million on research into care, prevention and a cure over the next 10 years. With nearly two thirds of people with dementia experiencing loneliness and almost half reporting to have lost friends after their diagnosis, Dementia Friends was launched in February 2013 to tackle the stigma and lack of understanding which means that many people with the condition can face social exclusion. The initiative, which is jointly run with Public Health England and funded by the Cabinet Office and Department of Health, combines face to face Information Sessions and online videos to help people learn more about dementia and the small things they can do to make a difference.</p>
<p>This was from another section.<br />
					Creating a dementia-friendly generation Young people can play an important role in the creation of dementia-friendly communities. Not only do a third of young people know someone with dementia, but they are the leaders, employers, researchers, carers and adults of tomorrow. Increasing young people's awareness can help reduce stigma and help people to live well with dementia now and in the future. Alzheimer's Society is encouraging all schools and youth groups to include dementia awareness in their activities, to help us create a dementia-friendly generation. The new</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>NATIONAL PLAN GOALS: TIME TO MAKE THEM HAPPEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>I. NAPA Accomplishments </strong></p>
<p>Since the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease was first released,<sup>1</sup> there has been progress in establishing a cohesive and comprehensive national strategy to fight the illness. Strides have been made in federal agency interaction and coordination, increasing educational materials and outreach and promoting awareness through social and traditional media. National action has spurred movement at the state level and a vast majority of states now have their own plans to coordinate resources and services, often resulting in dynamic care delivery programs that provide better outcomes at lower costs.</p>
<p>Yet, more must - and needs - to be done. Many of the action steps taken have required little resources. While it's a start, these are merely low-hanging fruit and the heavy lifting remains. In addition to increased federal resources, we need better tools are needed to ensure early and accurate diagnosis of dementia. New, coordinated care delivery models that are more efficient and yield better outcomes must be adopted nationally. States need to be more fully engaged and the US needs to further its commitment to international efforts.</p>
<p>As the NAPA Advisory Board continues its work, we must move beyond the edges of policy. While the national Alzheimer's plan established lofty, but achievable goals, sufficient resources are needed if we are to make real progress in eradicating this devastating brain disorder and developing a cure or meaningful treatment by 2025. Further, federal health programs need to remove barriers to access and recognize the growing need for custodial and long-term care services and supports for individuals living with dementia and their family caregivers.</p>
<p>Solutions are readily available to reduce costs of care while promoting better outcomes for individuals with dementia and their family caregivers. The national Alzheimer's plan already contains a number of such recommendations, which, if implemented could save significant resources. In addition national stakeholders, including the Alzheimer's Foundation of America (AFA), have contributed constructive comments, ideas and proposals for the NAPA Advisory Board to consider when developing their annual report for HHS.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>AFA would like to build upon these past proposals and offer the following new recommendations to further the process and ensure implementation of the national Alzheimer's plan on a credible pathway toward achieving its core objectives. These new proposals, moreover, are not costly, can be quickly implemented and will have an immediate, positive impact in achieving the objectives of the national Alzheimer's plan. They include:</p>
<ul><li>Calling on CMS to develop and execute a timeline in which they will nationally adopt and broadly implement innovative care delivery models.</li>
<li>Encouraging states to develop their own Alzheimer's plans and increase states' involvement in the national Alzheimer's plan.</li>
<li>Promoting and expanding opportunities for cognitive memory screening.</li>
<li>Increasing the federal commitment to international efforts fighting Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Increasing resources for Alzheimer's disease research and caregiver supports and services.</li>
</ul><p><strong>II. AFA Recommendations </strong></p>
<p>Adopting innovative care delivery models, expanding transitional care programs, and expanding caregiver supports can reduce hospitalizations, decrease emergency room visits and delay costly nursing home placement.</p>
<p>As outlined in AFA's "Cost of Care: Quantifying Care-Centered Provisions of the 'National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease" report,<sup>3</sup> recommendations such as medical homes and enhanced caregiver training and supports, will provide significant cost savings--more than $110 billion during a 10-year period--while promoting better health outcomes for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, and improving quality of life for their caregivers.</p>
<p>An independent study of a Minnesota dementia caregiver program found that, if fully implemented, the program would save the state nearly $1 billion over 15 years,<sup>4</sup> further underscoring the findings of AFA's "Cost of Care" report.</p>
<p>In the coming year, CMS is expected to release data from demonstration projects, including several involving dementia care delivery models. This should provide the necessary evidence for federal health programs to move ahead with alacrity to implement such programs nationwide. As demonstrated in Minnesota, small investments in supports that provide caregiver tools and strategies yields major savings and better outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>AFA, therefore, urges the NAPA Advisory Board to recommend that CMS develop and execute a timeline in which they will nationally adopt and broadly implement the innovative care models and enhanced caregiver support recommendations that are included in the national Alzheimer's plan. </strong></p>
<p>In an effort to help advance the goals of the national Alzheimer's plan at the state level, the National Alliance for Caregiving and AFA released a white paper that examines the scope of the Alzheimer's crisis, and the need for wide-scale implementation of state plans that address supportive services specific to state localities.<sup>5</sup> The report offers six key recommendations, applicable to both new and existing state plans:</p>
<ul><li>Establish and maintain a task force of Alzheimer's disease stakeholders, including government officials, community groups, individuals with dementia, and family caregivers.</li>
<li>Assess the ability of the state Alzheimer's disease community to support diagnosed individuals and their families.</li>
<li>Develop a state plan for Alzheimer's disease that includes goals specific to the state population, and outlines measures to track progress.</li>
<li>Keep stakeholders engaged in the design, implementation and evaluation of the plan.</li>
<li>Recognize that state plans are "living documents," and modify them, as appropriate, over time.</li>
<li>Learn from the successes and challenges of other states and the national plan.<sup>6</sup></li>
</ul><p>States are the often called the laboratory of democracy<sup>7</sup> and their freedom to innovate, customize and target policy can produce effective models, some of which can be replicated on both state and federal levels. Yet, there is no process or forum to share successes, discuss failures and identify gaps in policy. There needs to be greater communication, not only between states, but between states and the NAPA Advisory Board so federal officials can be keyed into valuable input from their efforts.</p>
<p><strong>AFA urges further encouragement of states to develop their own plans, increase states' involvement with the NAPA Advisory Board and establish a forum within the National Governors Association or National Council on State Legislatures for states to share best practices and successful recommendations with their peers. </strong></p>
<p>Misdiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is already rampant, leading to unnecessary costs and, most importantly, risks to individuals. Memory screening is necessary, therefore to ensure a timely and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. With early detection, individuals with dementia can receive available therapy earlier in the disease progression when most available treatments for Alzheimer's disease are most helpful. Early identification allows optimal therapy with available and emerging medications.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), moreover, is focusing more clinical research on individuals earlier in the disease process. AFA can appreciate the difficulty in developing meaningful diagnostic criteria for preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Yet, cognitive screening can help identify pre-symptomatic individuals and others with mild cognitive impairment who can populate these necessary and vital drug trials that give hope to millions with dementia.</p>
<p>Despite these advantages, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has failed to recognize cognitive screening as necessary for older adults.<sup>8</sup> While USPSTF found adequate evidence that some screening tools have sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful in identifying dementia, they found inadequate direct evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment and of non-pharmacologic interventions.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Memory screening is gaining ground thanks to increased awareness about Alzheimer's disease, as well as the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, which includes a cognitive assessment.<sup>10</sup> In addition, during AFA's 2014 National Memory Screening Day this past November, more than 6,000 sites across the country provided free confidential screenings, as well as education on good brain health, to tens of thousands of participants.</p>
<p><strong>AFA urges the NAPA Advisory Board to further promote and expand opportunities for memory screening. The NAPA Advisory Board should call for more research on cognitive screening and its impact on individual care choices and identify new technologies that can test and track cognitive functioning. </strong></p>
<p>There has been considerable movement in the worldwide effort to fight Alzheimer's disease. Since the G8 Summit held in London in late 2013, there has been a more coordinated international effort in combating dementia. The G-7 has committed to identifying a cure or a disease modifying therapy by 2025 and to increase funding for dementia research.<sup>11</sup> To this end, international policy makers have met at various legacy meetings throughout 2014 (with more scheduled in 2015, including a meeting in February at NIH). In addition, Dr. Dennis Gillings, consultant to the pharmaceutical industry and founder of a drug trial, has been appointed by the UK Prime Minister as the World Dementia Envoy.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>As a leader in Alzheimer's disease research, the US needs to continue its commitment to these international organizations. The sharing of research data, best practices and study results will speed drug development and help achieve the shared 2025 goal. The NAPA Advisory Board acknowledges this need and, in the past year, has heard from international Alzheimer's advocates and has been briefed on worldwide efforts.</p>
<p><strong>It is imperative, therefore, that the 2015 NAPA Advisory Board recommendations include greater commitment to these international efforts. In addition, representatives of the State Department be invited to join the NAPA Advisory Board. </strong></p>
<p>Without adequate resources, getting to the 2025 NAPA goal will be arduous and success will be put in doubt. Investment in promising research is imperative to meet these ambitious, yet achievable goals. Despite the need, spending on Alzheimer's disease research lags far behind research resources spent on other major diseases. In FY 2013, the National Institutes for Health (NIH) spent approximately $504 million for Alzheimer's disease, while $5.2 billion went to cancer research; $2.9 billion for HIV/AIDS; $2 billion for cardiovascular disease; $1.2 billion for heart disease; and more than $1 billion for diabetes.<sup>13</sup> Without the same commitment for Alzheimer's disease, costs will continue to rise at unprecedented rates, promising research will remain unfunded, and hope will be diminished for the millions living with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>The NAPA Advisory Board needs to recommend Congress "double down" on Alzheimer's disease research to $1 billion in FY'16 and work with appropriating committees in Congress on a pathway to get Alzheimer's disease research funding at $2 billion by the end of the current decade. </strong></p>
<p><strong>III. Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>These are challenging times, and limited resources call for creative solutions. Yet, we cannot simply maintain the status quo. Investment in research and caregiving services is the only way to ensure that we, as a nation, can overcome the growing human and fiscal crisis that is Alzheimer's disease. An international, comprehensive and coordinated effort is needed to combat the growing worldwide crisis of dementia impacting individuals and families regardless of race, creed, color or national origin.</p>
<p>The recent worldwide effort against Ebola can be instructive in developing a strategy that can contain and ultimately defeat the disease. In the case of Ebola, after an initial period of unpreparedness, economically advantaged nations took action and developed an international strategy to control the outbreak and develop a vaccine. For its part, the US will spend $5.2 billion in FY'15 alone on care, prevention and development of a viable vaccine to fight Ebola. While it is far from certain whether this current Ebola outbreak can be contained; the international commitment to adequately respond to the crisis, with proper initial resources, cannot be questioned.</p>
<p>Unlike Ebola, however, we know we are facing a growing worldwide dementia crisis and its impact on society is arguably greater. The national Alzheimer's plan sets a stage and provides guideposts and impactful endpoints. Yet, the missing piece is the necessary investment that can change trajectory of this disease and transform outcomes. Progress has already been made in several areas of the plan and some modest goals have been completed, yet we are nowhere near the ultimate prize of finding a treatment or cure, and our time to meet the 2025 goal is ticking away. Now is our time to make it happen, or chances are it never will.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Based on the question I believe I was asked by George, I decided to expand on it since I may have not painted the right picture an may have rambled a bit. I will share to attached documents that have been edited for me. This email will be completely unedited and you will see firsthand how my writhing and word finding has been impacted. I decided to give you an idea on what is like for me to plan and be at NAPA.</p>
<p>It all starts almost at the end of one of the meetings. I need to add it to my outlook otherwise I may forget about it. Once I get that information I will probably check it 3 or 4 different times just to insure I entered it right. I cannot begin to tell you how I want to select a certain date and instead I choose the wrong on. I can tell you I cannot understand that as I was such a perfections.</p>
<p>As we get closer to the date I search for hotels that I can get a better rate. I cannot begin to tell what burden it cost this is to me. My wife and I are not always in agreement in doing this and I feel so guilty of spending the money. When I final find a hotel I give the information to my wife to do the booking. I am so afraid that I will do something wrong or even book the wrong date or even misunderstand what they tell me. At one time in my life I would have made this trip all in the same day even though it would have been exhausting. Now days because of my location and in order to be of useful when I attend I need to arrive the night before so I am not stressed out. I am a little without the drive already. When I am finished the meeting I am so stressed and over whelmed that I would truly be a risk of driving all that way. My head feels like it is in the clouds and so unclear. I cannot begin to tell you how I need to unwind an relax after the meeting. It may be easier to possibly take the trains to get there but that would add to the cost and so much more confusion to me to try to interconnect with the trains and find the different ways to get to them from one train to the other and on time. I know this may be hard to understand as it is for me who once traveled regularly this way but when you cannot find the signs and get lost finding room numbers in a build then you would understand what all those other things do to you and the amount of pressure and stress it creates. ( on a separate note. I went to one of the congress buildings with a room number. I must have spent over a half hour or more trying to find it. I keep asking people to point me to it but somehow I just kept missing it. I cannot begin to tell you why. Thank god I finally ran in to someone that I knew and I asked them if they could personally take me there. I cannot begin to tell you how embarrassed I felt that I could not find my own way and do something so simple. Even with asking for people to point me I could not get there. It is even hard for me to understand why I cannot do that. That is why I am terrified these days to travel the trains, airports and metros but I will If I have to. I just know that it may have some issues along the way, Just hope they are not costly. I do real hat that to because I was so cost conscious in my life so that creates another level of stress)</p>
<p>As we get a month out I try to recall what new issues need to be addressed that may be important. Not necessary related to your topic. That would be tomuch to even begin to figure out. I also hat to be repetitive as so many tell me I should be. I believe you are all smart people and get it the first time. I cannot begin to tell you what pressure it si to try to stay within your time frame and I am not even sure I can even figure that out. I usually come up with so many topics and must limit it because of the time. I really have trouble prioritizing any more. To me they are all important. I believe part of the problem is in order to do that one needs to use executive functions that I no longer have or capable of using. I do believe they are there, just some broken path to the highway. And I do have the thought an times but just cannot seem to get them into words because as I try to think of what I am thinking to translate it stress me out that I forget what I am trying to write. It is crazy by far. It like I can only handle one task at a time and anything else is overload to me. Go figure, people say I had one of the most stressful jobs in my career and I thrived on it while others could not keep up with me or even handle it. It is so hard to write these days because I cannot remember what I said in the previous sentence. In fact as I write as sentence I make so many errors and by the time I go back at the end of the sentence to reread it I have so much difficulty trying to even know what the words were that I was using just for that sentence. I can take so much time trying to do that part. As I right and all I can say is thank good for Word. I can assure you if that did not exist today I would have died by now. It takes what I can no longer spell and make sense of it for me. Not always sure it using the write words. Sometimes my spelling is so bad and I cannot even being now to even spell the word for it to even help, so frustrating.</p>
<p>Now after probably many days of working on my speech I sent it to Emma Steel who is my editor all the way in the UK. She is the only person I could find that was willing to help volunteer her time. I had reached out to so many local like high schools, colleges and no one would give me just a little time to help in editing my work, not even a friend who was teacher who said she is to busy to help. All I wanted was one or two things a month. So many people offer there help but when it comes down to asking them for it they don't . Very frustrating for one that always help others when they were in need. I need it now so badly just the be heard as I am slowly losing my abilities and there is no one there for me. While I ask my wife on some It so much for her to handle as I have already added to burned on her already.</p>
<p>Emma does such a beautiful job especially with the poor information I give her. I could not even image what it must be like for her because I cannot even figure it out and I wrote it. Takes a special kind of person. She does all this from the goodness of her heart and I am demanding at times.</p>
<p>When I get the work back some time we need to go back a few time because some of points may not be there with the passion I like to put in this. Many times I just settle just because it's not worthy of the added work I would need to place on her and don't want to make her feel bad. Sometimes I amy go to someone else to help in order to get it closer to where I feel it should be. To many times in my writing I go over board and they all tell me to tone it down which I do many times but I have learned in life that on very important issues you need to be very direct if you want something done and it may need to be unpleasant if you tell the truth. While you folks my not believe it I hate it every time I must say something negative to you. It does hurt me inside and I continuously think about it as it may possible jeopardize the relationship we have. This works on me from before the meeting to weeks later. Even more because when I speak there are no comments made to even get a sense to how you feel. Any way once I final get my speech I send it to two trusted individuals who are in the dementia arena for guidance. Based on their comments I may change or remove something. I always want to insure I get it right since I may no longer be the best judge for that. These people have been extremely important to me in making all this possible.</p>
<p>If everything is okay with the speech then I need to get it ready so I can read it. First I change the font size to 18. Then I need to place unusual spacing in there so I can continue to read it and so I can stay focused. If I do not do this the words all look like they are shifting. I have trouble f keeping track of whereI am and if the font is to small I see the entire page of data coming at me as one, and cannot focus on a simple word. This what I have been able to figure out to help me cope and to be able to continue.</p>
<p>A few day before the meeting I must write an agenda of the places I need to be it with the complete address information. I will check that over at least 3-4 times to insure I did not error. If I am to meet with someone and have a phone number I will ask my wife to added to the cell phone so I have it in the memory. I can no longer do that. Kind of strange for someone who was responsible for Data and Voice for 70,000 people and was always a gadget person. I have become fearful of much of technology because I struggle to use it and cannot remember the mistakes I make so I don't do them again.</p>
<p>The day of or night before I need to get ready and pack what I need. I really rely on my wife to do much of it any more as I cannot keep it straight and remember what I need or packed. It also seems that I lost the ability to kind of plan to organize ahead matching cloths which I was once very good at. I would have never allowed my wife to just select something and be okay with it. I try to place as much as possible in the car as soon as possible so I don't have to many things I need to worry about when I leave. I even add my wallet to by brief case because I have ben know to forget it recently.</p>
<p>The day I leave I need to insure I am not in one of those days that my mind is all foggy. If that happens I would probably need to cancel the trip because I would not be able to drive that long under those conditions. I worry about that for while till I get on the long stretches of high way. When I do start out in my car I add the address to my GPS. From that point on till I get there I am on autopilot and following what it tells me to do. I don't always understand so I may take the wrong turn but the great thing about it is it will recalculate and get me there no matter how many mistakes I may make. Cannot even image what life would be like without it. I never even needed a map before. It was like I had built in GPS. While I am driving I am using ever once of energy that I have to try to stay focused and alert to what I am doing and the road and cars around me. I cannot begin to tell the amount of stress that is created when I drive now days. While I drive good it takes so much energy to do it. I feel like I am leaving my finger prints embedded in the steering wheel. I pretty much tune out everything else. Since I consecrate so much on the road, I sometimes have difficulty in following the road signs following on where to turn but that is okay because I have learned to not panic or get upset as much. That is the worst thing when can do with this disease is get stressed out because it leads to a serious snowball effect that can really make the mind go into a cloud and so unable to think. That is probably the most important think one can teach us. Not to panic and remain calm. I believe if we can master that it will go a long way. While I have driven to DC so many times it would sure be nice to look at place on the road as a landmark so I can gage about how close or far I am. Many place I see appear like I seen them while others look so new to me and cannot even understand. Sometimes all of a sudden I thing I know where I am going to only realize I am confusing it with some other road or place and it had nothing to do with where I am headed.</p>
<p>I was once the person that waited to run on fumes in the car before getting gas. Today I start to panic as I head to DC because I have gotten caught in paying super high prices for gas because I went to the wrong location. I still had tree bars but concerned of not being able to find the next gas station because I cannot follow directions. Because of that today I now try to fill up before Dc and I still pay more that I would like to but I do so many other stupid things to day that just keep adding to my cost of living because of lack of memory. It amazing how much one needsit and how we take it for granted until you lose it. When I final get there it is such a sense of relief to be able to check into the hotel. I call my wife to let her know I got there. Sometimes she calls me as in this last time because it took me much longer to get there and she was wondering why. Lots of traffic. In the hotel it can be easy or embarrassing when you need to fill the form out. I may not remember the type of car I have or even how to spell it. I do get my address wrong from time to time now. I usually don't understand all they tell me with their instruction on the internet and all the other things they say. I almost need a hotel for dummies on a piece of paper to read as I needed for what they tell me. Then I go to park my car which some time is challenge. I try to use the handicap spaces because It makes it easier to find, Just need to get to the right level. But as Leave the car and others are around me I feel so guilty by taking that spaces as they see me carrying all this luggage and walk without any issue. It has already happened where I could not find the car, so this method works.</p>
<p>When I get in the room I am very careful to put my items in one or two places in fear that I may lose track of them and forget them. It takes me many hours to finally unwind from that drive. Before I leave the hotel room I go thought some kind of a ritual every time. I feel all my pockets multiple times that I have all what I need. My instructions paper that also has the address, my room key and other things.I probably do this 2 -3 times because I may not remember I did it on unsure. As I am going down the elevator I may be rechecking again. I am not sure if it because I have total lost self confidence in myself or if its I forget I had checked.</p>
<p>Now that it's time for dinner I would like to really go somewhere else, but close to hotel makes it easier since I don't to risk getting lost and don't like driving when its dark. Especially when I am out of my comfort zone. When I return I call my wife to let her know I am safe so she does not worry. I could only imagine what goes through her head when I leave. But she wants me to keep my impendence for as long as I can even if that means there will be issues along the way. Sometimes she may need to guide me of setting up my alarm or the internet on my tablet. I do call the hotel for a wakeup call but like to have a backup in place. That night I try to prepare most of what I need for the next day so I am not forgetting something and to keep my anxiety down. The next morning I am head for my NAPA meeting and of course doing my rituals. I have even more to do because there is so much more I must take with me this time, like brief case with all my information, pens, business card.</p>
<p>This last time it was such a pleasure because someone was kind enough to offer to pick me up from the hotel. If not I would have receive a ride to the metro were I would have difficulty in adding money to the metro card. I really need someone to help me do that. Gas stations is even a problem some times because they are to quick and I am slow at replying. They need an AD mode to select. If I had the card then I only need to wonder if I get to the writ track. People are not so friendly when you are stopping them on the way to work as they are rusting for their train. Oh and the noise in those places really create a problem for me because I cannot filter the sound out so when the person is speak to me which I would have hard time understanding any way and remembering the noise only raise the bar for my failure.</p>
<p>Once I get to the sop if I am lucky to get off at the right one because I find the signs that tell you the stop a bit confusing at times. It's also hard to process as the train is coming into the station to read what is on the walls with the anticipation of trying to get off and all those people around me. Once I do get off it becomes a problem of asking lots of people to guide me so I can find my way at NAPA. I always ask two people because so many send you the wrong way. Not sure why people can just say they don't know.</p>
<p>Now that I made it I start to unwind because all this builds new stress. It makes it challenging going thru the metal detector because I don't always remember what I should remove. When I get up stairs I always feel a bit awkward because I cannot remember people's names and not always even sure of their face. Sometimes I think I met them but I did nt. I never had those issues in the past in fact most were surprised by my recall. I actually look forward to see people with name badges as that helps me a lot. Not that I am always able to read it as I am starting to speak with them. Can not multitask. I was a bit disappointed at this last meeting because they did not use the tags. When the morning gets started I am pretty good. It takes so much energy for me to sit there and try to focus and concentrate on what is being said. It's like using 110 present of all my power during that time. (I know this is hard to relate to but picture a moment in your life were it required full concentration and all your attention to insure you did something right. It feels like you are drained if you did it for a while. That is what happens to me most of my day as I do what most of you just easily cruise through the day) When you folks talk I do not necessarily hear everything you say. Well I guess I do but my mind doe not process it fast enough. So I am constantly trying to fill the gap for missed words and trying to make sense of it all. As I get back from lunch I am stating to feel the drain on my body which is huge by then. That whole afternoon I am fighting so hard to keep my body engaged to continue the process of absorbing what you are saying. I start to lose some of that ability but when topics of real interest come up I do get more out of it. You will me going out more often or standing. I am trying to keep myself calm as I am real having a very difficult time being there at that point. Just try to image that you had to concentrate on one thing all day. This time it was great because you made it so much better because of the technology. I could hear very one because of the new microphone. I cannot being to tell you what an improvement that was for me. Not so much when we lost the projector. I could not follow and had lost of difficulty. In fact those handouts are useless if you cannot even read the print. You may as well save the tress if it cannot be read. When the meeting stops it's like instant relief and I start to unwind. I do like to speak with many of you after. I am okay at that time but still winding down..</p>
<p>The trip back to the hotel is about the same but this time my head is a bit foggy. Ok for a short drive but not long.</p>
<p>The next day when I leave DC I always know I am going to get lost. There are two areas that I keep making mistakes and for the life of me I cannot remember were to go. One day I made the same mistake 3 times. This was during rush hour traffic. Can you image to turn wrong and it takes 20-25 minutes to get back to where you turned wrong original and you still not sure where to turn and turn the same wrong way again. That day I was almost ready to just pull the car off the road and call for help. Lucky something in my mind told me to take a completely different route for a while and this way the GPS final figured out a new way. Talk about frustrations that day. That is why I no longer drive home the same day. It is so much more relaxing to leave DC at 6:30 AM. I just want you to remember because so many of you are thinking why is this guy driving? I and many others who see me drive agree that I do very good. I need to keep an eye on that as I know it won't be long before I can't. But don't confuse ones driving capability to being lost or getting lost. That is hard for many to understand. I have been put in many recent situations where my reaction was needed to avoid any accident and I did better a normal person may have reacted. My wife was in the car. My reactions are still good. They may be slower then they were, but stall faster than many on the road without AD. My biggest fear is to be in an accident and it as absolutely not my fault, but because I have the AD someone may take action to make themselves feel better. After all mydoctor made the recommendation 6 years ago to stop because I would not know the day on my own. Just think how many good years would have been taken away from me. As you can see I did skip a lot from my trip but when I arrive home I finally have this huge sense of relief that I was able to make it to the meeting without any major issues. I continue to wonder if I can make the next or was this the last.</p>
<p>I must tell you I did not even think of all these things being that bad until I wrote this. Is even worse by far when something unexpected happens like getting lost or went down the wrong metro lane. I waste so much time an energy all day long just to correct mistakes.</p>
<p>I do believe I did much better in this wring than usual. I really spend a long time putting this together. About 11 hours and it seemed to be clear headed.</p>
<p><strong>I cannot tell you how please I was that someone asked me a question at the last meeting.</strong></p>
<p>I hope this more of a incite for what it is like to be in my shoes.</p>
<p>I always welcome your questions because that is the only way people will learn.</p>
<p>P.S, Whilethis letter was not edited I did share it with my editor who made the following comment.</p>
<p>Ironically this is the clearest I have seen you write in long time, your spelling is almost spot on, and so is you word usage etc.</p>
<p>Not sure why but I did spend a lot more time on it. I just hope you read it all.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's Disease, My Daughter, and Me</p>
<p>I am not sure how much longer I can take this. I truly miss my daughter, who lives in New York. She is so much closer to home nowadays than she was four years ago. This weekend she decided to come home to visit. While I wanted to have some kind of conversation with her, I struggled and could not seem to figure out what I should say. I am so glad when she is here.</p>
<p>It was Sunday afternoon when my wife said my daughter would be leaving in about 45 minutes so she could catch the bus. They were both sitting at the kitchen table. I felt like I should go there and spend some time with her before she left. So I turned off the TV and sat at the table. I sat for almost 50 minutes and hardly said a word.</p>
<p>That whole time, I kept thinking that I must and need to say something, but I just could not figure out what to say. I felt like crying so many times because I just could not come up with any words. My mind was so empty, without any thoughts. During the last 10 minutes I felt even more pressure to say something, but I had no thoughts in mind nor could I even be creative enough to start a dialogue.</p>
<p>I cannot understand why it is so hard. I can jump in on conversations once in a while to make a comment, but I struggle so much to have some conversations. I really do not believe people understand how painful Alzheimer's disease can be.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes after my wife and daughter left, I began writing this. I was doing everything possible to hold back my tears. Is this what I am becoming or have become?</p>
<p>So many people say to me, "You don't seem like you have Alzheimer's or dementia." I only wish they could see the pain I go through on a daily basis. I am not sure I want to continue down this lonely road much longer. I only wish my daughter remembers me for who I was and not for the person I am becoming.</p>
<p>I love you so much, Jamie, and I wish I could still show it. I am so proud of who you are and have become. I only wish you could feel the same way about me. Just another bad day for me, but it was so wonderful to see you.</p>
<p>I am so fearful that it will become even worse, not that I am sure how that is possible since I did not say much at all.</p>
<p>I pour my heart out to you not for your pity, but for you to do something to change the course of dementia. No one should be forced to deal with this. There are no excuses for doing nothing.</p>

<p>Imagine if you will waking up one morning and going about your daily business, you have had breakfast and are about to leave for work, but you can't remember where you left your keys. Common enough you say; we have all done that at some time or other. Your wife hands you your keys and off you go. Life carries on as normal for a few weeks then one day, while at work you have to call a colleague, but you have inexplicably forgotten his extension number; an extension number you have called numerous times a day for the past 10 years. You feel silly but put it down to being tired. You work hard and hold a high profile position in a financial institution so it is understandable that you will have memory lapses now and again. Like the key incident you laugh it off.</p>
<p>Over the next few months things start to get worse, you are forgetting people's names even though you have worked with them for many years, you are making stupid mistakes at work, you are forgetting to go to meetings, you are finding it really difficult to do the simplest of tasks, you continually forget where you parked the car. Again you are told by friends and colleagues and doctors that it is down to stress; that you need to slow down, maybe take time off etc. But you know there is something wrong, you know that it is more than stress.</p>
<p>So you start keeping a record as best you can and you pester your doctor for answers. One day you get the answer. An answer no one expected.</p>
<p>An answer that will change your and your family's life forever.</p>
<p>You have Young Onset Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is an incurable, progressive loss of brain cells. In the beginning it targets the memory and speech, as time goes on the symptoms become wider ranging and debilitating and include disorientation, difficulty judging distances, poor vision, poor speech/writing abilities, repetitive behaviour, mood swings, and depression. Then in the final stages of the disease it is not just the mind that is affected; the body is rapidly declining also. In the late stages of Alzheimer's there will be difficulty swallowing, a needed for assistance when changing position or moving from place to place, there is increased vulnerability to infection and a complete loss of short-term and long-term memory. Death is slow, painful, undignified, and inevitable.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen and this is my diagnosis.</p>
<p>For the last decade I have campaigned on behalf of myself and all those suffering from this devastating disease. Why do I have to campaign? I do it because over five million Americans have Alzheimer's, and other forms of dementia. And what is more shocking is the lack of knowledge out there about this illness.</p>
<p>I have become extremely surprised by the lack of public commitment to my pleas for support of Alzheimer's disease. While some may be sympathetic in the moment, there appears to be little follow-through.</p>
<p>People look at me and think there is nothing wrong; I am not in a wheelchair, I have full use of all my limbs, I can see, hear, speak and listen...... but not for much longer.</p>
<p>I am dying; day by day hour by hour my life is ending.</p>
<p>So much of my life has changed with this disease; household chores that were once second-nature, like cutting the grass have become frustrating difficult and for me to perform. I leave things lying around the house; not to be difficult, but because I have forgotten where they go, and I am also afraid that if they do get put away I will not remember where they were put.</p>
<p>I was once a very sociable person but now I go to a happy affair only to be tortured by the noise and surrounding conversations because I am overwhelmed by the stimulus of sight and sound. I don't understand what people are saying; the words run together and they may as well be speaking a foreign language.</p>
<p>I can no longer write or speak like I used to, what you a reading now has been written by a friend of mine who helps me put my words onto paper. My friends have become distant and even when in their presence they will address my wife, even when enquiring after me they rarely direct their questions to me. This is heart-breaking for me, the fact that they feel they can no longer talk to me really saddens me.</p>
<p>Grocery shopping with my wife is time consuming and frustrating as I find it difficult to make decisions and plan ahead for meals. Eating out was something I used to enjoy but now I am unable to read the menu and assimilate the information into a decision. At home my wife has to assemble my meals in a series of individual decisions.</p>
<p>There was a time when I could follow a map and easily get from point A to B. Now I rely on my wife for navigation, I know that it won't be long before I can no longer drive and that really upsets me because I love going out for long drives in my car, it is the last vestige of independence I have left.</p>
<p>I used to be smart, I worked hard, and I accomplished a lot. Seeing all my failures today are giving me a new appreciation for the things I was once capable of doing. I was a very different person, but that intelligence still shines through occasionally as I am challenged to invent new coping strategies to respond to these changes.</p>
<p>This disease is costing me money in so many ways because of the problems and issues I create; I have broken gardening tools because I have forgotten how to use them properly.</p>
<p>Personal grooming is a problem as well; as I can never remember the last time I washed my hair or changed my clothes.</p>
<p>In meetings I will lose track of the subject matter if the information is shared in long sentences. If I am speaking at events or meeting I must have my speech printed a large font size with clearly marked punctuation.</p>
<p>Sometimes my mind does not communicate with the rest of my body; I had to turn the grate on my fireplace but instead of tentatively feeling if it was hot or not I just picked it up and badly burned my hand.</p>
<p>I can no longer use my video recorder. I had trouble remembering which way to turn off the water in the garage for the hose</p>
<p>I lost my job because I could no longer function in the environment, so now I spend my days advocating for Alzheimer's it gives me a reason to get out of bed in the morning, it stimulates what is left of my mind.</p>
<p>Do you know what the worst part of this is? I have to watch my wife struggling to do the things that I once was capable of doing, and know I cannot do anything thing to help. I see my wife becoming stressed, depressed and overwhelmed, and know it will only continue to get worse.</p>
<p>My wife is on the road to hell; I have not even reached the worst stage. That scares the hell out of me.</p>
<p>I am losing my mind and I can see it happening, but I cannot do anything to change the course. I am slowly becoming a child again, and will soon be a body with no mind.</p>
<p>At what point should I give up? At what point would give up?</p>
<p>What do I have to look forward to?</p>
<p>Why should I put my wife through any more pain and sadness, do I really want her to watch me slowly die in front her eyes?</p>
<p>Any chance I had at a good life and a happy retirement has gone; my life is pretty much over. If you were in my shoes would you want to carry on, knowing what is in store for you?</p>
<p>I want to die on my own terms, I want to die with dignity, I want to die while I can still make the decision to die, and that is a very small window because I know in the not too distant future even that choice is going to be taken from me.</p>
<p>The laws we have in place today do not take into account the needs of people suffering from dementia; we need to rethink not only how we regard people with this disease, but also how we look after them. We need to have things in place not only to help those suffering live vital and productive lives, but also provide the means necessary for them to die with dignity and at a time of their choosing. We need to take our heads out of the sand; we can no longer turn a blind, this is a very real problem, this is happening now to millions of people across America.</p>
<p>We need your help!</p>

<p>I have three issues I would like to address briefly today. Please contact me via telephone or email if you have would like additional information concerning any of these issues.</p>
<p>As many of you know I have shared with you my vision of dementia friendly communities. I believe Project Lifesaver International should be part of our future plans. Project Lifesaver provides timely response to save lives and reduce potential injury for those who wander due to dementia including Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>The task of searching for wandering or lost individuals with cognitive conditions is a growing and serious responsibility. Without effective procedures and equipment, searches can involve multiple agencies, hundreds of officers, countless man hours and thousands of dollars. More importantly, because time is of the essence, every minute lost increases the risk of a tragic outcome. This is a program that must be offered in all states. We currently use tax dollars to pay for these bands that track prisoners under house arrest, we need to make this technology available to those with dementia, at no cost, to keep them safe. Statistics show it will save money and produce better outcomes if we all invested.</p>
<p>My next concern involves the verbage associated with certain medications. For many years now most in the medical community, non profits and I have been preaching what I believe is questionable information to others. I have been telling people that (colon - ester - ace) cholinesterase inhibitors, such as (Dan - ep- azil) Donepezil and (Meh - man - teen) Memantine may work for only 50 % of people and when they do they only work for 6- 18 months. This is the information reported by drug manufacturers, physicians and patient education portals. I have learned that this is reported because that is the longest length of time that the drugs have been clinically studied. Recent information, circulated by many experts in the field, suggests that these drugs can continue to be effective for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>The language concerning the use of these medications must be changed if we are going to help people. The benefit of continuing medication is a complicated question as I have found in the last 6 months. People are encouraged to check with their clinicians and make an informed family decision. While further research needs to be conducted, whether it's best to continue or discontinue (colon - ester - ace) cholinesterase inhibitor use I believe we need to error on the side of caution and include some language that states that it could have a negative effect if one was to stop taking it. It can also include that more scientific studies are needed. I have spoken to many doctors over the past few months who are also looking for clear direction. I would think we should make the decision on the side of caution and keep the patients best interest in mind. I believe that if the patient started taking these drugs and they did benefit from them originally then they should stay on them until the end, even if the benefit is small. When your brain function is at a very low capacity, any help is good. I say this as long as they do not have any serious side effects from the medication. I have a comprehensive bibliography on this topic and suggested guidelines in medical language that I can share. It includes information from many doctors/experts in the field. The reason I am so concerned is because I constantly hear others who are on the drugs question whether they should still be on them after they have been taking them for over a 1 1/2 years. I have also spoken to some who stopped it and realized in a week or so that they were not performing as well and went back on the drug. Then I have heard some horror stories where they stopped taking the drug and realized it had helped. When they went back on they never seemed to recover to the same level of cognitive function as they were before. I say all this based on their own viewpoints and those of their care partners. They regret ever doing this, but they only did it because of what they heard about effectiveness only lasting 6-18 months. Please help change this confusing data.</p>
<p>Finally, as you know I have been pushing for the World Purple Angel to be the same as the Pink Ribbon or as the handicap sign. We have now trademarked that here in the US and in the UK. It is free for use with our permission if the guidelines are met. Please adopt this symbol as part of your continued support for dementia. We need to stand as one on this cause.</p>
<p>On one Final comment - At our last meeting I think some of my comments were taken personally. The goal behind them was a call for action. Many outside of the committee told me that they would have liked to have said those things also. My response to them is don't be afraid to speak up honestly and from the heart.</p>

<p>I am writing to you today because I have a few questions concerning US's efforts to address dementia since the Summit, in particular with regard to long-term care. While the Summit was held in London, it seems that the US has been leading this issue since 2011, with the enactment of the NAPA. I want to make sure the US perspective is clear in my report.</p>

<p>I believe words really matter, and sometimes we don't realize the hurt they may cause; especially if you are not personally dealing with the disease. I have been involved in many planning meetings that have discussed what appropriate words should be used when describing this disease. Most recently I attended such a meeting, involving key stakeholders in this arena, where someone came up with the perfect term. When I heard it a light bulb went off. Then I got to thinking why no one has thought of it before. Now I am hoping that you will adopt this term for NAPA. "Dementia, including Alzheimer's"</p>
<p>A term I would like to remove from regular use is the word patient, when referring to people living with dementia. This term slowly becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and gradually they become more dependent on others. They are a person not a patient.</p>
<p>While we are on the subject of terminology. I also do not like the term "caregiver". In fact I despise it. And although "care partner" is better, I and many others still don't like it. We are still discussing whether or not the term "supporter(s)" should be used instead. I will keep you posted.</p>
<p>NAPA has now been in existence for about three years now, and recently they conducted a survey where 59 percent of people asked thought that Alzheimer's was just part of memory loss and related to normal aging. I am not quite sure what NAPA's mission is, but as a national group who should be bringing change for dementia, I believe you folks have failed miserably in educating the public. It's no wonder no one wants to do anything for this cause.</p>
<p>I have been saying for years that it's a discrimination issue, but I may have been using the wrong word. I should have been saying it is a civil rights issue. I should have the right to be treated just like any other person who has a disability. I should have the same rights as a person who gets funding for HIV. I should have the same rights as a person who gets funding for cancer. I should have the same rights as any other person who can drive and has a medical condition. I should have the same civil rights to decide when and how I die. I should have the same civil rights to be in control of my own finances.</p>
<p>But because I have dementia I have lost all of my civil rights and more. Can you tell me why I lost my civil rights when I live in the United States? I did nothing wrong, I am just a person with a disability.</p>
<p>My wife is here today for the first time. She is the one that I depend on to do many of the things that I am no longer capable of. It is bad enough that I have burdened her and placed so much added stress on her. But the federal government has added even more burden and stress on her, because she must fill out forms on my behalf on where my money is spent. I think that is totally ridiculous. My personal privacy is being abused. Why is it that just because I have dementia I am treated differently? Does that make sense to you?</p>
<p>I have shared the following with Dr Gillings of the World Dementia Council. What are your thoughts on this idea?</p>
<p>If each country was to contribute to a pot of money, then offer that money as an incentive to find a cure by 2020, I think you would generate a huge amount of interest. You would attract more experience. Would it really hurt to throw something like that out there while your team is working the normal channels? I would think you would have so many people jump in to this arena based on that. I believe this is a small price to pay if we get a way to stop this disease.</p>
<p>When Senator Pat Toomey questioned Sylvia Mathews Burwell on Alzheimer's funding at the finance committee, it was clearly stated that things changed historically, and as such we should be changing the way we fund this disease. This is what I have been saying every time I have come here.</p>
<p>It is time to shift some of those funds to dementia. Someone must tell Francis Collins. I cannot understand that why, when something this simple is staring you right in the face, you fail to take action. You seem to lack the courage to make this simple change. How many more need to suffer and die in this devastating way before you folks do your jobs. What has happened to our civil rights? Stop beating around the bush and tell them what we really need and must have. 100 million is so far off the real number we need.</p>
<p>Talk about frustration. For years now we have been saying we need at least two billion dollars, but no one seems to listen to us. However, when illegal immigrants cross our borders the president asks for almost four billion dollars, with no plan in place. Why do our civil rights not count? Why is no one willing to stand up for us like that?</p>
<p>On another note. It's now been over a year since the public comments were updated. I was told it would be resolved at one of our previous meetings. It's still not fixed as of third of this month, and if one cannot resolve this simple issue how are you going to even tackle Dementia, including Alzheimer's?</p>
<p>If it sounds like I am get frustrated with NAPA, I am, I believed in all of you folks, and now years later, there has been very little progress made. Let's put more passion and fire into this project. So many like me are counting on you, this is just not another long-term project.</p>
<p>Someone recently said to me "I would never call you a diplomat." This was in reference to my speeches and speaking. I believe that is part of the problem. We all try to be so nice to each other and we don't push for what we really need. While we end up accomplishing great etiquette at this table, many continue to suffer and die around us. Please tell them what you really want to see happen and don't beat around the bush, some people just don't get it that easily.</p>
<p>At our next meeting, will you allow me to have someone send a connection to you on your computer and I can bring other people virtually on the computer here on the big screen. These are people from all over the US. I would like to give them each a 3 minute time to speak. They are all in the US and have been diagnosed with some form of dementia. I may be able to get a recording to share. I am willing to give up my time so others can be heard. Please allow the people to be heard before their voices are no longer capable of speaking because of the dementia.</p>

<p>I have attached my October 2013 fifteen page response to the Florida Purple Ribbon Task Force's recommendations. In so doing, I apologize in advance for the quality. Post ADRD estate resolution after 10 years of full time care of a level 6, I went through three bilateral reconstructive surgeries with post op complications resulting in over two years restricted mobility. I had hoped to assemble a more comprehensive document reflecting the needs of the hundreds of caretakers I have communicated with over the years and testify at federal and state hearings on the issues raised in this document but was not able to walk/drive until a few months ago.</p>
<p>We had a triple dose of ADRD in our extended family. As such, all of your efforts to find a cure are deeply appreciated.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Response to 2013 Florida Purple Ribbon Task Force Report</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>I have reviewed the Purple Ribbon Task Force Report and the survey. I don't agree with the approach, recommendations or the data and underlying assumptions forming the basis of same. I was particularly concerned with the failure to address abusive practices, systemic industry reform, and secondary impact. After repeated review of this document, I arrived at the conclusion that proposals were no more than plugged holes in a dike with the damn about to burst.</p>
<p>ADRD is a global health crisis of frightening proportion. It is a vicious and insidious disease with debilitating economic, psychological and physical consequences extending far beyond the directly afflicted. This Task Force had the unprecedented privilege to not only place Florida in a national leadership role in addressing and responding to an international humanitarian medical crisis but to shine a light of hope in a very dark place for millions of elderly and their families. Your response was insular and short sighted. It will cripple this state.</p>
<p>First, it was my understanding that the impetus for Task Force creation was the 2011 Miami Herald investigative report series, "Neglected to Death", the focus of which was facility abuse of elderly, particularly ADRD, and state regulatory oversight. It is simply unforgivable and irresponsible that this emergent and heartbreaking crisis as to the elderly in general, and ADRD in particular, was not met with regulatory reform, expanded enforcement and financial/criminal sanctions for this conduct.</p>
<p>Not only was this not addressed but, amazingly, a statement was made that placement of small groups of ADRD elderly in homes was the best solution. I have serious concerns over the justification for this conclusory remark as to ADRD and the source's understanding of disease impact. These homes are not subject to regulatory oversight and are thus a prime target for incompetent coverage and abusive practices. (I thought it was illegal for professionals to recommend unlicensed facilities.) ADRD are not able to articulate their needs, complain, or ask for help under the best circumstances. Removing a layer of government protection, however remote, is ill advised and careless. Even in a facility, this concept of small groups, dating back to the early 90's, struggles because success was predicated on an interdisciplinary team approach which does not exist.</p>
<p>Second, public policy and elder service delivery has fallen prey to an out of control, self serving, self perpetuating and self aggrandizing provider controlled industry dedicated to achieving maximum profit with minimal overhead. Often owners and investors are outside the state or international. Profiteers want a piece of the elderly and layer by layer, they take it. Owners can run a 30% profit level on a facility or HHC business. The best way to evaluate this, outside SEC, IPO or tax filing, is to look at listings or private offering representations of gross revenues and owner benefit. After a few are open, whether or not an IPO is filed or ownership transfers, investors do expect continuation of the same return. Bare minimum revenues are directed toward elder services. The State does not benefit.</p>
<p>Truly outstanding health care professionals, including RN's, LPN's and CNA's suffer and eventually abandon direct service delivery because they cannot control the desired quality of their efforts. Caretakers suffer because they cannot insure that the safety, medical needs and quality of life of their loved one will be served and personally take on the burden. Elderly suffer because they are personally, physically and financially abused and victimized.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association Campaign for Quality Residential Care: Dementia Care Practices Recommendations for Assisted Living Residences and Nursing Homes is a valuable reference. It conditions successful implementation of recommendations on having a sufficient number of appropriately trained staff. This is not evident in practice, was not translated to statutory or regulatory obligation by the Task Force and should be immediately addressed before additional elderly are harmed.</p>
<p>Many families could have paid the $120,000 annual fee for SNF care and continued with their lives. Most don't make that election because the ADRD were repeatedly injured when attempts were made, that avenue was closed to ADRD by the provider, or only made available with doping and/or a 24/7 aide. ALF's are simply out of the question because, in most cases, they can't meet the base medical needs and life quality for non ADRD elderly. ADRD shares the same expected medical and ADL needs normally attendant to aging and many cognitive challenges are based on failure to responsibly meet these needs.</p>
<p>Florida AHCA and CMS deficiency reports and judicial filings, in the public domain and available for your review, reflect across the board abuses. Facilities are not safe and engage in abusive practices directly or by quality understaffing and neglect.</p>
<p>Third, the "aging in place" policy statement, particularly as to mid to upper level ADRD or sundowners is simply cruel and dysfunctional. It will economically destroy this State, families, and future generations because it not only fails to take into account the needs of the ADRD but fails to assess and quantify the secondary destructive personal and financial impact on families. As to the majority of elderly who live alone, it is life threatening. Norway parrots this approach in its 2015 report but, in the absence there of admission to SNF's without acute condition, has their own issues with death and injury by release of isolated non ADRD elderly to a home environment. I don't understand the policy advocate's underlying motivation. Is it an HHC profit oriented response, a mathematically challenged but otherwise well meaning individual, or someone who desperately needs a reality check as to disease manifestation at the mid to upper levels?</p>
<p>I don't know your proposal for single ADRD, particularly those homeless without financial resources, when SNF Medicaid beds are scarce and selectively reserved for non ADRD. I do know that elderly spouses can't handle ADRD. They have their own needs and are often continuously and irrationally verbally and physically abused. It is just too much. Most look to divorce to avoid ADRD caretaking, simply leave or predecease the ADRD. At some point, children, if there are any and if they care, have to gratuitously assume this full time obligation.</p>
<p>In December 2012, the New York Times, after a comparative international review of efforts in this area concluded</p>
<blockquote><p>"Is care at home for patients with Alzheimer's necessarily more humane? Only if caregivers have the resources -- financial, physical and emotional -- to handle this draining, exhausting, immeasurably difficult job. And only if the institutions that serve people with more advanced forms of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia are so poorly financed, staffed and operated that we wouldn't feel comfortable leaving loved ones in their care….</p>
<p>Anyone who's followed reader response to <strong>Jane Brody's column</strong> this week on aging in place knows the burden that this can place on families, especially if government support for home-based services (companions or home health aides who help with bathing, dressing, toileting and other tasks), adult day care or respite care is scarce or nonexistent, as is the case for most middle-class families in the United States. …</p>
<p>Other countries with which the United States is closely aligned have embraced long-term care as an essential social responsibility while we have not. Unless and until we do so, caregivers here will be among the most harried, stressed and burdened among wealthy, developed countries in the world."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Children caretakers are former attorneys, architects, doctors, engineers, technology and security consultants, teachers, industry executives, police, prosecutors, university professors, fire, health care professionals etc. No profession is excluded. The reason why we are "former" is because, in the absence of essential industry facility reform, regulation and enforcement, there is no responsible choice.</p>
<p>These caretakers are comprised of both sexes, cross party lines, and are frustrated, not simply because control over their own economic, professional and personal future has been taken out of their hands by small time industry profiteers, but with the fact that the quality of the lives of their ADRD loved ones could have been immeasurably improved if safe, quality facilities existed.</p>
<p><strong>Our economic loss and that of our families is Florida's current loss and future burden. Caretakers, professionally and financially, were critical contributors to Florida's economy. We bought and provided goods and services. We contributed to the community. We saved money for our children's education and our future through 401K's. We preserved our health. Now, as caretakers, we do not engage in any of these efforts. </strong></p>
<p><strong>A new classification of poverty has been created which is "intergenerationally" contagious to join the current ADRD unserved homeless population. Put another way, at the end of the caretaking period, which can exceed a decade, our resources have been depleted, we might have MCI, ADRD or a physically debilitating condition, we don't qualify for SS disability or unemployment since we have not contributed, and there may not be family to provide care. 50% of the future generation will be ADRD caretaking. Grandchildren want to know whether to invest in their future if everything is going to fall apart. How do we respond based on your plan? </strong></p>
<p>ADC does not help the ADRD if continuous doping is used to protect other participants from sporadic bouts of agitation occasioned by infection or alienation of environment. ADC does not help if the home caretaker works and the disease manifests itself at night by sundowning, whether or not the ADRD is otherwise normal to easily manageable during the day and particularly considering the lives of children and their schooling. Segregating all ADRD to one ADC but intermingling levels is traumatic for the lower levels that retain some sense of self, daily facing their possible future particularly if operations are not individually medical and cognitive need responsive. ADC is one entity depending on staffing which might not realize the profit level of facilities, if any, depending on quality of service.</p>
<p>With HHC, demand exceeds quality supply for elderly in general. The usual bare minimum wage does not otherwise attract quality applicants particularly if a non ADRD position opens. Occasionally, through internal networking, as opposed to HHC agencies, a miracle occurs but it is usually short lived. Unqualified HHC pose a danger to the patient. Again, this is a complex disease. It varies in form and manifestation and can change without notice. It requires an interdisciplinary team effort focused on the ADRD.</p>
<p>Last survey, 25% of ADRD caretakers repeatedly engaged in suicide ideation. 10% engaged in it after the protracted caretaking period was over. Individuals personally advised of this diagnosis contemplate suicide because they don't want it for themselves or the burden they have already experienced for their children. Absent reform, this will continue.</p>
<p>We want the lives of our ADRD loved ones immeasurably improved in a properly staffed safe and secure environment conducive to their special needs and enriched with advanced cognitive or sensory stimulation like a Snoezalen room, interactive games and activities, supported by responsible, dedicated, trained and educated interdisciplinary professionals who care that ADRD and their medical needs are attended to without chemical or physical restraints and promote level appropriate company of friends. We want them to enjoy their life as it reaches its conclusion, to be protected from abuse in all its forms, and to have a choice in the manner in which quality care is provided.</p>
<p>Reports like this have repeatedly issued over the past 15 years. They are always well written, there is always a survey eliciting information which has been in the public domain for so long, judicial notice would be taken of the conclusions without need for evidentiary support. They define the disease, introduce impact and demographic review analysis and recommend research, education, awareness campaigns of whatever kind, some legislative public pronouncement of caring, and reinforce support for research to find a cure through another commission or office. Occasionally ADRD are thrown a bone through subsidy of providers whose conduct is the basis for complaint. Operational regulatory reform is never addressed because tasks forces are controlled by the entities which should be regulated. Scientists never receive sufficient direct funding. Elderly ADRD never receive the services they need because critical issues are never addressed. One frustrated attorney caretaker made a remark that such reports all be filed away under the category "don't ever do this again".</p>
<p>The following provides limited comment on your report, including your needs analysis, rejects historically structured commissions and task forces, introduces issues not covered but with the focus on necessary reform, and presents recommendations and comments assimilated over the years from caretakers, attorneys and health care professionals including doctors, RN's, and CNA's with prior industry affiliation. The goal is to accomplish reform and proceed in a new direction without state financial stress.</p>
<p>There is a two part solution.</p>
<p><strong>First, clean up existing operations though regulatory reform outlined below more specifically, particularly focusing on increasing staffing and quality control, and take out the trash. Set up sufficiently harsh fines and sanctions individually and by facility to insure that abuses will not continue and to support enforcement in cases of repeat violations. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Second, set up a revolving account for seed monies and loan guarantees, including interest subsidies for infrastructure/development, consolidate IDG and other state and federal resources to support nonprofit operation of multilayer extensive campus developments, sufficiently attractive to entice those amply able to pay for residency, including high level medical care, cognitive services and activities to improve quality of life. Attach it to a university for memory disorder service (like John Hopkins Copper Ridge) independent medical oversight and student involvement. By eliminating owner benefit, the 30% differential may also be applied to cover those unable to pay but in need of services. The goal is a physically and financially self sustaining campus, where no one is turned away. </strong></p>
<p>In other word, change the conception of aging from a depressing environment to one where spouses without ADRD can live and regularly visit their loved ones happy in the knowledge that their needs are addressed in a positive way while they pursue their own interests. Change the attitude of staff towards their role, change the name to a university concept with individual neighborhoods/dormitories, and make it an interactive campus and a wonderful place to be. Instead of being the country that can't get it together in terms of aging and ADRD, let the United States be a leader.</p>
<p><strong>ADRD Population and Needs Assessment </strong></p>
<p>Data challenges based on elevation of presentation form over substance consist of the following:</p>
<p>First, in order to presumably substantiate policy recommendations, the Task Force had a survey. The survey structure was borrowed from, I believe, Oregon, despite the wealth of talent in this state and the issue intimacy of highly educated resident professionals. The survey was not publicized and was open for a period of about two weeks on a site not regularly visited. As to ADRD and family caregivers, the response was so insignificant that no responsible economist would have publicized the survey results much less used it as a basis for defining issues because it lacks statistical integrity. It otherwise substantively failed because the primary focus was asking questions which supported a provider private pay response, not otherwise responsive to ADRD needs.</p>
<p>Second, there is a concern that the base from which linear projections have been made as to the number of ADRD in Florida is not valid and existing and future service delivery needs estimation will suffer. The Rush CHAP's report has routinely been used nationally. The base for this report was an older population on the south side of Chicago and early onset, to the best of my recollection, was not taken into consideration. Over time, studies have repeatedly made extrapolations applied to census, disease incident reports and other variables using this baseline. I would suggest that this may not result in statistically significant results as to, at least, Florida and California.</p>
<p>Third, I also question whether projections should be linear. These numbers do not take into consideration the possible contagion factor by example but not limitation, prion scabie migration, infection and replication (if a causation) not prevented through traditional surgical sterilization methods, the impact of surgical inhalational analgesics as a contributing factor in neurotoxicity/dementia, and the rising incidence of vascular dementia, all of which would suggest an exponential as opposed to linear projection approach.</p>
<p>Fourth, ADRD is a primarily a hidden population. Death certificates rarely report ADRD as a cause of death because other health factors intervene before the afflicted reaches the terminal stages of the disease. Inferring from presentation of county cause of death statistics that ADRD may be quantified in this manner is improper.</p>
<p>Establishing a form of reporting of this disease to more closely define the scope of the problem, particularly in a state which bears a substantially disproportionate share of the ADRD population might be helpful. I don't understand why Florida has an issue with doing, on first impression, a more statistically significant analysis and quantification. Inquiry through residential property tax billing with pass through to non owner occupants was suggested as one way, without incurring significant cost and more closely reflective of county/local needs, to solicit this information. As a secondary benefit, it would also be a way to publicize the brain bank, obtain dedication and encourage, at the early ADRD stages, assembly of diagnostic and cognitive history to accompany donations in furtherance of research.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Disease Advisory Committee </strong></p>
<p>There is a critical and urgent need for provider industry reform, particularly staffing of facilities, as to the elderly in general and a complete reorientation and restructuring of approach as to ADRD. The Task Force declined to address reform. The responsibility for the future of ADRD was left to the industry dominated Alzheimer Disease Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>The constituency, if you will, is the elderly, particularly the 30% or more ADRD elderly and growing proportion of early onset afflicted with ADRD. Yet repeatedly over time, attention is directed, not to the needs of this population, but to the interests of service providers.</p>
<p>When you have a regulatory structure controlled by the regulated through Committee participation or otherwise, evidenced by policy encouraging direct provider benefit through subsidy or oversight avoidance, you have a form of indirect and constitutionally prohibited entrenched special interests influence. It is a little like stepping in quicksand. Once you have lost your way, you are pulled deeper and deeper into the quagmire of minutia driven situational response from which it is impossible to extricate yourself no matter how well meaning your efforts. Your Baker Act justification and analysis is a good example. Proposed respite care funding is another. Underlying all of this is the complete destruction of all hope of responsible choice to caretakers and quality of care for the ADRD as a matter of Florida public policy.</p>
<p>The Committee contains representatives of the assisted living, home health care, hospital and pharmacy industries. They should be removed and replaced by individuals who do not have financial ties by investment, ownership or employment with a provider. Preferential composition, given the enormity of issues, should be given to a retired judge, Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, an economist, attorneys, prosecutors, nurses associations and legislative representatives who are all able to ask the essential questions and perform investigations without challenge to neutrality.</p>
<p>This is not a personal or professional criticism of any of the individuals involved. I don't know them. It is simply that, as a matter of public policy, no industry should be in a position to control, influence or otherwise make policy which regulates its conduct or in which it might directly or indirectly receive a financial benefit. It is a conflict of interest. Industry input is important but not in this way.</p>
<p>You should seek an opinion from the State Attorney General's office on this matter. At minimum, participation creates an appearance of impropriety which could directly or by inference undermine the integrity of efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Department of Elder Affairs. </strong></p>
<p>I was legislative liaison for a State Department many years ago for Aging, Housing, Local Government, MFA, HFA etc.. Back them we had floor privileges in both houses so information exchange was ongoing. No bipartisan disputes attached to any elder issues. During that time, the legislature passed protective measures like the uniform construction code, planned real estate development full disclosure, nursing home patient's rights and a full range of elder services directly or through state matching funds for federal programs with bipartisan support.</p>
<p>When money did not exist for requests that were truly beyond any realistic appropriation expectation, we found a source. For example, when we wanted to fund pharmaceutical assistance for the elderly on the state level, we attached it to the gaming referendum for revenue dedication. When we needed a design/materials/best practices for affordable housing, we did not pay someone to do it, we went to a television network and announced a contest.</p>
<p>As to the Department of the Elderly, I noticed you contracted with an entity to provide design or whatever development plans for a LTC. I did not see the specifications you put out for bidding on this so I can't comment. Facility design and building specs information are easily internet available. I believe the University of Florida already built one of the original Smart Houses and green facility construction is a fact of life as are sustainable communities internationally. (Germany apparently has an entire town self sustaining.)</p>
<p>You might consider publicity, through contests, as a major motivating factor for free design concepts without financially obligating the State. You receive more truly exciting and innovative solutions en masse and if you integrate it with interdisciplinary considerations from technology, security, surveillance, assistive devices, to artificial intelligence and sensory input, entertainment, activities and acute care advanced equipment, with building considerations, you might get past an extended stay design with a pacing circle. Finally, design concepts which integrate isolated small groups are physically and personally dangerous to the welfare of residents unless and until adequate quality staffing with oversight is mandated and aggressively enforced.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Industry Reform </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of these recommendations following is to make facility owners start taking issues concerning elderly seriously because the State of Florida finally does. If it takes sanctions, penalties and other costs as well as license disciplinary/revocation as to staff and owner/facility, so be it. The conduct is wrongful and someone should start caring before injurious results are out of control. Further if conduct would have been criminal outside the walls of a facility, including accessory before and after the fact in cover up, it is time to recognize it for what it is.</p>
<p>Years ago, I was Director of Licensing engaged in casino development at a time when State regulation over construction, all casino and hotel operations and employees was intense. When a facility or operations are heavily scrutinized and fined for misadventure, a higher level of conduct emerges.</p>
<p>The following, from professionals in the field, is exemplary but certainly not exclusive. It does not but should address hospital failure to have in house coverage of ADRD fall risks or wanderers. Caretakers, particularly the sandwich generation who work or have dual elderly/family responsibility and are without funds, cannot sit for 24/7 with a hospitalized ADRD. Some hospitals let an aide do coverage for a group of 2-4. This is extremely helpful and reduces hospital liability risk.</p>
<p>Ownership and Management<br />
					Prequalify, through a 4 way investigation and license owners, investors and management. Educational, experiential and training prerequisites are currently insufficient and should be strengthened. (in Florida you only need high school to operate an ALF) There is precedent for this in NJ's gaming industry and other sensitive fields. We need to start treating the needs of our elderly as critically.</p>
<p>Staffing<br />
					Identify the nature, function and specializations of interdisciplinary staff dealing with ADRD. Increase minimum per patient staffing ratio per shift with specification of their qualifications for dealing with cognitive challenged particularly at night. Background investigations, qualifications and training of staff need to be expanded and reassessed.</p>
<p>Economic Fines and Sanctions<br />
					Continuously inspect and severely economically sanction those substandard facilities which harm the elderly.</p>
<p>Staff and Owner Liability for Violations<br />
					Take action to discipline or revoke the licenses of operators and staff that participated in or were aware of violations or falsified records and failed to report same.</p>
<p>Facility Compliance Repeat Violations<br />
					Federal or state trustee supervised independent contractor assumption of operational activity over extensive or repeat offenders should be provided to bring a facility into compliance with the cost of same borne by the owner/operator. Sanctions should be automatic and not negotiable.</p>
<p>Criminal Liability<br />
					Assault, battery, criminal negligence and endangerment, pain medication theft and financial abuse should be treated through the prosecutor, not the ombudsman, in the same way it would be treated if outside the facility. Staff who participated in or were aware of the offensive conduct and failed to report same should be similarly charged. Inception of any such investigation and criminal proceeding or license sanction or revocation hearing, should be communicated to all concerned federal and state authorities.</p>
<p>ALF and ADRD Care<br />
					ALF classification of care, as it currently exists, should be eliminated as a vehicle for ADRD care. It does not even meet the basic needs of elderly without ADRD and this should be addressed.</p>
<p>Doping<br />
					There is a need for explicit verifiable protocol for the prescription and administration of medication for ADRD as to nature, duration and dosage, documentation of use of off-label drugs and physician (not nurse) justification for exceeding any recommended dosage or duration of administration <strong>after seeing the patient</strong>. There should not be an automatic presumption of physician competence in this area. (One psychiatrist had no knowledge of Lewy body dementia.) When elderly are ignored or have ADRD or are otherwise doped with off label drugs for behavioral control purposes, they cannot articulate pain. It is a form of involuntary imprisonment not unlike the Argentinean prisons in the 50's which used a rudimentary form of psychotropic drugs on inmates. (In Florida, drugs are also being used on juvenile detainees to control behavior.) If elderly ADRD are doped when they act out and they act out because they have untreated cancer or undiagnosed medical condition which they are unable to communicate, they face years of pain in a semi comatose condition before their life ends strapped in a wheelchair or urine soaked bed without relief. There is an urgent need for immediate action. This conduct is criminal and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>Cognitive/sensory activities for ADRD.<br />
					Identification of advanced cognitive conditions which mandate immediate facility release and transfer to a specialized facility dealing with memory care or to a SNF, if attendant medical issues, should be automatic to preclude doping. Facilities should have structured interventions and activities for ADRD which respond to their unique needs.</p>
<p>Financial Abuse<br />
					Prior court approval (after family and beneficiary notice) of any gift, behest, testamentary or other property transfer to a facility or any of its employees should be mandatory.</p>
<p>Surveillance<br />
					Provision of distance web cams to permit HCS and staff monitoring of their charges, particularly in the case of ADRD should be provided. There is ample evidence to suggest that when staff are under surveillance, abuse abates. Similarly female patients in understaffed facilities need to be protected against sexually aggressively ADRD men. The use of minimum wage employees in egregiously understaffed facilities particularly at night is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Fall Risk and Wandering Prevention/Notice to HCS<br />
					Remote notice of bed vacation through sensor monitoring technologies to staff to prevent fall risks and ADRD wandering at night prior to injury is critical. Absence of such protection resulting in death or serious injury has been the basis for substantial litigation. There further needs to be mandatory immediate notification to HCS of injury to patient and accurate record preservation of same.</p>
<p>State of the art lifting devices/equipment<br />
					Staff and patients have been injured by lifting challenges. Staff has a brutal experience lifting physically challenged/obese with long term chronic consequences. Patients are injured if mishandling occurs. This needs to be remedied.</p>
<p>Record Management/Interaction<br />
					HCS's should be able to directly access the patient's records, including medication management and nurses notes through online interactive software between HCS's and facility. No medication or medical treatment should take place without an HCS's consent. Interactions between medications or other medical conditions and side effects should be self contained within this data base, continuously monitored and addressed. There is no need for handwritten files which can be manipulated/altered pre inspection.</p>
<p>Ombudsman<br />
					There needs to be strict guidelines as to the use of the ombudsman function, the obligation of the ombudsman to immediately refer elder endangerment or possible financial abuse to the appropriate authorities and to advise HCS, POA and family of their options, including referral to prosecutor, counsel and a NAELA contact number, or availability of court mediation services as recommended herein. The ombudsman role should be carefully redefined and restricted in scope to matters not possibly criminal in nature. (Some issues are just not appropriate for the ombudsman.)</p>
<p>Facility License Manipulation<br />
					There should be an absolute prohibition of facility license downgrading to avoid continuing state scrutiny and oversight when the facility is faced with closure at the higher level.</p>
<p><strong>Intergenerational Support and Information Access </strong></p>
<p>The "intergenerational" approach suggested would make a nice Hallmark card but you have to deal with reality. It is not going to happen and with ADRD there is an issue as to whether, as to children, it should. There is a reason the ADRD caretaker community has the saying "There is always one" (who takes on the responsibility). Another way of putting it is "There is only one".</p>
<p>Many of us started caretaking in the 90's when we were in our 40's and continued through our late 50's. There is no way to accurately convey the absolute shock of initial ADRD diagnosis and the immediate and complete upheaval and destruction of finances, health, and professional and personal life. The unrelenting stress of the behavioral challenges of this horror of a disease, ongoing sleep deprivation occasioned by sundowning and the sporadic and unpredictable agitation/violence which can result in actual physical injury to the caretaker are not the only challenges. The caretaker must deal with non ADRD medical conditions attendant to the aging process.</p>
<p>In order to understand this, you have to get past the marketed mental picture of a sweet grandmother, mildly confused, smiling at a helpful grandchild. This is a fabrication along with an intact family unit working together when ADRD reaches the upper stages.</p>
<p>The ADRD are agitated, offensive, argumentative and occasionally violent with errant behavior predicated on infection, pain, boredom, frustration and fear. They will pace incessantly, wake you in the middle of the night pulling hair because they want to "go home" or because they think you stole the (deceased) spouse or (deceased) mother. They will get up repeatedly in the middle of the night to get dressed for school, stand by a window or door to protect the family all night and punch anyone who comes close. Alternatively, they just wander out the door. They bite, scratch, hit, and accuse anyone of stealing whatever is on their mind at the time. Then they might stop for a few weeks and just when you think things are good and you attempt to drop them off at ADC so you can get to work, they refuse to move. If you take them out, they can refuse to get out of the car for hours on end when they return since they don't recognize where they are. If they are a fall risk, the problem is worse since you have to follow them to protect them. They might go through a fear of water period for weeks or months. They will take things and hide them or take off their clothes in public. Men, usually, may act in a sexually aggressive way toward children or grandchildren because he thinks they are his wife. The challenges are endless. Children might want to help but the ADRD might not like them. Elderly might be able to handle the ADRD during the day but experience unbearable night challenges. (Perhaps there should be Adult Night Care.)</p>
<p>Whoever they were that you loved, as a spouse or a parent, only exists in decreasingly rare glimpses and disease ramifications have made them unknowable. Maybe they occasionally know you and maybe they just know your name. This can continue for 10-15 years.</p>
<p>Children can't and should not be exposed to this unnecessarily because they are not sufficiently mature to handle it. No one really is. Even adults struggle with being accused of something they never did or being hit when violence was never a part of their life. Why should children have to deal with it when the ADRD might not like having them around? Each case is different but the presented characteristics are common.</p>
<p>Family problems range from lack of cooperation to money and estate issues. I will address this in the section on mediation. However, the recommended approach is through professional ongoing interdisciplinary interaction where intergenerational support is gratuitous or not necessarily family related.</p>
<p>Caretakers are daily exposed to the ravages of this disease and are highly motivated. If a USF professor discovers that when the stress related protein FKBP51 partners with protein Hsp90 it contributes to tau toxicity, we want to find out more. If a student grandchild sees the disease progress, preferably infrequently, research becomes more interesting and an interest in biogenetics, psychiatry or neuroscience might emerge. In those cases, you will start to see intergenerational support in ways you never contemplated.</p>
<p>Research grants issue to the scientific community. (Caretakers become very annoyed when scientific research monies are redirected for any reason particularly industry self training.) Subsidized research finds its way into professional journals inaccessible to the general public except though subscription, per article payment or university affiliation. Accumulated costs to review research for interested caretakers and students coupled with the cost of distance viewing of conference presentations is collectively exorbitant, effectively denying the intended beneficiaries access. I believe the cost of the 2013 pharmaceutical industry report on international advances on Alzheimer's drugs is $1600. Yet they want us to participate in their trials. Journals cost about $37 an article. The Alzheimer's Organization charged $500+ to caretakers for internet viewing of conference proceedings though they exist by virtue of our ADRD.</p>
<p>This somewhat circuitous and incestuous proprietary orientation creates an informational glass ceiling caretakers and students can't afford to break through. Information actually conveyed is usually abstract in content although there are exceptions. NIH did permit free web cam access to the 2012 Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit. Some universities, like University of Miami, permit distance access, without charge, to cognitive training at a level sufficiently advanced to be of interest.</p>
<p>The State Library System could be engaged in concert with state universities to assist access. Alzheimer's national and international interdisciplinary publications on all matters from the scientific (journals on molecular biology, neuroscience, and biogenetics) to new forms of cognitive interventions are of interest along with conferences and lectures. Caretakers and students can get to the local library or access through Kindle etc.</p>
<p>Many caretakers are certified in their profession and/or have one or more doctorates. As to students, I believe it was a 15 year old that discovered an inexpensive strip test for a type of cancer a few years ago. One scientist who was participating in the UW "foldit" program of protein structure modeling, (available online to anyone desirous of participation in research) said that his high school son was much more proficient than he was. If you want student interest in this field and you want to help caretakers help their ADRD, respect their level of intelligence and open the door.</p>
<p>A World Autism Center in Jerusalem is underway through the support of the International Center for Autism Research and Education, which is based in New York City. It plans to include a state of the art research facility, a "global platform" for field researchers, continuing education programs and "university level" courses on the condition. It will also have a residency program and will otherwise include advances in autism research including early detection. In other words, it plans to be the world's "largest multidisciplinary center for autism research, diagnosis, treatment and prevention."</p>
<p>I proposed a similar structure for an international Alzheimer's Center, under the umbrella of the 78 nation Alzheimer Federation and in affiliation with the WHO, providing technologically advanced facilities for scientist and independent NGO research, as well as consolidation and development of available international resources and technology addressing cognitive challenges. This would be an interesting project if Florida wanted to take on the challenge (and it could also incorporate facility design elements).</p>
<p><strong>Court Mediation Services, Caretaker Responsibility and Compensation </strong></p>
<p>In recognition of the statistically significant percentage of the future generation who will be full time caretakers of ADRD parents, disputes as to responsibility and compensation for care whether during the life of the ADRD patient or as to unjust estate enrichment for uncompensated services provided as a post DOD claim thereafter, will impose an overwhelming burden on the courts.</p>
<p>There is an immediate need for the state courts to make available, publicize and encourage pre filing court mediation of any and all family/beneficiary disputes relating to care, including caretaker compensation, whether continuing during the term of the caretaking or post DOD in estate distribution, immediately on diagnosis or indication of need, and reducing same to written agreement. In the absence of such agreement and to the extent this becomes an estate issue, mediation should immediately follow the assertion of an unjust enrichment claim by the caretaker.</p>
<p>Most family disputes are based on allocation of caretaking responsibilities and compensation. Family members may refuse to participate except when their financial interests are concerned at which time they become highly active. Caretakers struggle to find time to sleep much less take on a court battle for compensation particularly when liquidity is limited, they have already lost their income and the only asset is the home.</p>
<p>Absent agreement or early court intervention, an unjust enrichment claim may be asserted against the estate post DOD. Historically these were difficult because there was a presumption that family caretaking should be gratuitous. However, recently and thanks to the Alzheimer's Organization, the nature of ADRD and the demanding nature of the care is receiving international public attention. Courts are now recognizing this claim in ADRD cases and some states have passed laws specifically providing for caretaker compensation.</p>
<p>Provision for special needs or other trusts may not be available or have been addressed in many of these cases. This goes further. Caretaking is sufficiently traumatic without family dissension. Early, expeditious and affordable recourse is essential. Mediation provides it.</p>
<p>This is particularly critical since caretakers of Alzheimer's patients, who collectively save the government billions of dollars are (1) denied Social Security disability benefits, no matter medical conditions which would otherwise justify entitlement or prior contributions to Social Security, usually spanning decades, because of the time restricted credits contribution prerequisite to qualification, (2) further penalized by reduction in future social security benefits by inability to contribute during the protracted caretaking period which consumes what would have been the most economically significant period of their lives, and (3) denied unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>Often, caretakers do not receive compensation (or later assert unjust enrichment claims against the estate) because of (1) insufficient resources, (2) family dissension, (3) exhaustion, and/or (4) a general feeling of obligation toward the afflicted parent or spouse which would make taking compensation for caring personally offensive. They are usually unaware of the loss of Social Security disability benefits for failure to contribute during the caretaking period, have no idea of the potential for their physical harm and immune system collapse from the disease or are unable to do anything about it. They can lose income, savings, assets, and children's college funds during a caretaking period which can continue for ten years or more.</p>
<p>At best, if a personal caretaker, at the end, they are old, they have lost their professional marketability, they don't have the physical strength or emotional stamina to pick up their lives and they are usually medically in trouble. The experience is not unlike PTSD and the caretaker has become the patient without a caretaker. At that point, caretakers are advised that, not only is the enrichment of SS by their efforts not acknowledged, but they are penalized by SSA for the caretaking period in the denial of essential benefits and are denied unemployment benefits. This injustice needs to be addressed and rectified.</p>
<p><strong>Solicitation Practices and Non Profits </strong></p>
<p>In June and July 2013, Tampa Bay Tribune issued an expose' of charitable industry abuse, misuse and outright fraud in solicitation practices. "America's Worst Charities" is the result of collaboration with the California Center for Investigative Reporting, the nation's largest and longest serving nonprofit newsroom dedicated to watchdog journalism. CNN joined the partnership in March. Reports indicate that even the best charities may have a solicitation/public relations cost of up to 40%. After that, take away the balance for infrastructure support which may still not be sufficient if labor intensive services are involved. How much makes its way down the pike to the victims? It is just an overwhelming struggle particularly in today's economy when governments are facing their own crisis. <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page">http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page</a></p>
<p>There are too many low rent operators in Florida, operating out of post office drop boxes and, through internet and other solicitation practices, holding themselves out as ADRD research or educational ventures without qualifications or staff. The underlying motivation is to non profit salary themselves by redirecting funds which should have gone to dedicated university and brain institute research scientists. In furtherance of the public trust which motivated the donation, it is time to take a closer look at the ventures legally permissible in this state and weed out the scams.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>STATEMENT FOR THE RECORD SUBMITTED TO THE<br />
					Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services<br />
					U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center">April 29, 2014</p>
<p>AARP appreciates the opportunity to comment as the Advisory Council prepares to make 2014 recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (National Plan). AARP's mission is to enhance the quality of life for all as we age. Living independently, connected to family, friends and community is key to a high quality of life. As we age, a decline in cognitive health is not only one of people's greatest fears, but it is also one of the greatest threats to living independently and a high quality of life. As with all family caregivers and the loved ones they are helping, tangible steps can be taken to improve the quality of care, quality of outcomes, and quality of life for people living with dementia and their family caregivers. As this country moves forward with the National Plan goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025, we also need to move forward with more effective care for those already affected by dementia, including better care coordination and planning, better access to affordable care, and support for family caregivers who take care of their loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>A. Translate evidence-based, person and family-centered care into widespread practice. </strong></p>
<p>It is important to expand person and family-centered care models broadly to reach the tens of millions of people and their families who could benefit from them. We know that person and family-centered models of dementia care that emphasize continuity of care and coordinate across settings and providers can also improve outcomes. Thanks to academic researchers across the country and the support from federal agencies who are represented on the Advisory Council such as the National Institutes of Health, the Administration for Community Living, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, we have developed an evidence-base from which we can implement better care.<sup>1</sup> In some cases, in addition to improving individual outcomes, we can even deter or delay expensive, disruptive, unwanted hospitalization and institutionalization.<sup>2</sup> Both domestically and internationally, models of care exist which demonstrate interventions that preserve abilities, improve behaviors, and reduce caregiver burden. These models show that we can do more to help those with a diagnosis of dementia -- and find ways to do it in responsible, cost-effective ways.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Despite the evidence that we can improve outcomes for people with dementia, these models of care are unfortunately neither widely known nor widely adopted. All too often, people either go untreated, or even after diagnosis, think there is nothing that can be done. It is important to educate people with dementia and their family caregivers that medical, social and behavioral interventions can help even while we struggle to find a cure for the future. <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>That is why AARP urges the Council to redouble their efforts around goals 2 and 3 of the plan:<br />
					Goal 2: To enhance care quality and efficiency and<br />
					Goal 3: Expand supports for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families.</p>
<p>More broadly, individuals and their family caregivers should be made aware of interventions that can help them.</p>
<p><strong>B. Apply evidence-based quality of care across all settings -- for those living at home receiving care through primary care settings, as well as in residential and institutional settings. </strong></p>
<p>Individuals should receive quality care no matter where they live. As the Advisory Council considers how to achieve the goal of enhanced quality and efficiency of care for those with dementia, it is critical to think about the care provided for those with dementia living in different types of settings. People often live with dementia for long periods of time -- and dementia manifests itself over a continuum of time and abilities. Therefore, quality care needs to adapt over a continuum as well.</p>
<p>AARP is striving to make it easier for older people to live with independence and remain in their homes and communities for as long as they can, surrounded by family and friends. People with dementia are often happier and have more control in their own familiar home, and with the right help and support, they too can continue to live independently.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>While we want people to have the option of living in their homes as long as possible, for some people, particularly those who face advanced stages of dementia, living in a residential setting or nursing home may be the best option for them. Clearly these people still want and deserve to live life on their terms, with dignity and respect, and need high quality care that is affordable and sustainable. Our emphasis on promoting independent living applies to people living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities as well as in home or other smaller community settings.</p>
<p><strong>C. Recognize that quality of care also must include family caregiver support. </strong></p>
<p>In 2009, about 42 million family caregivers in the United States provided care to an adult with limitations in daily activities at any given point in time. They provided unpaid care valued at $450 billion that year, more than total Medicaid spending in 2009 and more than twice the total for paid services and supports, according to AARP's Public Policy Institute.<sup>6</sup> The Alzheimer's Association estimates that more than 15 million of those caregivers are providing care for someone with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>While this concept is important in family caregiving broadly, best practices of care for those with dementia recognize caregiver well-being is essential to maintaining the well-being and abilities of the individual as well.<sup>8</sup> It has been clearly established that counseling and support for spousal caregivers of those with dementia benefit the individual, family caregiver and society. Individuals whose family caregivers received the counseling and support interventions designed by the New York University Caregiver Intervention Study compared to usual care experienced a 28.3% reduction in the rate of nursing home placement.<sup>9</sup> A 2012 report released by AARP's Public Policy Institute and the United Hospital Fund also found that almost half of family caregivers perform medical/nursing tasks for care recipients, such as managing multiple medications and helping with assistive devices for mobility.<sup>10</sup> Families generally do not receive training and other assistance to help them provide care. Such training and supports also benefit the person receiving the assistance.</p>
<p>We need to help the millions of family caregivers navigate the confusing care systems to provide assistance for their loved ones and otherwise support them in their caregiving roles. Family caregivers should be given an assessment of their needs and then receive help based on the assessment, especially when a care or discharge plan depends on a family caregiver voluntarily providing services to an individual. Such assistance should include information, training, counseling, links to community resources, help locating services, respite care, or other supports. In September, a federally appointed Commission on Long-Term Care released a report with important bipartisan recommendations to help build a better system to support individuals and their family caregivers nationwide. <sup>11</sup> Importantly, the Commission called for a national strategy to address the needs of family caregivers. The Commission specifically recommended assessing family caregivers and their needs in the care planning process, including family caregivers in patients' health records and as members of care teams, ensuring family caregivers have access to relevant information technology and, importantly, encouraging family caregiver interventions, including respite, training, and other supportive services. We need to provide the support and tools to all family caregivers so that both the recipient and provider of care can sustain themselves.</p>
<p><strong>D. Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>AARP is dedicated to improving the quality of care to all individuals who need long-term services and supports (LTSS) and supporting creative, innovative mechanisms by which that care can be personalized, delivered, evaluated and financed. We know that older adults with end stage dementia are some of the most complicated and expensive individuals with LTSS needs. They often are living with multiple chronic conditions -- and if we can improve the quality of care for those with dementia, we can use those lessons to improve the care for all people with LTSS needs. Focusing on concrete steps to deliver on goals 2 and 3 of the plan could help make significant strides to assist all older adults and their families.</p>

<p>I'm writing to ask NAPA to get behind the new global symbol for dementia. No longer can we have each country or organization spending resources to develop their own propriety symbol or resources.

<p>I won't quote the stats on dementia. I know this council is very aware of them. Please add fuel to the fire and join this massive movement that started in the UK and has spread around the world.

<p>As a caretaker for my husband who is one of the millions diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease, I urge NAPA to embrace and get behind the Purple Angel Project. It is anunique symbol representing all types of dementia. While the ribbons which represent many different diseases are well known, there are many ribbons of the same color representing different diseases. The Purple Angel would be immediately recognizable as representing dementia awareness world wide. I know that you are aware of the epidemic which is projected to happen in the future and the more people become aware of dementias the more people will be able to be helped as they take the dementia journey.</p>

<p>I work as a CPN in Later life services in Manchester. I received an email from a colleague who is involved in a awareness raising in dementia campaign ,as I am myself. The very simple Purple Angel logo is recognised all across UK and globally as a symbol of hope.</p>
<p>The Hope is that communities will commit to being dementia friendly and stigma associated with this brain disease will lessen.Showingthe logo is by way of pledge to stand together to make this happen.</p>
<p>I trust if you read about the efforts of Norman McNamara(Norm Mac on Facebook ) who has Lewy Body dementia and is the inspiration behind the Purple Angel Ambassador(PAA) initiative, further information is available on the following sites.</p>

<p>December 11, 2013 was a great day for those living with dementia. That was the day of the G8 Dementia Summit. Many became energized that day; motivated to find a cure for dementia and to improve the lives of those who are living with the disease. They realized the importance of including those living with the disease in the process. And although I am disappointed that the US did not take the lead in this world health crisis, it was still a huge step in the right direction, and there is no reason why we cannot catch up.</p>
<p>We need to create jobs in the scientific world and keep the money and the brightest minds here. We could use the HIV model that was so successful. The long-term gain will be a huge return on the money invested plus the many lives we save. While we have some great plans in place we must push harder for funding and make the hard choices.</p>
<p>Please keep this momentum going and do not be afraid to rock the boat for this cause. That is the only way we will win this battle.</p>
<p>I have heard representatives from many organizations speak at these meetings, and I sometimes feel they see it as an opportunity to advertise their company or organization. I think they forget why they are here.</p>
<p>Many speakers represent those living with FTD, Down Syndrome, and Lewy Body, as well as dementia. What I find interesting is that although they are all involved in the same cause they all seem incapable or unwilling to join forces with other organizations and work together. It seems they feel that their cause or issue is more important. My message to them and others is this: it is not about <em>your</em> organization, it is about the people you represent.</p>
<p>It amazes me that many people still don’t know about NAPA, those who do should share this information so others living with the disease have the opportunity to be heard. I have been coming to these meetings for a long time, and I rarely see any other attendees who are also impacted by Alzheimer’s/dementia. In fact it was I who brought someone along with me to speak at the last meeting. As organizations representing people living with dementia, it is your job to invite them to these meetings.</p>
<p>It is imperative that you see and hear the people who are living with this disease. The committee has to realize we desperately need your help, and it is only through your work and the work of others that we will get to a cure. So please provide information about these meetings on all your websites, and encourage participation from everyone, you know many of these people, pick up the phone and find a way to bring them here. It’s because of them you are doing this.</p>
<p>Please join us by using the Purple Angel World logo on your websites and awareness campaigns as a symbol of support for enhancing dementia awareness, hope, and empowerment for all. This symbol represents all types of dementias. The Purple Angel was created in Great Britain to become that universal symbol, representing our united support, joining together to raise dementia awareness on a global basis; as well as our hope that, one day, researchers will find a cure! This is a grass roots campaign driven by the people living with the disease and the care partners.</p>
<p>Please Adopt ONE symbol that will come to represent our global message and mission of RAISING awareness, HOPE, and EMPOWERMENT FOR ALL PEOPLE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA, THEIR FAMILIES, AND THEIR CARE PARTNERS. Let’s stop the confusion.</p>
<p>This is the first NAPA meeting I have missed, but I am determined to live my life to the fullest and am taking a tour around Australia, New Zealand and Bali on a cruise. I hope to see you all the next time.</p>
<p>Please remember we are all in this together, and as such we must all learn to work with each other so we can become stronger. Please put your politics aside for the greater good.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Helen Lamont not only for reading this out in my absence, but for always being there for me. She has no idea the difference she has made in my life in giving me the opportunity to be a part of all this. It has given me a purpose, I want to go on living, and to change the world. And I know that together we can do that.</p>

<p>Attached is my speech from yesterday for the public record. It was nice to see you all yesterday and I really liked the accommodations. For me it made it so much better to be in the middle so I could get a better view and clarity of who was speaking. Thanks so much for you offer to read my next speech. I wish you a very safe and wonderful holiday season.</p>

<p>Jane Tilly made some comments about ACL and ADSSP programs. It sounds like some great things are starting to happen. I just hope they are involving people with YOAD in the creation of these programs.</p>
<p>During my time as an advocate I have made contact with people all over the world, and I have come to realize that there are some great and pioneering programs happening out there in the dementia arena. Some are based on scientific research, and some are not but they all have great outcomes. Unfortunately these programs go unnoticed by the majority of people. I have seen famous institutions try to invent a program from scratch, unaware that the same program had been established in the same area some time-ago. This wastes time, money and vital resources that can be better spent on other ventures.</p>
<p>A good example comes from a well-known scientist based on the west coast with whom I spoke with a few weeks ago. We were discussing a new trial he was considering perusing, a trial that he assumed was the first of its kind. However, I had previously spoken to a person on the east coast who had already started a similar program. Knowing that the program had already been established elsewhere saved the scientist time and money. This is a clear reason why it is vital that information be shared.</p>
<p>We must develop a way of sharing the best ideas from around the world, and at the same time educate people. An ideal solution would be to have an international information portal where people can share ideas, and upload information about programs that have been created. The site will have an administrator whose job it is to review the information provided.</p>
<p>The portal should be broken down into categories including location, type of program e.g. drug trial or meeting and who it suits best. Ideally there will have a top three recommendations. An already-existing government site would be an ideal place for this portal to be located.</p>
<p>At our last meeting I mentioned the need for dementia-friendly communities and businesses, and that I was in talks with a local hospital in my area. Well I am happy to announce that after two long years the hospital has now not only decided to create a dementia-friendly hospital, they have also decided to educate and engage the community so we can build a dementia-friendly community.</p>
<p>This vision has been shared with the committee and I hope that this program can be used as a model that can be rolled out across the US. I hope to put Doylestown PA on the map as being a true dementia-friendly community, because until we have a cure we must create environments that enable and encourage those living with dementia to live full and productive lives within our communities.</p>
<p>I believe the best ideas come from those directly impacted by dementia since they know what it's like to deal with this disease. So many like me can be true assets if given the opportunity to be included in the process. The sad fact is that many institutions and programs are not willing to include us which I cannot understand. How can you resolve the issues that affect us if you do not completely understand them all? Companies, organizations, health providers and the public need to be encouraged to use us as a resource.</p>
<p>By taking these steps we will start to eradicate the stigma that goes hand in hand with this disease.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to be changed to take into account those who are no longer able to operate a vehicle safely, but not to impact those, like me, who are still able to drive. First responders need educating, and a system needs to be created that will help identify a dementia patient.</p>
<p>In my opinion awareness continues to be the biggest problem for those impacted by dementia. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show that Alzheimer's is a disease that affects all ages and not just associated with getting older. Education will lead to many other benefits.</p>
<p>While it is very important that people know that there is no cure; that those affected will die, there should be no excuse for not encouraging those who have the diagnosis to live life to the fullest. Having a diagnosis of dementia does not mean we lose our willingness to live, or motivation to contribute to society. We need opportunities to engage in meaningful activities throughout the course of the disease.</p>
<p>We should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. While this is still a taboo subject we must talk about these issues.</p>
<p>I hope you have read my vision. I welcome the opportunity to speak with you further and go into more details. My idea highlights the problems and points to a simple solution, but it's not the only solution. I leave that up to those who understand the system better then I. I just took a stab at it.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the committee for electing a member who has dementia. This is an important role, with a great deal of responsibility being placed on the elected member to represent us in an adequate manner. As a person with Alzheimer's who serves on the PA State committee I know how challenging it is to be a part of the process, and to communicate with the people I serve with because of my disease. We as representatives and advocates need to be effective, and as the disease progresses and renders us ineffective we need to have the strength and fortitude to step down, and allow another with the disease to take the reins. Mr. Moore, I wish you the best of luck, we are all counting on you. Please feel free to reach out to me and your friends living with dementia.</p>
<p>Good Luck Don and I will miss you!</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>As the more than 300 residents of Villa Gardens, a Continuing Care Retirement Community in Pasadena, California, we witness every day the tragic decline of friends and family members affected by Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. We write now to strongly support and ask you to support the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) enacted in 2011.</p>
<p>Dementia in its many forms, including Alzheimer 's disease, affects more than 5.2 million people in this country. <strong>Its cost in 2013 will total an estimated $203 billion</strong>, including $142 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid. Total payments for health care, long-term care and hospice for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias are projected to increase from $203 billion in 2013 to $1.2 trillion in 2050 (in current dollars). This dramatic rise includes a 500% increase in combined Medicare and Medicaid spending: $107 Billion in Medicare, $35 Billion in Medicaid, and $61 Billion in personal and other expenses. (These figures are taken directly from the 2013 National Plan.)</p>
<p>We feel certain that you are familiar with these figures but also recognize that there are many issues, both global and national, of critical importance on your plate right now. One is certainly the fiscal health of our country. We were delighted to see President Obama and Congress take a step in addressing this humanitarian need when they passed NAPA. We also believe that it is now a Congressional Imperative to make the funds available to accomplish what NAPA promises.</p>
<p>We ask you, a highly respected and influential member of Congress, to ensure that NAPA receives the financial support it deserves. While, as a nation, we respond to the humanitarian needs of the global community we must also respond, as we have not yet adequately done, to a need of tremendous significance and magnitude on our own doorstep.</p>
<p>We would also appreciate hearing from you about what you see as the probability of NAPA funding and any other steps we can take to support NAPA.</p>

<p>Below are my comments for the public record. If you can group this with the earlier files I sent you that would be great. This being first. Thanks</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>Some comments on the earlier topic on CMS.</p>
<p>In reference to the availability of PET Amyloid scans.</p>
<p>I think it is very important to the outcome of people like me to these tools.</p>
<p>For me it took 9 years to get a diagnoses. It was not until I received the PET scan that it confirmed that something was truly wrong. Many insurance companies still do not pay for that test. I cannot begin to tell you how many times I had repeat many of the test hoping for an answer. I even had 3 Neuropsychological tests that cost over $2500.00 each during that time.</p>
<p>Because of this diagnose.</p>
<p>I was able to start my medications.</p>
<p>Start my end of life planning and make plans to live life to the fullest in the short time I had left.</p>
<p>Able to get in Clinical trials</p>
<p>Apply for disability</p>
<p>Able to now focus my effort to being an advocate for the disease which had now given me a new life's purpose.</p>
<p>When I need surgery the doctor was able to avoid anesthetics contraindicated in AD.</p>
<p><strong>The delay in my diagnose led to being fired from my job and losing the very benefits I had contributed to that would have taken care of me for the rest of my life. It would have even simplified it for my caregiver. Now we both suffer. I lost it all and must rely on social security. </strong></p>
<p>I would like to personally thank this advisory council for supporting the Department of Health and Human Services decision to include someone living with dementia on the committee. I believe people around the world will view this as a major step forward for people with dementia. Ideally this should set an example to be followed by all people, businesses and organizations. While we may have a progressive disease we still have a lot to contribute to society if we are just given the chance. It is decisions such as this that will help reduce stigma, and prove to people what we are capable of doing. I speak for myself and many others when I say thank you so much.</p>
<p>As some of you know I have been appointed to the PA State Alzheimer's Planning Committee. I was very excited by the feedback I received after the first meeting on the commitment to make the plan successful before it was even discussed or even created. I wish I could be as excited about the work being accomplished here at NAPA. While there are great ideas coming from all of you, and plans and polices are being created, there is still a distinct lack of funding. Many of you here have the power to influence those who are in a position to increase funding; I encourage you to do more. We are all aware that Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease of the century, more than heart disease and cancer, yet the leaders chose to do nothing, in effect ignoring those of us who are dying in the most horrible way possible. The funding that we have for this disease is even less today than before; we are heading the wrong way. Many people get excited by the comment on proposed budget increases; people like me only get excited on the actual budget changes. Budget proposals are even more disappointing than the failure of clinical trials.</p>
<p>For some time I have worked on putting together a vision of what people with dementia need. I believe many people have an idea of what is required, but I feel the best ideas come from those directly impacted by dementia because those of us who are living with dementia know how we feel, and what we need. My vision has been shared with the PA state, and I have sent a copy to all those on the NAPA Advisory Council. It is my hope that this document becomes shared with all the states and other parts of the world. I would also be more than happy to expand on the reasoning behind what I came up with and why I felt it would be a benefit to not only the people living with this disease but also their family and friends. I hope you take what I have written and use it as a guideline for what is needed and you create a model of best practices for others to use.</p>
<p>Below is a list of issues as I see them from my introduction statement on June 7th that I shared with the PA state committee.</p>
<p>In my opinion awareness is the biggest problem. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show that Alzheimer's is a disease that affects all ages; it is not just associated with getting older. I know of a 30-year-old, and a 29-year-old who have it.</p>
<p>Stigma of the disease must be eradicated.</p>
<p>Companies and communities must treat this like any other disability.</p>
<p>State laws need to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve immediately.</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is.</p>
<p>People should be fast-tracked for social security instead of being treated like crooks while they are getting deeper into hardship.</p>
<p>First responders need educating, and a system needs to be created that will help identify us without becoming a target for others.</p>
<p>We need a way to deal with our guns.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those who are no longer capable, and not to impact those that are still able to drive.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways if we are looking to make it better for those impacted.</p>
<p>Need to encourage dementia-friendly communities and businesses.</p>
<p>We must be able to live life to the fullest even though we have the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Having a diagnosis of dementia does not mean we lose our willingness or motivation to be contributing members of society. We need opportunities to engage in meaningful activities throughout the course of the disease.</p>
<p>We must encourage the research and provide funding.</p>
<p>Trials need to provide more flexibility by using communication technology.</p>
<p>Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia.</p>
<p>Patients should be made aware of the living wills which should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p>I hope you will now look at my vision and give it consideration.</p>
<p>I thank you for your new and improved plan, but we are far from being able to take a bow for any real credit. So much more must be done.</p>
<p><em>I'd like to thank the Alzheimer's Association for making it possible for me to be at NAPA.</em></p>

<p>Re: Recommendations for a National Uniform Law Regulating Elder Facilities, Court PrefilingMediation of ADRD Family Caretaker Responsibility and Compensation, Amendment to the SSA on Caretaker Disability Entitlement and the establishment of a World Alzheimer's Institute</p>
<p>I have reviewed the NAPA Plan, as updated, and thank the Alzheimer's Organization for its awareness efforts. Consolidated informal comments and recommendations from caretakers, attorneys and health care professionals follows. I thank NIH for its continuing publications on clinical trials and health related issues and the FDA for its oversight function and providing assistance to caretakers filing notices of clinical trial mismanagement. Specific recommendations fully within NAPA authority are contained at the end of this statement.</p>
<p>I am an attorney who has been in the Alzheimer's trenches for fifteen years. We had a triple dose of this insidious disease in my extended family. I handled a level 6 case 24/7 for ten years. During this period and continuing post DOD, I remain committed to interdisciplinary research from the progression of clinical efforts to find a cure to identifying ways to improve the quality of life of those afflicted with Alzheimer's in the absence thereof. I retain an ongoing interest in the welfare of the hundreds of caretakers I have met over the years and concern with the inevitable ruinous impact of this disease on the next generation.</p>
<p>The industry report on AD entitled "<strong>Alzheimer's Drugs Market, 2012 - 2017</strong> was issued in May 2013. It is a comprehensive document which the extensive outline, (including mention of NAPA) clearly demonstrates with key objective to establish the likely evolution of leading drugs, generics and launch of new drugs across the different regions in the world. I watched the NIH sponsored Alzheimer'sDisease Research Summit 2012: Path to Treatment and Prevention in real time, paid particular attention to counsel and came away with no hope of cooperation for obvious proprietary legal intellectual property and economic reasons which are without the control of the NIH. In fact, it appears that the scope of any cooperation is extremely sensitive since even the appearance of infringement could result in litigation which holds up distribution of a viable curative pharmaceutical indefinitely.</p>
<p>There is some disappointment with a few NAPA initiatives perceived as a disservice to victims of ADRD without a voice who are pleading for protection and to the caretakers who give up everything to provide support.</p>
<p>I don't see the DOJ, the FDA or the IRS and United States Patent Office on your federal agency list? I don't see the ABA Commission on Aging/NAELA charged with a NAPA mandate to address legal issues in this area. Perhaps you need a broader resource base. Everyone wants to help.</p>
<p>As to the alzheimers.gov, you have a list of drugs on your site for ADRD care. The FDA has stated that certain drugs are contraindicated with elderly with dementia and are in fact life threatening. Would you please coordinate your representations with the FDA before another elderly person is seriously hurt? Regardless of the $100 million False Claims Act charges and sanctions against J&amp;J relating to Omnicare bribery, either these drugs are approved for use by the elderly ADRD or they are not. Clarification would be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>ADRD population</strong></p>
<p>There is a concern that first, the base from which linear extrapolations have been made as to the number of ADRD is not statistically significant and existing and future service delivery needs will therefore be underestimated. We are not supporting the caretaker population, estimated at 25-30 million, directly or by providing adequate support for prevention of facility neglect and abuse so alternatives to home caretaking will be available.</p>
<p>What will the future hold for high school and college students who justifiably want to know whether and why they should invest in their future if everything is going to fall apart with 50% of the future population ADRD caretaking? At minimum, ADRD educational/training materials should be made available through the state library systems so caretakers/children will have easy and immediate access to free resources.</p>
<p>Second, taken to the extreme, without resolution of the causation issue, does the potential for prion scabie migration/replication through surgical equipment and water supply raise the potential for contagion and exponential as opposed to linear expansion of this population? There are patents available which deal with prion destruction in surgical equipment sterilization not currently accomplished with traditional techniques. Is it possible to address these concerns?</p>
<p><strong>Social Security Disability and Caretakers</strong></p>
<p>The SSA discriminates against caretakers of ADRD as a class in denial of disability benefits. The theory of liability as to the SS is unjust enrichment No one wants to see this mushroom into a class action but if this injustice is not rectified, another forum for redress will be pursed.</p>
<p>Caretakers of Alzheimer's patients, who collectively save the government billions of dollars are (1) denied Social Security disability benefits, no matter medical conditions which would otherwise justify entitlement or prior contributions to Social Security, usually spanning decades, because of the time restricted credits contribution prerequisite to qualification, (2) further penalized by reduction in future social security benefits by inability to contribute during the protracted caretaking period which often consumes what would have been the most economically significant period of their lives, and (3) denied unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>Caretakers do not receive compensation (or later assert unjust enrichment claims against the estate) because of (1) insufficient resources, (2) family dissension, (3) exhaustion, and/or (4) a general feeling of obligation toward the afflicted parent or spouse which would make taking compensation for caring personally offensive. They are usually unaware of the loss of disability benefits for failure to contribute during the caretaking period, have no idea of the potential for their physical harm and immune system collapse from the disease or are unable to do anything about it. They can lose income, savings, assets, and children's college funds during a caretaking period which can continue for ten years or more.</p>
<p>Many of us started caretaking in the 90's when we were in our 40's and continued through our late 50's. There is no way to accurately convey the absolute shock of initial ADRD diagnosis and the immediate and complete upheaval and destruction of finances, health, and professional and personal life. The unrelenting stress of the behavioral challenges of this horror of a disease, ongoing sleep deprivation occasioned bysundowning and the sporadic and unpredictable agitation/violence which can result in actual physical injury to the caretaker are not the only challenges. The caretaker must deal with non ADRD medical conditions attendant to the aging process.</p>
<p>Spouse caretakers usually predecease the AD patient since the stress of caretaking destroys the immune system. If children take on the responsibility they are similarly affected. Although ADRD manifests itself differently in each individual, the one common thread is the impact on the caretakers. They deal with the protracted trauma of losing the essence of their loved one years before the actual physical death. At best, if a personal caretaker, at the end, they are old, they have lost their professional marketability, they don't have the physical strength or emotional stamina to pick up their lives and they are usually medically in trouble.</p>
<p>The experience is not unlike PTSD and the caretaker has become the patient without a caretaker.</p>
<p>At that point, caretakers are advised that, not only is the enrichment of SS by their efforts not acknowledged, but they are penalized by SSA for the caretaking period in the denial of essential benefits. This injustice needs to be addressed and rectified through (1) amendment to SSA disability prerequisites relating to entitlement based time restricted contribution period for ADRD and other caretakers, or (2) a class action against the SSA for unjust enrichment of the fund attributable to private caretakers efforts and in the denial of benefits to caretakers who would otherwise qualify for disability.</p>
<p><strong>Court Mediation Services on Caretaker Responsibility and Compensation</strong></p>
<p>In recognition of the statistically significant percentage of the future generation who will be full time caretakers of ADRD parents, disputes as to responsibility and compensation for care whether during the life of the ADRD patient or as to unjust estate enrichment for uncompensated services provided as a post DOD claim thereafter, will impose an overwhelming burden on the courts.</p>
<p>There is an immediate need for the state courts to make available, publicize and encourage prefilingcourt mediation of any and all family/beneficiary disputes relating to care, including caretaker compensation, whether continuing during the term of the caretaking or post DOD in estate distribution, immediately on diagnosis or indication of need, and reducing same to written agreement. In the absence of such agreement and to the extent this becomes an estate issue, mediation should immediately follow the assertion of an unjust enrichment claim by the caretaker.</p>
<p>When care facilities are undesirable or financially impractical, the burden falls on the family particularly in the case of ADRD where 24/7 care is involved. In many cases, qualified at home care providers are not available or are unwilling to do AD because it is just too hard. The comment I received from an agency representative was "life is too short". Unqualified at home care providers pose a danger to the patient.</p>
<p>There is a saying in the AD community that "there is always one" (family member) who assumes primary and often sole responsibility for care. Most family disputes are based on allocation of caretaking responsibilities and compensation. Family members may refuse to participate except when their financial interests are concerned at which time they become highly active. Caretakers struggle to find time to sleep much less take on a court battle for compensation particularly when liquidity is limited, they have already lost their income and the only asset is the home.</p>
<p>Absent agreement or early court intervention, an unjust enrichment claim may be asserted against the estate post DOD. Historically these were difficult because there was a presumption that family caretaking should be gratuitous. However, recently and thanks to the Alzheimer's Organization, the nature of ADRD and the demanding nature of the care is receiving international public attention. Courts are now recognizing this claim in ADRD cases and some states have passed laws specifically providing for caretaker compensation.</p>
<p>Provision for special needs or other trusts may not be available or have been addressed in many of these cases. This goes further. Caretaking is sufficiently traumatic without family dissension. Early, expeditious and affordable recourse is essential. Mediation provides it.</p>
<p><strong>The ABA Commission on Aging/NAELA should draft a uniform national law regulating facilities and employees. License should be conditioned on compliance or relinquish entitlement to federal and state benefits/subsidies.</strong></p>
<p>There is an absolute necessity for a national uniform statute/regulations for state enactment regulating ECC, ALF's and SNF's, otherwise conditioning the provision of federal subsidies and benefits on facility compliance and providing stringent sanctions for violations, not only as to the facility, but as to participating health care professionals.</p>
<p>The ABA has successfully taken on uniform national laws in the past and it is particularly critical here. The attorneys from the ABA Commission on Law and Aging/NAELA have the talent and the experience in the trenches of facility abuse to handle this issue. If NAPA fails to give a voice to elderly ADRD through strong advocacy and protection of their interests, they will have failed their mandate.</p>
<p>The Miami Herald issued a three part investigative report in 2011entitled, "Neglected to Death" <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com">http://www.miamiherald.com/neglectedtodeath/index.html#morer</a> This is essential reading for anyone in this field. The Nursing home abuse blog and other resources provides an overview of, for example Emeritus (California - wrongful death, Florida - bed sores, medication misadministration and falsification of medical records etc. etc.) Usually the response is simply to convert to a lower classification of care (independent living) to circumvent future state oversight. The Florida legislature has twice failed to enact legislation to remedy abuse. The industry is now attempting to enact legislation in Florida which will make it more difficult to sue for abuse.</p>
<p>With advance apology to truly outstanding health care professionals delivering quality care, caretakers do not place their loved ones in facilities because the (1) the health, safety and security of the ADRD cannot be assured in substandard, understaffed facilities (2) there is excessive doping (chemical restraints) to compensate for inadequate staffing, (3) the facilities do not take high level ADRD without a 24/7 private aide making it a cost prohibitive venture, (4) Medicaid beds are not made available to ADRD unless the condition developed post initial admission, and (4) the state is lax or nonresponsive in enforcement.</p>
<p>Please understand our collective, absolute fury with your "15%" reduction in doping and demand for clarification. This is a civil rights if not a criminal battery issue. It is not subject to arbitrary and callous treatment as an administrative efficiency issue. Visit an AL or SNF and speak with families and attorneys who specialize in this field. Look at your own deficiency reports on the 620 nursing facilities in Florida alone and the court abuse claims against assisted living facilities. There are a substantial number of attorneys in the ABA Commission on Law and Aging/NAELA who would be happy to provide education.</p>
<p>When elderly are ignored or have ADRD or are otherwise doped with off label drugs for behavioral control purposes, they cannot articulate pain. It is a form of involuntary imprisonment not unlike the Argentinean prisons in the 50's which used a rudimentary form of psychotropic drugs on inmates. (In Florida, drugs are also being used on juvenile detainees to control behavior.) If elderly ADRD are doped when they act out and they act out because they have untreated cancer or undiagnosed medical condition which they are unable to communicate, they face years of pain in a semi comatose condition before their life ends strapped in a wheelchair or urine soaked bed without relief. There is an urgent need for immediate action. This conduct is criminal and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>Which 8.5% of this group are you comfortable abandoning?</p>
<p>We had three experiences with respite in ten years in two high level SNF's and one hospice, each stay under two weeks. The first resulted in a hip fracture with the elderly woman in the next bed in the same condition. (The other woman was given haldoland cried for hours.) The second stay resulted in extensive bruising, a cut on the forehead and a hematoma on both arms. The hospice, situated in a hospital, was advised preadmission that the ADRD could not call for help and, as a fall risk, did not need diapering but needed a commode next to the bed which she could utilize. They put her as far away from the nursing station as possible in a room with a woman who was incapable of any communication, put her in diapers she would not use and put the side bed rails up. Within 8 hours of admission, she had fallen attempting to get out of bed to go to the bathroom and had ripped open her leg about 10 inches. When I arrived at 5 am, she was bleeding on the bed. (My father entered a hospital without a mark on his body and was discharged with a stage 3 decubitus with MRSA on his coccyx.) All of this has to stop now.</p>
<p>To the extent doping, neglect and abuse is not rectified, elderly will continue suffering and families will forfeit their livelihood, savings, children college funds and quality of life to keep their loved ones safe at home. Please do not make it the policy of NAPA to tolerate any form of institutionalized abuse.</p>
<p>Many facilities are not capable of or are unwilling to provide essential services to insure the safety and care of their elderly residents. There are too many profiteer operators opening what are essentially extended stays with food service, mandating understaffed facilities to achieve a substantial owner benefit/ROI without regard for the quality of life of their residents.</p>
<p>There is an absolute necessity to continuously inspect and severely economically sanction those substandard facilities which harm the elderly. Take action to discipline or revoke the licenses of operators and staff that participated in or were aware of violations or falsified records and failed to report same. Similarly, federal or state trustee supervised independent contractor assumption of operational activity should be provided to bring a facility into compliance with the cost of same borne by the owner/operator. Sanctions should be automatic and not negotiable.</p>
<p>The foregoing does not overlook and in fact should aggressively pursue actions for assault, battery, criminal negligence and endangerment, pain medication theft and financial abuse as appropriate through the prosecutor, not the ombudsman, who, in turn, should immediately notify all concerned federal and state concerned authorities of the pendency of any investigation and subsequent charges. I have discussed this matter with major city police from San Francisco to Boston and they have horrifying tales.</p>
<p>This industry is unable to regulate itself. The recent ALA request for state plans was disappointing. Florida ALA declined to do its own report and adopted the Texas plan. None are particularly effective in addressing resident issues if reform would economically burden the owner.</p>
<p>The uniform national law act should set forth, with specificity, optimal minimum standards for facility operation including but not limited to</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Qualification and licensing of owners/operators (in Florida you need high school to operate an ALF),</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Program of cognitive/sensory activities for ADRD. Identification of advanced cognitive conditions which mandate immediate facility release and transfer to a specialized facility dealing with memory care or to a SNF if attendant medical issues, (The advent of IPADS and touch screens opens new door in this area for ADRD who could not negotiate a mouse)</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>HCS's should be able to directly access the patient's records, including medication management and nurses notes through online interactive software access between HCS's and facility. No medication or medical treatment should take place without an HCS's consent. Interactions between medications or other medical conditions and side effects should be self contained within this data base, continuously monitored and addressed. There is no need for handwritten files which can be manipulated/altered pre inspection.</p>
<p>I am an attorney who is aggressive in medication management and I quickly discovered that nurses resented any inquiry. This has to stop. We are HCS's and we need this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There needs to be strict guidelines as to the use of the ombudsman function, the obligation of the ombudsman to immediately refer elder endangerment or possible financial abuse to the appropriate authorities and to advise HSC, POA and family of their options, including referral to counsel and a NAELA contact number or availability of court mediation services. The ombudsman role should be carefully redefined and restricted in scope to matters not possibly criminal in nature. (Some issues are just not appropriate for the ombudsman.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be an absolute prohibition of facility license downgrading to avoid continuing state scrutiny and oversight when the facility is faced with closure at the higher level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DNR forms and living wills have to be uniform nationally. (Florida requires the forms to be in a particular format on yellow paper?)</p>
</li>
</ol><p><strong>The WHO has declared ADRD as an international health crisis. International cooperation requires a different approach from the NAPA plan with consolidation and dedication of international resources solely to scientific research. </strong></p>
<p>The World Health Organization calls on nations to recognize dementia as a global public health crisis. Nobel Laureate, Dr. Stanley Prusiner, immediate past Director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases at UCSF, and recently appointed Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board at the Cleveland Clinic Lou RuvoCenter for Brain Health, along with The Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation which funds the work of Nobel Laureate Dr. Paul Greengardand every other internationally prominent scientist considers Alzheimer's one of the most devastating and grossly underfunded illnesses affecting society and are staunch advocates of a significant increase in funding to make substantial breakthroughs.</p>
<p>A World Autism Center in Jerusalem is underway through the support of the International Center for Autism Research and Education, which is based in New York City. It plans to include a state of the art research facility, a "global platform" for field researchers, continuing education programs and "university level" courses on the condition. It will also have a residency program and will otherwise include advances in autism research including early detection. In other words, it plans to be the world's "largest multidisciplinary center for autism research, diagnosis, treatment and prevention."</p>
<p>A World Alzheimer's Center under the umbrella of the 78 nation Alzheimer Federation in affiliation with the WHO providing technologically advanced facilities for scientist and independent NGO research, as well as consolidation and development of available international resources and technology addressing cognitive challenges should be created. (See eg. Norway's Snoezalen rooms <a href="http://www.snoezeleninfo.com/main.asp">http://www.snoezeleninfo.com/main.asp</a>, advances made by John Hopkin'sCopper Ridge, Melabev in Israel, the Fisher Institute at NYU, the University of Florida's Smart Room, games and brain training to name a few.)</p>
<p>While seed money could be provided through NAPA, this fund is insufficient to provide national support for ADRD research demands much less international efforts. Similarly, the Alzheimer's organization has its own challenges in infrastructure support particularly given the scope of their service delivery.</p>
<p>In June and July 2013, Tampa Bay Tribune issued an expose' of charitable industry abuse, misuse and outright fraud in solicitation practices. "America's Worst Charities" is the result of collaboration with the California Center for Investigative Reporting, the nation's largest and longest serving nonprofit newsroom dedicated to watchdog journalism. CNN joined the partnership in March. Reports indicate that even the best charities may have a solicitation/public relations cost of up to 40%. After that, take away the balance for infrastructure support which may still not be sufficient if labor intensive services are involved. How much makes its way down the pike to the victims? It is just an overwhelming struggle particularly in today's economy when governments are facing their own crisis. <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page">http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page</a></p>
<p>In the absence of sufficient government appropriation and given the cost of fundraising/air time, a new vehicle to accomplish the $5-10 billion needed for ADRD research must be identified and pursued through the international community. It has been suggested (and inspired in part by Google's Razoo) that the search engines should be engaged as the only viable means of effectively coordinating, in every language, a coordinated time restricted massive campaign on the front page of the engines to elicit international financial support to expeditiously achieve essential support. Properly structured, the engines can slice through the overhead to accomplish direct benefit to scientific research in fulfillment of the intent of the donor and the international public trust through the Alzheimer's Federation of 78 nations in affiliation with the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>The current reaction to NAPA is that, despite the best intentions and through no fault, the current approach is underfinanced, piecemeal at best and holds no ascertainable hope of accomplishing an expeditious cure. You need a great deal of money and resources to save the next generation. If you want to accomplish significant goals, you have to put international firepower behind your efforts.</p>

<p>I hope you are doing well and look forward to seeing you on Friday. At my PA state Alzheimer planning committee today I shared the following documents. I am hoping this could become useful document for the NAPA Advisory Council. I would also hope you have a way to share this with all the states. This is a document that I have worked on for over five months and I have had input from many people and organizations in the dementia arena along with 15 other advocates who are dealing with dementia. If you should have any question please feel free to reach out to me. I would also be interested on your thoughts.</p>

					Dementia-Friendly Vision</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
<p>As a person living with this disease I find it a challenge these days to be able to communicate with the rest of the team. While I appear to be very normal when we have short talks, there are many issues that I struggle with. I have lost the sharpness and quick response needed to be able to interact with you all at your level. It makes it even harder when many of you have very high IQs. With time you will learn that while I may not respond immediately, answers come to me many hours later. Sometimes they never do. When I hear conversations I do not hear the entire sentence but part of it, and in my mind I fill in the blanks. It's weird to know you have many answers in your head, but cannot find a way to retrieve them.</p>
<p>Because of all this, and because we are breaking up into various teams I want to ensure I will have the opportunity to share my visions of what I would like to see. Some of these ideas come from others who have created them before me, and many are my own ideas or a combination of both ideas.</p>
<p>There is no true order and some things may even be duplicated due to my lack of recall. I did have help from others in the editing of this document. Below is my short list of issues as I see them from my introduction statement on June 7th.</p>
<p><strong>Public Awareness, Education, &amp; Engagement </strong></p>
<p>In my opinion awareness is the biggest problem. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show younger people who don't understand that Alzheimer is a disease that affects all ages; it is not just associated with getting older. I know of a 30-year-old and a 29-year-old who have it.</p>
<p>The stigma must be eradicated.</p>
<p>Companies and communities must treat this like any other disability.</p>
<p>State laws needs to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve immediately.</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is.</p>
<p>People should be fast-tracked for social security instead of being treated like crooks while they are getting deeper into hardship.</p>
<p>First responders need educating, and a system needs to be created that will help identify us without becoming a target for others.</p>
<p>We need a way to deal with our guns.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those who are no longer capable, and not to impact those that are still able to drive.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways if we are looking to make it better for those impacted.</p>
<p>Need to encourage dementia-friendly communities and business.</p>
<p>We must be able to live life to the fullest even though we have the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Create work environments in which we can still feel productive without penalty to the employer or the person living with the disease.</p>
<p>We must encourage the researcher and provide funding.</p>
<p>Trials need to provide more flexibility by using communication technology.</p>
<p>Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia.</p>
<p>Patients should be made aware of the living wills which should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Communities </strong></p>
<p>My vision of a dementia-friendly community is a bit involved, but if it's implemented it will have a huge impact in many ways. When I think of a dementia-friendly community it refers mostly to those who are in the early to mid stages of the disease. This idea was first started in the UK by my friend Norm McNamara who is living with Lewy Body Dementia.</p>
<p>This community should include first responders, health providers, local businesses, public transportation providers, airports, and the public.</p>
<p>I think the best way to achieve this is to create a system that allows individuals to register with the state, or someone of equal standing, this should include care partners as well as it's important to have emergency info on the caregiver. I would like to see something similar to MedicAlert at a state level.</p>
<p>What follows is a brief outline of the MedicAlert system.</p>
<p><strong>MedicAlert® + Alzheimer's Association Safe Return</strong>® is a 24-hour nationwide emergency response service for individuals with Alzheimer's or a related dementia who wander or have a medical emergency. We provide 24-hour assistance, no matter when or where the person is reported missing.</p>
<ul><li>If an individual with Alzheimer's or a related dementia wanders and becomes lost, caregivers can call the 24-hour emergency response line (1.800.625.3780) to report it.</li>
<li>A community support network will be activated, including local Alzheimer Association chapters and law enforcement agencies. With this service, critical medical information will be provided to emergency responders when needed.</li>
<li>If a citizen or emergency personnel finds the person with dementia, they can call the toll-free number listed on person's MedicAlert + Safe Return ID jewelry. MedicAlert + Safe Return will notify the listed contacts, making sure the person is returned home.</li>
</ul><p>Six in 10 people with dementia will wander and/or get lost. A person with Alzheimer's may not remember their name or address, and can become disoriented, even in familiar places. For people with dementia wandering is dangerous, but there are strategies and services to help prevent it.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association has developed training tools and support programs to prepare law enforcement, EMTs, fire fighters and other first responders when they encounter a person who is wandering.</p>
<p>Anyone who has memory problems and is able to walk is at risk for wandering. Even in the early stages of dementia, a person can become disoriented or confused for a period of time. It's important to plan ahead for this type of situation. Wandering and getting lost can happen during any stage of the disease.</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for the following warning signs:</p>
<ul><li>Returns from a regular walk or drive later than usual</li>
<li>Tries to fulfill former obligations, such as going to work</li>
<li>Tries or wants to "go home", even when at home</li>
<li>Is restless, paces or makes repetitive movements</li>
<li>Has difficulty locating familiar places like the bathroom, bedroom or dining room</li>
<li>Asks the whereabouts of current or past friends and family</li>
<li>Acts as if doing a hobby or chore, but nothing gets done (e.g. moves around pots and dirt without actually planting anything)</li>
<li>Appears lost in a new or changed environment</li>
</ul><p>The information on your medical alert bracelet will connect health professionals with your emergency medical information. We provide memberships and services designed to protect you and your loved ones during a medical emergency or time of need.</p>
<p>MedicAlert's medical bracelets, medical IDs, and other medical jewelry have been used to alert responders of the underlying medical conditions a patient may have - such as allergies, anaphylaxes, diabetes, and autism. First responders are trained by MedicAlert staff to recognize all forms of medical IDs, and our services ensure they get your up-to-date medical information, the moment they need it, to make informed decisions about your treatment and care. MedicAlert services and medical IDs are also used to communicate advance directives and can even help those with Alzheimer's or dementia make it home safely during wandering emergencies.</p>
<p>For more information please visit their website: <a href="http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-safety.asp">http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-safety.asp</a></p>
<p>Those who choose to register would wear a bracelet similar to the one above or some type of dog tag on a chain. By registering the people would be able to take advantage of many benefits. Family would need to register and could be set up when in the clinic for diagnosis as well as info bracelet... ordered and resources given out.</p>
<p>All those registered would be given a unique identification number that will have basic information that could be used in case of emergency. To stop the system being abused or compromised, this information should only be accessible by the relevant people, following a secure procedure and calling a special telephone number and providing the person's ID number. (This would only be accessed by calling a provided number)</p>
<p>It may include information like blood type, allergies, drug information, doctors, emergency contacts, and addresses.</p>
<p>This system needs to be linked with the 911 systems, and the yellow dot program. When a person calls the fire department the address should be flagged immediately when it comes up as a person with dementia living in the residence they are being dispatched to. This is important for many reasons.</p>
<p>A person with dementia may panic in this situation and may not know how to respond to the emergency conditions. They may be much worse than a child in some cases, and just curl up in a corner in fear and just stay there. They may not even speak out when people are calling their name. They may have even started the fire and are scared. They could be combative and the firefighters need to know how to deal with that situation. There are many other reasons why the firemen need to be aware before arriving.</p>
<p>If we ever have some kind of a natural disaster or need to evacuate for some emergency this system will be a major asset, especially for those who may be at home on their own. By being registered this will insure a much better outcome for those who may not be able to think for themselves. Many of these people would not leave with just a simple call and they may not even understand what is said in robo-call type alerts.</p>
<p>If the police are called that should also be flagged immediately. It could be the person with dementia calling in, and not able to articulate the problem. It could even be a false alarm because they are scared when there is really no threat. Sometimes people with dementia have been known to make serious accusations of being threatened by their spouse with a gun, which has led to spouses being locked up for days because the system was not aware of the person's dementia. Again, if members of the emergency services are coming to a house where a person with dementia resides, they need to treat threats in a completely different way otherwise it can escalate and even become deadly.</p>
<p><strong>Issues with Police: Weapons &amp; Driving </strong></p>
<p>While I am on the subject of issues with police there is a document which I shared with the chief of police a few years ago. While some changes are being implemented in some parts of the US, I am not sure they are being addressed in PA. I tried to reach out to my local police department and training facilities, but was just blown off. One of the biggest and most serious issues that I feel needs to be addresses is that of weapons. I came very close to taking my life, and even told a police officer on the telephone, but he refused to do anything. I just wonder how many other people pleaded for help and ended up killing themselves because nobody answered their cry for help. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Sometimes people with dementia get confused or feel threatened and may make accusations that could land someone else in jail. Be prepared to deal with cases like this. They need to be handled very differently from someone without dementia. Some would say like a mental illness. They believe what they are saying is fact.</p>
<p>We require a place to store or remove guns from a home when needed - I came up with a simple way that this could be accomplished without too much impact on the police. A gun safety device can be used to secure the guns in the person's home, and the key can be given to someone responsible. There were other suggestions made.</p>
<p>If someone with Alzheimer's is stopped for a sobriety test they may fail because they have trouble following instructions or poor gait. They may also be much slower with their responses, and may even give you a blind stare because they are confused. They may not be able to follow complex directions. Directions need to be broken down into steps.</p>
<p>I know we want to make the roads safe so we need better testing methods for Alzheimer's patients who drive.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's patients can sometimes become very aggressive and defensive during an argument, they can even become threatening. This is the wrong time to try to remove them from their home. They need to be calmed down first; otherwise it can become a disaster for that person, because many will not understand what is going on.</p>
<p>Be prepared to deal with people who may seek help when they are lost. We can get lost while driving; this does not mean we cannot drive. These two issues are often confused by many.</p>
<p>The car should also have some sort of identification mark. It could be tied-in with the yellow dot system; however, I am concerned that we may become a target because of that. We are much more gullible because of this disease and that could be a very serious issue. I was someone who always kept all those scammers at a far distance, and now I am starting to fall prey to some and think it will only get worse as time goes on and I get worse. It could be on a driver's license, like a donor or class B license. It could be a code that is not obvious to all.</p>
<p><strong>Universal Symbol: The Purple Angel </strong></p>
<p>There is a common logo that is slowly becoming the internationally known symbol for those living with dementia and I think we should use it. It is called the Purple Angel.</p>
<p><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-site-pages/163251/PurpleAngel.jpg" style="height:25px; width:27px" />To be used on all websites and dementia patients information and hospitals</p>
<p><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-site-pages/163251/PurpleAngelStamp.jpg" style="height:28px; width:30px" /> For stores and businesses to show they know and have been educated</p>
<p>This was created by Norm McNamara and is starting to get a lot of recognition. In fact it is now going to be used in some US hospitals as an indicator that the person has cognitive issues; they hang it on the door of the hospital room of the patient. I recommend that we adopt this symbol for all programs connected to dementia-friendly communities.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Hospitals </strong></p>
<p>While I am speaking about hospitals, below is a list of issues that I have been working on with a local hospital in hopes of starting the first dementia-friendly hospital in PA. I was trying to build a training program with the Alzheimer's Association along with a question and answer session with people like me who are living with the disease. Below is the list I have shared with them. Some hospitals are actually doing a quick cognitive test by asking 3 words upon registering to see if there may be a concern even if the person does not have a diagnosis. I would expect that all hospitals would educate staff on the issues, for instance we can easily get lost while trying to find a department as an outpatient.</p>
<p>At registration, identify a person that can and will be able to be involved in all decision-making, along with the patient.</p>
<p>At registration, identify a person that will be given full access to all records on behalf of the patient.</p>
<p>Patients bring in a list of current medications. If for some reason you must change the drug or dosage for any reason, the issue should be addressed with the patient and caregiver to ensure there are no issues (even if it's as simple as converting to a generic). Sometimes patients cannot take another form of the same drug-ask them.</p>
<ul><li>Example: My doctor switched me to Galantamine rather than Aricept because of side effects. In the hospital, they substituted Aricept. (My wife had Galantamine with her, but of course it is a big deal that you should not take your own meds.)</li>
</ul><p>A special ID bracelet should be placed on this type of individual so the staff is alerted that this patient has some form of dementia. This will help them if the patient is acting confused or wandering or just needs a little extra help or explanation. It may also mean that the patient isn't great at making good decisions. If you need a color, purple is perfect.</p>
<ul><li>Example: I needed a Fleet's enema pre-op. The nurse asked if she should give it to me or if I wanted to use it myself in the bathroom. Of course, I offered to do it myself. I found I had difficulty once I got in the bathroom by myself; a bad decision on my part. The nurse should have not given me the option. (We do not want to appear stupid or show our flaws so we may do something to show we are still capable when we may not be.)</li>
</ul><p>I know they always ask the patient for their full name and birthdate - that may be hard at times for us. I can become confused on a good day, in the hospital it can be worse because of pain medication or being awakened suddenly or the stress of just being out of our routine. Maybe another way can be figured out. (Before a name tag is placed on a dementia patient it may require 3 or 4 staff individuals to ask the patient for that information and each must identify the same information before the ID is placed. This will insure the wrong tag is not placed on the patient. Use the verbal ask on critical things like surgery and drugs given the first time the nurse may see the patient)</p>
<p>There are special things one needs to know about using Anesthesia. Anesthetic agents are a cause for concern in AD pathogenesis. Luckily, the field of Anesthesiology has addressed these concerns in an excellent and honest manner. I would defer to their consensus statement:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/108/5/1627.full">http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/108/5/1627.full</a><br /><a href="http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/">http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/</a></p>
<p>The bottom line seems to be to avoid isoflorane.</p>
<p>Do not always consider a patient being confused as a part of the dementia, but it could be much worse due to the drugs they are on. When I was on pain killers my wife could not even get a response from me that made much sense, and she knows what's normal for me.</p>
<p>A real concern exists on what type of drugs the patient may receive for Anesthesia. Pain killers will also have a much greater impact on this type of person.</p>
<p>While ordering food from a menu is simple, it is very overwhelming for me to keep track of things and what items may even go together, or are even needed. I will probably need help with this task.</p>
<p>Don't assume we can figure out how to use items in the room like TV, Phone, call button, and anything else. Please point them out and provide a simple explanation on their use.</p>
<p>Aides should not be the first point of contact. I am not always good at explaining what I need and the aide was not always good at interpreting what I was trying to say. Aides are okay for follow-up or to help with food menus. Again this is why training on all levels is so critical.</p>
<p>When asking a question, give them a minute or two to answer without going on to some other question. You could even ask them to think about it and come back in 5-10 minutes, no longer. This is very subjective depending on the person. We often need a few minutes to gather our thoughts. We might even answer a question right away and then realize a few minutes later that that wasn't what you asked.</p>
<p>Somehow you need to insure the patient response is really correctly given - they sometimes give an answer just to not appear stupid or show they did not understand. Maybe some visual aid or clues can be given along with the verbal depending on the stage the patient is in.</p>
<p>Try to keep items and things in the room in the same place once they determine the best location for them.</p>
<p>I personally feel these patients should be kept a bit longer than the average person, for observation. This would just be to make certain there are no issues at time of release.</p>
<p>Offer a pen and paper to keep in the room. Tell them to write down questions they want to remember to ask when the nurse comes in the room.</p>
<p>Keep in mind many patients with dementia can no longer spell correctly and may use the wrong context for words.</p>
<p>This is the wristband that will be implemented to all patients with dementia at Brooksville Regional Hospital, along with this square magnet to be place on the outside of the patient's room on the doorframe. Before any of these wristbands will be used, training seminars from the Alzheimer's Association will held for all of the hospital staff members. Training should start in about a month. This is a major step forward in maintaining the safety of all dementia patients during hospital stays.</p>
<p>The hospital loves the purple angel logo, We went through three different band designs before this. The problem being that purple is also the national color for DNR. What I love about it the most is that it's for "all dementias," which is what we truly need in the hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Businesses </strong></p>
<p>Moving on to dementia-friendly businesses; I envision that businesses take a 7 or 8 hour course provided for free by the Alzheimer's Association and others, to make them aware of the issues that people with dementia deal with, and what they may need help with. On completion of the course they will get a sticker that they can place in their place of business that says Dementia-Aware with a picture of the logo. By doing this we will be creating awareness, and educating many on how to make it easier for us to still function as members of society; something that is not always easy when you are an adult who is slowly becoming a child again.</p>
<p>Some of the issues may be</p>
<ul><li>feeling panic in a large store when becoming separated from the person they came with</li>
<li>being asked a question and not being able to respond, or even giving the wrong information</li>
<li>having trouble locating items in stores</li>
<li>no longer being able to calculate how much they have spent or can spend if they have a budget</li>
<li>getting lost, losing sense of direction, or not being able to locate the car in the parking lot</li>
<li>it would be nice to get assistance when there are similar products to choose from, because I can no longer do comparison shopping based on price, or if an item in the same category is on sale</li>
</ul><p>Not everyone will easily display, or even be willing to wear the bracelet or dog tag because of the stigma surrounding this disease. Only when this changes will people feel more comfortable about sharing their diagnosis with others.</p>
<p>Even though we are living with AD we should be encouraged to live life to the fullest. We need to keep our minds engaged. We should be able to work, and to still do high level functioning jobs, and the company not be penalized, and the person with the disease should not be impacted by SS because they are working. As volunteers I would expect that our transportation expenses be paid for, and maybe even lunch. This will have a positive impact on the people with the disease and be of great benefit to a company that can utilize the person. Some do not want jobs like pushing hospital beds around, or doing simple tasks when we have a high function skill set.</p>
<p>The state can help AD people to live life to the fullest in many ways. For those that are still driving they should be given a disabled sign for their car. It helps me in many ways such as finding my car when I park in a strange place or large lots. For those that are not driving, allow us the same opportunity as seniors. This will help us get around much easier. For suburban areas allow us access to the transportation for the disabled at the discounted rates.</p>
<p>The state can offer free access to national parks, fishing and boating for a small size water craft for the person living with the disease and a caregiver since in many cases they will need someone to take them. All of this can be centered on having the bracelet which will simplify the process and minimize any costs.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you need to make it simple for these people because they will most likely not be able to fill out many of the forms needed to qualify. I am sure there are many other things that can be made available.</p>
<p>Writing skills can be impacted hindering communicating. An idea would be to forward our unedited letters to schools to be used as a part of the English classes; the students would edit the letter and send it back so we can send it. It would also be great if we could take college courses for free with the idea that we are not getting a degree or credits.</p>
<p>When it comes to purchasing tickets for travelling on trains etc. staff need to be aware that we may need help. We may not be able to check in at the airport unaided. We should not be penalized for not being able to take advantage of online offers because we cannot use computers. We may need to be taken to a gate or to a temporary room until our flight or train is ready (this does not mean we need to be ferried about in a wheelchair!)</p>

</ul><p>I would like to see a simple pamphlet be put together for those who are living with the disease covering all the benefits available to us with AD. It must be simple to understand, short and to the point. The procedure should include all of the resources available and where one should turn. Today one has no clue and they do not know what is available. This should be handed out with a diagnosis from your doctor.</p>
<p>Laws need to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve. Let's stop burdening the social security system. Because there is no clear test for the diagnosis of YOAD, many diagnoses are delayed. Many people are terminated from jobs, and are unable to collect their long-term disability insurance, because of the two-year law. Most diagnoses occur much later, as in my case. I paid a lot of money into a long-term health disability plan in my company and I lost it all because of the law. I now get less than a third of what I would have been entitled to, and no medical coverage which I would also have had, all because of a law that does not work for individuals with this disease. Changes must be put in place until we have better tests available. If someone is terminated for non-performance and they have been diagnosed with dementia at a later time, they should have the right to go back at least six years to prove their case. Companies should not get a free pass because we all pay for this injustice. The two year law is a failure for people like me with dementia.</p>
<p>I was terminated from my job before I got a diagnosis which took another 6 years. Now I am forced to rely on government disability. Alzheimer's is a sickness. This is a disease, and the people who have it should be treated that way.</p>
<p>Companies need to treat AD like any other disability. The following comments were put together from a person who works in HR.</p>
<p>Tell your story to HR Management. What kind of company do they want to be? How will they protect their human resource that has dementia - and be good risk managers by taking appropriate action to minimize the risk of litigation for wrongful termination under ADA? What are the costs of unrecognized dementia in employees i.e., lost productivity, errors, quality, odd/unexplained behavior, a decline in management skills leading to more of the above? What are the State percentages? Give examples - If they are a company of 1,000 employees that equates to xx employees who will have early onset dementia - can they afford to be blind to the problems these individuals will cost the organization? Alzheimer's is not all about the needs of the caregiver. Little to no attention is given to the INDIVIDUAL WITH DEMENTIA. If the company has a PEP program (Personal Employee Program that typically provides 8 to 12 sessions of counseling when an employee suffers from personal problems (divorce, runaway kids, elderly care, etc.) why not have a Dementia Hotline/Exploration. Why not help people self-diagnose early and assist them to seek a medical diagnosis, so TOGETHER the employee and company can make a plan for them to ultimately exit from the company with dignity - example: an employee is still skilled, but may need to move from having the responsibility of being a manager to becoming an individual contributor. Why wait to FIRE someone for non-performance, when you could continue to employ the person until the day comes where there is no job which matches the employee's skills. A diagnosis of dementia IS protected under ADA. Why wait to be sued by an employee who was unfairly terminated because of his disability. Why not be proactive and humane, keep the person off unemployment; mitigate your exposure to litigation. Such a small cost to set up a program to assist and empower employees to work TOGETHER with them, give them dignity and determine together when it is time to go. Help them transition to retirement with disability; unemployment; assistance from the Alz Association.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Issues &amp; Necessary System Change </strong></p>
<p>Younger-onset Alzheimer's, also known as early-onset Alzheimer's, generally refers to those who are affected by the disease before the age of 65, usually in their 40s or 50s. Because of their younger age and healthy appearance, doctors often attribute symptoms of Alzheimer's to depression or stress, resulting in delayed diagnosis. These symptoms, such as challenges with short-term memory, impaired judgment and difficulty making decisions, eventually progress to a point where they affect workplace performance, and ultimately, jeopardize employment. Many individuals living with younger-onset Alzheimer's are in their prime earning years and supporting loved ones at home. The loss of income and access to employer-sponsored health benefits can be devastating.</p>
<p>This document reflects State and Federal issues that may not be working. My goal is that if the existing jurisdiction responsible is not able to enhance the process, the other will step in and fill in the gaps so people are not impacted. It is my hope that they can work together to fix the weaknesses in the system that may have been overlooked.</p>
<p>To help address their financial need, many individuals with younger-onset Alzheimer's rely on Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). In March 2010, the Social Security Administration (SSA) added early-onset Alzheimer's to its Compassionate Allowance Initiative, which expedites the disability determination process and serves as a trigger to begin the two-year wait for Medicare benefits for those under the age of 65. Family members (e.g. spouses and minor children) may also be eligible for benefits based on the applicant's work record. This addition by SSA has been a huge relief for individuals and families dealing with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Many are treated like they are crooks when they apply for Social Security Disability. It creates an added burden on the family and the patient. People say that the Compassionate Allowance act will help people, but it did not help me, and many keep saying that it works. The following story is from an ongoing case. This program may be better but the people who run the programs are clueless in many ways on what a person with AD can or cannot do. This person is not only struggling financially, but has no one to look out for them. I cannot even imagine the hell they must be going through because it would take me forever to complete the same forms.</p>
<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>It's so nice of you to think of me. I wanted to add that the reason I was turned down on the first application and reconsideration was because I filled out the RFC form myself (I lived alone at the time and it was a necessity) and not for lack of medical evidence. My son now lives with me but only minimally supervises me and does the driving. An examiner at Social Security took it upon himself to send out an investigative unit because he felt I must be faking Alz even though in the course of the application and reconsideration, I saw 5 doctors, 4 of whom thought I had Alz disease and 1 CE examiner who thought it was possible but hesitated because I still have average intelligence (my IQ was in the 140s when I was in graduate school and now around 100, which I think this is an alarming decline). This SAA evaluator then proceeded to imply that all the doctors I saw were fooled. He even sent out an investigative unit to actually <strong>videotape me without my knowledge</strong> (following me to one my CE appointment one day and sending undercover police officers to my home the following day). I don't remember the investigators coming to my home and didn't see them at the hospital (obviously quite good at the stealth part). At the hospital, the doctor walked me out to the lobby because he was afraid I would get lost said a few minutes later I "disappeared (I got my ride, of course)." They went back to the doctor looking for me, and he apparently was very concerned I had actually gotten lost in the hospital. At my house, they said I walked slow to answer the door but I didn't limp (???) and was polite and had my hair combed (implying I was not disabled based on my outward appearance and probably less than 30 seconds of conversation). The evaluator felt that anyone who could describe their symptoms on an application, write mostly coherently, (though always needing multiple edits, spell check, and entailing a lot of repetitiveness) answer the door, use a phone, live alone, or drive in the early stages had to be faking it regardless of MRI, neurological tests, etc., that clearly gave me a diagnosis of EOAD. Long-winded, I'm sorry. I'm still feeling kind of abused and outraged. As for now, my lawyer thinks he can get me a hearing OTR and I'm hoping for that and a favorable decision If not, it will be another 12-15 months before I have a hearing date, this because the SSA evaluator apparently does not understand that early-stage Alzheimer's is not immediately visible on the surface. In the meantime, I am now in the process of selling my home to live with my adult son as we can no longer afford the upkeep (this is a modest home - but now far above my means).</p>
<p>I'm very lucky that my son is living with me to help, but it means I do not qualify for Medicaid because his income is now considered my income and puts us just above the income limit. He can't put me on his insurance as I don't qualify as a dependent because of my small LTD policy, which in turn needs to be repaid to the insurance company if I do get SSDI. I've gone from a single, self-supporting middle class woman, to lower middle class, now to poverty level in the course of about 4 years. Without my son's help, I'm probably within 3 months of living on the street. At the same time, I'm suddenly placing a tremendous burden on him and fouling up his goals in life.</p>
<p>Another note: I find it ironic that my neurologist tells me to exercise vigorously, take care of my health, and socialize as much as possible in order to function longer whereas I sense the government is telling me that I'm not eligible for disability insurance (despite working since age 13 and paying into the system for years) unless I give up, lie in bed, and wait to die.</p>
<p>It would be great if the Alz Assoc could find a way to educate the SSA evaluators on what Alzheimer's disease looks like in younger people in the early stages so that other people don't go through what I'm going through now. It would also be great if they could lobby for earlier Medicare benefits (rather than the 2 year wait after SSDI) for all disabilities that are only going to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Awareness is the biggest problem.</p>
<p>Awareness of YOAD will change the public perception of who gets Alzheimer's - young people. People who are under 30 get it. Use commercials, billboards or posters in key places to get the word out. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show younger people because most don't understand that Alzheimer is a disease not just a result of aging.</p>
<p>Awareness of outcomes for AD -- Currently people who have Alzheimer's cannot be cured. There is no way to slow the progression of the disease, and most die within 4 to 8 years of diagnosis. While these two statements are strong I feel this is what it's going to take to reach younger generations and others to jump in and help. We cannot beat around the bush; the public needs to know that this is a horrific way to die. Death by Alzheimer's is slow and painful not to mention the impact it has on the family. Places like the Alzheimer's Association and others need to open with all the facts about the disease so people are prepared.</p>
<p>Remove the negative stigma associated with the disease. Too many people are ashamed to let others know that they have this disease. They act like they did something wrong to get it. Now is the time to join me, come out of the closet, hold your head up and be proud in making a difference in how we are looked upon by ourselves, and others. WE need to show that we are still capable of doing some things at our own pace.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those that are no longer capable, while not impacting those that are still able to drive. It should be based on the person's true driving experience and ability, and not on perceptions or fears. It should have nothing to do with getting lost; GPS tracking devices can help us if that is a concern. Many people have the misconception that if a person with AD is in an accident the insurance company will not pay for the claim, or may even sue them. While there are many tests available to test one's driving, many are not fair to a person living with AD. In fact if the average person was given the same test they may even fail. Better tests that deal the individual living with the disease are needed and all must be able to test this test. Some of the cognitive tests do not correlate to driving ability, but to failing and singling out people with AD. That is completely unfair. For example I fail the Trail-Making Test, Part B and I still drive very good. The testing should be free or paid by insurance. These tests can cost around $300 -$350, and provide annually. Every 2-3 months we should drive with a spouse or other person who understands us to see how well we drive. That should be a regular part of our future lives, and they should be the ones to tell us when they feel it is time to give up driving. I am not saying that people with AD should not eventually stop driving, but it should be done for the right reasons -- that they will become a danger to them or someone else. What we need to focus on are the real problems of driving, and not the side issues related to them. We must embrace new ways to deal with people with AD and find new opportunities and technologies to use to our advantage so we can enhance the lives of those suffering with this disease, and so they can continue to lead a normal life for as long as possible. Do not fall into the one-size-fits-all trap because all those living with AD are different from each other and we must figure out a way to make everyone feel safe including those living with the disease. We are still human beings.</p>
<p>My biggest fear is that one day I will have an accident and my license will be taken away. It may not have anything to do with my Alzheimer's, but it will be perceived that way. I have had 3 to 4 car accidents in my lifetime, some being my fault while most were others. We all have them. As a person living with AD I seem to notice much more. I see many people run through lights, not use turn signals or come to a complete stop at the stop sign. I see people cut others off or shift in to other's lanes without paying attention. All I can think is that if people saw me do any of these things they would want to take my driver's license away, yet all of these folks are normal and they just get a free pass. Why?</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is. One should not be impacted by other laws that were not designed or intended for those living with this type of disease. There are many state and federal programs that limit us from being able to contribute to or benefits we are not entitled to because of our age. Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia. A family should have a cap on what they must payout. Why should the surviving spouse be left penniless because their partner was sick? Is it enough that most of us have already had to deal with financial hardship we were not accustom to?</p>
<p>Pa. Caregiver Support Program (care recipient/household income must be @ 200% of poverty or below for max. reimbursement.</p>
<p>Below are just of a few of the ways this disease is costing me more money than ever. I once did most things around the house and now I have to rely on others and the cost is adding up very quickly. Many things are becoming neglected which will have a greater cost in the long run. I used to be good at comparison shopping and now I no longer do it because I cannot recall the price so I can compare. This has such a huge impact from food, gas, utilities and everyday items.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), individuals with a pre-existing condition receiving SSDI can join high-risk insurance pools3 and receive immediate health insurance coverage while they wait for Medicare benefits to become available. This has been particularly helpful for those who are unable to find affordable health insurance because of their Alzheimer's diagnosis. The program will end in 2014, at which time individuals can purchase health insurance through their state-based insurance exchange or qualify for Medicaid under its expanded criteria. Pennsylvania has yet to decide whether or not it wants to participate in the Medicaid expansion, which according to one estimate, will cost the state 1.4 percent more than current spend to reduce the number of uninsured adults by over 40%.</p>
<p>In addition to the cost of care, Alzheimer's imposes an immense burden on families. Last year, there were an estimated 664,384 unpaid caregivers in Pennsylvania, providing 756,600,213 hours of unpaid care valued at over $9 billion. Unfortunately, the physical toll of caring for Alzheimer's also resulted in over $427 million in additional healthcare costs to unpaid caregivers in your state. To assist those who care for people with Alzheimer's in Pennsylvania, the state offers the Pennsylvania Caregiver Support Program. Preference is given to caregivers of care recipients who are 60 years or older, but eligibility was recently expanded to include care recipients who are 18 years or older. All care recipients must demonstrate functional limitation and financial need.</p>
<p>Regrettably, age is still a barrier to other support programs for individuals with younger-onset Alzheimer's and their caregivers. All caregiver support programs that receive funding under Title III of the Older Americans Act require care recipients to be at least 60 years or older. Likewise, Pennsylvania's Medicaid 60+ waiver and aging block grants are only available to those who are at least 60 years old. Restricting eligibility by age, rather than diagnosis, forces many families affected by younger-onset Alzheimer's to exhaust their own resources and put their own health and financial security at risk.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways to make it better for those impacted. Physician education -- Doctors need to be better educated, and need to commit to a more timely diagnosis so that patients can collect the benefits they deserve and are entitled. Doctors should not act like our lives are over. Once a diagnosis is made it should automatically trigger a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist so the person can learn to deal with the devastating news. Many people are in denial and waste that last few years not knowing what to do. Instead they should be living life to the fullest. Make the memories. We must be encouraged to make living wills and put our financials in order quickly since our minds are going. We have no time to delay. Encourage participation in medical trails and offer frequent checkups.</p>
<p>Living wills should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p>We must encourage research and provide funding. In order to eradicate this disease we need to find more sources of funding and redistribute current government funding to bring Alzheimer's to a level comparable to other disease research. Trials need to provide more flexibility by using technology. Many are unable to participate due to lack of flexibility. Some people do not participate in clinical trials because they feel it will not help them. They need to know that it's not about them but what they do can help someone in their family should they get the disease. Since a cure may be long in coming, it would also be nice to see more funding provided to investigate treatment methods to maintain independent function longer. The drug companies have taken the stage and it's all about what increases their profit and not necessarily about what will help the patients.</p>
<p>Make government grant programs free, fair and balanced - Some researchers using government research grants are discriminating by age and minorities because of rules being set forth by both the provider and the receiving researcher. This will prevent the formation of an accurate picture of this disease. For example, black people are twice as likely to get Alzheimer's. Why?</p>
<p>Eliminate the term Caregiver - Come up with a new term for the word caregiver when used for people in the following stages Very mild decline (2), Mild decline (3) and Moderate decline(4). We find it very demeaning and do not like being treated like a child. Help us where we are weak, but don't give up on us just because we have now been labeled with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>We need away a way to break down many of the silos and built a coalition of companies and sites to work as one. Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) is a diverse and growing national coalition of 58 member organizations including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The only sad part is the Alzheimer's National has not joined due to not being able to set politics aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/">http://www.leadcoalition.org/</a></p>
<p>This is all part of the problem - a lack of willingness to work together. I am not sure what the state can do here but we need to find a way to encourage others to work in harmony for the greater good of what we all seem to claim. We are doing this for dementia. Sometimes I really wonder and I think it just a business for these folks.</p>
<p>I know I have made many recommendations around the use of the Alzheimer Association as part of this document. Because of that I want to give full disclosure. I was a past ESAG member and I am currently still an ambassador for them. For those who know me they would tell you I am not influenced by others and my dedication is to those impacted by the disease. With that being said I do feel they deserve a lot of credit for what they have accomplished in the last 30 or more years. They take a lot of heat for some issue that are out of their control due to some high level expectation of the public.</p>
<p>On the other hand I do not want you to think that they have all the answers because I and many others realize that they do not do justice for many like me who are dealing with the disease. They focus on the caregiver and not us. Part of the problem in my eyes is the lack of a business mind across the board, and lack of a CEO approach to business. Because of that scenario there is much inconsistency in the organization and much time is lost in understanding our needs and minds. That all leads to very slow response or lack of response to the very services they think are great. They have this internal mindset that everything has to be done a specific way and that is always the right way, yet the people are not given the tools. The sad truth- it is not and I have worked on changing some of that and I can assure you it's not an easy task. I encourage that we continue to work with them but at the same time we need to demand change and at a much faster pace.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I am sharing this with you in hope that, as you do your planning, you take my findings in to account when making recommendations to others. We must treat all people who are suffering from dementia, regardless of stage, with the highest level of respect all the way through to the end. While this may not apply to all, it would appear that many who are even in stage seven are still able to communicate in some way.</p>
<p><strong>Living Life with Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>Below are some articles I have written in the past, you may learn how someone with AD is dealing with this disease. These are my favorite that I feel people have been able to learn and see another side that they did not know before.</p>
<p>I have worked on this for about five months, and recently I shared the email below with many sites related to AD for feedback. Most of those who had reached out to me were able to support my findings. The bottom line is that while most of us have limited thinking capacity many are able to communicate; we just have to find a way that suits the individual. I received a lot of feedback. My biggest concern is that most people are clueless, and assume that we cannot understand what they are saying about us; many say cruel things. Just try to imagine for a minute what it would be like to hear what others may say or do to you, and you are never given an opportunity to defend or express yourself. That is what is happening to most of these folks.</p>
<p>We must find a better way to educate caregivers, health professionals, and all those working with people living with this disease. The biggest problem I see is that everything is time-based because of the costs. This view will not work for people. It will also take special training, and the need to break with our normal habits of communicating. If we are going to be able to reach out to them, we need to change. We are still human beings and we deserve to be treated in a respectful and dignified manner.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen and I have been living with AD much longer than most people who have had this devastating disease. I am in need of your help to prove a point. Let me explain.</p>
<p>I have learned that as we progress with Alzheimer's/dementia, we lose our brain functioning and can no longer think. I am starting to believe that this is not true.</p>
<p>It has now happened to me on multiple occasions where I was asked a question, and I am able to formulate the answer in my mind, yet I found myself unable to verbalize it. Sometimes my mouth may move but nothing comes out. It was the weirdest thing, and I could not understand why it was happening to me. I was aware of what was going on, but could do nothing.</p>
<p>Since that time I have asked 18 other people with some type of dementia, and of them 16 had similar experiences. Two of them said they had not. This makes me think that as this disease progresses our brain may still be functioning, yet it is unable to communicate with the rest of the body, allowing it to have less control than it would normally have. I truly believe I am on to something, and was curious as to how I can try to prove this theory.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example. About three years ago I met the daughter of a man with AD. He was no longer communicating with her because, she was sure, he could no longer commutate at all. Someone suggested she ask a question, and keep totally silent for at least two minutes after. About a minute and a half later he finally responded to her question. From that time on she realized what she had to do and was thankful for that advice.</p>
<p>I don't want you to think it's going to be that easy; it will take a lot of work, patience and persistence on your part. Here is what I would like others to try for someone who is in the late stages of Alzheimer's. First of all take the person to a very quiet room; it should not have any kind of background noise even from things like an air-conditioner blowing. Those noises are real problems for me, and would assume it will be a bigger issue for them. Such noises really have an impact on my ability to process and focus. You should also do this at a time of day that they are not tired. It becomes very challenging for us to try to focus and listen to what others say. It really becomes tiring, and we get burned out quickly.</p>
<p>When you start to speak to the person use short sentences, and pause in between them so they have time to process what you are saying. That is very important. Tell them that you think you have found a way to communicate with them. Tell them you are going to look at them closely for some sort of sign. It could be an eye movement, maybe looking to the right or left or down or up. It could be a smile. It could be a finger moving or a fist being made. It may even be them sticking their tongue out. I would start by focusing on parts of the body that may still show signs of control. You must become a detective and keep looking at various body parts for some sign. It may not happen the first time or even a second time. It may never happen and I could be wrong. But if I am right just think of the benefits that will come out of this for you and your love one.</p>
<p>Reassure them that you will continue to look for a signal and they should keep trying the best they can at their speed. Ask them a simple question like "do you love me? If yes lift your finger or lower your finger". Again you will need to keep quiet, and observe for at least two minutes. Keep doing this and try this with different parts of the body. They may not have control over certain parts, and that may be an issue. If you do see something make sure you point that out to them and ask them to do it again to insure they really are responding. If this turns out to work find a way to use that same body part to get yes or no responses from the person. Keep in mind that this may not always work and you may need to be creative. Maybe just keep the finger raised longer if they mean no, or tap it twice etc., but that may be too much to ask.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind if the person has not had any real dialog with someone for a long time this would also take more time. No matter what do not become discouraged, try this at least three different times on different days. Like I said this may never work and I have it wrong.</p>
<p>If this does work please reply to this site with your contact information so I can speak to you. If this works for a few it makes me believe that we need to treat these folks completely different to the way society treats them today. This will change so much about what people really believe is happening to our minds.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>"The Realities of Alzheimer's and Overcoming Stigma"</strong></p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect more than 35 million people worldwide today. An astonishing fact that today someone in the world develops dementia every 4 seconds. By the middle of the century more than 115 million people will be affected by the disease if we do nothing.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen, and I am living with Alzheimer's and trying to make a difference. I was previously a high-level manager in the telecommunication industry. In 2008, I was diagnosed with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD) after struggling to get a diagnosis since my first symptoms at age 39. Losing my job and not being able to work had a huge impact on my life as I was a workaholic. I am now an Alzheimer's advocate and a spokesperson for the Alzheimer's Association (U.S.) as a member of its national 2012 Early-Stage Advisory Group.</p>
<p>I am so frustrated, because no one realizes how seriously disabled I am. If I had a loss of limb or some other visual ailment, it would make people realize. I don't want them to feel sorry for me or pity me, just want to be understood. So many people say you do not seem to have Alzheimer's, and that frustrates me. Let me tell you what it's like to live with this debilitating and progressive disease.</p>
<p>Imagine for one minute that your friend, relative or family member has Alzheimer's and has to deal with the following issues. When I go shopping and look at items, most of them never really register in my mind, even though I see it clearly. I have trouble making decisions, because I question whether I am making the right one. I can no longer enjoy my favorite hobbies, because it requires processing skills that I no longer have. I went from being a gadget person, to now being threatened by technology that I no longer can use. This is what I deal with and so much more.</p>
<p>I go to a happy affair only to be tortured by the noise and surrounding conversations, because of the loudness that cannot be filtered out. If people try to speak with me in a public setting where there are many other conversations, I just don't understand what they are saying. This is because all of the people speaking come in at the same volume level. All the words run together, and it sounds like a foreign language.</p>
<p>I went from being extremely proactive to becoming much less active and motivated. I leave things around the house and don't put them away, because I don't know where they go or feel I may not know where to retrieve them again. One moment I am nice and another I may fly off the handle. I can no longer write or speak like I used to. My friends slowly become distant and usually speak to my wife. I do realize this.</p>
<p>I worry every day about the challenges ahead. Or even worse, I am losing my mind and see it happening, but I cannot do anything to change the course. People always say 'if I can do anything just let me know." If I take them up on that offer, they back out of their commitments. I have become extremely surprised by the lack of public commitment to my pleas for support of Alzheimer's disease. While some may be sympathetic in the moment, there appears to be little follow-through. This is very upsetting, because I feel as though it affects me personally as well as the millions of others living with the disease. I was always there for others when they needed it and now I feel alone.</p>
<p>While many people just coast through the day, I have to use 110% of my processing skills to do most things, which increases the stress and frustration. The worst part about this disease is knowing that I am doing all these things wrong and have no way to control or stop it, and it's only getting worse as the days go by. I used to save lots of money by doing so many things around the house. Now I lost the drive, determination and skills needed to do those things. Many times I hurt myself trying or make it worse.</p>
<p>I cannot begin to explain how it tears me up inside to see my spouse struggling to do the things that I once was capable of doing and know I cannot do a thing to help. I realize that one day I may no longer be able to drive and this devastates me. I see my wife becoming stressed, depressed and overwhelmed, but caregivers know it will only continue to get worse. Sadly, they keep telling themselves that they can do it all even when we know they will need help.</p>
<p>I, the patient, see it definitely. My wife is on the road to hell, and she does not even realize it yet, because she is so busy trying to block it all out. The worst part about all this is, I have not even reached the worst stage. That scares the hell out of me.</p>
<p>I have been so surprised by the stigma associated with this disease. It comes at you from all angles. People think they knew what Alzheimer's is, but they don't. I see this not only from people living with dementia but many media health correspondents, physicians and organizations that are geared to helping those deal with the disease. I have learned that I do not want to share my diagnosis with people I meet until they get to know me. If I was to tell them upfront, I would be treated so differently, which I have learned. I kind of see this disease like HIV use to be. The people who have it are so afraid to let others know, including family. I do not get it. We did nothing wrong to get this disease, and we need to speak up to let our voice be heard. We did nothing and no one should be ashamed of having it. I feel so much better when I share it with others than when I try to hide it.</p>
<p>Because of my frustration with existing environment for people with dementia, I realized change was need. I decided to use my few skills left to advocate. I have spent some of my last few years being on television, radio, newspapers, many blogs and working with many politicians. I also had an opportunity to speak at all of the public sessions to develop the first U.S. National Alzheimer's Plan, all this on my own. But that was not enough, because I ran into so many people who just did not want to get involved. I am now a volunteer for the national Alzheimer's Association Early-Stage Advisory Group. If there is something I want you to walk away with it's that you can make a difference, but it will take persistence. Write a letter to your public official or reach out to local support organizations to create needed programs and services. Your voice and your story are powerful tools. Please get involved.</p>
<p>The simple truth is, if you have not been touched by this devastating and debilitating disease yet, consider yourself extremely lucky. Sadly, it's just a matter of time before it touches you. It is my hope that my actions today may prevent future generations from suffering with this disease. So give yourself piece of mind and do something today. I hope that what I am doing will allow me to leave this world knowing that I did everything possible to make that next generation have a fighting chance. There are no excuses for not wanting to help. The human cost factor is too high, and we are all accountable to do something.</p>
<p>There are many organizations out there like ADI and the Alzheimer's Association that can help you. The Alzheimer's Association got me started in many ways with my new journey. It not only helped me, but it also had helped my wife as my caregiver. They have a website with many resources at www.alz.org. I encourage you to reach out today if you have not already. I would also encourage you to educate yourself.</p>
<p>Please join me and Go Purple on Friday, Sept. 21 for World Alzheimer's Month. I wear a purple Alzheimer's bracelet every day. And for those living with Alzheimer's, stop focusing on what you cannot do and join me in the battle to advocate. We still have so much to give, and we need to use our skills at our own speed. There is nothing to be ashamed of. We are counting on all of you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Over the past few years I have visited many websites that talk about Alzheimer's/dementia. The one thing that they all have in common is that not one of them encourages those of us who have the disease to continue to live and enjoy our lives. While I realize AD is a progressive and devastating disease we are still here, we are still alive, so treat us that way. Do not write us off.</p>
<p>I have always been savvy when it comes to finances and have always been a saver. One day I was speaking to a friend of mine who has AD, and I was telling her how I did not want to spend a lot of the money I had saved, because I wanted to leave it for my wife for that rainy day. My friend told me: "This is the rainy day. What are you waiting for?" She was right, and that's exactly how I started to think.</p>
<p>Just because we are living with AD, does not mean we should curl up and think our life is over before it actually is. There is so much more we can still do to enjoy life. Make wonderful memories with your loved ones before the days turn ugly.</p>
<p>One thing I had always wanted was to own a convertible, so we purchased one. I wanted to drive it down to the Keys in Florida. I have a friend out in California who also has AD. She has an RV and had planned to travel around the country before she declined and was incapable of driving anymore. One day she mentioned that she was going to the Keys and I decided to meet up with her. I also wanted to go deep-sea fishing to catch a big game fish. Don't get me wrong I am not person who goes fishing, but it was something I have always wanted to do. I had looked into it and it was very pricy, but it has always been on my bucket list. I think we all have a list if we stop and think about it.</p>
<p>I had no real plans; I just wanted to go out and drive my convertible, to feel the fresh air and admire the beautiful scenery and enjoy nice weather. I had a great time. I had a permanent smile on my face. I decided to stay with my friend in the RV for a week and visit various campgrounds along the way. That was a whole new experience, and some of the places we stayed at had fabulous views.</p>
<p>It was great to be out on our own, not having to rely on caregivers all the time. We had some difficulties, but we were able to mange on our own. It cost me a few extra dollars along the way because when I purchased something I could not remember the price in order to be able to compare, and sometimes I took the wrong road and had to take the turnpike, but these were minor issues. This road trip made me feel so much better about me. It was good for my mind; I came back stronger because of what I had achieved.</p>
<p>This disease has a way of making you feel like you are no longer cable of doing things on your own. You lose your self-esteem and your self-confidence. After this trip I felt great.</p>
<p>I did have to opportunity to go fishing. It was such a beautiful day with perfect conditions. The fish were not really biting to begin with but it didn't matter I was just happy to be on a boat again. Then I caught a fish that was about 10-12 inches long. Then I caught a barracuda that was at least 18 inches long, and then one over two feet long. Not to long after that I got the big one, a king macro that was 42 inches long! You should have seen the smile on my face. It is memories like this that we need to be making.</p>
<p>My friend in the RV has decided that she will not just use her mother's china and silverware on special occasions. Instead she took them with her in the RV. It gives her pleasure to use them every day. How many of you have a wonderful expensive hand bag or nice watch, which you only use on a special occasion?</p>
<p>Life is short; take pleasure in using those treasured items now. Start to create your own bucket list, don't just write it, DO IT! There are many wonderful memories that you can still make. Make them now before it's too late. Stop focusing on the negative. Make these last few years be the best of your life. You must do this now, before your mind no longer works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Since being diagnosed with Young Onset Alzheimer's Disease I have dedicated much of my time to its advocacy. Over the years I have worked with many people in different parts of the world, and through my experience I have come to realize that a major problem in reaching a cure is our actions. The way we treat not only those who suffer from this disease but those who care for the afflicted, the focus on funding and research and the lack of communication and collective action. Although there are many brilliant people who are involved in Alzheimer's and Dementia action and research I feel that following some simple principals and plans we could bring about real change in the world of these diseases.</p>
<p>PARTICIPATION -- Patients, caregivers, family and friends must become advocates</p>
<p>FUNDING -- Unprecedented action from government and public sector is vital</p>
<p>TEAM WORK -- Organizations dedicated to fighting the cause must work together to reach a shared goal</p>
<p>RESEARCH -- It is imperative that professional medical research personnel work hand-in-hand with patients</p>
<p>LIVE -- Those suffering from the disease must learn to live happy and fulfilling lives</p>
<p><strong>PARTICIPATION</strong> -- The government wants to hear from us! I have been doing this a long time and I am told over and over again by government officials that they need to have a clear idea of the numbers of people with Alzheimer's so they can make the appropriate changes to policy etc. In order for the government to do something they need to see people with the disease. I know people have busy lives but if we want things to change, patients, caregivers and friends need to start taking action.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? By getting involved! Write to the people who can help - government, health officials, and the press. But be mindful that you have to be persistent with these people, you have to fight. Can you imagine the impact if even a small percentage of the millions of sufferers took a little time to have their say?</p>
<p><strong>FUNDING</strong> -- We must look at other funding models for this disease. Unlike HIV and cancer, there are no survivors. Patients will continue to place a massive financial burden on the national economy; we need to be more proactive in how we fund research, care, medication and support for loved ones and caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? By writing to Congress, and the National Institute of Health. These people are responsible for prioritizing the distribution of funds to critical diseases - Alzheimer's disease is not on the list; we need it on the list.</p>
<p><strong>TEAM WORK</strong> -- There are many organizations out there hosting their individual fund raising programs, which is to be commended but the downside to this is that they still insist on operating independently on one another. These people need to see the bigger picture, they need to set aside their politics and differences, and come together as one and work together -- after all, they share the same goal don't they?</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? Well we can stop complaining about these organizations and give them solutions and guidance. Together we have the power to bring about change. Keep informed of all the latest news and action, don't listen to gossip or rumor -- check the facts; do your homework.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen. I am living with Alzheimer's disease. I spend almost every waking hour advocating for increased funding for research that will improve the treatment of this dreadful disease. In 2008, at the age of 49, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after struggling to get a diagnosis since my first symptoms began at age 39. There are more than five million Americans now suffering from this devastating disease.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds research into critical and devastating diseases such as cancer and HIV/Aids. Yet there is much neglect and discrimination regarding the allocation of funds for research into Alzheimer's and related dementias. As a person who experiences the devastating impact of Alzheimer's disease every day I hope that research will lead eventually to postponing the onset or slow the progression of this disease, if not prevention and cure.</p>
<p>Currently, Alzheimer's disease only receives about $450 million for research from NIH, compared to more than $5 billion for cancer and more than $3 billion for HIV/AIDS. I am astonished at the lack of funding dedicated to addressing the number one health epidemic. Historically, leadership from the federal government has helped lower the number of deaths from major diseases such as HIV/AIDS, heart disease, stroke and many types of cancers. This past experience provides hope that increased efforts directed at Alzheimer's disease will be met with similar success.</p>
<p>There are many more Americans living with Alzheimer's than HIV; more funding is desperately needed. If we do not act now this disease has the potential to bankrupt this country. Money allocated today will have an enormous return on investment if it leads to the kind of successes obtained for other diseases.</p>
<p>If you have not yet been touched by this devastating and debilitating disease it's just a matter of time. I hope that my advocacy will help prevent future generations having to suffer my fate and that of many others. You can help by increasing NIH funding for research on Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</p>
<p>I appeal to members of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the respective appropriations committees: Make the hard choices; increase funding for Alzheimer's disease. Do everything necessary to ensure that Alzheimer's disease gets the exposure, commitment and funding necessary to change the course of the disease before millions more Americans are affected.</p>
<p>My work as an advocate has provided opportunities to share my story on a national platform. I have provided public comment during meetings of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services in addition to having my personal essay about overcoming the stigma of the disease featured in the Alzheimer's disease World Report 2012. I have also become a member of the Alzheimer's Association National Early-Stage Advisory Group, helping to raise awareness of the disease and provide insights on the most appropriate programs and services for individuals in the early stage of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p>I hope that what I am doing now will allow me to leave this world knowing that I have done everything possible to make generations to come have a fighting chance. Do not forget these people or the future generations who will develop this disease. We face dying in the worst possible way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>As an Alzheimer's patient, I find it very difficult to perform tasks that I was once very capable of performing. Sometimes I am better than other times at doing the same task. People around me have accepted this fact and have tried to be very forgiving when I run into issues doing a task or when just trying to remember something. I really think that people around me should challenge me more at times.</p>
<p>For example, many of my doctors kept questioning me about whether or not I should still be driving. This of course was mentioned to my wife who also started wondering. I finally had a driving test a few years later. It was recommended that I no longer drive, even though I passed the test. I was almost borderline, but there was concern that I may not recognize when I become worse and could then become a danger. First of all, I have to tell you that the test they performed was not fair. I wonder how many regular people would be able to pass this test. The test also relied on me to learn new things in order to take the test. That is not fair since I have been driving the same vehicle all this time and nothing has changed. This constant talk about my driving has totally killed all of my self-esteem about driving. Every time I was in the car on the road with my wife, she constantly pointed out any mistakes I made, and her reaction time was much quicker than mine. I do realize I am a bit slower in my response time, but that is why I give myself more space between the other cars. Sometimes I am very far back or I just don't want to go around that slow car. There is nothing wrong with not feeling comfortable to go around that person. Let me do it at my speed.</p>
<p>I see many people on the road that I feel are so much worse than me and I wonder why they are still on the road, if I am supposedly so bad. I decided that I was going to drive to visit my daughter in South Carolina. I live in Jamison, PA in Bucks County. I was very scared to take this trip but I was trying to prove something to myself. It could have meant the end of my driving if I made a serious mistake along the way. I drove in one day, about 700 miles, with the help of a GPS in my car. The more I drove, the more I was starting to feel comfortable behind the wheel. A few other people on the road made serious mistakes along the way and I easily avoided a possible accident. This trip was the best thing I could have done for myself. I now have almost all of my self-confidence back and my wife no longer makes constant comments about my driving, unless I have a real issue. I have now had two close calls that required quick thinking and maneuvering to avoid an accident. In both cases, I was able to avoid the issues without my wife's comments. Again it may have taken me an extra second or two to react, but I was fine.</p>
<p><strong>Coping Strategies for Daily Challenges </strong></p>
<p>Because of this situation, I feel even stronger than ever that it is important to be challenged. I know it may be easier for you to do something for an Alzheimer's patient because it's much quicker for you to accomplish the task. But I really believe that if you take the time to coach us along the way, we may do better in the long run. Believe me, I know it's got to be very aggravating at times, but I really appreciate it. It takes a lot of patience on the part of the helper. Everyone is different and you need to know at what point in time you should not push. It's also hard to be patient and not raise your voice at the person you are trying to help, because it will only make it worse.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble remembering dates or things I need to do.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I use my computer and Microsoft Outlook to keep me straight by sending me reminders.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Getting email using regular places like Google or Yahoo is a challenge for me.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: My daughter had set up my Outlook to retrieve emails from all my accounts, and they arrive in the same format which makes it so much easier to read, and it allows me to use common folders.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I forget to reply back to people's emails.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I flag them with a reminder date so it will automatically send me a reminder.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Remembering passwords is a real challenge for me.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have created a personal system that works great, I also rely on the computer to store many of them; however, it is a real challenge when the system does not work. I also keep files with the password information.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble remembering the day, the month and the year.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have watch that displays all the information.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have an extremely complex TV, stereo and entertainment system, which requires many remotes and settings to be used.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I purchased a smart remote that allows me to put in all the steps at once, and press one button which takes care of sending all the commands to all the devices at once. It works great until it fails. Not sure how much longer I can maintain it. It's a bit involved</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Most of my lawn power tools are a struggle to use.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I do not think I have any coping method other then I keep trying different things until I get them to work. The problem is most are new, I find it easier to work with tools I am familiar with.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I drive I don't always feel as comfortable behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I sometimes need to take more precautions, and allow more distance between the car in front of me, and I may drive a little slower. I am also much more alert and focused during these times. It makes it hard because when I travel with my wife she wonders why all of sudden I drive slower, when normally I am flying. There is nothing wrong with going slower and being cautious.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I don't do much of anything anymore.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: The other day I was speaking with my neighbor who was waxing his car. This gave me some inspiration to want to do it. When people mention things to me it sometimes gives me what I need to take it to the next level.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I purchased a camera; however, no matter how many times I read the manual I still don't seem to be able to understand how to use it.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: Make sure you buy one that works completely automatic without needing to do anything. It is frustrating at times when you would like to do something on your own but just can't remember on how to do it. I have learned to accept it but I still try and fail.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Spelling and forming sentences has become a real challenge.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take advantage of using the computer to guide me in the correct spelling of a word. That is becoming harder because often it cannot figure out what I am trying to say. I also ask others to look things over for me, and to correct them for me. It's kind of frustrating for me because I am really concerned that I may not be able to do this much longer. I have seen a big decline in this over the years. I seem to notice this more than my other skills because I do it so often. While I am sometimes ashamed of sharing it with others, I still need to communicate so I try to not think about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Sometimes when I want to do certain things I need to stop and think.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: If I want to work on a project I will spend a lot of extra time trying to think of the best approach, this doesn't always help, but I tend to work at a slightly slower pace and am aware that things will go wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Finding past emails or letters</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: The computer is such a wonderful tool in so many ways. It allows me to search the entire computer as long as I can remember a word or two in the document I am looking for. While it may take a while I would not be able to survive without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I can no longer do many things</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I rely on my wife for many things nowadays. I am not sure if that is a coping strategy. When anything important needs to be considered, I ask her for her help. She does all the financials, and planning of most things. It is frustrating but I realize I cannot do it on my own.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I get lost or cannot figure out how to get from one place to another. Maps are not easy to follow anymore even the ones that you print out from Google.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: GPS! I cannot imagine what it was like for people like me before GPS and the computer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I fear that one day I will be lost or not be able to communicate with others due to a temporary stress or decline in my mental capacity.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have chosen to not be concerned about that. I have a medical tag on me all the time that has my medical condition along with important contact information. I will continue to go wherever I want to go. I realize I will need to rely on others to get there. I will need to ask others for help frequently, and to ask multiple times so others don't send me down the wrong path. It will take me longer to get there, but I cannot let that stop me. Living in fear is also no way to live. I know there are good people that will help me when the time comes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Some things I do get me very frustrated</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I no longer try to do those things so I do not get frustrated</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I write notes as reminders</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I only write a few notes as if I have too many they just become overwhelming, and I would lose track of them because there are too many.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I need more time to do things</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I leave much earlier for meetings and places so I can allow for issues along the way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: If I start to get frustrated doing something.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I move on to something else and then I try to come back and do it later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I fear I may get lost when I go to new and far places.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take a cell phone with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I go shopping and lose track of the person I am with I sometimes start to worry a little bit.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to calm myself down and look for them. If I cannot find them I will try to stay by the door we came in so I can see them at that register</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I had trouble remembering which way to turn off the water in the garage for the hose.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: My wife added masking tape with a marking pointing to off. No more issues. I have the feeling that over time I will need many reminders like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble hearing people speak in loud places.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to not go to restaurants or other places where I will be put in that situation if I can help it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I can no longer use my video recorder.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I now have TiVo which makes it so much easier to do things. I still need some help, and my wife can help when I need it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I try to communicate with much smarter people.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I believe that my reaching out to and working with people who are very smart will delay the deterioration process.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I cut the grass, or do something that requires me to be a bit more stable on my feet.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I use a good pair of shoes, or even a low cut boot. It really helps me become more stable on my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I could get hurt while doing yard work.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I do not wear lose clothes or short sleeved clothes when doing yard work so I do not get hurt. Wearing shorts has already led to a broken foot because the pants leg got caught on the shifter. I also wear safety glasses. The problem I have is I don't always remember to take these precautions, or sometimes I think it's not necessary because I feel I will be careful if I am doing something that will just take a few minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Just the other day I was thinking in my head that I had to turn a grate on my fireplace, and I was thinking it may be hot.</p>
<p><strong>No Coping Strategy</strong>: Instead of being careful and just putting one finger closely to feel for heat, I just tried to touch it with three fingers to lift -- I got burned. How do you get a copping strategy for becoming stupid? It seems that my mind is not communicating with the rest of my body.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ???</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: All the people around me know I have AD, so most of them are keeping an extra eye out on me which is nice to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to keep some type of a schedule. I get up every day at the same time and try to eat at the same time. This kind of helps to do things like taking my drugs or other things. The second I change my routine you can be sure I will forget to take my drugs or do something else.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I double and triple check myself on many things I do. Daily Challenge: ???? Coping Strategy: I try to find some humor in my issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ?????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I ask people for help and ask a lot more questions of others</p>

<p style="text-align:center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>A few months ago one of my friends mentioned that I am always talking about things related to Alzheimer's. While I know I spend my days advocating for this disease I did not realize I was that bad. Especially with those I am not trying to convince or influence. Although I appreciate the person telling me, it has really bothered me.</p>
<p>I started to give it some thought and tried to understand why and what I could do to change that. Not too long after that my wife made a similar comment, and that really hit home because their comments to me were so close together.</p>
<p>I realized many things have contributed to this. The most important is I no longer work and I feel like I am locked in this house; I really have nothing else to do. I wish I could still be working and doing something meaningful, but unfortunately my skills required to perform those jobs are no longer there because of my Alzheimer's. I use to go to work, I used to talk with others about many different topics, not just work but everyday world issues.</p>
<p>I have tried to have similar conversations with people about issues in the news, and I don't always have the right information since I don't always understand it all, and only retain bits and pieces. While there was a time I was a news junkie, now I can rarely recall many of the topics or even can tie other stories together in my mind so I can speak intelligently. I have recently found myself starting discussions that go south because I start out with part of a subject, and when we delved into it deeper I was at loss for information. I felt stupid because I could no longer speak about something I once found very easy. I used to be great about talking about political issues which really requires you to know what you are talking about, but now I can barely defend my position, and I do worse for even bringing the subject up, and then I feel bad because I was not able to point out the real issues so the person could really make a true assessment.</p>
<p>Since I have no real job I have made it my mission to advocate for Alzheimer/dementia. I try to keep my mind as engaged as possible. I also try to focus on things that most don't, like the high hanging fruit which is probably not the best for some on like me. That involves dealing with many high-level people. While I do good at first I don't always have the answers they require, and sometimes may come across as not knowing what I am doing. It is very frustrating knowing that in my brain I have the answers, but I just do not know how to retrieve the information needed to help me do what I need to do. Especially when I need it the most, I may remember later on sometimes, but it's too late. There was a time that I could retrieve everything to my favor and keep track of everything one person would say to me.</p>
<p>Then I finally realized I listen to the weather report multiple times a day and I never seem to know what the weather is supposed to be like, which I always use to know. I just do not seem to retain it.</p>
<p>I use to like reading the paper and I no longer do that because I have trouble retaining what I read or I don't remember how the story relates to something I read a few paragraphs back in the same article.</p>
<p>I used to have hobbies that I can no longer do because of the disease. I use to love boating and tinkering with electronics. I can no longer do any of these things. I rarely do anything around the house because I am afraid I will make it worse.</p>
<p>When I have conversations with others I do not always remember what we have spoken about in the past. I always hated it when you spoke to certain people and they keep repeating the same information you had spoken about in the past. I do not want to become one of them. There are so many discussions I want to have but I just can't because the lack of my ability and more. I miss that so much. To have an intelligent conversation with someone that can reply with meaningful information, where we both walked away with some new and interesting facts would be wonderful.</p>
<p>I was never one to blow my own horn, but I do that today so others can see some of the steps I have made in hopes that they feel they are willing to take risks and help me expand my mission.</p>
<p>I have accomplished some great things and I think that is what I may share with my friends. Maybe I am repeating myself and I don't know it. I keep trying to figure out how I can change, but I struggle because I do not know what to do. It seems that Alzheimer's has taken over my life and not sure what or how to change.</p>

					Meeting July 19th 2013</strong></p>
<p>Please see below the HHS 2013 recommendations and National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners and International Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners recommendations for items pertaining to HHS numbers 14, 16, 18, 21 and 22 and education related items.</p>
<p>HHS 14: Develop a unified curriculum for primary care practitioners to become more knowledgeable about AD and enhance the skills necessary to deliver dementia capable care.</p>
<p>HHS 16: Form a blue ribbon panel of experts on advanced dementia to develop innovations in clinical care practice and quality, including palliative care, for people with advanced dementia.</p>
<p>HHS 18: States should assure that they have robust, dementia capable LTSS systems.</p>
<p>HHS 21: State education and health agencies and others should include key information about AD in all curricula for any profession or career track affecting LTSS.</p>
<p>HHS 22: State, local and private sector organizations should ensure that paraprofessional caregivers in every venue are adequately trained and compensated.</p>
<p>National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners NCCDP / International Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners ICCDP Recommendations:</p>
<p>NCCDP is recommending that the HHS include in the July 19th 2013 meeting of NAPA recommendations;</p>
<p>NCCDP is recommending that Alzheimer's disease and dementia education be provided by a Certified Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Trainer who has completed at minimum 12 hours of dementia education by a national training company who provides training for in-service directors and trainers, a Train the Trainer program that includes but not limited to; dementia / Alzheimer's disease overview, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, medications, behaviors, wandering, hoarding, sexuality, cultural diversity, nutrition, death and dying issues, types of dementia, depression, etc.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that the National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners and International Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners are added to the list of organizations that provide dementia education.</p>
<p>NCCDP is recommending that dementia education be required of all health care professionals and front line staff which includes but not limited to Physicians, Medical Directors, Pharmacists, Consultants, Activity Professionals, Recreation Specialists, Administrators, Assistant Administrators, Occupational Therapists, Physical Therapists, Speech Therapists, Nurses, Nursing Assistants, Personal Care Assistants, Home Health Aides, Dietitians, Social Workers, Clergy, Dietary Workers, Universal Workers, Housekeepers, Maintenance Workers, Security Guards, Bus Drivers, Mental Health Workers, MDS Coordinators, etc., All health care workers and front line staff who are currently working in Hospitals, Nursing Homes, Assisted Living, Adult Day care, CCRC, Hospitals, Home Care Agencies, , Hospice Agencies, Management Companies, Hospitals, Rehab Centers, Memory Centers, Boarding Homes, Adult Foster Homes, Senior Centers, Independent Living, HUD Housing, Shared Housing and any other geriatric setting and that the dementia education at minimum will consists of 12 hours of LIVE dementia education and an additional LIVE 8 hours that includes abuse and neglect and presented LIVE by Certified Alzheimer's disease and Dementia Trainers</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that all new staff (new hires) are required to have this education prior to beginning work or assignments.</p>
<p>NCCDP is recommending that all employees who work in any health care industry such as; associations, aging government office such as the Ombudsman, Office On Aging, State Offices who have Surveyor's, etc., are all required to have a minimum of 12 hours live dementia education at minimum and an additional LIVE 8 hours of education that includes abuse and neglect and presented LIVE by Certified Alzheimer's disease and Dementia Trainers</p>
<p>NCCDP is recommending that all learning institutions, trade schools, universities and two year colleges who provide any type of health care curriculum such as Nursing Assistant, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Speech Therapist, Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialist, Social Work, Nursing, Physician, Pharmacist, Dietitian, etc., either as a certificate program, registry program, licensing program or a degree degree will be required to provide 12 hours of dementia education and 8 hours of abuse and neglect classes prior to graduating from the program. NCCDP is recommending that the dementia education be taught live by a Certified Alzheimer's disease and Dementia Trainer.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommend mandatory 6 hours minimum of dementia education for all First Responders which includes but not limited to Law Enforcement, EMT's and Fire Fighters because they are often the first professional in the home during a crisis and they need dementia education so they are equipped to respond to a confused or disoriented individual. NCCDP recommends the education is provided by a NCCDP Certified First Responder Dementia Trainer CFRDT.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that the health care professional, front line staff and organization have the ability to select which company, college, trade school or private trainer to provide the Alzheimer's disease and dementia education and no one should be forced to select from a pared down list of a few institutions regardless of the organization private or nonprofit status. The public should make a choice based on the reputation, experience and knowledge of the organization presenting the dementia education.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that HHS put together a comprehensive list of institutions, technical colleges, organizations, consulting companies, private trainers and companies who provide Alzheimer's disease and dementia education and companies should be allowed to add their name to the list of providers with no endorsement from HHS. HHS should not recommend nor endorse one organization, trade school, university, private trainer, etc over another.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that HHS not put any kind of stipulation on a training program nor require that a training program be evidenced based. HHS should recommend what topics a comprehensive curriculum includes.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that ADEAR be expanded to include more information and resources for health care professionals to utilize rather than develop another national repository.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that ADEAR provide a list of USA and international organizations of what they provide and products, resources, learning materials, assessments currently available and includes but not limited to state organizations, institutions, organizations, companies, etc.</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends you and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services for the first National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease ("the Plan") and all the public and private sector stakeholders collaborating effectively to implement strategies crucial to transformative change for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. LEAD is pleased that a number of priority recommendations previously submitted by the coalition are included in the first Plan and is optimistic that the revised Plan will be even stronger.</p>
<p>LEAD is a diverse and growing coalition of 56 member organizations including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Working collaboratively with LEAD member organizations and other stakeholders across the Alzheimer's-serving continuum, we offer the recommendations below for the revised National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Equally important, we are prepared to work with the Administration, Congress, and all other interested parties to achieve the shared goals articulated in the Plan.</p>
<p>LEAD's recommendations seek to strengthen the goals, strategies, and actions within the Plan. As noted in earlier comments, LEAD believes that some actions can be pursued at no or only low cost but that the topline goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. It is imperative that both Plan work and outcomes are LEAD Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease accomplished with the utmost public transparency and that there is an effective methodology for assessing the impact that strategies within the Plan have on progress toward the timely achievement of stated goals. To that end, LEAD recommends that immediate action be taken to develop a model in 2013 that will allow HHS to assess the impact of the action steps in the Plan and identify areas for course adjustments. We, as a nation, should pursue only implementation steps that clearly are moving toward our goals. In that regard we recommend that each goal and strategy set forth in the final Plan include a budget, clear milestones and quantifiable metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Ian Kremer, LEAD's executive director. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD relied upon three workgroups -- one each in the areas of research and drug development, clinical care, and long-term care support and services -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the entire Alzheimer's-serving community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>

</ul><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Over-arching Plan Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Adopt all 2013 recommendations from the Advisory Council </em></strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan incorporate all the recommendations adopted by the Advisory Council at its January 2013 meeting.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Until such time as the statute may expand the number of seats on the Advisory Council, invite a person with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder to participate on each Advisory Council subcommittee as on outside expert</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that a mechanism be developed to have at least one person diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and one person diagnosed with a non- Alzheimer's dementing disorder begin actively participating in Advisory Council work no later than the summer of 2013. The public comment process is not an adequate substitute for comprehensive participation. The Advisory Council members and all federal officials involved in developing and implementing the Plan have stated unambiguously and with great integrity that the Plan addresses not only Alzheimer's disease but all dementing disorders; among the most important ways to give life to that commitment is to invite voices from a diverse range of dementing disorders.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 3: <em>Create a formal mechanism for additional federal government agencies to participate in the Advisory Council process</em> </strong></p>
<p>Rightly, HHS is leading the federal effort to develop and implement the Plan; HHS has encouraged and welcomed participation by other federal agencies. LEAD recommends that such participation be more formal, consistent, and robust. While expansion of statutory membership on the Advisory Council is one option worth consideration, LEAD believes that amending the statute is not a necessary prerequisite to convincing other federal agencies to participate voluntarily. At a minimum, the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education, along with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should participate in developing and implementing the Plan alongside colleagues from HHS and the Department of Veterans Affairs who already are engaged. Consider some representative examples: Labor and Education are critical to addressing health care workforce challenges; Hurricane Katrina and super storm Sandy painfully demonstrated the need for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop preparedness strategies for when natural disasters separate people with dementia from their care providers and settings; Alzheimer's disease science rapidly has become a critical issue in global economic competitiveness requiring attention by Commerce; both the Commerce Department and the State Department likely could contribute to HHS efforts to expand collaboration with foreign governments in coordinating existing national plans and potentially developing a global Plan; OPM and OMB need to be at the table to assess the impact on both the federal workforce and the federal budget.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 4: <em>Encourage participation in the Plan process by experts on non-dementing disorders that have a high rate of co-morbidity with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder</em> </strong></p>
<p>The Plan already encourages public-private partnerships (PPPs) and breaking down any tendencies to work in silos. LEAD recommends that the Advisory Council and HHS strongly encourage both formal and informal participation in the process of developing and implementing the Plan by public and private sector stakeholders with expertise in other disorders which have a high rate of comorbidity with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. For example, many people have both Alzheimer's disease and diabetes; while it is not yet clear with there is only a high correlation or a causal relationship, it is clear that it is much more financially costly and physically injurious to have both conditions together than either condition alone. The National Institute on Aging certainly could establish dialogue with other relevant NIH institutes focused on co-morbid conditions while Alzheimer's disease patient advocacy organizations on the Advisory Council could establish similar dialogue with patient advocacy organizations focused on co-morbid conditions to advance implementation of the Plan and develop recommendations for future revisions. Working collaboratively in the public and private sectors should make more effective efforts to reduce or better manage co-morbid conditions and, potentially, accelerate pursuit of scientific interventions to reduce the incidence of such conditions.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 5: <em>Identify and define a role for individuals and family members/family caregivers in each major section of the Plan</em> </strong></p>
<p>Individuals and family members/family caregivers are capable of contributing to memory loss detection, increasing participation in clinical trials, improving clinical care, reducing stigma, and raising public awareness. LEAD recommends that the Plan clearly identify and define ways in which individuals and family members (or their identified family caregivers) can support effective implementation of each major action or strategy within the Plan.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 6: <em>Incorporate throughout the Plan clear and transformative time-based metrics with projected necessary funding levels</em> </strong></p>
<p>It is abundantly clear to LEAD and others across the Alzheimer's-serving community how remarkable the work is that the Advisory Council and federal officials have done in a very compressed time frame. The depth and variety of recommendations and actions developed thus far have been impressive. Policy experts likely are able to unpack how these elements translate to changing real people's real problems. The Plan as a whole needs language that can be much more readily identified by the general public, language that will make clear how the Plan will change their lives. This is particularly needed in the Plan's clinical care and long terms supports goals. In the research goal, the Plan has that language in the form of the 2025 goal. But the complexity of the language and the sort of inside Washington nature of what is proposed in the Advisory Council recommendations and what is already embedded in the Plan's clinical care and long term supports sections, is impenetrable for average citizens who need the Plan to work but who also need to be inspired by the Plan and have their hope sustained or restored by the Plan. There should be aspirational goals across the Plan that are tangible, transformative, and clear. Take the model of the 2025 goal and frame parallel goals in the clinical care and long term supports portions of the Plan. Much of what already exists in those sections of the Plan already point in the direction of what would be aspirational goals but those aspirational goals have not been articulated. The Plan proposes to fix the systems but does not articulate why the systems need to be fixed or what would be achieved as a result of fixing the systems.</p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan adopt time-based goals -- that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other public and private sector agencies could collaborate to implement -- for:</p>
<ul><li>increasing the percentage of people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder who are diagnosed and the diagnosis properly charted in the medical record, informed of the diagnosis, and referred by the diagnosing medical practice to community resources;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of wandering and the rate of injury or death;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of family caregiver depression;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of falls by people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder in home and community based settings as well as in residential care facilities; and</li>
<li>increasing the utilization of hospice and other palliative care services.</li>
</ul><p>LEAD recognizes that most or all of the goals, strategies and action items within the Plan entail significant federal investments designed to reduce over time costs to the public and private health care systems, the economy, and the toll of human suffering. LEAD recommends that the Plan articulate the federal investments needed to achieve the established goals and value of the budgetary, economic and social benefits that are to be accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 7: <em>Commission an independent analysis of the investment value of Alzheimer's disease spending by the federal government</em> </strong></p>
<p>Members of Congress, the Administration and tens of millions of Americans recognize the strategic irrationality and inhumanity of the enormous federal expenditures on care for people with Alzheimer's compared to the relatively miniscule federal investment on research to prevent, treat or cure this devastating disease. But that imbalance persists and worsens year after year in part because the federal government scores federal research spending as a cost rather than an investment. The scoring system therefore ignores not only the future cost-savings to social safety net programs but also the future revenue gains that would accrue from development of new products with a vast global market, increases in workplace productivity, and an expanded workforce. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for an independent body to assess the investment value of the federal government's Alzheimer's disease research funding and provide policy options to correct the current imbalance between federal funding for research and care.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD supports this bold goal, with the hope that it will be achieved more rapidly with the right plan and resource commitment. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has included a number of recommendations submitted by the coalition under Goal 1, including the recommendation for a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on "the most promising pharmacological interventions" as well as accelerating efforts to "identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease." LEAD applauds the increasing emphasis on international coordination and collaboration with commercial and nonprofit partners. However, it is imperative that any goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease must include research investments in non-pharmacological treatments. Nonpharmacological approaches can improve relevant outcomes including improved behavior and delay of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds NIH/NIA for convening the first Research Summit in May of 2012 and for its plans to reconvene every other year around specific research topics of high priority to the field. LEAD recommends that each summit provide explicit strategies and milestones to be met within defined timeframes. Furthermore, LEAD recommends that each summit have a specific session to report milestones and the progress of strategies set at previous summits.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that HHS carryout and begin implementing by the end of 2013 the action plan produced by its intended convening of representatives from across the federal government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to create an action plan for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the building of registries.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions </strong></p>
<p>Strategies to expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease should reference industry's contribution in conducting clinical trials. Strategies should build on the infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new therapeutic targets and therapies--including combination therapies--for trials and their existing working relationships with regulators to ensure that safe and effective treatments get approved. The NIH/NIA 2012 Alzheimer's disease Summit included debate on examining the current conceptual models in studying the disease as well as providing a portion of federal funding for cutting-edge proposals. Non-pharmacologic interventions should also be explored, including community-based interventions and technologies that allow people with dementia to function independently for as long as possible. Strategies should include a statement of what each federal and industry partner can contribute and where the cost and time of the clinical trial process can be reduced consistent with standards of safety and efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression </strong></p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry, and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a large-scale, open-source patient registry of subjects that can be approached for recruitment in prevention trials, including specifically under-represented ethnic and other sub-populations. Consider a broader healthy aging registry, similar to the Framingham study for cardiovascular disease, to follow asymptomatic individuals and those with correlated diseases such as diabetes (the new European Medical Information Framework -- Innovative Medicines Initiative consortium has a similar aim). Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on development of quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector </strong></p>
<p>With the levels of funding now dedicated by government, academia, and industry to Alzheimer's disease research, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of all partners and resources -- and make the best use of the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. There is a need to align government, industry and academic sponsored studies to achieve consensus on defined recommendations for advancing new drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. A precedent exists in other disease areas (e.g. STAIR recommendations for stroke). Current public-private partnerships in the Alzheimer's disease arena have not yet owned this opportunity to date. Funding would catalyze such progress. Research should be a community-wide effort for public private collaboration and HHS should consider asking the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to help coordinate this effort with them.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.1: Pursue ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments </strong></p>
<p>There are many important -- albeit underfunded -- strategies being pursued to speed treatments to patients such as disease modeling, drug repurposing, better target identification, and strategies for combination therapy. However, a major issues remains with respect to the lack of a centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB). LEAD recommends that this Action include expanded public and private support for a uniform patient consent and centralized IRB to review all multi-center Alzheimer's disease trials to decrease the time for trial start-up and protocol amendments.</p>
<p>The National Biomedical Research Ethics Council (NBREC) has been incorporated as a "neutral" home to develop a National IRB for Neurodegenerative Diseases (NIRB-ND). The NIRB-ND will closely follow the Central IRB model pioneered successfully by the National Cancer Institute, and it will be managed by a Steering Committee composed of representatives from the sponsoring organizations/foundations.</p>
<p>Given the proposed changes to the "Common Rule" on the topic of centralized IRBs (cIRBs) and the National Institutes of Health's growing interest in cIRBs, this effort will provide an innovative solution to a problem shared by many constituencies interested in therapy development. The NBREC approach features the establishment of a successful public-private partnership business model. The NIRB-ND will guarantee the protection of study volunteers, reduce needless delays in large clinical trials, decrease costs and reduce risks associated with studies. The project is exploring options for expanding reviews to include Canada and eventually countries within the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings </strong></p>
<p>There is an exponential growth in the number of public and private partnerships (PPPs) in the Alzheimer's disease arena, which is simultaneous with a concern of consortia fatigue. The sense of urgency exists to address improved understanding of the scope of activities (in scope and out of scope) for the numerous PPPs, and specifically how alignment is taking place to avoid duplication of effort. Positive examples exist of synergistic alliances between ACT-AD, C-Path and CAMD, ADNIPPSB/Alzheimer's Association, and the Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease. Defining specified resources aimed at facilitating coordinating PPPs is an unmet and urgent need. Leadership from ASPE is crucial and should be made a priority.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan include a process for developing standardized informed consent to allow participants in clinical trials to authorize their deidentified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study in order to advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. LEAD recommends pooling of individual de-identified data into larger Alzheimer's disease databases -- globally available to qualified researchers -- to allow data mining and to increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, HIPPA, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Implement Alzheimer's disease specific data standards to ensure a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data</em> </strong></p>
<p>The Plan should encourage all new and ongoing federally funded and industrysponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease specific data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Using these standards will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA and EMA. Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data, including data in failed trials, data with respect to dormant drugs, and data rich in biomarker information, should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's disease CDISC data standards and any federally funded and industry sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use. Given the FDA's preference and future requirement for submission of clinical data in CDISC unified clinical data standards, it is recommended that data be collected for current and future clinical trials in CDISC format using the AD CDISC therapeutic area specific standards. Lack of action on this recommendation will slow the time for regulatory drug review of any new therapeutic candidate.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Plan includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. The Plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis, and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans requiring care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings.</p>
<p>As the Plan has evolved from the Alzheimer's Disease Study Group (ASG), to the Advisory Council and the first Plan, we have not adequately motivated the Plan with a clear vision of what clinical care should look like in the United States. The comprehensive effort to date has been laudable and has advanced the country's goals with respect to research. But research advances will not have the impact that they should unless we begin with an equally broad and forwardlooking conceptualization of clinical care.</p>
<p>ASG recommendations related to clinical care in 2009 were limited to a focus on measurements of quality, making paid caregiving available, and educating the public about the disease. There was an implicit assumption that medical care is already uniform, executed consistently and well in diverse settings, and that it encompasses the public need. In 2011, LEAD recommended that the Plan include development of a workforce to diagnose and care for people with memory disorders; improve models for reimbursement that incentivize practitioners to diagnose early and treat persistently; support pilot and demonstration projects to improve the care that is available; develop innovative new models for care; improvement of emergency care for people with dementia; and establishment of a network of geographically accessible memory disorders centers to serve as translational sites to advance the medicine around prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of AD and related conditions. The first Plan was very strong on collaborations among agencies, advancement of neuroimaging and biological markers to aid in early diagnosis and drug development, educating the workforce and disseminating existing guidelines (albeit limited and out of date), as well as educating the public. It also mentioned the need to strengthen direct care, without describing the deficiencies; the need to survey unmet needs; to develop cost-effective models of care; to improve minority care; to protect the vulnerable; and to assess the housing needs of people with dementia. These listings may be perceived as somewhat piecemeal and secondary by people at risk for and living with memory disorders, their families, and healthcare workers.</p>
<p>Clinical care should encompass detection of risk factors, management of risk factors, early diagnosis and lifelong management, regardless of social differences, medical co-morbidities, and physical location. Citizens should be able to count on comparable approaches regardless of where they live or how they fund their healthcare. New advances in research related to risk, diagnosis, and treatment should translate easily into clinical settings, so that willing patients can help to prove or disprove their utility. And clinicians who choose to promote brain health and provide care to people with memory disorders across the stages of their lives should be able to do so without bankrupting their practices. Without some effort to develop a national, clinical focus on specialized prevention and care approaches, there will be no true expertise--and the greatest advances to date are at risk of being irrelevant because there is no coherent approach to ensuring that they shape practices in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 2 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties </strong></p>
<p>The Plan recognizes both the worsening shortage in the geriatric specialty workforce and the dire consequences that the shortage causes for the growing population of people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. LEAD recommends that the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) support training projects that provide fellowships for individuals studying to be geriatric social workers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.6: Support state and local Alzheimer's strategies </strong></p>
<p>The Plan recognizes that many states and local communities have developed dementia strategies and action plans. The Advisory Council repeatedly has discussed opportunities for the national Plan and these state or local plans to share and reinforce best practices. LEAD recommends that HHS and the Department of Labor collaboratively develop best practices for direct-care workforce development, recruitment, and retention tailored to each provider setting in the Alzheimer's disease care continuum including: home health, adult day, assisted living, skilled nursing, and hospice.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Address inconsistencies across geographic areas and subspecialties, and from provider to provider</em> </strong></p>
<p>Clinical approaches to risk management, diagnosis, and treatment are inconsistent across geographical areas and subspecialties, and also vary from care provider to care provider. Existing education of physicians regarding dementia and related disorders is also quite limited, despite the fact that the Medicare Trust Fund spends over $9 billion annually to subsidize Graduate Medical Education. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for conducting a nationwide assessment of available expertise by region of the country including expert clinicians in all relevant specialties (family practice, general internal medicine, geriatrics, neurology, psychology, psychiatry, and social work), paid caregivers, day centers, overnight respite care, and long term care options. This should include examination of current practices for risk factor management, diagnosis, longitudinal outpatient management, emergency management, and long term residential care in each area. Additionally, all residency programs should be assessed for the amount of education and training focused on dementia and related disorders.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Update reimbursement formulas to encourage brain health risk management, early diagnosis of memory disorders, persistent and multi-disciplinary treatment, and uniform levels of treatment across care settings</em> </strong></p>
<p>The current reimbursement system discourages brain health related risk management, early diagnosis of memory disorders, persistent treatment, multidisciplinary treatment, and uniform levels of treatment regardless of care setting. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for an analysis (to be completed by the end of 2013) of the actual costs and reimbursements for laboratory services and patient visits for risk factor management, diagnosis, and longitudinal outpatient management, and for diagnosis and management within long term care settings. The analysis should benchmark successful programs and practices. LEAD also recommends that the Plan call for HHS to propose (by the summer of 2014) options to correct the reimbursement formulas as needed to optimize these efforts; funding for demonstration projects for models of care across the spectrum of disease; and funding for demonstration projects to assess the impact of dementia specific medical homes. For example, reimbursement levels might be tied to whether nationally certified dementia specific services were provided.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 3: <em>Address inadequate emergency and acute hospital care for people with memory disorders, especially those with dementia</em> </strong></p>
<p>Inadequate emergency and acute hospital care imposes staggering costs on the physical and emotional well being of patients, families, and medical personnel. The economic costs to patients, providers, public and private insurers are unsustainable. The horror stories are well known, more typical than anecdotal, and all too true. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for HHS to complete (by the end of 2013) a nationwide assessment of the available inpatient and outpatient emergency care for dementia patients with acute agitation or psychosis and the quality of inpatient care for people with memory disorders hospitalized for non-dementia related conditions. LEAD further recommends that the Plan call for HHS to propose (by the summer of 2014) methods to incentivize hospitals and psychiatrists to handle dementia related emergencies and standards for emergency care for people with dementia. For example, HHS could consider proposing standards for geriatric psychiatry units, which currently are not required to have a psychiatrist or even a geriatrician.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 4: <em>Establish a network of geographically dispersed and accessible memory disorders centers, linked to sites providing integrated research and patient care, to facilitate translational medicine, and to continuously develop and improve the standard of care</em> </strong></p>
<p>Access to quality care -- and the application of medical practice to transformative research -- all too frequently is compromised by geographical happenstance. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for provision of supplemental funding to the centers for infrastructure and reporting, and ensure adequate reimbursement within the centers to support clinical infrastructure. Additionally, LEAD recommends that the Plan establish a target date of 2017 for HHS to develop a comprehensive national public health strategy for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders which includes for all Americans regardless of age or care setting early assessment of risk factors, advice about risk mitigation, access to diagnosis and disease management.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds the Plan for including goals and strategies that will improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that the Plan includes recommendations from LEAD to expand proven programs that are in place at the federal, state and local levels that provide adequate care and support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families. Moving forward it is important that the Plan provide adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 3 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials </strong></p>
<p>Stigma has diverse cultural bases and forms of expression. Reducing stigma and its consequences requires culturally appropriate interventions. LEAD recommends that stigma be identified as a specific criteria when implementing Actions 3.A.1, 3.A.2, and 2.A.3.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations </strong></p>
<p>The Plan calls for HHS to "partner with private organizations to convene a meeting of leading scientists and practitioners to review the state of the art of research and translational activities related to evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations." LEAD recommends that the Plan now call for such a meeting to be an annual occurrence.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>LEAD supports this Plan action and recommends that it be expanded to include education for court personnel, financial planners, and first responders. A number of states and local communities have extensive and evidence-based experience partnering with private organizations such as the Alzheimer's Association in educating first responders and court personnel (some have worked with financial planners) to better meet the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders and of family caregivers. At a minimum, HHS and the Department of Justice could serve as a clearinghouse for best practices in educating legal, financial, and emergency services professionals.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan call for development of training standards, for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, by government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include home care, adult day care, assisted living, and nursing home. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes among providers, family caregivers, other advocates, and people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2: <em>Develop best practices to help family caregivers remain productive in the workplace</em> </strong></p>
<p>Many family caregivers want or need to remain in the workforce but face substantial challenges that could be addressed successfully with workplace policies designed for elder care and based on the accommodations begun more than a generation ago for working parents. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for development of best practices to help family caregivers remain productive in the workplace. Best practices may include flextime; work-at-home options; jobsharing; counseling; dependent care accounts; information and referral to community services; and employer-paid services of a care manager.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3: <em>Assess the impact on and develop best practices for supporting children who are family caregivers</em> </strong></p>
<p>At the local, state, and federal levels, enormous investments are committed to advancing the academic and personal success of children. Increasingly, there is widespread -- perhaps universal -- realization that the efficacy of such investments can be enhanced or diminished by students' home environment. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for HHS and the Department of Education to collaboratively examine the consequences of Alzheimer's disease family caregiving on the academic achievement, and social-emotional well being of children and develop best practices for schools to support the needs of these students.</p>

<p>I would also like to share with your team a modified article that I had originally written for the World Alzheimer Report 2012. Since that time I had the opportunity to take a 3 week vacation which I truly loved. At the same time it pointed out new weakness in my skills and I realize I have declined a bit more. There was a time that I can follow a map and could easily get from point A to B. Unfortunately this time was different. I had to continuously rely on my wife who was not quite used to taking on this challenge. When I look at the map, I just cannot focus on an area and I just keep seeing all of the streets. You also need to keep into memory where you are coming from and what was the last cross streets, which again I cannot retain. Unfortunately my frustration was passed on to her because I expected her to perform at the level I once could. It's not easy living with a dementia person.</p>
<p>Then there was looking at the menus, I just could not seem to look at menus and make sense because I was being confused by it being into different languages even though one was English. For one reason or another I just could not process that information and had to rely on my wife to know what I like to help me make a choice.</p>
<p>Then there was the train stations. I looked at the boards completely confused and not understanding what my wife was seeing on how and where to get our next train. I just went along for the ride and thank god she knew what she was doing. These are all things I have never had to rely on anyone. In fact I was the one being the leader in my business and personal life when it came to those types of things.</p>
<p>I also use to have a great sense of direction without a map and almost never got lost. But I realized that in order to do that you need to be able to retain when and where you turn so you can keep track of direction. It seems that I lost that because I had to tell my wife to figure out where we were many times. She was not use to that which placed a lot more stress on her. It seems that more and more things are starting to fall on her shoulders and that is a very big burden to have to carry. In fact I realized to late that I had over burden her with even making this trip, which I was once very cable of doing or at least sharing the load. There was so much planning involved and it all fell one her because I cannot even be a bouncing board to check for accuracy anymore.</p>
<p>I always walked around with this fear that I might get lost in a crowd from my wife. But that's why I always made sure to have the business card for the hotel I was staying at. I am telling you all this and sharing the article below because we all hear all the medical terms around dementia issue, but I really believe most people are clueless when it comes to truly understanding what dementia people really have to deal with. I learned this first hand dealing with the supposedly expert health reporters. I want people to become educated and realize that while our disability is not visible, it is by far a very true disability. I hope this will be useful to your team. As always I am willing to speak about this openly and be completely honest no matter how embarrassing it may be.</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>"The Realities of Alzheimer's and Overcoming Stigma"</strong></p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect more than 35 million people worldwide today. An astonishing fact that today someone in the world develops dementia every 4 seconds. By the middle of the century more than 115 million people will be affected by the disease if we do nothing.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen, and I am living with Alzheimer's and trying to make a difference. I was previously a high-level manager in the telecommunication industry. In 2008, I was diagnosed with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD) after struggling to get a diagnosis since my first symptoms at age 39. Losing my job and not being able to work had a huge impact on my life as I was a workaholic. I am now an Alzheimer's advocate and a spokesperson for the Alzheimer's Association (U.S.) as a member of its national 2012 Early-Stage Advisory Group.</p>
<p>I am so frustrated, because no one realizes how seriously disabled I am. If I had a loss of limb or some other visual ailment, it would make people realize. I don't want them to feel sorry for me or pity me, just want to be understood. So many people say you do not seem to have Alzheimer's, and that frustrates me. Let me tell you what it's like to live with this debilitating and progressive disease.</p>
<p>Imagine for one minute that your friend, relative or family member has Alzheimer's and has to deal with the following issues. When I go shopping and look at items, most of them never really register in my mind, even though I see it clearly. I have trouble making decisions, because I question whether I am making the right one. I can no longer enjoy my favorite hobbies, because it requires processing skills that I no longer have. I went from being a gadget person, to now being threatened by technology that I no longer can use. This is what I deal with and so much more.</p>
<p>I go to a happy affair only to be tortured by the noise and surrounding conversations, because of the loudness that cannot be filtered out. If people try to speak with me in a public setting where there are many other conversations, I just don't understand what they are saying. This is because all of the people speaking come in at the same volume level. All the words run together, and it sounds like a foreign language.</p>
<p>I went from being extremely proactive to becoming much less active and motivated. I leave things around the house and don't put them away, because I don't know where they go or feel I may not know where to retrieve them again. One moment I am nice and another I may fly off the handle. I can no longer write or speak like I used to. My friends slowly become distant and usually speak to my wife. I do realize this.</p>
<p>I worry every day about the challenges ahead. Or even worse, I am losing my mind and see it happening, but I cannot do anything to change the course. People always say 'if I can do anything just let me know." If I take them up on that offer, they back out of their commitments. I have become extremely surprised by the lack of public commitment to my pleas for support of Alzheimer's disease. While some may be sympathetic in the moment, there appears to be little follow-through. This is very upsetting, because I feel as though it affects me personally as well as the millions of others living with the disease. I was always there for others when they needed it and now I feel alone.</p>
<p>While many people just coast through the day, I have to use 110% of my processing skills to do most things, which increases the stress and frustration. The worst part about this disease is knowing that I am doing all these things wrong and have no way to control or stop it, and it's only getting worse as the days go by. I used to save lots of money by doing so many things around the house. Now I lost the drive, determination and skills needed to do those things. Many times I hurt myself trying or make it worse.</p>
<p>I cannot begin to explain how it tears me up inside to see my spouse struggling to do the things that I once was capable of doing and know I cannot do a thing to help. I realize that one day I may no longer be able to drive and this devastates me. I see my wife becoming stressed, depressed and overwhelmed, but caregivers know it will only continue to get worse. Sadly, they keep telling themselves that they can do it all even when we know they will need help.</p>
<p>I, the patient, see it definitely. My wife is on the road to hell, and she does not even realize it yet, because she is so busy trying to block it all out. The worst part about all this is, I have not even reached the worst stage. That scares the hell out of me.</p>
<p>I have been so surprised by the stigma associated with this disease. It comes at you from all angles. People think they knew what Alzheimer's is, but they don't. I see this not only from people living with dementia but many media health correspondents, physicians and organizations that are geared to helping those deal with the disease. I have learned that I do not want to share my diagnosis with people I meet until they get to know me. If I was to tell them upfront, I would be treated so differently, which I have learned. I kind of see this disease like HIV use to be. The people who have it are so afraid to let others know, including family. I do not get it. We did nothing wrong to get this disease, and we need to speak up to let our voice be heard. We did nothing and no one should be ashamed of having it. I feel so much better when I share it with others than when I try to hide it.</p>
<p>Because of my frustration with existing environment for people with dementia, I realized change was need. I decided to use my few skills left to advocate. I have spent some of my last few years being on television, radio, newspapers, many blogs and working with many politicians. I also had an opportunity to speak at all of the public sessions to develop the first U.S. National Alzheimer's Plan, all this on my own. But that was not enough, because I ran into so many people who just did not want to get involved. I am now a volunteer for the national Alzheimer's Association Early-Stage Advisory Group. If there is something I want you to walk away with it's that you can make a difference, but it will take persistence. Write a letter to your public official or reach out to local support organizations to create needed programs and services. Your voice and your story are powerful tools. Please get involved.</p>
<p>The simple truth is, if you have not been touched by this devastating and debilitating disease yet, consider yourself extremely lucky. Sadly, it's just a matter of time before it touches you. It is my hope that my actions today may prevent future generations from suffering with this disease. So give yourself piece of mind and do something today. I hope that what I am doing will allow me to leave this world knowing that I did everything possible to make that next generation have a fighting chance. There are no excuses for not wanting to help. The human cost factor is too high, and we are all accountable to do something.</p>
<p>There are many organizations out there like ADI and the Alzheimer's Association that can help you. The Alzheimer's Association got me started in many ways with my new journey. It not only helped me, but it also had helped my wife as my caregiver. They have a website with many resources at <a href="http://www.alz.org">http://www.alz.org</a>. I encourage you to reach out today if you have not already. I would also encourage you to educate yourself.</p>
<p>Please join me and Go Purple. I wear a purple Alzheimer's bracelet every day. And for those living with Alzheimer's, stop focusing on what you cannot do and join me in the battle to advocate. We still have so much to give, and we need to use our skills at our own speed. There is nothing to be ashamed of. I, and your loved ones, are counting on all of you.</p>

<p>Thank you for your outstanding efforts on NAPA and the May 2012 Alzheimer's Disease Summit.</p>
<p>Below you will find a brief response to a proposal on the use of NAPA funding which has disturbed me sufficiently to immediately respond to both the Alzheimer's Organization and NIH. Specifically, NIA's goal to reduce use of antipsychotics by 15% in the first year and to expand training programs on behavioral intervention.</p>
<p>This is outrageous.</p>
<p>The FDA specifically proscribes the use of antipsychotic drugs other than for their specified purpose and has issued unequivocal warnings of danger up to and including stroke or death to the elderly on misadministration. Medicare specifically proscribes the use of chemical or physical restraints.</p>
<p>The United States Attorney is handling hundreds if not thousands of False Claims Act matters with severe economic penalty against pharmaceutical firms. Local prosecutors are filing criminal complaints against nurses and doctors for the use of anti-psychotics not only in SNF's but, as to children in juvenile detention facilities.</p>
<p>37% of the AD population in Florida is on psychotropic drugs.</p>
<p>First, the act of using a pill or injection in this manner for behavioral control has been characterized by prosecutors as a criminal battery.</p>
<p>Medicare, through Plan D has intimate knowledge of the extent of use by date, duration, dosage and location. If there is extensive use of antipsychotics in a particular facility, the matter should be referred to the United States attorney's office for investigation and appropriate action. Absent referral yet with knowledge, obstruction of justice issues arise.</p>
<p>Individuals don't have the ability to do this. They can only act as to a particular patient in what is essentially a disenfranchised population. Health care surrogates, if any, may or may not be informed of the offensive conduct or attentive to the needs of AD patients who are being abused in this manner.</p>
<p>It is inevitable with an increasingly litigious baby boomer generation that such obstruction of justice charges, conspiracy, RICO and other criminal complaints will be made against the federal government employees, agencies, nursing home operators, nurses and doctors and pharmacies as well as civil actions for damages from injury or wrongful death. It has already started.</p>
<p>Treating this inhuman torture of elderly as an administrative efficiency issue is an abuse as vicious, criminal and sadistic as the act of administering the injection or forcing the pill. I don't know if you have ever sat next to a SNF frail elderly AD with a hip fracture, shaking and crying after administration of an antipsychotic. It will haunt you. One more day is too much.</p>
<p>In one Medicare 5 star facility, an attempt was made in the first week to give a new AD patient an anti seizure drug because the patient was "acting out". The surrogate declined. In this facility, AD were separated from the general population. A friend/aide covering the new patient for an afternoon was a nurse and a former nun from Ireland. She took her to a SNF music recital and was shocked because the rest of the patients were virtually comatose. The surrogate showed up at the facility the next day to find the patient's arms covered with a large hematoma and bruises from wrist to elbow as well as split skin on the forehead. No one had alerted the surrogate to the injury. No staff member would address the injury. The AD patient was pulled out of the facility.</p>
<p>The only way to stop this abuse is to aggressively act. The United States Attorney in Boston took action against J&amp;J and Omnicare under the False Claims Act. It is incumbent upon Medicare and NIH/NIA and AD advocacy organizations to treat this with the same seriousness of purpose and dispense with pharma and nursing home owner/operator handholding. If you as individuals and as a representative of your agency or organization do not have the courage, the talent, the knowledge and the integrity to immediately save these patients from needless continued suffering, don't work in this field.</p>
<p>One doctor advised me that the section of the brain controlling the creative was the last to be destroyed in AD. After months of fruitless research for activities which benefitted AD, I found myself reading the Jerusalem Post on August 5 to find a care center in Israel with a program which made their days enjoyable.</p>
<p>How embarrassing for us that I had to go so far.</p>
<p>Training of Staff</p>
<p>The recommendation to utilize NAPA money on manpower to train nurses and aides in behavioral intervention techniques is a waste of time and an inefficient, inappropriate use of manpower and resources. I don't understand the continuing tolerance of the medical profession feeding itself from subsidies. What is next? Gerontology certification training for attorneys who are not up to speed?</p>
<p>Administrators, nurses and aides are licensed by the state. Prior to licensure, they have to complete training through state approved contractors to insure that they are qualified to perform the function of the profession they have elected to join. If the state, by and through its contractors has not met its responsibility to properly set forth statutory and regulatory qualifications for certification and/or contractors have not met those guidelines in training programs (for which they are compensated), to qualify licensees to meet the needs of the population they service (AD) despite clear demonstrable need, it is incumbent upon the state and its contractors to immediately remedy any training deficiencies.</p>
<p>The professional associations or the Alzheimer's organizations can prepare AD Behavioral Intervention Training materials by disc or online/video cam for sale to state training approved contractors. The state training contractors should incorporate these materials into certification training. If the individual is already licensed, state facility and professional license renewal should be contingent on licensee completion of such continuing professional education.</p>
<p>Tapes are valuable because they can be viewed repeatedly by staff, caretakers and home health care aides at leisure. With all respect to dedicated trainers, sometimes the level of sophistication is not very high and the quality of instruction questionable. Further and often, recommended techniques which fail to address the individual do not work. For example, one newly trained MSW put a group of AD in a room overlooking the garden with peaceful music. One lady was quiet but when they moved her out, she burst out crying. She said they kept her in room next to a desk listening to that "horrible music" because the bill had not been paid and they would not let her go to the bathroom until her family showed up and paid it. She was quiet because she was embarrassed.</p>
<p>Second, agitation and "acting out" are based on inability to communicate physical distress, pain or discomfort, infection, medication side effect or misadministration, fear, frustration, or confusion. Hallucination occurs in the late stages. Behavioral intervention will not be effective if the problem is physical because the underlying cause is not abated. This should be the first step in evaluation.</p>
<p>As experienced nurses will tell you, successful behavioral intervention involves an intimate knowledge of the patient and time consuming one on one attention. Unless and until there is increased staffing in the facility so more than medication administration, dressing, bathing, changing and feeding can be accomplished, no more than lip service will be paid to training efforts. Nurses are furious that, because of budgetary staffing constraints, they may be professionally hurt and their patient's needs are not addressed. Other nurses are so beaten down they are numb and operate on autopilot. Some doctors are clueless. They defer to nurses and pharmain prescription and rarely visit the patient. Yet Medicare pays for their time.</p>
<p>The Florida legislature has declined to increase minimum staffing. Consideration should be given to a mandatory national standard.</p>
<p>Represented decline in the use of antipsychotics is not based on facility compliance with Medicare proscriptions. It is based on the fact that reputable SNF's and AL's refuse to take patients with AD. If a patient develops AD while in the facility and doping is not used, the facility demands 24/7 private care in addition to the facility charges which is paid for by the family as a condition of retention. This is why AD are taken home for private care and lives of caretakers are destroyed.</p>
<p>I have reviewed the financial representations of SNF's and AL's which are on the market throughout the nation. A substantial majority represent a net profit to owners of 35 to 50% of gross income. If a SNF or AL is doping to increase or preserve owner profit, it is time for closure with possible criminal prosecution. Alternatively, federal or state takeover or placement in a form of receivership until compliance is accomplished would be recommended.</p>
<p>I will address specific recommendations including programs and services which actually benefit AD afflicted under separate cover including sources of additional funding for the Alzheimer's Organization.</p>
<p>We had a triple dose of AD in our family. I was responsible for one highly agitated elderly with multiple physical issues for fifteen years, nine 24/7 as well as one late stage dementia. I have used the resources of your site and NIH since it was first accessible on the internet as well as every other medical information site available. I have read deficiency reports for probably 70% of SNF's in Florida, visited facilities, spoken to nurses and other caretakers on a regular and continuous basis and had a front row seat to institutional neglect of elderly AD including a few direct hits.</p>
<p>By way of my qualifications, I am attorney, with a BA University of Notre Dame in government/economics, an MPA NYU, and experience representing the legislative interests of a State Department including Aging, Local Government Services, Housing and Human Services with floor privileges in the Senate and House; in a corporate construction/development operation in a new and heavily regulated industry conforming operations and employment with statutory and regulatory directives; law firm experience including pharma product liability defense; and extensive experience as a mediator.</p>

<p>Attached is my letter to be read at the NAPA April 17 meeting. I tried to keep it as short as possible, but I was afraid I would lose part of the message I was trying to convey. I would have liked to focus on only one or two points, but I felt they were all very important. Maybe some were in the middle of reading you can slam a book down to get everyone's attention to refocus at my request since I am not there to get their attention. I'll be watching.</p>
<p>Is there a way I can send you an email to a blackberry or something if I hear something that I would like to bring up last minute as I attend the meeting from home?</p>
<p>Thank you again for all this. You have no idea what it means to me to be able to be a participant in this project.</p>

<p>I cannot express enough the <strong>Urgency</strong> and need for interim goal at 2020 or earlier, victims cannot wait for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong> ... 2020/2025 is goal critical but we need to mobilize the will, the plan and the resource to get there as quickly.</p>
<p>Save time, money and lives, by not reinventing the wheel. Use the finished HIV model. I am a firm believer that the people before us have laid the framework needed to get started so we are not wasting a lot of time on the basics. The only approach I always followed along with that is, to delete, enhance and critique to make the plan even better. Ask the previous plan makers what they did wrong and what would they do different. Ninety percent of that framework came from the best of many minds. I really believe the input and suggestions made by Bruce Lamb, in his letter from January 13, 2012 should be discussed when building this framework.</p>
<p>One thing that keeps coming to mind is the disparity issue related to AD. Am I the only one that sees this, or do we all just not want to talk about it? For example, AD was first identified and named in 1906, while AIDS was identified in 1981. I see us now in the same stages as HIV was in 1988, when a focused effort was begun towards treatment or cure, with the creation of The Office of AIDS Research. It took an additional 5 years to strengthen this OAR (The NIH Revitalization Act), which really made a huge difference. Within three years of that day and by 1996 we started to finally have an impact on AIDS.</p>
<p>Let's not make a similar mistake as we did with HIV. Let's create a diseased focused agency for AD, with all the necessary strength, as of day one. Just think you can make up for the disparity that has been created and just maybe we could have a cure in less than 5 years.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership</strong> ... the President himself needs to speak out because we need everybody at the table -- not just Federal government, but industry, research community, victims and affected families, people of all ages -- and only he is in a position to provide that leadership.</p>
<p>Government should consider offering a large sum of money to anyone who can come up with the cure for this disease first. While I am not sure what that amount should be, it can be in cash and partial tax credits. I think that will drive many more into this arena and more efforts if the pie is big enough.</p>
<p>Bruce Lamb shared his viewpoints on January 13, 2012, which were very interesting. I really like these paragraphs below and we should all learn from them. Bruce makes very good points on how to evaluate the adequacy of Alzheimer's funding.</p>
<p>If one assumes that funding for HIV/AIDS was right sized to enable translation of basic discoveries to successful therapies, then given the lack of effective AD therapies, one possible implication is that funding for AD has been insufficient. A quick comparison of funding levels for HIV/AIDs relative to AD in the United States suggests this may be at least one factor that has hindered the translation of AD discovery to effective therapies. Based on publicly available data, National Institute of Health funding for HIV/AIDS in the United States is currently approximately $3 billion [5]. With approximately 1 million HIV-positive subjects in the United States, this equates to $3,000 of NIH funding per person with HIV/AIDs. In contrast, current NIH funding for AD is at a level of approximately $450 million [5], with perhaps another approximately $100 million to $200 million in NIH funding that might have some relevance to the study of AD (cognitive decline in aging, related neuro degenerative conditions). With a current prevalence of approximately 5 million individuals affected with AD in the United States, this equates to a maximum of $130 of NIH funding per person affected with the disease. So, on a per affected individual basis, NIH funding for HIV/AIDs is 23 times the level of that for AD.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many different ways to evaluate proportional or relative funding. Another one that is quite germane is economic impact. For AD in the United States this is estimated at more than $170 billion per year (and worldwide at $600 billion per year) [6]. Again focusing only on the United States, the yearly funding for research by the NIH represents 0.4% of the yearly costs of the disease in the United States. In other words, for every $2 the disease costs the United States, we spend less than 1 cent on research.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone for their hard work to date, but even more important is for you to actually follow through on the promises and plans. I am counting on you!</p>

<p>Alzheimer's News 4/11/2012</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association commends recognition of Alzheimer's and dementia as global health threat</strong></p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association strongly supports the call to action in the newly released World Health Organization (WHO) report <em>Dementia: A Public Health Priority</em>, which asks for all nations to develop and implement a national Alzheimer's plan, conduct greater efforts in early detection and diagnosis, and increase support of Alzheimer's disease research.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association is pleased that the WHO, in partnership with Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI), has released its first-ever major report on Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Alzheimer's and dementia affects more than <strong>35 million people worldwide today</strong>, and the report reveals the astonishing fact that today someone in the world <strong>develops dementia every 4 seconds</strong>; by the <strong>middle of the century more than 115 million people</strong> will be affected by the disease.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the comprehensive report will serve to elevate much-needed international attention to the grave health threat Alzheimer's and dementia pose to the global community today and in the years ahead.</p>
<p>"The World Health Organization lending its powerful voice and support to elevating awareness and understanding about Alzheimer's and dementia is very significant," said Harry Johns, Alzheimer's Association president and CEO. "It underscores the organization's recognition that Alzheimer's is a public health crisis requiring urgent global attention and action. These conditions will continue to be a major public health threat increasingly affecting the social and fiscal well-being of the global community until a concerted international effort is launched to combat it."</p>
<p>Already, the global cost of <strong>Alzheimer's and dementia consumes one percent of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</strong>, according to an ADI report. In the United States, the direct costs of Alzheimer's disease to American society will escalate from an estimated $200 billion this year to $1.1 trillion in 2050, largely due to baby boomers at increased risk for developing the disease as they age. In addition to the $200 billion dollars in care costs largely borne by government programs, Medicare and Medicaid, more than 15 million family members and friends provide unpaid care valued at $210 billion.</p>
<p>The new report urges countries to take a public health approach to addressing the Alzheimer's and dementia crisis while developing and strengthening policies that improve the quality of life for those living with Alzheimer's. Other goals included strong surveillance systems that allow for earlier detection of dementia and a stronger commitment to support scientific research that could one day lead to effective treatments that could stem the crisis.</p>
<p>The report discusses efforts in countries throughout the world to develop national plans, including highlighting the steps that the Alzheimer's Association took to mobilize advocates to urge passage and enactment of the National Alzheimer's Project Act. This legislation authorized the process currently underway in the United States to create this country's first national Alzheimer's plan. The Alzheimer's Association continues to work closely with U.S. leaders to shape a strong national plan, which will hopefully serve as a model for other countries. Fourteen countries, including France, Australia, Northern Ireland and Japan, currently have national Alzheimer's/dementia plans.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association has long recognized the international impact of Alzheimer's and other dementias and has made significant contributions globally toward the goal of a "world without Alzheimer's." As the world's leading Alzheimer's nonprofit, the Alzheimer's Association provides premier global forums for the greatest minds in Alzheimer's science to collaborate, connect across disciplines, address common challenges and share new discoveries. This is most notably demonstrated through the Alzheimer's Association International Conference, the largest gathering of Alzheimer's scientists and researchers annually. This year's conference will take place on July 14-19 in Vancouver and is expected to be attended by nearly 5,000 of the world's foremost Alzheimer's researchers.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association International Grants Program has been instrumental in advancing the scientific enterprise and shaping the ever evolving Alzheimer's landscape. The Association currently fund grants in 24 countries across the spectrum of Alzheimer's research from molecular biology to medical systems investigations and has awarded grants in excess of $292 million to more than 2,000 projects. In March, the Alzheimer's Association awarded its largest ever research grant -- nearly $4.2 million dollars over four years -- to the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network-Therapeutic Trials Unit (DIAN-TTU), based at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, to enable the program to move forward more quickly with innovative drug and biomarker trials in people with genetically-based, young-onset Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>"The Alzheimer's Association applauds the leadership of both the WHO and ADI in their efforts to elevate global attention to Alzheimer's and dementia. It signals an understanding that the knowledge, insights and resources of all nations must be leveraged to confront the daunting public health threat of Alzheimer's and dementia," said Johns. "The Association remains committed to working with these organizations, other international bodies and countries throughout the world to illuminate the human and economic toll of the disease until the vision of a world without Alzheimer's is realized."</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association </strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer care, support and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health. Our vision is a world without Alzheimer's. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.alz.org">http://www.alz.org</a>.</p>

<p>I am writing to you because of a request from USAgainstAlzheimer's, however, I'd like to make you aware of a book that has been written by Mary T. Newport, MD titled "Alzheimer's Disease, What if There Was A Cure?". She has done research on Coconut Oil which has shown significant change in her husband's Alzheimer's. In her book, she mentions that she attempted to attend an International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>They would not let her speak at the conference or allow her to pass out information on her research.</p>
<p>I find that inexcusable.</p>
<p>I lost my eldest sister in 2008 of the disease. It was one of the worst things I have ever been through after losing another older sister of ALS in 1996.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for signing NAPA and putting creation of our first National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease on the fast track.</p>
<p>I preface my comments with brief personal history.</p>
<p>I joined the national Alzheimer's Association early in 1980, co-founded both the Chicago and Detroit area chapters as I moved around the country, joined the National Board of Directors circa 1981 and rose to become a national Vice Chair and Chair of the Public Policy Committee. In 1984 I co-founded the Alzheimer's Disease International. I am also proud to have single-handedly suggested the idea of what became the federally funded program to states to create innovative Alzheimer's programs with special emphasis on serving minority populations. While Chair of the Public Policy Committee for the national Alzheimer's Association I was also successful in getting our board to hire full time professional public policy staff, create our annual spring "Public Policy Forum" to bring our citizen advocates to Washington DC to be educated and meet with their Congressional representatives. We also developed our first coalition efforts, e.g. with the then Long Term Care campaign, and the National Citizen's Coalition for Nursing Home Reform and helped support the nursing home reform bill that became law (OBRA 1987). We also held our first meetings with members of the CBO and Medicare/Medicaid administration officials to examine what information was needed to start developing a plan for how to meet the service and funding needs of people with dementia and their families. Later, in the 1990's while at Wellesley Centers for Women we looked at the scary prospects of the diminished numbers of people available (the baby bust era e.g. my children's birth cohort) to serve as care partners to those baby boomers who would be developing Alzheimer's and other brain/body diseases in 2040-2050. I then was asked to join Boston University's NIH funded Alzheimer's Disease Center and Department of Neurology to continue my clinical intervention studies; I currently have a small phase I trial of nutritional supplements underway, funded by the U.S. Alzheimer's Association.</p>
<p>My work over the past 30 plus years on behalf of Alzheimer's disease and now the broader field of brain health, is all inspired by my mother Frances Fink Emerson who developed Alzheimer's disease in her early 50's, lived 25 years and died in 1990 with no ability for willed action or movement of any sort, and a brain shrunk to half its original size. She received great care both at home -9 years-and in a nursing home -- 16 years- (and thus lived a long time despite her disabilities....no other health issues) in an era when we knew only a fraction of what we know now, thanks primarily to the work of the Alzheimer's Association, and research funding by NIH, Alzheimer's Association and WHO and other organizations and caring people around the world.</p>
<p>Today I am an Alzheimer's researcher connected with Boston University School of Medicine, actively serve on my local chapter board (Alz. Assn of Massachusetts and New Hampshire) as member of the Medical Scientific Advisory Committee, serve as a Board Member Emeritus of the national Alzheimer's Association (an inactive role), and actively attend and present scientific papers or posters at the Alzheimer's Disease International. I also have a small business that brings evidence-based knowledge about brain healthy lifestyles to organizations and individuals and families. My centerpiece is the evidence-based Memory Preservation Nutrition program, which I am proud to be bringing to 6 Boston area Assisted Living communities to help them improve the healthfulness of the foods their residents are served and eating. I am also a popular speaker, mainly on the topic of "Healthy Eating for a Healthy Brain and Body." And was featured as part of a Medical Journal TV news report on Boston Channel 5's Chronicle on March 20, 2012 and November 18, 2011.</p>
<p>I am excited by the breadth and content of the draft national Alzheimer's plan and want to make just a few pointed comments about moving forward. I am also attaching a couple documents that might be of interest in summarizing some of the recent work related to brain healthy lifestyles and reducing risk of Alzheimer's and other brain diseases. Here also is the direct link to the article I wrote for Sage Encyclopedia 'Alzheimer's Disease: Encyclopedia of Lifestyle Medicine and Health' See it at: <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=6kqwthjab.0.ptfnnijab.rplxpbdab.1&amp;ts=S0737&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sage-ereference.com%2Fview%2Flifestylemedicinehealth%2Fn18.xml%3Fp%3DemailAIi5pJ5vQDTvY%26d%3D%2Flifestylemedicinehealth%2Fn18.xml">http://www.sage-ereference.com/abstract/lifestylemedicinehealth/n18.xml</a></p>
<p>First, I am gratified that the draft plan calls for research and program development in the realm of healthy lifestyles, not just innovations in the realm of pharmaceutical and medical research, which of course is needed as we would all like to find the magic bullet(s) to prevent and cure this disease. But given the complexity of this mysterious disease and the delicacy and intricacy of the brain, such magic bullets may not exist. Alzheimer's may be as challenging to reduce risk as has been heart disease, stroke and diabetes, since they are all interrelated in ways we are still seeking to understand. Thus major public health initiatives based on evidence uncovered in the fields of nutrition, physical exercise, sleep, stress reduction and much more may be what works to help our society avoid the catastrophe of doubling, then quadrupling the numbers of Americans with Alzheimer's disease as the numbers of people who could serve as care partners and paid professional providers shrinks in relative numbers.</p>
<p>Second, as an active member of the international Alzheimer's research and practice communities I strongly urge that the HHS Administrative offices charged with designing, refining and implementing the plan be in close liaison with international efforts to combat Alzheimer's disease. People in the US are often very parochial and have no idea of the great strides being made elsewhere. Also, because our healthcare system is presently dominated by for-profit organizations and pharmaceutical companies, it is harder for us to see clearly public health priorities that might be the best use of resources. The international community faces graver restraints in resources but at the same time has the power of being able to find collective solutions that benefit the most people. For instance at our most recent conference of ADI, held in London, the closing debate was whether enough evidence now exists to mount a major public health initiative targeting improvements in healthy lifestyles for middle-aged adults....vs. an even broader public health initiative to improve the health and wellbeing, especially nutrition, of babies and pregnant women and through that route decrease the numbers of future adults with brain diseases. Meanwhile we are all gearing up to try to be ready to serve the millions of adults who already have Alzheimer's, who will develop it if we don't find a way to slow down the progression and delay the age of onset.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's Disease International's small but very competent staff (Mark Wortman is the CEO, based at the UK Alzheimer's offices in London) and with several groups of collaborative research groups who are keyed in on finding practical solutions to this world wide crisis we are all facing together.</p>
<p>One of these research groups is called "10-66" which receives both NIH and WHO funding to conduct important cross-cultural studies in the developing world to establish true and comparable prevalence/incidence rates of both Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, has conducted international clinical trials of caregiver interventions to determine usefulness and costs in a variety of different countries and financial settings, and is now looking at some broader public policy and public health issues. Their annual reports can be found on the ADI website:</p>
<p>In addition, there is a collaborative effort of several country based large research projects examining whether certain lifestyle interventions could help reduce the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, or delay the age of initial symptoms. Each initiative has different founding sources and different specific research objectives and methods, but by combining and collaborating they hope to increase the robustness of their findings. One of the three studies is taking place in Finland, led by Miia Kivipelto with major funding from Finland's Health Department, and some additional funding from the U.S. Alzheimer's Association and perhaps other sources as well. I touch on that study in one of the two papers I have attached to this email.</p>
<p>Another perspective that was discussed at this last London meeting was, how best to proceed in planning CARE in the depressing scenario that we can't prevent most of the cases of Alzheimer's. What public policy is best. One that is disease specific, or that is based on disabilities, across diseases and health conditions. This was very interesting to me arising among a group of people who has fought hard for over 25 years to get their home countries to give proper recognition to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and to develop national plans. But once one has raised awareness, achieved sufficient specific research dollars and developed specific care programs, then one is freer to look at the broader public policy perspectives and see what is the best use of resources for a country, and what is most likely to be politicall feasible.</p>
<p>As you could gather from my resume, I stand ready to volunteer my time and attention to helping you in your efforts should you see a way I could be helpful.</p>
<p>In the meantime I applaud all the work you are doing and say THANK YOU. You all are fulfilling a dream I've held since the 1980's of a true national effort to combat Alzheimer's disease, both through research, public health and programmatic efforts at the local, state and federal levels.</p>

<p><strong>Prevalence </strong></p>
<p><em>The World Alzheimer Report 2010: The Global Economic Impact of Dementia</em>, published by <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Disease International, reported that around 0.5% of the world's total population live with dementia, predominantly AD, and that the total estimated worldwide costs of dementia were US$604 billion in 2010, equivalent to around 1% of the world's gross domestic product. The <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association reports that there are nearly 15 million caregivers for <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> and dementia patients in the United States. AD is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the one growing most rapidly (by 50% from 2000 to 2007). The growth rate of this epidemic is expected to further accelerate with the aging of the baby boomer generation, increasing personal costs to families, which provide the bulk of care, and rapidly escalating economic costs from $172 billion today to more than $1 trillion by 2050. The U.S. National <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Project Act was enacted into law in January 2011 to create a coordinated national strategy to address this national public health emergency with widespread social and economic consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of AD and Diagnostic Criteria </strong></p>
<p>AD is the most common form of dementia, causing multiple impairments in thinking and cognition, including planning and organization (executive function), attention, short-term episodic memory (especially the recording of events and experiences), and sometimes visual-spatial function. The pathological hallmarks of AD are extracellular plaques composed of a protein called beta-amyloid (also called "A-beta") and the intracellular accumulations of neurofibrillary tangles, the insoluble paired helical filaments of an abnormally phosphorylated tau protein, and a cytoskeletal protein critical to the brain cell structure. Studies suggest that the soluble forms of A-beta, not the more visible plaques, are the toxic form. The normal function of A-beta is to kill microbes, as part of the innate immune system. It is the large amount of A-beta present in AD that is abnormal. Moreover, plaques and tangles appear to be late-stage developments and may or may not reflect the initiating biological sequelae, which may include injury, inflammation, disruptions of cell signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and disruptions in glucose and/or lipid metabolic processes.</p>
<p><strong>New Criteria for Diagnosing and Redefining AD </strong></p>
<p>National Institutes of Health/<strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association working groups in 2010-2011 updated the criteria for diagnosing <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia, added criteria for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to underlying <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology, and set the framework for identifying and testing biomarkers that in the near future could be used to diagnose "preclinical AD." Thus, the definition of AD has expanded beyond dementia and cognitive impairment to include a presymptomatic stage of the disease.</p>
<p>Biomarkers may improve the accuracy of diagnoses of both <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia and MCI due to <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology during life and serve as clinical trial end points. Prominent among the new biomarkers are neuroimaging (e.g., of A-beta levels, glucose processing, and the size and shape of brain structures) and measuring the presence of A-beta and tau in cerebrospinal fluid. These criteria will replace those established in 1984 as the "NINCDS-ADRDA" criteria. These criteria, developed by the National Institute of Neurological Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA), were universally adopted and have been in use, without modification, for more than 25 years. One of the challenges of prevention and treatment trials, both with preclinical AD and in MCI, is the inadequacy of cognitive tests to catch early changes reliably. The emergence of other outcome markers, namely brain imaging, and other biomarkers, is revolutionizing the field.</p>
<p>Scientists participating in the work groups formulating the new guidelines note that the updates were urgently needed for establishing the next generation of clinical trials for possible pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions. In medical practice, the proposed changes represent refinements of existing criteria for the diagnosis of <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia. The guidelines suggest, for example, that physicians recognize that complaints of loss of memory may not always be the first or most prominent presenting symptom. A decline in other aspects of cognition (e.g., word finding, vision/spatial issues, and impaired reasoning, judgment, and problem solving) may be the first presenting or the most prominent symptoms. Many research scientists in the field are concerned that current biomarker criteria give too much emphasis to A-beta and tau (especially A-beta) and too little to the role that oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular pathology, white matter, and other lesions or injuries may play in cognitive decline, in clinical symptoms of dementia, and in the development of abnormal levels of A-beta and tau. Ignoring a large body of evidence could hinder identifying proper treatments and preventive interventions, particularly lifestyle interventions. It is also important to guard against reductionist AD theories because what is now called "<strong>Alzheimer's</strong> disease" may be one or more multifactorial disorders and thus may require "multitherapies."</p>
<p>The evolving understanding of AD includes the recognition that individuals with a diagnoses of AD and MCI can still learn new information and acquire new habits, using a variety of preserved functions such as other forms of memory (e.g., visual, emotional, procedural). In addition, it is important to realize that while people with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> may have lost many brain cells and synapses, they still retain many healthy brain cells, so it is important to work with them to maintain brain health in the hope of slowing progression, maintaining positive emotion, and improving quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Causes or Etiology of AD as Related to Lifestyle </strong></p>
<p>The exact causes and etiology of AD are still not fully known. As of 2011, there are still no methods of perfect diagnosis during life or ways to cure or completely prevent AD. Age remains the biggest risk factor for AD, with (lower) education levels the only other consistent risk factor across all ethnic groups. However, much has been learned in the past 30 years, lifestyles are at the heart of this new knowledge.</p>
<p>Research now recognizes AD as a complex chronic disease with many environmental and genetic factors, whose pathology may begin to accumulate 10 to 30 or more years before the appearance of noticeable clinical symptoms. With such a long prodromal stage, preventive interventions are needed that can be safely used for decades. While a few families have an autosomnal dominant form of AD, most individuals have what is called the "sporadic" form, without clear genetic patterns. The <em>APOE4</em> type of allele confers a dose-related risk for persons of European origin but not typically for those of African origin. While other risk-conferring genes have been identified, most scientists have found that environmental factors are probably at least as important as genetic ones. Recognition of the importance of lifestyle flows directly from the multiple studies that have shown that brain and cognitive health is dramatically affected by the rest of the body, especially the cardiovascular, glucose metabolism, and cell energy systems.</p>
<p>Observational and prospective studies have confirmed this logical relationship and spawned numerous animal studies to explore the relationships between particular lifestyle factors, cognition, and the mechanisms of action. For instance, physical exercise as well as many nutrients and food substances with anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory properties have proven to lower the amount of A-beta in animal models and also lower inflammation. Some nutrients also improve neuronal cell signaling, lipid metabolism, and glucose metabolism and/or decrease oxidative stress.</p>
<p>This sort of evidence, together with numerous observational studies with a variety of human populations in different countries, has established that appropriate nutrition and physical activity are good candidates for helping reduce the risk of dementia, cognitive decline, and AD in humans. In 2010, gold-standard randomized clinical trials for integrated evidence-based nutrition programs had not yet been undertaken, and those for various forms of exercise had just begun. These kinds of lifestyle interventions are very difficult to get funded and then carry out, so scientists cannot yet say with certainty that the various lifestyles indicated by an array of other studies will be sufficient to delay the onset of cognitive symptoms or slow progression. However, scientists have already proven with certainty the link between nutrition, physical exercise, and certain other lifestyle factors to prevent, slow, or even reverse other related chronic diseases such as stroke, other cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and insulin resistance. Therefore, most researchers and clinicians are ready to recommend lifestyle approaches as these offer probable additional benefits to cognitive health. Lifestyle interventions are also of keen interest since, given the multiple decades of presymptomatic development of AD-related pathology, preventive interventions need to be safe and tolerable.</p>
<p>A growing body of research suggests that a variety of nutritional factors, social engagement, mental stimulation, physical exercise, complex activities incorporating multiple domains, and management of stress and depression all help preserve brain health. Managing both emotional and physical stress is important because heightened cortisol levels have been connected to cognitive decline as well as to faster rates of decline in persons with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia. Moreover, research reports an association between cortisol levels, hippocampal shrinkage, and insulin resistance. Adequate sleep is also essential for a healthy brain, neuroplasticity, and memory. Music, art, acupuncture, T'ai Chi, meditation, and certain other spiritual practices, as well as having a meaning and purpose in life, also appear to enhance brain health. Many of these lifestyle factors are related to neuronal plasticity and the generation of new brain cells as well as prevention of deterioration of existing brain cells.</p>
<p>Research indicates some common factors for both cognitive and emotional health. Intervention studies indicate the independent and synergistic efficacy of nutrition, cognitive rehabilitation, physical exercise, and various alternative medicine practices in improving cognition, mood, and quality of life of persons who already live with AD or other memory or brain disorders. The challenge is in actually making behavioral changes to adopt these protective lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>Why Lifestyle Factors Are Important to Brain Health </strong></p>
<p>Epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of AD doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 (with 13% of individuals over the age of 65 having AD and about 40% over 85 years having AD). If lifestyle interventions can delay the onset of AD by 5 years, the prevalence of the disease would be halved, along with all the attendant human and financial costs.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that healthy brain tissue is better able to withstand the ravages of age, genetic vulnerabilities, environmental stresses, accidents, toxins, and disease. Further, healthy lifestyles help enhance and strengthen neurons, dendrites, and other body and brain cells.</p>
<p>Many studies, including gold-standard clinical trials in the case of many other chronic diseases, have suggested that a healthy lifestyle, especially with regard to nutrition and exercise, may help prevent and treat most human chronic diseases. Thus, healthy lifestyles are helpful to both the person with dementia and his or her care partners, who are at extra risk of depression and illness because of caregiving.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular health and normal glucose metabolism contribute to brain health, while the rise in obesity and other chronic illnesses has a direct negative impact on brain health. Dozens of studies have established that each vascular risk factor adds to the risk for AD and severity of dementia.</p>
<p>Diabetes and prediabetes increase the risk of cognitive decline, MCI and dementia, and, according to some scientists, AD in particular. Studies using imaging techniques in adults and teenagers show that diabetes, prediabetes, or abnormally high insulin resistance as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) shrinks the hippocampus, the major site for short-term memory and spatial memory, encoding of new information and experiences, as well as some aspects of emotional function. These findings should raise serious public health concerns because study results show that the hippocampi are already shrinking in obese teenagers with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as in middle-aged nondiabetic adults with insulin resistance. Cognitive impairments in nondiabetic adults were found to be associated with the degree of insulin resistance. Related memory impairments and related white-matter changes were observed in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels were reduced in adults with insulin resistance.</p>
<p>Inflammation is believed to play a key role in the etiology of AD and has been associated with an increased risk of AD. Existing inflammation, as well as inflammatory events such as infections, surgery, or heart attacks, hastens progression in people with AD. Oxidative stress also plays a key role in AD etiology, including increasing inflammation and oxidation of brain lipids. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction is part of AD etiology and relates to the energy systems within the brain cells.</p>
<p>In summary, whatever hurts the heart and blood vessels harms the brain. Problems with glucose metabolism and insulin levels also threaten the brain. The organ and disease silos are disintegrating, with increasingly similar clinical recommendations for better nutrition and exercise and for managing stress to treat or prevent a wide range of chronic diseases affecting nearly every organ in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Lifestyle Approaches for Cognitive Health </strong></p>
<p>Many leaders in the field of brain health believe that the evidence is already sufficient to suggest that regardless of personal risk factors, and with or without pharmacologic intervention, a healthful lifestyle is likely to reduce risk, delay onset, and slow the progression of AD and vascular dementia. Some of these researchers and clinicians conclude that the evidence suggests that it is the combination of vascular lesions (e.g., microstrokes or white-matter lesions) with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology that together result in symptoms of MCI and dementia. If these hypotheses are correct, then they offer another argument in favor of practicing healthy lifestyles to reduce cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Nutrition, physical exercise, and other lifestyle interventions work on multiple pathways to improve overall health in multiple organs with minimal or no side effects, even over many decades, which is important since scientists now believe that the pathology of AD--that is, the development of excess A-beta and abnormal phosphorylated tau--begins several decades before the appearance of cognitive symptoms.</p>
<p>Multiple lifestyle factors can have synergistic or additive effects. One of the most interesting trials involved the 2-year study of aged beagle dogs conducted by Carl Cotman's group at the University of California, Irvine, which showed that an enriched diet alone improved performance on a cognitive task from 25% in the control group to 67% of the experimental animals. A third group, with increased physical activity and social play, improved performance to 80%, while combining enriched diet and exercise-play interventions resulted in 100% of a fourth group of dogs being able to perform the difficult learning task.</p>
<p>Given the well-established connection between cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and diabetes and cognitive function and cognitive decline, and the evidence-based certainty that good nutrition, physical activity, and certain other lifestyle changes help treat or prevent these diseases, more and more people in the AD field have concluded that it is good clinical practice to recommend these healthy lifestyles to persons concerned about their brain health or who already have a diagnosis of MCI or dementia, including AD.</p>
<p><strong>Multidomain Lifestyle Study Under Way in Finland </strong></p>
<p>Many people in the field agree that the preventive intervention most likely to be effective will be multifaceted to be potent enough to delay the onset of AD or slow it down. There is one such multicenter randomized clinical trial under way in Finland, called the <strong>Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability</strong> (FINGER) Trial, under the leadership of Miia Kivipelto and funded by the Finnish government, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the national <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01041989). Persons between 60 and 77 years of age who are determined to be at increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia are randomized to a control group (standard health counseling at baseline) or to a preventive intervention for 2 years. The latter receive multidisciplinary treatment that includes nutritional guidance, physical exercise, cognitive training and social activity, and intensive monitoring and management of metabolic (e.g., diabetes) and vascular risk factors. Importantly, each intervention includes a coach to guide and encourage the implementation of each lifestyle change. In addition to cognitive end points, a variety of potential biomarkers are monitored in relationship to any cognitive change, including biochemical markers of inflammation or oxidation, hormones controlling blood sugars and fats, as well as brain imaging.</p>
<p>Dr. Kivipelto's study reflects the combined wisdom of many leaders in the field, including the International Academy of Nutrition and Aging. The FINGER study builds on more than a decade of research, suggesting the importance of each domain of this combined program. The collective findings of some of these studies are summarized in the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Selected Findings of Lifestyle Studies </strong></p>
<p>Observational studies have established that each of the following lifestyle behaviors may be independently related to a lower risk of dementia: (a) nutrition, (b) physical fitness, (c) social activities and social engagement, (d) organization memberships, (e) productive (meaningful) activities, (f) mental activities (e.g., reading, word spelling/recognition, numbers, and other games), and (g) management of stress. Several researchers, using meta-analyses, have concluded that the most potent activities are complex activities that involve multiple domains, especially activities that include physical activity and social interaction as well as cognitive challenge, such as dancing and golf. Examples of activities involving 2 domains are board or card games, knitting, gardening, T'ai Chi, chi gong or yoga, and doing exercise in a group. Complex and novel activities such as learning a new language, especially sign language, traveling to new places, and playing a musical instrument, especially a new one, are also particularly recommended.</p>
<p>A 2010 Institute of Medicine Consensus conference and a Cochrane review of certain lifestyle interventions for preserving cognitive health concluded that there was insufficient evidence on which to base clinical recommendations. The Cochrane reviews and the Institute of Medicine, however, used very strict criteria for acceptable clinical trials, and for physical exercise, they reviewed only a few clinical trials of very small size or pilot in nature, which were underpowered. Both panels tended to be overly conservative and looking backward rather than forward in a brand new research field where rigorous clinical trials were just beginning to be designed, funded, and reviewed and where, logically, these interventions might have their biggest impact in the preclinical or MCI stage of AD, where outcome measures are still under development. Most reviews also do not integrate the combined weight of observational studies with clinical trials in animal models of AD, which are the first phase of testing some of the factors observed in human longitudinal studies and of researching mechanisms of action. Nutritional trials, especially those with integrated complex nutritional programs, are difficult to design and gain adherence to, and physical exercise programs to some extent suffer the same challenges. Published randomized controlled trials in the nutrition field as of 2011 were limited to single substances or small groups of vitamins.</p>
<p>Nonetheless the body of evidence is growing rapidly.</p>
<p><em><strong>Nutrition </strong></em></p>
<p>One well-structured prospective study published in 2010 found that persons with the highest levels of all 8 forms of vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols) had half the risk of AD, whereas previous studies and intervention trials, less knowledgeable about the necessity of all forms of vitamin E in the brain and body, had looked at only <em>a</em>-tocopherol. This Karolinska Institutet (Sweden) study concluded that it was the combination of the 8 vitamin E forms that was important to brain health.</p>
<p>Various nutritional studies using animal models have shown the power of various single nutrients to lower A-beta levels, reduce oxidative stress, and improve cognitive function. Clinical trials of persons with MCI or AD have been few in number and show mixed results but some limited promise. A Swedish clinical trial of fish oil capsules using a daily dose of 1.7 mg of docosahexaenoic acid and 0.6 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (2 long-chain omega-3 fatty acids abundant in the human brain) reported preliminary results suggesting a slowing of cognitive decline in persons with early-stage AD. A larger trial of just algae-derived docosahexaenoic acid had no effect across all AD patients. One study of 3 B vitamins (B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, and folate) had no effect in persons with AD, but another using lower doses of the same 3 B vitamins improved cognition in people with MCI, but only in those with high homocysteine levels. These results suggest that while combination dietary programs may produce stronger effects on cognition than current pharmacological treatments for AD, single nutrients may be insufficient, and nutritional interventions may have more effect in MCI and very early-stage AD. Continued clinical research is needed.</p>
<p>Of greater interest for clinical study is combining multiple nutrients since the most recent observational studies have suggested that it is combinations of whole foods, such as in the Mediterranean or DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets, that really make a difference. A 2006 integrative review presents evidence of how various nutrients appear to work on the multiple different pathways leading to AD and/or dementia, including inflammation, oxidative stress, glucose or insulin abnormalities, levels of A-beta and tau, cell signaling, and mitochondrial dysfunction. A recent animal study showed that a combination of whole foods-based nutrients, including vegetable, fruit, and herb and spice nutrients combined with fish oil, appears to restore mitochondrial dysfunction in triply transgenic AD mice, and a clinical trial is now under way in healthy older adults. A series of pilot studies with both mice and humans conducted by Thomas Shea and colleagues have shown preliminary success in improving short-term memory and attention in both cognitively normal adults and patients with AD, with a novel combination of vitamins and nutrients: namely, vitamin E, folic acid, vitamin B12, <em>N</em>-acetyl-l-cysteine, acetyl-l-carnitine hydrochloride, and <em>S</em>-adenosylmethionine. These preliminary studies suggest an important focus for continued studies in nutrition and brain health.</p>
<p><em><strong>Physical Activity </strong></em></p>
<p>Most of the meta-analyses of physical activity that had less strict criteria for study inclusion than the Cochrane reviews reported consistently positive results, backing up the observational studies that had linked physical activity to reduced incidence of AD and slower rates of conversion from MCI to AD dementia. An array of intervention studies in healthy older adults, people with MCI, and people with early AD, all found evidence of decrease in the rates of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Animal studies have established that physical activity increases cognitive function and identified at least 2 newer mechanisms of action beyond the known cardiovascular mechanisms: (1) decrease in levels of A-beta in the brain and (2) increased amount and rates of neurogenesis, especially in the hippocampus. Human studies have established that people who exercise more have higher levels of hippocampal BDNF, a brain chemical related to neurogenesis. Increased serum BDNF levels have been correlated with larger hippocampi and better memory performance.</p>
<p>Kirk I. Erickson's randomized controlled study using magnetic resonance imaging as an outcome measure established that aerobic exercise (specifically 1 year of walking 3 times a week for 40 minutes) can increase the size of critical brain structures. Consistent with the expected 1% to 2% annual hippocampal loss in dementia-free seniors, the control group (which spent an equal amount of time stretching) lost about 1.4% volume in this brain region by the end of the 12-month trial. In contrast, the hippocampi of the walkers grew by roughly 2%. In addition, researchers found that greater elevations in serum BDNF were linked to greater gains in hippocampal volume.</p>
<p>The benefit of walking exercise seemed specific to the anterior part of the hippocampus (including the dentate gyrus). Similar effects did not appear in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, or posterior hippocampus. The dentate gyrus is the most metabolically active part of our brain and is involved in spatial memory, short-term memory, and new learning. Neurogenesis is most prominent in this part of the adult brain; many surmise that it is so because creation of new brain cells and dendritic connections is essential to the production of new memories.</p>
<p><em><strong>Meditation and Spiritual Practices </strong></em></p>
<p>Stress management and spiritual practices may also contribute to brain health. For example, a recent study using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in live human participants reported that persons participating in an 8-week mindfulness meditation program experienced measurable increases in the hippocampus regions associated with memory, sense of self, and empathy while reducing areas of the amygdala associated with stress. Numerous studies demonstrate that other spiritual practices such as forgiveness improve emotional and mental health. By relieving stress and depression and decreasing cortisol levels, such practices may also improve cognitive health.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cognitive Training, Cognitive Rehabilitation, and Cognitive-Kinetic Interventions </strong></em></p>
<p>With regard to cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation strategies to improve and preserve cognition, the evidence is particularly strong. Observational studies suggested that "use it or lose it" applies to keeping one's mind active. The groundbreaking ACTIVE randomized clinical trial study demonstrated that even short-term cognitive skills practice interventions had persistent effects in the healthy elderly. A number of later studies suggest that the most effective interventions combine modalities--for example, cognitive training with physical exercise and support groups.</p>
<p><em><strong>Multifaceted Relationship Between Physical Activity and Cognition </strong></em></p>
<p>In population and clinical studies, physical activity and exercise have been shown to have a positive effect on cognitive function in people of all ages. Recent studies have found that physical exercise stimulates a positive increase in executive control processes, including planning, scheduling, working memory, inhibitory processes, and multitasking. The impact of physical activity on cognitive abilities also continues through the entire lifespan. Physical exercise, for example, has been found to be a key facilitator in neurogenesis, particularly in the hippocampus as well as in other areas of the brain. In general, the rate of neurogenesis and other cognitive benefits is related to the intensity, novelty, and dose of physical activity and exercise. Both endurance (aerobic) and strength (resistance training) exercise benefit both cognitively intact and cognitively impaired individuals.</p>
<p>With regard to improvement in individuals with MCI and AD, substantial clinical trial evidence suggests that various cognitive rehabilitation and training strategies may help restore lost function and slow progression of cognitive decline. Different strategies appear to have more or less potent effects in only one area or in multiple areas. For example, a cognitive training strategy targeting episodic memory benefited only episodic memory. A more holistic strategy that combined physical movements based on kinetic/cognitive theory with cognitive training benefitted areas of attention, spatial abilities, language, memory executive functions, and daily functions. Arkin's pioneering study, initially published in 1999, found a combination of simultaneous physical exercise and conversation, and language practice and word games, interspersed with volunteer activity, particularly effective.</p>
<p><strong>Barriers to Adopting Lifestyle Initiatives </strong></p>
<p>There are several barriers to adopting lifestyle changes, including cultural and psychological barriers. Cultural challenges include the overdependence of the American health care system, and therefore of most individuals, on pharmaceuticals and surgery, which have limited preventive roles for many chronic diseases or could be more potent if combined with lifestyle changes. Perhaps the biggest challenge for implementing these interventions as standard clinical practice is financial. Generally, lifestyle interventions are not covered by most current health insurance plans, although the concept of health promotion and prevention of illness is starting to develop. For instance, because research has established that having a "coach" or personal trainer helps individuals make lasting lifestyle changes, some private insurers will supply a free "health coach" even if the actual interventions are not reimbursed.</p>
<p>To promote brain health, prescribed cognitive training and physical activity may be the modalities most likely to be recognized with some incentives. Nutrition for brain health promotion is not currently covered, although individuals with diagnoses may find some limited coverage for counseling with licensed nutritionists. For families working together to provide a healthier home environment for both a patient with brain disease and his or her care partners, one possible source of funding is the National Family Caregiver Support program, which can be accessed online at <a href="http://www.aoa.gov/prof/aoaprog/caregiver/caregiver.asp">http://www.aoa.gov/prof/aoaprog/caregiver/caregiver.asp</a>. Individuals who have long-term care policies also may be able to gain coverage for these services. The future major solutions lie in the realm of public health, public education, public policy, and research envisioned with the 2011 passage of the National <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Project Act.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>4.2.0. Memory and Cognitive Impact of Foods</strong></p>
<p>Research is proceeding rapidly on the connection between diet, including individual nutrients, on memory and other aspects of our thinking.</p>
<p>Most of the research to date has examined how foods relate to memory and cognition. This research has consisted of either animal studies of specific foods or nutrients, or of epidemiological studies of large groups of people (which can show an association, but not prove a direct cause). These studies have explored the relationship between aspects of what we eat and the likelihood or risk of developing general cognitive problems, mild cognitive impairment (including of the amnestic type i.e. involving memory problems), any kind of dementia (i.e. problems in thinking in multiple areas serious enough to cause problems in daily life or work) or specific diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The mechanisms of action (for how specific foods might help or hurt the brain) identified to date appear to vary, and in the case of many whole foods, multiple actions could be working simultaneously (See for example, Emerson Lombardo NB et al. 2006, Sun AY et al 2008. Tian J et al 2010, Howes and Perry 2011, Williams RJ, 2011). Some ways specific foods could enhance brain health include increasing the availability of the memory neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain (apple juice, sage, Melissa, saffron) (e.g. by directly increasing production, slowing its metabolic breakdown, similar to the action of the cholinesterase inhibitors currently on the market), anti-oxidant and/or anti-inflammatory action, regulating amount of various forms of Abeta peptides, slowing or preventing oligomerization or fibrilization of the Abeta molecule (Wang 2008, Frydman-Marom, A.,2011), protecting omega-3 fatty acids in brain cell membranes or fatty acids, regulating blood sugar and insulin, and/or cholesterol, estrogenic effects that can be neuro-protective, promoting creation of new brain cells or connective parts, or slowing their destruction, improving neuronal signaling and synapse activity, restoring mitochondrial function (related to energy) of brain cells, and retarding tau pathology (the "other" problem protein in AD) (Green 2007) . This list is only partial!</p>
<p>The number of human clinical trials is still small but growing.</p>
<p>The body of evidence suggests a clear connection between foods, overall diet and our brain health, including memory and other cognitive skills such as attention and executive function (ability to organize and plan), and is growing each year.</p>
<p>This website and our brain healthy newsletters will keep you informed of this growing body of evidence.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<p>Several studies using various mouse models of Alzheimer's disease demonstrated the positive effects of a wide variety of food substances chosen for their believed health benefits such as strong anti-oxidant properties. Each food type may be comprised of thousands of nutrients. Foods tested that improved cognitive behaviors and/or lowered Abeta levels in TG mice include: apple juice, blueberries, spinach, strawberries, green tea, melatonin, DHA, plum juice, Concord grape juice, resveratrol, grape seed extract and others (Chan A et al, 2006, Rogers EJ et al.2004, Joseph JA. Et al. 1999, 2009, Lee JW, et al 2009, Mandel SA et al. 2011, Calon, F et al, 2004 and Green et al, 2007, Shukitt-Hale B et al, 2009, Shukitt-Hale B et al 2006, Lagouge, M., et al, 2006, Wang et al., 2008). Both almonds and walnuts helped Alzheimer transgenic mice perform better in cognitive tests and lowered levels of A-beta (Chauhan N et al. 2004, Muthaiyah B, et al, 2011 - no published citation for almonds- see continued work by Neelima Chauhan, PhD, of the University of Illinois-Chicago, as reported in 2005 by Society for Neuroscience. <a href="http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=news_111405">http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=news_111405</a>). An unrelated Indian study in aged rats reported almond paste reversed scopolamine-induced amnesia, reduced cholinesterase activity in the brain, and also significantly reduced cholesterol and triglycerides in these aged rats (Kulkarni KS, et al. 2010).</p>
<p>Epidemiological studies have also identified a long list of brain healthy foods. More recently, innovative studies have begun to identify GROUPS of foods that appear to reduce risk of cognitive decline and onset of dementia, MCI or Alzheimer's disease, such as foods typical of the Mediterranean diet (Féart, C et al 2009, Gu Y, et al 2009, Scarmeas N et al., 2006, 2009a, 2009b, or the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet (LINK <a href="http://dashdiet.org/dash_diet_book.asp?google&amp;gclid=CMDj8qOMsq0CFUTc4Aodvz0FlQ">http://dashdiet.org/dash_diet_book.asp?google&amp;gclid=CMDj8qOMsq0CFUTc4Aodvz0FlQ</a> ) (see unpublished study led by Heidi Wengreen, RD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Nutrition at Utah State University).</p>
<p>Combination supplement studies are also gaining interest. Professor Thomas Shea, Ph.D., Director of the Cellular Neurobiology and Neurodegeneration Research Centerat U Mass Lowell (<a href="http://www.uml.edu/research_labs/Cellular_Neurobiology/Staff.html">http://www.uml.edu/research_labs/Cellular_Neurobiology/Staff.html</a> ) is examining, first in mice and now in humans with and without memory impairments, a combination of certain B vitamins, amino acids and anti-oxidants, with some encouraging results. Another study led by Jon Valla in Arizona uses a combination of fruit and vegetable powers, anti-inflammatory spices and herbs, and fish oil, yielding some positive results in TG mice. A similar combination with the addition of vitamin D is currently undergoing a pilot Phase I clinical trial with healthy older adults at Boston University. Also, Nutricia, a subsidiary of the French Danone Company, is pursuing human clinical trials in both Europe and the US, of Souvenaid® (<a href="http://souvenaid.com/">http://souvenaid.com/</a>) a combination of neuron building substrates identified (and patented) by Dr. Richard Wurtman at MIT, together with anti-oxidant isolated vitamins (Kamphuis and Scheltens, 2010), featured at a company sponsored symposium at MIT (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fighting-alzheimers.html">http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fighting-alzheimers.html</a>). The consumer needs to be aware of the differences between medical foods such as Souvenaid, and nutritional supplements such as "Great Mind, as the rules of evidence and FDA regulations are different. The Alzheimer's Forum engaged in an excellent discussion of this topic in 2009, <a href="http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2258">http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2258</a></p>
<p>A Swedish placebo-controlled clinical trial using fish oil containing both DHA and EPA reported that fish oil appeared to slow cognitive decline only in a few persons with early stage Alzheimer's disease. In persons with mid stage disease the main positive effect was to reverse weight loss, which can be a serious problem in some people (Freund-Levi Y. et al, 2006). A larger, more recent clinical trial of just DHA derived from algae, in persons with AD, reported no significant effect on cognition; however the trial neglected to include EPA, the more highly anti-inflammatory long chain Omega 3 which, in nature, usually occurs in conjunction with DHA and which humans typically consume (and synthesize) along with DHA. Since other AD research has established that AD has an inflammatory aspect to its etiology, we believe that EPA may prove to be as important as DHA in its treatment and prevention. Also, psychiatric and attention-deficit disorders research has established that EPA rather than DHA appears to be the active long chain Omega 3 in achieving the desired treatment effect. See for example Jazayeri S, 2008 (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18247193">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18247193</a> ) and work by Andew Stoll, MD (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Omega-3-Connection-Groundbreaking-Anti-depression-Program/dp/0684871386">http://www.amazon.com/Omega-3-Connection-Groundbreaking-Anti-depression-Program/dp/0684871386</a>) and Ned Hollowell, MD. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delivered-Distraction-Getting-Attention-Disorder/dp/034544230X">http://www.amazon.com/Delivered-Distraction-Getting-Attention-Disorder/dp/034544230X</a>).</p>
<p>Cinnamon helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar, is a potent anti-oxidant (see ORAC chart...link) and is anti-inflammatory, and thus through these 4 pathways is thought to be positive for brain health. A January 2011 publication of an animal study (transgenic mice and flies) by a group of Israeli scientists suggests that cinnamon may also have a positive direct brain effect - cinnamon helps retard the development of Alzheimer's pathology by preventing the oligomerization ("clumping") of single Abeta molecules, leading to toxic forms that kill brain cells (Frydman-Marom A). To learn more, see our newsletter on the topic (Link to Cinnamon newsletter CHANGE THIS TO NEW WEBSITE POSITION <a href="http://healthcareinsights.net/home/newsletter-2011/august-2011-newsletter/">http://healthcareinsights.net/home/newsletter-2011/august-2011-newsletter/</a>). Grape seed extract also prevents or slows oligomerization and fibrilization.</p>
<p>A proof of concept RCT in 12 older adults with MCI found significant improvements in one test of memory (verbal learning) in the 6 randomized to drinking Concord Grape Juice for 12 weeks (Krikorian R et al 2010).</p>
<p>Three small pilot randomized controlled studies of three different spices/herbs in Alzheimer's patients, all led by the same medical researcher in Iran, all published in reputable peer-reviewed journals, suggested positive effects in slowing cognitive decline compared to placebo (sage and lemon balm, also known as melissa) or slowing at same rate as a current prescription drug, without the usual gastro-intestinal side effects (saffron). (See Akhondzadeh, S. et al. 2003a, 2003b, 2010)</p>
<p>Diets high in sugar and/or saturated fats appear to be harmful for the brain. A preclinical study in AD transgenic mice demonstrated that simply spiking water with 10% sugar (while offering same healthy mouse chow to two groups of identical, randomized mice) resulted in speedier cognitive decline of the mice drinking the sugared water, higher levels of Abeta in the brain, and abnormal cholesterol levels. Cao D et al. 2007, Suzanne Craft group's proof of concept randomized clinical trial in 50 older adults for just 1 month demonstrated that a high glycemic index, high saturated/high fat diet, compared to a low glycemic, low saturated fat/low fat diet, resulted in significantly worse cognitive performance (using a visual memory test), and undesirable changes in levels of Abeta in cerebral spinal fluid. (Bayer-Carter JL et al. 2011).</p>

Founded in 1980, the Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.</p>
<p>Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and 15.2 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top 10 in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Currently, there are no survivors. Alzheimer's kills more Americans than diabetes, and more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. Individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias are high consumers of hospital, nursing home, and long-term care services. Average per person Medicare costs for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias are nearly three times higher and Medicaid spending is 19 times higher than for those without these conditions. Care for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias is estimated to cost Medicare and Medicaid $140 billion this year alone. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment. Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, Alzheimer's impact on our country will grow year by year. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the escalating cost of care will reach $1.1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). Costs to Medicare and Medicaid are estimated to increase nearly 500 percent over this period.</p>
<p>However, this does not need to be our future. If the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure through the National Alzheimer's Plan, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years (similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease) would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050.<sup>2</sup> Similarly, profound advances can be achieved through improvements to Alzheimer's care quality and effectiveness and through improved supports for individuals with Alzheimer's and their families. The challenge and the potential promise of the National Alzheimer's Plan is our opportunity to change the trajectory of this heartbreaking disease.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association is pleased the important strengths contained within the Draft Framework were preserved in this initial draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan. As was the case with the Framework, this first draft is comprehensive in scope, addressing many of the issues that are critically important to the Alzheimer's community. We do see key opportunities to further strengthen this draft plan prior to its next iteration. The Association's comments address specific areas to fortify; for instance, palliative care and transportation issues, which are particularly important for the one in seven Americans with Alzheimer's who live alone.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>In addition to the specific comments that follow, the Alzheimer's Association would like to emphasize several broader themes.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong>:<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly urges that the National Alzheimer's Plan build on the momentum of the Administration's recent, commendable action on Alzheimer's research funding by indicating in the plan the full scale and scope of research funding required to achieve the Administration's goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. To this end, we believe recent work by leading Alzheimer's researchers to be available in April 2012 will provide a very solid foundation for these projections.<sup>4</sup> As we previously noted in our comments submitted for the Draft Framework, we believe that the firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones are needed, the Department is to be commended for including a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently-needed treatment advances.</p>
<p><strong>Economic burden</strong>:<br />
					The bipartisan, unanimously passed National Alzheimer's Project Act calls for the identification of priority actions to reduce the economic impact of Alzheimer's disease on the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as on American families, while improving health outcomes. In addition to the estimated $140 billion in Medicare and Medicaid costs this year, families caring for people with this heartbreaking disease will still incur high out-of-pocket costs for care -- an estimated $33.8 billion in 2012. Given the high costs of adult day centers, assisted living facilities and nursing home care, and the duration of the disease, individuals affected by Alzheimer's will often deplete their savings and assets, and ultimately come to rely on Medicaid for assistance. Though the theme of better health outcomes is present in several places in this draft, the attention to addressing the economic burden is, in our judgment, insufficient. The distinct financial burdens of Alzheimer's disease were a pervasive theme among the more than 40,000 Americans who participated in the Alzheimer's Association public input process on the National Alzheimer's Plan last year. We urge this be directly addressed in the next draft.</p>
<p><strong>Public health</strong>:<br />
					While we applaud the draft plan's emphasis on strengthening the Aging Network to deal with the burden of Alzheimer's disease, it does little to frame Alzheimer's as a top national public health challenge and to engage the full resources of the public health community at the federal, state and local levels. In this regard, the draft can draw from an important and encouraging trend in leading states where the public health network has been actively evaluating the burden of Alzheimer's. It also can draw from important work developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assessing the public health dimensions of Alzheimer's. The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact. Complementing the strong emphasis on the Aging Network by highly engaging the CDC in the National Alzheimer's Plan will ensure Alzheimer's is addressed as a public health priority.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong>:<br />
					It would be difficult to overstate just how critical we believe Strategy 5B, "Monitor Progress on the National Plan," is to securing important outcomes in the first year of the plan's implementation. We urge this monitoring be done in a timely, transparent way to ensure accountability for both the implementation of action steps and the meaningfulness of this activity. This is important for several reasons. First, this transparency is a clear expectation of Congress as expressed in and embedded throughout the statute (P.L. 111-375). Second, this is necessary for the Advisory Council if the Council is to fulfill its obligation under the law to meaningfully report directly to Congress and to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on an annual basis. Finally, it is a fundamental expectation of the Alzheimer's community. Accountability is a precondition for the successful pursuit of all that follows throughout the plan.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments</strong><br />
					The following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and actions as outlined in the <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, research funds must increase to the Alzheimer's research community's recommendation of $2 billion in order to achieve this goal.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong></em>.<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes it is good to set and update priorities by garnering outside input. We also believe in addition to the National Institute on Aging (NIA), all Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that are funding Alzheimer's research should be an integral part of this planning process, including the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). We look forward to additional details as to how the priority setting activities will feed through to the peer review process so suitable funds are recommended for appropriate studies, and how the planning process will inform decision-making across the entire NIH and not just the NIA. We also look forward to a detailed research plan and timeline for activities soon following the May Summit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.3: Regularly update the National Plan and refine Goal 1 strategies and action items based on feedback and input</strong></em><br />
					In addition to informing the implementation of the National Alzheimer's Plan with feedback from the Alzheimer's Research Summit and the Request for Information (RFI), HHS and its federal partners should also seek input from the public and experts in the field when regularly updating the plan.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.4: Convene a scientific workshop on other dementias in 2013</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the National Alzheimer's Plan for addressing other dementias, in keeping with the intent of P.L. 111-375.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.5: Update research priorities and milestones</strong></em><br />
					The Advisory Council meeting should be held each year at a time most relevant to informing the President's annual budget for Alzheimer's research.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.1: Expand research to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, and translate this information into potential targets for intervention</strong></em><br />
					The development of effective treatments that can delay, prevent and treat Alzheimer's will require a significant investment in our basic understanding of the disease. It will be critical that basic science receive sufficient funds to ensure adequate fundamental knowledge of the disease. To make this action meaningful and effective, the plan must include additional details on how this important research will be prioritized and expanded, what networks and mechanisms will be used to expedite translation of the basic science, and what level of funding will be committed in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes that increasing enrollment in clinical trials is critical to developing new treatments and eventually overcoming Alzheimer's disease. Groundbreaking research that could have a substantial impact on individuals with the disease now and in the future is significantly slowed by a lack of volunteers for Alzheimer's clinical trials. Recruiting and retaining trial participants is now the greatest obstacle, other than funding, to developing the next generation of Alzheimer's treatments. We believe HHS can expand registries through the promotion of existing Alzheimer's disease clinical trial matching services such as the Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch service.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch is a free service that makes it easy for people with Alzheimer's, caregivers, families and physicians to locate clinical trials based on personal criteria (diagnosis, stage of disease) and location. The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch lets interested individuals search trials quickly and easily, and narrows results to those trials where there is a reasonable chance to be accepted for enrollment, saving time for both the participant and the researcher.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.4: Monitor and identify strategies to increase enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies</strong></em><br />
					Monitoring enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies should not be limited to the NIH. Tracking race and ethnicity should also be encouraged in the outreach recommended in Action 1.B.3. This tracking should also be done by the private sector.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong></em><br />
					The Association encourages greater specificity regarding the intent of this action as the norm in drug development is for clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions to be conducted by private industry. Although there is a government role in clinical development of non-proprietary interventions, we urge care be taken not to divert resources to areas already well covered by private industry at a time when research resources for Alzheimer's are stretched so thin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong></em><br />
					While there have been great strides in the use of imaging and biofluids biomarkers over the last several years, to ensure this action is successful, significant research is still needed and will require a substantial investment. This action should also require assembling and maintaining a large cohort of subjects in all stages of the disease, including preclinical.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong></em><br />
					Collaborations must include multi-disciplinary partners, including experts in clinical care, epidemiology, and public health. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be an active participant in these collaborations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.1: Inventory Alzheimer's disease research investments</strong></em><br />
					The research ontology is an important classification system that provides a framework for collective portfolio analysis and introduces opportunities for coordinated strategic planning and initiatives among partner organizations and research funders. The Association was pleased to work with the NIA on this important project and is looking forward to the possibilities of having a global view of what Alzheimer's research is being conducted.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.2: Expand international outreach to enhance collaboration</strong></em><br />
					As a global leader in Alzheimer's research, the Alzheimer's Association operates in a spirit of inclusiveness, seeking partnerships throughout the scientific community to propel the field of Alzheimer's research forward. In addition to connecting with the countries listed in the Action, connecting with established international organizations, such as Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI), would be valuable. We look forward to additional details on how the information gathered from this meeting will be turned into additional action plans and new research partnerships.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong></em><br />
					This Action should also include a review of regulatory science needs, biomarker qualification, clinical trial infrastructure barriers, new or adaptive clinical trial design and guidance on designing/approving prevention or disease-modifying trials. In addition to NIH, FDA and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), the consultation list should include private and non-profit funders of Alzheimer's research as well as the Department of Defense (DoD). A well-defined timeline for meetings and an action plan for this group should be established to ensure accountability and progress.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association encourages the Secretary of HHS, the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense to work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities. This may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.3: Educate the public about the latest research findings</strong></em><br />
					The CDC's Healthy Aging Program, specifically the Healthy Brain Initiative (HBI), is an important example of their role in educating the public about the latest research findings connected to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association appreciates the Administration's announcement that $6 million will be dedicated over two years for provider education and outreach. While the $6 million is a great first step, we urge the Administration to dedicate additional funds for this endeavor to be successful.</p>
<p>To begin work under this area, the Association recommends targeted outreach to various provider groups. We believe HHS should promote an understanding of dementia among health care providers through a variety of mechanisms including the development of guidelines and quality measures. Once these guidelines are created, the development of online training modules would be most efficient. Additionally, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so care can be evaluated. Assisted living facilities should be added to the list of settings where high-quality care should be provided.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly supports a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained to understand the complexities of dementia will help ensure individuals with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system.</p>
<p>While the Association applauds the efforts outlined in the plan, we are concerned that the education component within this strategy may be limited. Many individuals with Alzheimer's disease enter the health care system through their primary care provider. To reach this target population, we encourage the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to play a major role in educational outreach, particularly to the Medicare provider community. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed with individuals and their caregivers after a diagnosis such as managing dementia with other chronic illnesses and referrals to existing community supports and services. CMS could partner with relevant stakeholders, such as the Alzheimer's Association, to develop resources to share with providers. Providers' education should also include guidance on the appropriateness and benefits of palliative and end-of-life care services, such as hospice, for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. This effort should include how and when providers should discuss the issue with the individual and their representative.</p>
<p>We also encourage the plan to address educating physicians and other health care providers on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often providers do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing providers, a lack of training on the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delays detection of cognitive impairment and diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that state and local public health departments should be included in this action item. The public health community is very good at educating health care providers. There are a number of evidence-based interventions for educating providers in a variety of settings that can be applied to Alzheimer's disease. We encourage HHS to support the necessary infrastructure to help state and local departments offer this type of education in public health settings.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</strong></em><br />
					Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties, particularly those that care for people with dementia, should be expanded.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong></em><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the development of quality indicators. HHS should promote existing evidence-based guidelines and curricula. Where unavailable, HHS should work with relevant stakeholders who have developed evidence-based quality care guidelines, such as the <em>Alzheimer's Association's Dementia Care Practice Recommendations</em>, which incorporate the latest research and field evidence. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p>In addition, the Alzheimer's Association urges HHS to ensure that content within the proposed clearinghouse is current and easily accessible.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce</strong></em><br />
					Section 6121 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that all certified nursing aides (CNAs) that work in nursing homes receive training on care for persons with dementia. As implementation of this provision progresses, the Association urges CMS to include a mechanism that ensures any recommended education materials are fully understood and absorbed. Further, CMS should publically establish the survey guidelines that will accompany this new requirement to ensure CNAs are appropriately trained.</p>
<p>The Association would like to see the plan also recommend that all direct care workers, including those in assisted living facilities and home- and community-based settings, be required to meet a similar standard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong></em><br />
					HHS should coordinate with states to develop Alzheimer's disease coordinators and workforces in state and local public health departments that will develop and implement Alzheimer's disease strategies. Strategies may include early detection and diagnosis campaigns, provider education campaigns, surveillance work, implementation of state Alzheimer's disease plans, and other essential public health services. HHS should also work with Aging Network staff to recognize the warning signs of dementia and be trained to assist individuals and their families when they seek appropriate medical care for detection and diagnosis.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong></em><br />
					To continue connecting families and people with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease to Alzheimer's-capable resources and meet growing demand, the Administration on Aging's (AoA) National Alzheimer's Call Center will require additional funding. The National Alzheimer's Call Center provides 24-hour, 7 day a week, year-round telephone support, crisis counseling, care consultation, and information and referral services in 140 languages for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their family members and informal caregivers. Trained professional staff and master's-level mental health professionals are available at all times. Since 2003, the National Alzheimer's Call Center has served more than 2 million people in the community. Additionally, it is important to note that the Alzheimer's Disease Centers, funded by NIA, are only available to certain areas of the country. As such, we urge HHS to include a solution in the final plan to ensure areas without resources have access to assistance, such as the Call Center.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. As discussed, the ACA created the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) which includes the detection of cognitive impairment. To enhance the AWV, the Association believes the CDC should revise the model Health Risk Assessment (HRA), which is part of the AWV, to include questions about memory and other indicators of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>We also recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection in a clinical setting in addition to the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. While the draft plan refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is important to emphasize detection of cognitive impairment as the precursor to a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.C.1: Educate physicians and other healthcare providers about accessing long-term services and supports and Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes health care providers should be educated about available supports for newly-diagnosed individuals and their caregivers to provide better counsel through this difficult disease. This should include information medical and non-medical supports and services. Further, the Association believes Medicare should cover a visit in which a health care provider discusses current and future care planning, with the caregiver, with or without the beneficiary present, to ensure families receive vital information to navigate this difficult disease. The Alzheimer's Association stands ready and willing to partner with HHS to develop a list of appropriate resources to share with the provider community. In fact, our chapters are currently conducting outreach on the local level to make providers aware of the available supports in their own community.</p>
<p>As stated in the Association's <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em>, at least 800,000 individuals with Alzheimer's disease live alone and as many as half do not have an identifiable caregiver. We strongly encourage HHS to further develop assistance for this particularly vulnerable population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</em></strong><br />
					While developing dementia care guidelines and measures, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so that care can be evaluated. In addition, the guidelines should include criteria and provisions for quality palliative and end-of-life care, including hospice care.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to build on existing quality initiatives, such as the Alzheimer's Association's <em>Campaign for Quality Residential Care</em>, which takes a person-centered approach and covers the basics of good care in six areas. The Association supports the development of additional quality measures and evidence-based care guidelines, and can serve as a resource in this effort.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.E.1: Evaluate the effectiveness of medical home models for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					While the medical home model holds promise, these models of care would need to be flexible to accommodate the specific needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, as they may require additional time and services to be effective for the Alzheimer's community. Moreover, it is recommended that care coordination designed specifically for Alzheimer's disease be highlighted for evaluation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, models should focus on aspects that seem to be particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices. Due to the nature of Alzheimer's disease, coaches and telephone disease management may not be particularly effective for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					Acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners to facilitate greater safety for people with the disease.</p>
<p>While it is critical to identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's disease, there should be similar action on identifying and disseminating models of safety to be used by nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other residential care settings. Additionally, there should be similar action on this for emergency personnel and first responders.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong></em><br />
					Most notably absent from the discussion of improving care transitions is the importance of making a documented diagnosis in an individual's medical record. Further, an individual should have a list of relevant medications documented in their medical record, especially prior to any care transition. The use of electronic medical records may also facilitate the availability of this information and should be explored particularly in the context of safer care transitions for patients with dementia.</p>
<p>Some individuals have behavioral problems related to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, appropriate community mental health services should be developed to include systems that strengthen the care needs of individuals with behavioral disturbances.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.1: Review evidence on care coordination models for people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					As mentioned in Action 2.E.1, the focus of these models should include aspects of the models are particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.2: Implement and evaluate care coordination models</em></strong><br />
					Individuals with Alzheimer's disease who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid are likely to use more health care services and have less desirable outcomes without quality care coordination. For example, people with serious medical conditions and Alzheimer's or another dementia are more likely to be hospitalized than those with the same medical conditions but no Alzheimer's or dementia.</p>
<p>Initially, the evaluation of these integrated models of care should be weighted towards effective care coordination, rather than cost-savings, since individuals may have increased access to services that didn't have before. This is especially important when considering cost increases, which may occur in Medicaid services since individuals with Alzheimer's may not have had previous access to long-term care services and supports due to long waiting lists and state fiscal constraints.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.H.1: Create a taskforce to improve care for these specific populations</em></strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan must identify specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support</strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers. Often, financial barriers prevent families from accessing the support they need to provide care for their loved one. Although there are a number of strategies and actions to address support for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families, the plan does not clearly address additional funding for respite care -- whether it be in day centers or within the home.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</em></strong><br />
					As HHS considers which agencies, federal departments, and state and local networks to distribute materials, it should also consider including the CDC's Healthy Aging Program.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</em></strong><br />
					In addition to developing more services, the Alzheimer's Association believes existing services to support caregivers should be promoted, supported, and expanded. Furthermore, while this action mentions respite care, it does so only in terms of providing referrals and does not include increased funding so that families can access such services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</em></strong><br />
					HHS should look for ways to promote the National Alzheimer's Call Center and its services as a crisis resource for caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.C.1: Examine awareness of long-term care needs and barriers to planning for these needs and Action 3.C.2: Expand long-term care awareness efforts</em></strong><br />
					We encourage the plan to consider addressing all aspects of long-term care, including financial planning, driving, and safety issues. Increasing the awareness of future care planning could help individuals and their families address challenges earlier and help avoid crises later.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to examine the barriers to long-term care, which may include studying the availability and impact of long-term care insurance as people with Alzheimer's disease, particularly those with younger-onset, may face unique challenges when trying to purchase insurance.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					The education of legal professionals should be expanded to include other entities in the legal system, including law enforcement, first responders, prosecutors, and judges.</p>
<p>Broader awareness of Alzheimer's disease may help prevent or reduce arrests of individuals with Alzheimer's who are charged with crimes for which they have no intent, such as unintentional trespassing. Further, it may help legal professionals and first responders to spot abuse -- physical and non-physical -- against people with the disease. In addition, State Adult Protective Service (APS) agencies are overburdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire of circumstances. We encourage the plan to address the need for additional resources dedicated to protecting the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Finally, the plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. We hope that the plan considers guidance for legal professionals seeking to balance autonomy and individual safety.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong></em><br />
					Individuals living with dementia may experience behavioral and psychotic symptoms (BPSD) during the course of their disease due to the alterations in processing, integrating and retrieving new information that accompanies dementia. Non-pharmacologic approaches should be tried as a first-line alternative to pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of BPSD. The Association recommends training and education for both professional and family caregivers on psychosocial interventions. Further, we recommend the plan call for similar monitoring and reporting in assisted living facilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</em></strong><br />
					At least 800,000 Americans with Alzheimer's disease live alone. Compared to those with Alzheimer's who live with someone else, on average, people with Alzheimer's who live alone are more likely to live in poverty and require assistance performing tasks such as managing money, shopping, traveling, housekeeping, preparing meals and taking medications correctly. We encourage HHS to explore affordable housing models that will allow this unique population to live safely within their communities.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Action 4.A.1: Design and conduct a national education and outreach initiative</em></strong><br />
					The public awareness campaign in Action 4.A.1 must be culturally-sensitive and reach those in underserved locations.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress</strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government.</p>
<p>At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), coordinated by the CDC. Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they can adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.1: Identify major policy research needs and Action 5.A.2: Identify needed changes or additions to data</em></strong><br />
					The CDC has been a leader in incorporating measures of cognitive health into other population health monitoring efforts. The CDC Healthy Aging Program has worked on identifying databases, worked with partners to add questions on cognitive impairment and caregiving to the BRFSS and added questions on cognitive impairment to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) The CDC is currently analyzing data from these datasets as they become available. In particular, BRFSS data are unique and allow for state- and local-level data that can highlight the needs of diverse populations in the United States.</p>
<p>The CDC Healthy Aging Program developed a 10-question BRFSS module on Perceived Cognitive Impairment. Twenty-two states included the module on their state BRFSS in 2011 and an additional 16 states are including the module in 2012 for a total of 38 states, including the District of Columbia. The CDC Healthy Aging Program is working with partners, including states, to expand the module in 2013 to all 50 states. They are also producing reports and publications regarding these data to inform decision-makers about the perceived impact of cognitive impairment at the state and local levels.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.3: Make needed improvements to data</em></strong><br />
					Using data to improve and track progress is essential and we commend its inclusion in the draft plan. This critical information should be publically available, as well as to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (preclinical through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.1: Designate responsibility for action implementation</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the intent to designate responsibility for each action step. However, we urge designation of individual accountable for each action, rather than simply a "contact person."</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.2: Track plan progress</em></strong><br />
					Tracking on plan progress as described in this action step should be provided to the public on no less than a quarterly basis. In general, we urge that the reporting on progress regarding each action be paired with greater clarity and specificity regarding desired outcomes than has been provided in the draft plan.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.3: Update the National Plan annually</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association urges that updates to the plan be done with the same transparency and opportunities for comment that has characterized the formulation of this initial National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:<br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan should allow us, for the first time to answer this simple question: <em>Did we make satisfactory progress in the fight against Alzheimer's disease?</em> For too many individuals living with Alzheimer's and their families, the system has failed them, and today we are unnecessarily losing the battle against this devastating disease. A successful National Alzheimer's Plan offers us the opportunity to change that, and set a new trajectory for this rapidly expanding global epidemic through American leadership.</p>
<p>As we all know, a plan accomplishes nothing without thorough and effective implementation that is coupled with transparency and accountability for those actions. The Alzheimer's Association looks forward to a final National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, will help to build the strongest possible National Alzheimer's Plan to overcome the escalating burden of Alzheimer's disease on American families.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, there is now an Industry Working group on Alzheimer's supportive of the 2025 goal. I will be working to expand the size of this group in the coming months so that HHS has a strong partner in executing our National Plan. Here are their comments on the draft plan.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>As you refine the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, leading biopharmaceutical organizations engaged in Alzheimer's and dementia research and drug development are pleased to have this opportunity to offer comment on a strong first draft. The organizations participating in the Industry Working Group on Alzheimer's Disease (Working Group), identified above, represent many of the industry leaders striving to discover and develop therapies and diagnostics to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025 if not sooner. We have collectively invested tens of billions of dollars and many decades of energy to change the course of Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and we are all too familiar with the scientific, medical, and financial challenges associated with this pursuit, as well as the human and societal costs. If we are to reach the HHS stated goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025 -- which we support -- nothing short of a transformational and transparent partnership between the public and private sectors will be required. We look forward to working with you to make this happen.</p>
<p>The immense risks and challenges associated with bringing a drug, biologic, or other therapies to market are well known. The 1 of every 10,000 potential therapies that end up being approved for patient use take on average 13 years and cost well beyond $1 billion each to develop. For Alzheimer's and dementia research, scientific and other challenges have resulted in a very small number of approved treatments. And of the medications currently available, they address only the symptoms of the disease.</p>
<p>As noted above, we strongly applaud you and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services for embracing the bold and appropriate Goal number 1 of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. Given the significant current public health and fiscal challenges -- and the even greater looming health and fiscal threats posed by the disease -- this is indeed an appropriate goal. Fifty years ago, the nation committed to sending a man to the moon within the decade. We believe the time has come for a second moon shot, one focused on preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease. Just as we succeeded in putting a man on the moon ahead of schedule, we believe this goal can be achieved if the right resources -- public and private -- and the right policies -- those that encourage and accelerate the development of safe and effective treatments -- are brought to bear. The challenge before us now is how to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>This Working Group has devoted considerable time and energies studying this question and is pleased to offer the following comments and suggestions to maximize our collective abilities to achieve success. We have targeted our comments and recommendations within five core areas:</p>
<ul><li>Strengthening the role of industry in the overall process, particularly by providing continuing and dynamic input into determining our national research priorities and ways to compress the discovery pipeline.</li>
<li>Providing greater specificity and detail -- as well as an accurate statement of resources -- that will be necessary to achieve the strategies and goals.</li>
<li>Including the policy incentives necessary to attract and sustain robust industry and capital commitments to Alzheimer's and dementia research.</li>
<li>Establishing metrics that are useful in driving the desired outcome, are clear, and are measurable.</li>
<li>Extending our vision to encompass the global challenge presented by Alzheimer's disease and dementias.</li>
</ul><p>We will comment on each overarching point and then offer a number of more specific comments and suggestions for the next draft of the National Plan.</p>
<p><strong>I. Strengthen the role of industry in the overall process, particularly by providing continuing and dynamic input into determining our national research priorities and ways to compress the discovery pipeline. </strong></p>
<p>We are encouraged to see multiple references from the Administration that this plan be a true National Plan rather than a federal plan, meaning that it will include shared rights, roles, and responsibilities for all stakeholders. To ensure this desire is achieved, the Working Group strongly believes that the next version of the plan <strong><em>must include a more robust and ongoing process of partnership between government -- particularly the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration -- and industry</em></strong>.</p>
<p>For example, while we appreciate the upcoming NIH summit and the Request for Information to collect widespread input on the research agenda, we note these actions are limited to one-time occurrences and do not contemplate an ongoing and robust dialogue and exchange with industry partners. Also concerning is that other recommendations -- including sets 1.B, 1.C, and 1.E, which are focused on expanding research, accelerating effort to identify early and pre-symptomatic stages of the disease, and compressing the discovery timeline, call for what may be viewed as token or no industry engagement whatsoever despite the immense value such involvement would bring to the larger effort.</p>
<p>Specifically, action 1.E.1 focuses on identifying ways to compress the time between target identification and release of treatment, but calls for industry to be involved only indirectly. <strong><em>We strongly believe the plan should recognize an explicit role for industry with a direct seat at this and related tables given the predominant role we collectively play in the therapy discovery and development process</em></strong>. In this way, together, we will begin to set a concrete course that characterizes a new, vital and transparent partnership between the public and private sectors, aligned to achieve the 2025 goal.</p>
<p>Beyond the points above, we urge that the draft plan be amended to include the following:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Commit to establishing a meaningful partnership with industry and an ongoing process of dialogue between industry and NIH and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) in determining research and related priorities</strong>. Inviting industry to the table to identify significant areas of research need and to present perplexing questions in need of basic research will breathe life into the concept of life cycle innovation by providing invaluable input and exchange of ideas. If the government wants to create a truly national plan, we believe this new partnership with the private sector, one that is open, transparent, and ground-breaking, should be at the core of the plan. In terms of specific models, we recommend exploring the Forum for Collaborative HIV Research and related HIV/AIDS models as potential examples, as well as the platforms created through the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program for industry engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Establish a standing NIH/NIA and Industry Alzheimer's Working Group</strong> to provide the institutes with the continuous feedback loop on research and drug discovery issues such as those raised above. One potential model may be the CEO Roundtable on Cancer, which involves a number of industry partners as well as governmental collaborators including the NIH and FDA. Such a partnership could provide the NIH and other federal entities not only with additional voices and input but also with potential resources to support initiatives, such as more regular scientific conferences and inventories.</li>
<li><strong>Increase patient enrollment in clinical trials, particularly targeted minority patients</strong>. We strongly applaud this aspect of the plan and we urge that industry play a meaningful role in crafting the recruitment action plan, including being consulted on the populations or sub-populations we believe are most in need. This action plan should include specific tools for attaining this increased participation, such as targeted patient registries.</li>
</ul><p><strong>II. Provide greater specificity and detail -- as well as an accurate statement of resources -- that will be necessary to achieve the strategies and goals. </strong></p>
<p>The Working Group embraces many of the research action steps included in the first draft plan. Expanding basic research into the underpinnings of the disease, identifying risk and protective factors, identifying biomarkers, and identifying ways to compress the therapy development timeline are all tremendously important if we are to achieve the 2025 goal. But each of these strategies and actions is only as good as the corresponding action steps required to achieve them, and we believe greater specificity and detail than what is contained in the first draft is needed. <strong><em>We also believe that given the enormity of the challenges before us, the plan must speak to the significant yet realistic financial resources -- both public and private -- that must be brought to bear against this disease to stop it from destroying our health and finances. You have been bold in stating the 2025 goal, so too you should be realistic in setting the expectation for the resources -- and scope of investment across the public and private sectors -- that will be required to meet this goal</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Following are comments in terms of enhanced specificity that we feel would strengthen the plan.</p>
<p><strong>A clear path to the validation of a family of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers</strong></p>
<ul><li>Catalogue existing Alzheimer's biomarker initiatives including their focus/type (<em>e.g., inclusion, prognostic, surrogate endpoint</em>) and <em>where</em> they currently lie in terms of their development and review, identify gaps, and establish a plan that seeks to validate specific biomarkers within a certain timeframe.</li>
<li>Convene a joint high-level meeting between FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) leadership focused on Alzheimer's biomarkers and surrogate endpoints -- including imaging modalities and imaging agents -- and the much-needed harmonization of guidance and approvals.</li>
<li>Develop a joint NIH and FDA -- in close consultation with industry -- action plan focused specifically on identifying and validating Alzheimer's biomarkers. This will be a subset of the larger research prioritization and action plan and involve ongoing NIH, FDA and industry dialogue to better understand biomarker needs, to update the biomarkers action plan, and to provide clear and direct guidance to industry on the use of such tools.</li>
<li>Engage the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) on specific initiatives focused on biomarker and surrogate endpoint development and addressing challenges in conducting clinical trials in pre-symptomatic patient populations.</li>
<li>Issue, upon biomarker and endpoint approval, unambiguous guidance to industry on their usage.</li>
</ul><p><strong>A reduction in the cost and time of clinical trials and clinical trial processes</strong></p>
<ul><li>Create large-scale, open-architected patient registries, with a particular focus on ethnic subpopulations.</li>
<li>Engage industry as to population and subpopulation engagement, data, and other needs.</li>
<li>Consider the applicability of novel trial designs, such as models used to address rare disease, for Alzheimer's disease.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Improved access to standardized electronic health and clinical trial data</strong></p>
<ul><li>Establish a process involving NIH, FDA, and industry to identify core data issues. Topics would include access to data -- including intervention arm data, failed trial data, dormant therapy data, biomarker data and other valuable data sets -- as well as agreeing to and extending the use of common data standards.</li>
<li>As part of this process, engage with industry around specific ideas to enlarge the space of appropriate data sharing. Members of the Working Group have each participated in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, in many ways a seminal effort to explore and expand this space. We understand the opportunities afforded by efforts such as these, both to accelerate development where signals are positive and to fail early where signals suggest a dead end. We are prepared to build on these experiences to create new models that serve to advance therapy development across the sector.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Honest assessment of the level of resources necessary to achieve the 2025 goal</strong></p>
<ul><li>Include within the strategies and action items a realistic estimate of the resources necessary to achieve success, and a statement as to how the federal government, particularly during financially challenging times, plans to meet its commitment.</li>
<li>Extension of the scope and scale of responses to the global scale including a path forward toward a global action plan and fund.</li>
</ul><p><strong>III. Include the policy incentives necessary to attract and sustain robust industry and capital commitments to Alzheimer's and dementia research </strong></p>
<p>The draft national plan is deficient in that while it notes the importance of compressing the discovery timeline, it fails to mention financial and other policy levers that are needed to attract and sustain robust industry and capital commitment to this most challenging area of research. <strong><em>We urge that you speak to the role of smart incentives within the draft plan and lay out a path for addressing these topics near-term</em></strong>. Specific issues we recommend the plan address directly or develop a process involving industry stakeholders to address include:</p>
<ul><li>Maintaining and strengthening a patent system that encourages and rewards innovation and protects and provides a fair return on investment.</li>
<li>Establishing avenues for the collaboration of the public and private sectors that realistically take into account the genuine needs and strengths of both groups.</li>
<li>Ensuring appropriate payment for any successful therapy that takes into account the enormous costs of research and drug development in this critical area. This requires adequate federal reimbursement and payment policies and having the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) at the table whenever warranted.</li>
</ul><p><strong>IV. Establish metrics that are useful in driving the desired outcome, are clear, and are measurable. </strong></p>
<p>The members of the Working Group strongly believe that meaningful and clear metrics and milestones are absolutely essential for implementing any plan and holding responsible parties accountable. In business, clear action plans and corresponding metrics are commonplace and indispensable in keeping projects focused, on schedule, and on budget. All three of these attributes are necessary if the National Alzheimer's Plan is to be successful in achieving its goals, but the current plan falls short in this area, particularly in setting outcomes for action items. For example:</p>
<ul><li>The draft plan seeks to increase enrollment in Alzheimer's clinical trials but fails to specify specific numbers, target demographics or interim milestones.</li>
<li>It seeks to increase the pace of collaboration between the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs but does not provide a clear timeframe or goals.</li>
<li>It seeks to identify biomarkers but does not establish targets or set a timeframe for biomarker acceptance and validation by the FDA.</li>
<li>And it speaks to maximizing government and industry collaboration but does not espouse clear goals for this action, only events like meetings and conferences and high-level themes.</li>
</ul><p>While all of these and other actions are meritorious, they require clear metrics and a commitment to aggressive oversight. To that end, the industry Working Group recommends that the plan be amended to:</p>
<ul><li>Commit to develop this year specific action steps and metrics for each action starting with the designation of a specific federal official/office to manage each action.</li>
<li>Develop and post on the NAPA website a user-friendly "dashboard" to regularly track progress toward each action, strategy, and goal.</li>
<li>Work with industry and other appropriate partners to establish metrics that will increase our collective ability to achieve our goals, particularly the goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's by 2025.</li>
</ul><p><strong>V. Extend our vision to encompass the global challenge presented by Alzheimer's disease and dementias. </strong></p>
<p>In a recent speech, Professor Peter Piot, former Under Secretary-General of the United Nations and former executive director of UNAIDS, called dementia "one of the largest neglected global health challenges of our generation" and called for a global health action plan to address it.<sup>1</sup> Alzheimer's disease is an epidemic that respects no national boundaries and that threatens to cripple the health and finances of the world if unaddressed. The statistics are clear: more than 36 million people worldwide currently have Alzheimer's or dementia, and projections estimate this number will skyrocket to 115 million by the mid-century point, according to Alzheimer's Disease International. The economic impact of the current epidemic exceeds $600 billion annually, and nearly two-thirds of all victims live in developing nations that are largely ill-equipped to address the challenge.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Earlier this year, rating agency Standard &amp; Poors issued an analysis that said "Population aging will lead to profound changes in economic growth prospects for countries around the world, we believe, as governments work to build budgets to face ever greater age-related spending needs."<sup>3</sup> If governments fail to address this challenge and amend their social benefits systems, the agency concluded, the systems will become unsustainable." As Professor Piot noted, we must learn from the global approach to combat HIV/AIDS and enact a similar approach to Alzheimer's and dementia. No single country can take on this massive and multi-faceted endeavor alone, and the United States should be forceful and positive in recognizing this.</p>
<p>The draft plan acknowledges the need for greater collaboration between the U.S. and international partners, specifically Canada, the United Kingdom, and other nations that have or are developing National Alzheimer's Plans. This is a solid step that must be built upon with a clear path forward. Specifically, we urge that the global section be built out and contemplate specific measurable steps the U.S. will take to help develop and execute a global action plan as well as a global fund focused on both treatment and therapy development.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong></p>
<p>Madame Secretary, the members of the ad hoc Industry Working Group wish to express our deep gratitude to you for taking meaningful actions to address our national and global Alzheimer's epidemic. We believe the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is a strong first step, and we offer the above comments and suggestions as part of a sincere offer to foster a true partnership and collaboration with you and your colleagues to prevent and treat this disease by 2025. We welcome any questions you may have, and we stand at the ready to discuss any of our comments with you and your team directly if desired.</p>

<li>Convene a joint high-level meeting between FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) leadership focused on Alzheimer's biomarkers and surrogate endpoints -- including imaging modalities and imaging agents -- and the much-needed harmonization of guidance and approvals.</li>
<li>Develop a joint NIH and FDA -- in close consultation with industry -- action plan focused specifically on identifying and validating Alzheimer's biomarkers. This will be a subset of the larger research prioritization and action plan and involve ongoing NIH, FDA and industry dialogue to better understand biomarker needs, to update the biomarkers action plan, and to provide clear and direct guidance to industry on the use of such tools.</li>
<li>Engage the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) on specific initiatives focused on biomarker and surrogate endpoint development and addressing challenges in conducting clinical trials in pre-symptomatic patient populations.</li>
<li>Issue, upon biomarker and endpoint approval, unambiguous guidance to industry on their usage.</li>
</ul><p><strong>A reduction in the cost and time of clinical trials and clinical trial processes</strong></p>
<ul><li>Create large-scale, open-architected patient registries, with a particular focus on ethnic subpopulations.</li>
<li>Engage industry as to population and subpopulation engagement, data, and other needs.</li>
<li>Consider the applicability of novel trial designs, such as models used to address rare disease, for Alzheimer's disease.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Improved access to standardized electronic health and clinical trial data</strong></p>
<ul><li>Establish a process involving NIH, FDA, and industry to identify core data issues. Topics would include access to data -- including intervention arm data, failed trial data, dormant therapy data, biomarker data and other valuable data sets -- as well as agreeing to and extending the use of common data standards.</li>
<li>As part of this process, engage with industry around specific ideas to enlarge the space of appropriate data sharing. Members of the Working Group have each participated in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, in many ways a seminal effort to explore and expand this space. We understand the opportunities afforded by efforts such as these, both to accelerate development where signals are positive and to fail early where signals suggest a dead end. We are prepared to build on these experiences to create new models that serve to advance therapy development across the sector.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Honest assessment of the level of resources necessary to achieve the 2025 goal</strong></p>
<ul><li>Include within the strategies and action items a realistic estimate of the resources necessary to achieve success, and a statement as to how the federal government, particularly during financially challenging times, plans to meet its commitment.</li>
<li>Extension of the scope and scale of responses to the global scale including a path forward toward a global action plan and fund.</li>
</ul><p><strong>III. Include the policy incentives necessary to attract and sustain robust industry and capital commitments to Alzheimer's and dementia research </strong></p>
<p>The draft national plan is deficient in that while it notes the importance of compressing the discovery timeline, it fails to mention financial and other policy levers that are needed to attract and sustain robust industry and capital commitment to this most challenging area of research. <strong>We urge that you speak to the role of smart incentives within the draft plan and lay out a path for addressing these topics near-term</strong>. Specific issues we recommend the plan address directly or develop a process involving industry stakeholders to address include:</p>
<ul><li>Maintaining and strengthening a patent system that encourages and rewards innovation and protects and provides a fair return on investment.</li>
<li>Establishing avenues for the collaboration of the public and private sectors that realistically take into account the genuine needs and strengths of both groups.</li>
<li>Ensuring appropriate payment for any successful therapy that takes into account the enormous costs of research and drug development in this critical area. This requires adequate federal reimbursement and payment policies and having the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) at the table whenever warranted.</li>
</ul><p><strong>IV. Establish metrics that are useful in driving the desired outcome, are clear, and are measurable. </strong></p>
<p>The members of the Working Group strongly believe that meaningful and clear metrics and milestones are absolutely essential for implementing any plan and holding responsible parties accountable. In business, clear action plans and corresponding metrics are commonplace and indispensable in keeping projects focused, on schedule, and on budget. All three of these attributes are necessary if the National Alzheimer's Plan is to be successful in achieving its goals, but the current plan falls short in this area, particularly in setting outcomes for action items. For example:</p>
<ul><li>The draft plan seeks to increase enrollment in Alzheimer's clinical trials but fails to specify specific numbers, target demographics or interim milestones.</li>
<li>It seeks to increase the pace of collaboration between the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs but does not provide a clear timeframe or goals.</li>
<li>It seeks to identify biomarkers but does not establish targets or set a timeframe for biomarker acceptance and validation by the FDA.</li>
<li>And it speaks to maximizing government and industry collaboration but does not espouse clear goals for this action, only events like meetings and conferences and high-level themes.</li>
</ul><p>While all of these and other actions are meritorious, they require clear metrics and a commitment to aggressive oversight. To that end, the industry Working Group recommends that the plan be amended to:</p>
<ul><li>Commit to develop this year specific action steps and metrics for each action starting with the designation of a specific federal official/office to manage each action.</li>
<li>Develop and post on the NAPA website a user-friendly "dashboard" to regularly track progress toward each action, strategy, and goal.</li>
<li>Work with industry and other appropriate partners to establish metrics that will increase our collective ability to achieve our goals, particularly the goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's by 2025.</li>
</ul><p><strong>V. Extend our vision to encompass the global challenge presented by Alzheimer's disease and dementias. </strong></p>
<p>In a recent speech, Professor Peter Piot, former Under Secretary-General of the United Nations and former executive director of UNAIDS, called dementia "one of the largest neglected global health challenges of our generation" and called for a global health action plan to address it. <sup>1</sup> Alzheimer's disease is an epidemic that respects no national boundaries and that threatens to cripple the health and finances of the world if unaddressed. The statistics are clear: more than 36 million people worldwide currently have Alzheimer's or dementia, and projections estimate this number will skyrocket to 115 million by the mid-century point, according to Alzheimer's Disease International. The economic impact of the current epidemic exceeds $600 billion annually, and nearly two-thirds of all victims live in developing nations that are largely ill-equipped to address the challenge.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Earlier this year, rating agency Standard &amp; Poors issued an analysis that said "Population aging will lead to profound changes in economic growth prospects for countries around the world, we believe, as governments work to build budgets to face ever greater age-related spending needs."<sup>3</sup> If governments fail to address this challenge and amend their social benefits systems, the agency concluded, the systems will become unsustainable." As Professor Piot noted, we must learn from the global approach to combat HIV/AIDS and enact a similar approach to Alzheimer's and dementia. No single country can take on this massive and multi-faceted endeavor alone, and the United States should be forceful and positive in recognizing this.</p>
<p>The draft plan acknowledges the need for greater collaboration between the U.S. and international partners, specifically Canada, the United Kingdom, and other nations that have or are developing National Alzheimer's Plans. This is a solid step that must be built upon with a clear path forward. Specifically, we urge that the global section be built out and contemplate specific measurable steps the U.S. will take to help develop and execute a global action plan as well as a global fund focused on both treatment and therapy development.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong></p>
<p>Madame Secretary, the members of the ad hoc Industry Working Group wish to express our deep gratitude to you for taking meaningful actions to address our national and global Alzheimer's epidemic. We believe the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is a strong first step, and we offer the above comments and suggestions as part of a sincere offer to foster a true partnership and collaboration with you and your colleagues to prevent and treat this disease by 2025. We welcome any questions you may have, and we stand at the ready to discuss any of our comments with you and your team directly if desired.</p>

<p>From a global perspective, the NAPA law, Council and subsequent plan development have given a shot in the arm to the Alzheimer's community which has been pursuing many of the same aims of the act in countries on all five continents. Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI) would like to offer some brief comments to the NAPA planners about the broader context of your work. Though there are major differences in resources and the cost of care between developed and less developed nations, the similarities of challenges around diagnosis, family support, health system development and quality care are universal, as are the aspirations for improved treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's a disease and related dementias.</p>
<p>We offer our comments based primarily in response to draft strategies 1D and 1E, which recommend more international collaboration in the research and public health education sectors, a concept we heartily endorse.</p>
<p>ADI is the international federation of Alzheimer associations around the world, in official relations with the World Health Organization. Each member is the Alzheimer association in their country who support people with dementia and their families. ADI's vision is an improved quality of life for people with dementia and their families throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's as a Global Public Health Issue </strong></p>
<p>The global health community is waking up to the size and scope of the problem of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. These comments review 3 global developments: information reports by our private organisation, Alzheimer's Disease International (of which the Alzheimer's Association is a member), United Nations and World Health Organization reports and actions, which have recently increased and in which the US has played and could continue to play a helpful role.</p>
<p>Since 2009, <strong>ADI</strong> has issued major data reports about Alzheimer disease and related dementias worldwide. Each report is the product of scientific collaboration, led by an epidemiologist and full research team. I would highlight the most recent report, which provides the latest evidence of the medical and social benefits of an early and accurate diagnosis as a tool on which to base further work to fight the gap between prevalence estimates of 36 million worldwide and actually numbers of people diagnosed. It is estimated that probably no more than 1 in 4 people with dementia have received a formal diagnosis, which has been identified as a significant issue in the US draft plan framework and <em>Healthy People 2020</em> objectives.</p>
<p>In September 2011 the <strong>United Nations</strong> held only its second high-level meeting on a health issue in its history. This consultation on non-communicable diseases was held to debate a policy document and the final political declaration urges that member countries: "18. Recognize that mental and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, are an important cause of morbidity and contribute to the global non-communicable disease burden, for which there is a need to provide equitable access to effective programmes and health-care interventions."</p>
<p>This UN session directed the WHO to develop a series of targets, measures and indicators for reducing non-communicable diseases to be adopted by the World Health Assembly in its May 2012 meeting.</p>
<p>The <strong>World Health Organization</strong>'s involvement in Alzheimer's disease dates back to at least 1982, when it held an expert meeting on senile dementia. For many years most of the focus of the WHO has been through its mental health Programme (mhGap). The programme has produced a steady body of work for international professional and public health audiences about Alzheimer's and dementia. Our summary chart of all WHO publications is appended to these comments.</p>
<p>With WHO now deeply involved in follow-on planning from the NCD summit, efforts are underway to get Alzheimer's disease recognised as the fifth major non-communicable disease. <strong><em>However we need support from the US Government to make that happen and include Alzheimer's disease in the next NCD Strategy 2013-2020!</em></strong> Alzheimer's disease was used as an example of how ageing is a factor in the growing noncommunicable disease challenge in a recent resolution passed at the Assembly's executive meeting in January, and it is certain to be debated at the assembly meeting in May.</p>
<p><strong>WHO Global Report </strong></p>
<p>On April 11 2012 the World Health Organization will release a major global report on Alzheimer's disease and dementia. This is the result of collaboration with over 100 experts around the world to produce a volume similar in size and style to the world report on disabilities. Basic themes of the report will include the need for improved and coordinated research, more professional development of medical and non-medical staff, family caregiver support, and better linkages between health and social services in order to support people with Alzheimer's. The report will also focus on population risk reduction for Alzheimer's disease and dementia, identifying what might be done in the public health sector to better define and reduce population risk of dementia. The prevalence/diagnosis gap is also a theme of the report and it has a section on small subpopulations of people with Alzheimer's disease, such as rural, minority language speaking, or people with Alzheimer's referred to as early or younger onset.</p>
<p>The WHO will signal that we are on the brink of a global health catastrophe. Across the world, 36 million people are living with dementia today. But unlike people with other serious conditions, their plight is very often not recognised. They will argue that their condition attracts only minimal research investment and a lack of awareness about adequate care and treatment mean their condition is often made needlessly worse than it needs to be. As the global population ages the problem will only get bigger.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Collaborations </strong></p>
<p>Though there are many cross-national, scientific collaborations we suggest the following three that go beyond the bio-medical focus and highlight some of that work as suggestions for additional directions that international collaboration in research could foster.</p>
<p><strong>JPND</strong><br />
					The EU supports the European Union <strong>Joint Programme - Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND)</strong> to facilitate trans-European research. The idea was launched in 2008 during the French presidency of the European Union. It is a major effort to improve EU alignment of scientific strategy on Alzheimer's disease and make best use of available resources. It now numbers 24 countries.</p>
<p>JPND major effort to date has been to collaboratively create a strategic research agenda to guide activity and investments. Just released, this strategy is based on the most complete compendium of current country-by-country efforts ever created. It lays out five scientific priorities and a robust set of cross-cutting enabling activities to move the strategy forward, of which two are unique when compared to the draft NAPA framework.</p>
<p>The JPND <strong>healthcare and social care research goal</strong> identifies the major disconnect between health and social care systems and proposes research activities that may address the gap. Priority activities planned include coordinated studies to validate social care interventions, evaluation of pathways to treatment and support and their effectiveness, the effects of co-morbidity in dementia care and the study of assistive technologies.</p>
<p>The JPND <strong>treatments and prevention goal</strong> includes a set of activities to examine psychosocial interventions and some population health activities, with a significant public health element of the strategic research agenda is using the planned European Health Examination Study to provide new Europe-wide data on the prevalence of people with early cognitive difficulties. This could be cross-walked with the CDC work on surveillance and compared to the ongoing effort adding cognitive questions to other population health studies such as NHANES, which could to lead to better understanding of population risk factors and the challenges of co-morbid chronic conditions existing with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinated Prevention and Risk Reduction Studies </strong></p>
<p>We would encourage the NAPA planners to begin to think about Alzheimer's disease as the fifth non-communicable disease, and to take advantage of growing evidence that demonstrates that some of the risk of Alzheimer's and dementia is modifiable, with many of the same risk factors as the other major NCDs.</p>
<p>We support additional careful study and our members are careful not to say "prevention of Alzheimer's" but there is sound science on risk reduction and several more large European dementia prevention studies are targeting cardio-vascular and lifestyle related risk factors which will report in 2012 and 2013. These are:</p>
<ul><li>The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER)</li>
<li>The Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care (PreDIVA)</li>
<li>The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT)</li>
<li>The European Dementia Prevention Initiative is a new (2011) convening body of many of these collaborators. (<a href="http://www.edpi.org">http://www.edpi.org</a>)</li>
</ul><p>10/66 Dementia Research Group</p>
<p>The <strong>10/66 Dementia Research Group</strong> is a collective of researchers carrying out population-based research on dementia, non-communicable diseases and ageing in low and middle income countries 10/66 is a part of Alzheimer's Disease International, and is coordinated by the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. All protocols, survey instruments, and de-personalised 10/66 study datasets are available for secondary data analyses, subject to scientific and ethical review. The group has run carer intervention trials as well as validated measures for dementia identification in low resource countries, both of which might find application in the US with cultural or ethnic minorities.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments on Draft Framework of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the Draft Framework of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. AstraZeneca is a global innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets prescription medicines that treat the world's most serious illnesses. For decades our scientists have been researching methods to support early diagnosis, stop or slow disease progression, and to alleviate the debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Dementia research is challenging, and subsequently many pharmaceutical companies have discontinued investment in this area. AstraZeneca remains committed to neuroscience research and has adopted a more flexible R&amp;D model to fully optimize external research partnerships and expertise. In 2012 we announced that our global Neuroscience Innovative Medicines Unit will be headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>We applaud the government's commitment to strengthen public funding for Alzheimer's disease research thereby accelerating scientific advancement leading to new effective treatments. We support the broader initiative to engage public and private stakeholders around common goals and objectives to optimize existing activity and facilitate public-private sector collaboration. We have a global approach to medicines development and welcome the National Plan's proposal of international collaboration with other countries actively engaging in dementia research.</p>
<p>Disease modifying treatments will remain elusive unless we continue to research the underpinnings of the disease. New genetic, molecular, and cellular targets, beyond recent advances in beta-amyloid, are needed for future pharmaceutical interventions. Ongoing identification, validation, and endorsement of biomarkers enable clinical studies and help demonstrate disease modification. All at-risk patients will benefit from early detection and prevention if diagnostic capabilities are improved and a clear framework to bring effective treatments for this debilitating disease is established. The success of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the C-Path Institute Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) clearly demonstrate the positive impact public and private sector coordination can have in the development of new treatments for Alzheimer's. AstraZeneca encourages DHHS to continue this spirit of collaboration by including all appropriate stakeholders, including industry, in the overall planning process aimed at minimizing Alzheimer's Disease as a health burden by 2025.</p>
<p>We look forward to working with HHS to pave the way for innovation in Alzheimer's disease treatment and management. Please do not hesitate to contact Alice Pomponio if we can be of further assistance.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Inter-Agency Working Group of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for developing a solid first draft of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, a draft that includes goals and actions dealing with the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. LEAD is pleased that a number of priority recommendations previously submitted by the coalition are included in the draft plan.</p>
<p>Organizations from all segments of the Alzheimer's-serving community participated in developing these comments, including non-profits and for-profits, research-oriented and care-oriented, academic and advocacy, among others. LEAD believes strongly that achievement of the goals of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025 and improving the quality of care and of life of Alzheimer's victims and their families will require an National Alzheimer's Team using an 'all hands on deck' approach. LEAD and its participating organizations are prepared to step up as a full member of that Team.</p>
<p>Attached please find LEAD's comments on the first draft of the National Plan. We have organized our comments in the categories of research and drug discovery, clinical care, and long-term care support and services. We hope the Secretary will give strong consideration to including these recommendations in the final National Plan.</p>
<p>Comments provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals, strategies, and actions within the draft plan. As noted in earlier comments, LEAD believes that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private, and non-profit sectors. It is imperative that the actions within the national plan be monitored and tracked to assess the impact of the action steps as well as progress toward the Plan's goals. While we are pleased that HHS will evaluate the data and infrastructure required for implementation of the plan, it is important that there is a model for assessing the impact that strategies within the national plan have on progress toward the desired goals. To that end, LEAD recommends that immediate action be taken to develop a model this year that will allow HHS to accurately assess the impact of the action steps in the national plan and identify areas for course adjustments. We, as a nation, should not pursue implementation steps that are not clearly moving toward our goals. We cannot waste time and resources going down blind alleys. In that regard we recommend that each goal and strategy set forth in the final national plan include a budget, clear milestones and quantifiable metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>LEAD members have also identified a set of other actions within the draft plan that should be implemented immediately, without the need for a national plan. These include activities that are already being undertaken or that leverage current resources and materials. Many of these actions are critical to the success of implementing long-term goals and strategies. Specifically they include disseminating existing tools and guidelines to help healthcare professionals diagnose and care for people with Alzheimer's and their families, as well as expansion of successful interventions that are already proven to improve quality of life for people with Alzheimer's. These actions are highlighted at the end of each section of comments.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established three workgroups -- one each in the areas of research and drug development, clinical care and long-term care support and services -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the entire Alzheimer's-serving community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD fully supports this bold goal, with the hope that the goal can be achieved even more rapidly with the right plan and resource commitment. And LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has included a number of recommendations submitted by the coalition under Goal 1. Specifically we are pleased that the Advisory Council recommends a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on "the most promising pharmacological interventions" as well as accelerating efforts to "identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease." In addition, we are pleased that there is greater emphasis on international coordination and collaboration with commercial and nonprofit partners. However, it is imperative that any goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease include research investments in non-pharmacological treatments. Non-pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's treatment can improve relevant outcomes including improved behavior and delay of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's comments and recommendations for Goal 1 of the draft National Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong><br />
					Strategies to expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease should reference the very significant contribution that will be made by industry in conducting clinical trials. Strategies should build on the infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new agents for trials and their existing working relationships with regulators to ensure that safe and effective medicines get approved. Strategies should include a statement of what each Federal and industry partner can contribute and where the cost and time of the clinical trial process can be reduced consistent with standards of safety and efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong><br />
					To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry, and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a large-scale, open-source patient registry of subjects that can be approached for recruitment in prevention trials, including specifically under-represented ethnic and other sub-populations. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong><br />
					With the levels of funding now dedicated by government, academia, and industry to Alzheimer's disease research, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of all partners and resources -- and make the best use of the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. Studies need to be adequately powered, with agents that effectively test mechanisms of action, produce clear evidence of brain target engagement, and really help to advance the state of knowledge. Private industry is ready to support the 2025 goal and should be engaged as a full and equal partner with government and the research community in its achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include consideration of a uniform patient consent and centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB) to review all multi-center Alzheimer's disease trials to decrease the time for trial start-up and protocol amendments.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong><br />
					Public-Private Partnerships provide an opportunity to overcome many of the challenges associated with taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Many Public Private Partnerships exist around Alzheimer's disease and have helped to overcome barriers to research and drug development. Such partnerships include: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Coalition Against Major Diseases, FNIH Biomarkers Consortium and the Alliance for Aging Research's ACT-AD Coalition.</p>
<p>LEAD recommends increased support for these partnerships as they seek to establish publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification. Further as additional data gaps are identified, pre-competitive partnership collaborations can accelerate the pathway toward development of Alzheimer's disease modifying therapies.</p>
<p>New models of Public-Private Partnership cooperation and funding are needed, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations, collaborative platforms, and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such Alzheimer's partnerships could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because these partnerships rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided through multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation</em></strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the final plan includes a process for developing a standardized informed consent to allow participants in clinical trials to authorize their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study in order to advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger Alzheimer's disease databases to allow data mining and to increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, HIPPA, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop data standards to ensure a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data</em>.</strong><br />
					The National Plan should encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Using these standards will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA and EMA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data, including data in failed trials, data with respect to dormant drugs, and data rich in biomarker information, should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that all findings from the May research summit be shared with the public for comment and that "strategies and milestones for an ambitious plan to slow progression, delay onset, and prevent Alzheimer's disease" be established within six months of the summit to ensure continued momentum and coordination with the National Plan. LEAD recommends that continuing research summits be conducted every other year in order to monitor progress and adjust priorities in light of funding conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.2: Solicit public and private input on Alzheimer's disease research priorities</strong><br />
					The NIA should issue an RFI within six months of the summit as noted above and information be captured and evaluated and considered as the NIA develops priorities for future years.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene representatives from across the federal government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to create an action plan for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the building of registries.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft plan includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis, and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the draft plan will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans requiring care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are comments from LEAD regarding the draft plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong><br />
					Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides, and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in public and private hospital settings. Additionally, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>In addition to educating healthcare providers, LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this action be combined with Action 2.D.1 "Explore dementia care guidelines and measures." Both recommendations require input from experts to develop dementia-specific guidelines for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong><br />
					LEAD applauds the efforts to strengthen state aging workforces that are "capable and culturally competent" through the Administration on Aging (AOA). While implementing this action, it is important that efforts to improve state strategies do not further burden states' abilities to apply for and utilize funds from AoA. States should maintain flexibility to implement strategies that address the unique needs of the state populations through their state infrastructures.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated about palliative and hospice care by healthcare professionals. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</strong><br />
					The Advisory Council should consider merging Action2.D.1 with Action 2.A.3, which calls for the dissemination of "dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum." Both Actions require the convening of an expert panel to develop dementia care guidelines for care providers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong><br />
					To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the draft Plan should consider the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such centers would also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure people with Alzheimer's disease and their families have access to new Alzheimer's therapies</em></strong><br />
					As biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented. This will be particularly important as CMS improves upon the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of Medicare. Due to the absence of any current spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, ACO's may be "penalized" for providing a new treatment to patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse those new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Primary Care Doctors, Geriatricians, Geriatric Psychiatrists and Neurologists should be adequately reimbursed for patient care and the evaluation of cognitive function including psychometrics and caregiver education and counseling</em></strong>.<br />
					Unless doctors are appropriately reimbursed, the complex needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease will not be addressed. Anticipatory care planning and comprehensive treatment management in a setting where transitions and treatable concomitants of Alzheimer's disease are understood will result in better care. Such practices may delay the onset and progression of disabling clinical symptoms, and allow meaningful function, reduce healthcare costs, and improve the quality of life for individuals with the disease and their family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop Quality Care Measures for People with Alzheimer's and their Family</em></strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop Alzheimer's disease specific quality care measures. Information on these measures should be captured through the use of Health IT tools to track care quality and outcomes.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop guidelines that can be provided to provider groups.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</strong><br />
					Similar to Action 2.A.3 HHS should quickly convene a panel of experts to develop consensus for appropriate assessment tools and identify strategies for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					HHS should compile an inventory of tools to assist caregivers from federal and state agencies as well as patient advocacy organizations and make these tools readily available within the next year through the state aging networks.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong><br />
					HHS should convene stakeholders to develop guidelines for hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's and disseminate guidelines through national associations and hospital systems.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds the draft plan for including goals and strategies that will improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that the plan includes recommendations from LEAD to expand proven programs that are in place at the federal, state and local levels that provide adequate care and support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families. Moving forward it is important that the plan provide adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.3: Utilize informatics for caregivers and persons with AD</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the word "informatics" in the title of this Action be changed to "Health IT" to be consistent with the accompanying language. Identifying and capturing information about caregivers, in particular family caregivers, by health IT applications will help to better coordinate care of both the person with Alzheimer's or other dementias and the caregiver. Capturing information about the health of family caregivers on medical records has an added benefit of supplying data for metrics that can be used to track the impact of programs on both family caregivers and their care recipients. Data would allow for the comparison of patients with and without family caregivers as well as track health impacts on family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include identifying interventions that are successful in improving the health and wellness of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Many successful evidence based programs have been proven to work for both people with Alzheimer's and other dementias so it is important that the evaluation of such programs is not limited to only Alzheimer's specific interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include the evaluation of innovative interventions aimed at helping people with Alzheimer's and other dementias remain in the community rather than in long term care or other institutional settings.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure adequate resources for programs and services supported by AoA's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP)</em></strong><br />
					ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve Goal 3 in the Draft Plan, funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families at the community level.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Include services for mental and behavioral health services</em></strong><br />
					Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of needed health services available to individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with these individuals, their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of effective behavioral and mental health interventions.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.1: Identify culturally sensitive materials and training</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene an expert panel to develop an inventory of culturally sensitive materials and trainings available and identify gaps that should be filled by government and patient advocacy organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong><br />
					Utilizing its current inventory of federal agency programs and materials, HHS should make these resources readily available to all caregivers through the state aging programs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a meeting of partner organizations to identify successful evidence based interventions by community based organizations and quickly work to ensure that more people with Alzheimer's and their families have access to successful programs as identified in Action 3.B.4. There are already programs exist that LEAD recommends that HHS should expand as part of this effort:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.B.6: Share lessons learned through VA caregiver support strategies with federal partners</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the quarterly meetings identified in this action step commence as soon as possible so that important information is gathered and shared among federal programs and with community based providers.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress </strong></p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Establish a coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's disease care, research, and education within the federal government</em></strong><br />
					LEAD members strongly recommended that there be a permanent office or other coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's care, research, and education within the federal government. An office in the White House, like that established for HIV/AIDS, would be in a position to coordinate efforts across HHS, DOD and the VA as well as the Departments of Treasury and State and the Office of Management and Budget, in order to assure comprehensive coordination of a national and international effort to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's by 2025. Section 2c of the National Alzheimer's Project Act lays the groundwork for a coordinating function with HHS itself by establishing in the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services that:</p>
<ol><li>the Secretary or the Secretary's designee be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's; (and)</li>
<li>Provide information and coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies.</li>
</ol><p>Both the Act itself and those volunteering their time and expertise on the Advisory Council, its work groups, and those assembled by supporting private entities such as LEAD, have envisioned a lasting presence to drive and coordinate Federal and private efforts to defeat Alzheimer's. We recommend that a permanent role be established within the White House as well as in the Office of the Secretary of HHS at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level as National Coordinators of Alzheimer's Plan Implementation. These individuals will be responsible not only for reporting on the progress of the National Plan as provided by the National Alzheimer's Project Act, but also for driving forward aggressive coordination and rationalization of Federal resources with private and global efforts to defeat Alzheimer's by 2025.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Project Act, with bi-partisan support from the Congress, places the responsibility for this function with the office of the Secretary of HHS. A separate person within that office reporting to the Secretary may have a "bully pulpit" but would not have the administrative apparatus to function effectively. Ideally, this role would fall to an official whose full time job is pursuing an end to Alzheimer's in as highly placed a position as possible.</p>
<p>Similarly, locating this HHS responsibility elsewhere within HHS could dilute its importance. The National Institutes of Health, for example, focus on research, not care or education. The Administration on Aging focuses on care and education, not research.</p>
<p>The office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation has begun the implementation of the Plan efficiently and in good time. The professional staff has the institutional knowledge and, all indications are, commitment to the Plan to move it forward. What remains is the appointment of an individual within that office and at the level of a deputy assistant secretary whose full time responsibility is to fulfill the aspirations of the Act, the Advisory Council, Congress, and others who support it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Data Standards</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The Problem </strong></em><br />
					One of the inefficiencies in clinical trials is that data collected by different pharmaceutical companies as well as academic research sites is highly variable. The wealth of data from research holds great potential to advance scientific and regulatory work, but the lack of standardized data creates significant challenges. Variable data can impede a FDA reviewer's ability to perform integral tasks such as rapid acquisition, analysis, storage and reporting of regulatory data. Improved data quality, accessibility and predictability will give reviewers more time to carry out complex analyses, ask in-depth questions and increase review consistency. <a href="http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf">http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf</a> -</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Both FDA CDER and CBER are encouraging the use of data standards by industry into an accepted format such as that created by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) or Health Level Seven International (HL7). <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm">http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm</a> <a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm">http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm</a></p>
<p>Another potential for use of standardized data is the ability to create larger databases from smaller clinical trials and increase statistical power. Collecting AD data into large databases that can be mined will enable improved clinical trial design and patient selection for research, qualification of biomarkers for use in research, and decisions on the effects of novel therapeutics. An example of how a large database built on pooled AD data can contribute to the knowledge base is the use of modeling and simulation to provide a quantitative model of AD progression as performed by the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD). Indeed, opportunities afforded by AD data standards and data sharing have the potential to reduce costs of clinical trials and accelerate the translation of research into new therapies for the millions of patients and their loved ones affected by Alzheimer's Disease. Making data publically available allows more scientific investigators to perform AD research and provide new insights. A public database can increase collaboration and initiative from multi-disciplinary experts.</p>
<p>Medical research data on Alzheimer's patients should be collected in uniform data standards that are the same if the studies are done in San Francisco, Shanghai or Sydney.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br /><strong>AD Data Standards</strong><br />
					Require or strongly encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored AD clinical trials to use the same AD CDISC data standards to facilitate data sharing and regulatory authority (FDA and EMA) review.</p>
<p>Remap data AD clinical trial data rich in biomarker data, as ADNI and ADCS, to the same common AD CDISC data standards.</p>
<p>Develop common data standards and measurements for questionnaires that assess cognition and functional status. Engage copyright holders of AD questionnaires to allow an additional layer to capture recording of these instruments into AD CDISC data standards.</p>
<p>Foster the development of standardization of methods for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes and establish a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards.</p>
<p>Post data from federally-funded and industry sponsored AD clinical trials and recorded in AD CDISC data standards into a common AD database (as the CAMD database) available for qualified research use. Include data from placebo and if possible, active intervention arms</p>
<p>Promote the use of AD data standards in clinical practice/ Electronic Health Records (EHR) to collect data seamlessly that can be aggregated and analyzed for research.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Common informed consent form for AD clinical studies</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					The final report of the Alzheimer's Study Group emphasized that patients are critical contributors to clinical development. There was a call for patients to be made aware that they can speed the search for new treatments by enrolling in clinical trials, contributing tissue samples, and allowing the use of their medical records for research. Human subjects, research funding, and time are all in limited supply. Clinical research on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) must develop methods to assure that resources are used wisely and strategically. The informed consent form is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a single study and specific purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data are essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. Even though data sharing is a requirement in NIH funded studies, misunderstandings and overly restrictive consent forms restrict access to data collected under NIH funding and industry clinical trials as well.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Obtaining de-identified data from AD clinical trials, multicenter and single site studies, and pooling these data to build large databases is a critical step in providing the necessary research infrastructure to gain an understanding of a disease as complex as Alzheimer's and to examine significant scientific issues such as biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong><br />
					We recommend a mechanism to let Alzheimer's patients allow their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study and that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger AD databases to allow datamining and increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of AD, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p>The National Health Council has conducted surveys and issued reports such as the Electronic Health Information Exchange: A Live Strong Report describing that "87 percent of patients strongly agree that EHR should provide patients with a way to share their medical information with scientists doing research -- as long as the information cannot be linked to them personally."</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Making the case for Public Private Partnerships for NAPA</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					A crisis in medicine today is that there are increasing investments in biomedical research but decreasing numbers of new medical products, especially drugs, that obtain FDA approval and are available to patients.<sup>1, 2</sup> In order to respond to this crisis, the field of drug development is undergoing transformational changes.</p>
<p>Taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product that finally reaches patients faces overwhelming challenges including the long length of research, high rate of failures of potential candidates and enormous costs. This research and development process is so difficult it is called the "Valley of Death." As many as 80-95% of promising drug candidates fail.<sup>3, 4</sup> Drug companies will spend tens of thousands to perform research on millions of compounds and spend in excess of a billion dollars over a 10- to 20-year period just to have one drug reach patients.<sup>5</sup> A pressing example is Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for which diagnosis is difficult and there are only a few FDA approved treatments to temporarily slow the disease but no cure, at a time when this debilitating disease is exploding in the aging population. In fact, the pace for development and FDA approval of Central Nervous System (CNS) drugs is even longer than other drug classes.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>These challenges mean that companies have to be smarter and more efficient in managing drug discovery and development. Innovation is needed to create greater efficiencies to help move therapies through development, review and approval for patient use. John Castellani, President PhRMA, stated that "The regulatory process is a strategic priority that if done right can reduce time, cost and uncertainty in drug development."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong>:<br />
					Increasingly, public private partnerships (PPP) are presenting an opportunity to meet these challenges. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Innovation comes from focusing on science that can improve the process of drug development and be applied to regulatory decisions. Efficiencies come from building collaborations and sharing.</p>
<p>The flagship success of PPPs in AD is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (<strong>ADNI1</strong>), a $60 million, 5-year study to test whether imaging and biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments could measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Begun by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and supported by other federal agencies, private-sector companies and organizations, the ADNI1 investment would have been prohibitive for a single stakeholder. However, ADNI1 has transformed the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD. Additionally, many other PPPs are having an impact in AD, some of which are described below:</p>
<p><strong>ADNI2</strong>: Approximately 1,000 people aged 55 to 90 will be followed with imaging and biomarker measures to identify who is at risk for AD, track progression, and devise tests to measure the effectiveness of potential interventions. This ~ $60 million study is funded by NIH and companies.</p>
<p><strong>FNIH Biomarkers Consortium</strong>: One project is the first part of a multi-phased effort to utilize ADNI samples to construct multiplex panels in plasma and CSF to diagnose patients with AD and monitor disease progression.</p>
<p><strong>Alliance for Aging Research</strong>: The Alliance initiated Accelerate Cure/Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease, a coalition of national organizations representing patients, providers, caregivers, consumers, older Americans, researchers, employers, and health care industries seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for AD.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association Global Standardization</strong>: This organization is leading global efforts to standardize Alzheimer's biomarkers with the World Wide AD Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) and the Alzheimer's Association Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Quality Control Program.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable</strong>: Members facilitate the development and implementation of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease by collectively addressing obstacles to research and development, clinical care and public health education.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Path Institute's Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD)</strong>: CAMD accelerates the development of therapies for AD by advancing drug development tools for regulatory approval. CAMD developed AD data standards with CDISC, a pooled clinical trial database with 6,000 patients, and a clinical disease progression model. CAMD obtained regulatory approval for imaging biomarkers from the EMA and is collaborating with the FDA on CSF and imaging biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Path Institute's Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium</strong>: A workgroup is developing and evaluating a PRO instrument on MCI for use in clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new AD drugs.</p>
<p><strong>IMI PharmaCog</strong>: The five-year €20M PharmaCog project, funded under the European Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI), will provide tools to define the potential of a drug candidate, reduce the development time of new drugs and thus accelerate the approvals of promising new medicines.</p>
<p>While the impact of these PPPs is extensive, there are still significant challenges and opportunities for preventing and treating AD. One challenge is in the regulatory arena. For approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company engages exclusively with the regulatory agency and all information within the drug approval process is proprietary. Lessons learned from one AD drug trial are not shared, so any insights on why drugs fail or how particular biomarkers track with disease progression are lost. However, in recognizing the need for change, the FDA established an innovative approach in the Critical Path Initiative. The FDA formalized a process for submitting tools as biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments to be "qualified" for specific uses in supporting drug development.<sup>7</sup> Tools that receive a designation of "fit for use" from the FDA's qualification process8 can then be widely shared.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br />
					Providing the extensive evidence needed for qualification of tools by regulatory authorities can optimally be carried out through public-private partnerships. PPPs can support publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification.</p>
<p>The challenge then becomes funding PPPs that move products toward regulatory approval. The cost of qualification for a single biomarker is several million dollars over a time frame of up to 5 years. Such costs require significant investment by both public and private sectors and in-kind contributions in order to be successful. However, the end product is a tool that FDA can have confidence in to produce better data and be used by all drug companies in clinical trials. The result benefits all stakeholders, including patients.</p>
<p>Since not all PPPs conduct research as ADNI does, there needs to be new models of PPP funding, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such an AD PPP could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because PPPs rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided by a multi-stakeholder board to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>

<p>We believe that the five goals outlined in the plan which form the foundation of the National Plan is well formulated and seeks to offer a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. In comparing the National Plan to the most recent work of the three Sub-Committees, we felt the need to underscore a role for arts and aging research.</p>
<p>While our ultimate goal is a world without Alzheimer's, we recognize those living with the disease today and tomorrow will require the best possible care we can offer. We are concerned that the ultimate research agenda will be too narrow in scope and leave research relative to care practices as a back-burner issue, instead of integrated as a significant component.</p>
<p>Among the areas in NAPA that arts programming could be especially effective include educating family and the public about the disease and under lessening the stigma of the disease. A number of arts groups including the Alzheimer's Poetry Project have this effect when we hold workshops for family members and students. Our public arts events such as "Alzheimer's Poetry Day" held at among other locations, the National Hispanic Cultural Center held in Albuquerque, New Mexico on November 5th 2011 in English and Spanish is one such example.</p>
<p>A few arts programs serving people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia and their families, that have extensive experience in helping to educate caregivers and in demonstrating the role that creativity can play in the health of people navigating memory loss, that have show promise in research studies include:</p>
<ul><li>"Meet Me at MoMA," The Museum of Modern Arts dementia program.</li>
<li>"Time Slips," a Storytelling project with people with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</li>
<li>SONGWRITING WORKS., which engages elders, older adults and families in hands- on songwriting and performance using an internationally recognized method proven to restore health and community.</li>
<li>"The Dancing Heart," Kairos Dance, which vitally engages those with mid-to-late stage Alzheimer's, in a weekly dance and storytelling playshop that has shown to positively improve the health of participants.</li>
</ul><p>One agency missing from the list of participating inter-agency departments and government agencies tasked to help support the development of the national plan is the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). Recently, this agency partnered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in creating the white paper "The Arts and Human Development: Learning across the Lifespan," which frames a national research agenda for the arts, health and well-being. We recommend that the NEA have an opportunity to weigh in and support efforts in creating NAPA.</p>
<p>In the NEA, "Creativity and Aging Study The Impact of Professionally Conducted Cultural Programs on Older Adults," 2006 they write, "...In conclusion, these results point to powerful positive intervention effects of these community-based art programs run by professional artists. They point to true health promotion and disease prevention effects."</p>
<p>In addition, we would like to bring to your attention to two among many studies that show the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions in improving the health and quality of life for people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia including: "Singing while caring for persons with dementia<sup>1</sup>," and "Using poetry to improve the quality of life and care for people with dementia.<sup>2</sup>"</p>
<p>We must ask our selves what immediate help can we provide to people living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and how can we help them to continue to actively participate in the life of a community. Arts based dementia programming offers a chance to improve the quality of life of people living with dementia and their caregivers today. Thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts and recommendations.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>On behalf of the Pennsylvania Department of Aging, I am respectively submitting comments on the Draft National Plan (Plan) to Address Alzheimer's Disease. In general, I believe the Plan is well timed, comprehensive, and ambitious and our Department supports the Plan. Accomplishing the Plan goals will require collaboration with many different service systems, and the Department of Health &amp; Human Services will likely face challenges in coordinating efforts across these systems.</p>
<p>While achieving the vision of eliminating Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by 2025 is the ultimate goal, the immediate need is appropriate care for those with AD and relief for caregivers. Further, research needs to be expanded into areas that are supportive to caregiving. The Plan should also address the issues and propose solutions of excess deficits that cause unneeded anguish to both the person with dementia and their formal and information caregivers.</p>
<p>Because of the scope and complexity of needs of those with dementia, I believe it is helpful to prioritize those areas of need. First and foremost, there is a wealth of knowledge that enables clinicians to diagnose and treat persons with memory disorders. However, the greatest need is gavubg adequately trained physicians to diagnose and provide care for dementia residents. This issue isn't new; it has been known for the past 10 years. With only 7,162 trained geriatricians in the country or one geriatrician for every 2,620 residents over 75 years of age, there isn't an adequate supply of geriatricians to provide geriatric educational needs among the US medical schools.</p>
<p>There is discussion in the draft plan about the need to expand and prioritize research aimed at developing new pharmacological interventions for preventing and treating Alzheimer's Disease. There is also some mention about reducing the use of antipsychotic medications for treating the symptoms of AD in institutional settings. Both of these action items are laudable. What is missing is a recommendation to reduce the current widespread, wasteful and in some cases harmful, overuse and misuse of the cholinesterase inhibitors and related combination therapies in treating AD. Practice guidelines for cost effective and efficacious pharmacological interventions in the treatment of AD are available but not widely adhered to.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, there discussions are currently being held about the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System. Numbers of people are not now being identified; therefore a module asking respondents if someone in their home has dementia and the follow-ups would greatly help us identify the numbers outside of proper care, care-home settings, etc., that currently suffer dementias.</p>
<p>For your consideration, together with the above general recommendations, I respectively offer more specific comments. For example, although the Plan makes mention of emergency rooms, there needs to be "best practice" models that are shared with the thousands of hospital emergency rooms in the US. In addition, I propose these suggestions on specific goals, strategies, and actions:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.E</strong>: This priority deals with translating findings into medical practice and public health programs. There should be a separate action item that addresses the shortcomings in the current pharmacological treatment of AD and guidance to prescribers on how to remedy this problem.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1</strong>: This priority is not just important, it is essential if we expect to slow progress, delay onset and prevent AD. It needs to be a collaborative effort that is international in scope (Strategy 1.D) with high level commitment and energy that includes public and private resources and their networks interconnected. Money for research alone will not achieve what is needed. We need to look at past models of disease threats like tuberculosis, polio and HIV that had a grass roots demand for a cure.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3</strong>: This is also essential; we need some fast "wins" through medical research that energize the world-wide community committed to eliminating dementia illnesses. And, in addition to expanding the enrollment of all racial and ethnic populations, we need to have several drug investigations on an urgent fast-track that not only give people hope but the belief that we are doing everything possible to get these issues under control.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.3</strong>: ADEAR (Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral) needs to be a more widespread publically funded resource; there needs to be, for example, posters advertising it in post offices, libraries, and other public spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2</strong>: The lack of adequately trained providers is addressed by dedicating "6 million dollars over two years for provider education and outreach." This is a limited amount of money to fix the national issue of solving the access to care issue with competent geriatricians. Further, there needs to be expanded roles for Advance Practice Registered Nurses in geriatric care.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A</strong>: This strategy has a direct connection to PDA programs. PDA has done some work through the Long-Term Living Training Institute and Direct-Care Worker initiatives around educating and strengthening the direct care workforce to ensure workers are dementia-capable. PDA would welcome additional support in this area.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.4</strong>: PDA supports this action and sees the need for additional resources to train more direct workers in nursing homes and professionals that provide services in home and community based settings. PDA has provided funding to the Delaware Valley Alzheimer's Association to provide dementia specific training to those professionals that provide in-home care. The training is designed to improve care techniques that can be directly applied to day-to-day care in the home which can reduce the stress and burden on both professionals and family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies 2.C and 3.B</strong>: Contained in Pennsylvania's assessment for services for older adults is a 24-question assessment of caregiver status and needs. PDA would be interested to learn what other states are using and their best practices in terms of caregiver assessment instruments.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.H</strong>: PDA supports this action and sees the need for additional resources to improve care for certain populations, specifically those with intellectual disabilities. PDA currently co-chairs the Joint Committee on Aging &amp; Intellectual Disabilities (ID) with the Office of Developmental Programs. The committee was formed to improve services and supports available to older persons with ID by working together through interagency coordination and collaboration. As the number of people aging with ID continues to grow, education for both professionals and caregivers along with proper supports should be a focus and be given special consideration to ensure the proper care for this population.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.E</strong>: PDA supports this action and sees a great need for increased housing options for individuals with AD. Affordable, safe housing is a special problem during the early to middle stages of the disease for individuals who live alone and do not have informal caregivers to provide support.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies 4.A and 4.B</strong>: Public awareness campaigns and pooling/compiling resources should be organized around a single, nationally recognized association/entity related to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In conclusion, some components of the Plan have a direct connection to PDA programs, such as support of caregivers and enhancing the knowledge of direct care workers. Other components of the Plan such as methods for diagnosis, direct treatment, and research, do not have a direct connection to our programs. However, as I stated above, our Department supports the Plan and, while recognizing that there is no one quick, easy solution to dealing with such wide, complex needs, I feel my comments and suggestions are important for improving the Plan and thereby improving the lives of those with Alzheimer's Disease and their families and caregivers.</p>
<p>I thank you for the opportunity to provide input and look forward to hearing from you regarding my comments.</p>

<p>The American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) is the national professional association representing the interests of more than 140,000 occupational therapists, students of occupational therapy, and therapy assistants. The practice of occupational therapy is sciencedriven, evidence-based, and enables people of all ages to live life to its fullest by promoting health and minimizing the functional effects of illness, injury, and disability. Occupational therapy practitioners do important work with individuals who have Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their families, and AOTA appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as it works to implement the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA).</p>
<p><strong>Occupational Therapy and Alzheimer's Disease </strong></p>
<p>Five goals form the foundation of the Draft National Plan: (1) Prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025, (2) Optimize care quality and efficiency, (3) Expand supports for people with AD and their families, (4) enhance public awareness and engagement, and (5) track progress and drive improvement. AOTA sees the profession of occupational therapy as a key partner in each of these five areas. Occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants work with individuals who have AD and with their families to maximize occupational engagement, promote safety, and enhance quality of life. A variety of skilled techniques are used when working with an individual who has AD, depending on the focus of the intervention, the stage of the disease process, and the treatment setting.</p>
<p>An occupational therapist's evaluation of a person with AD begins with an occupational profile of the individual's valued occupations, roles and routines, as well as his or her current level of occupational performance. Often the caregiver is crucial in supplying this information as the person with AD may be unable to provide accurate information, or may be unaware of his or her own deficits. It is essential to identify the remaining abilities of the person with AD rather than to focus solely on what he or she can no longer do. Some examples include:</p>
<ul><li>Identifying performance patterns (i.e., habits and routines) that can be maintained which will prolong independence and assist with adjustment to new living settings such as a health care facility or a daughter's home. Practitioners also consider information stored in the patient's procedural memory, which often remains stable for the longest period of time in someone with AD. Performing well-learned basic activities of daily living (ADLs), such as combing one's hair, is an example of utilizing procedural memory. Practitioners learn what the client's hobbies and occupations are which will help with planning the intervention to stimulate patient interest and active participation.</li>
<li>Determining what type of cueing strategies the individual best responds to, and instructing staff on how and when to utilize these strategies during various activity demands. (E.g., does the patient require a one-step verbal command or does he or she need tactile cueing in addition to verbal cues? Can the client follow multi-step commands?)</li>
<li>Determining the time of the day that the person is most alert to maximize performance with activities. (E.g., if the client's typical routine pre-illness was working at night and sleeping during the daytime, then changing that routine may be challenging. The optimal time for engagement in activity may be late afternoons.)</li>
</ul><p>Other areas of consideration include accompanying conditions such as visual loss, or hearing loss. Education of the caregiver (e.g., family or facility staff or both) is a priority and expertise of occupational therapy practitioners, and the therapist should include identification of caregiver concerns about occupational performance and handling difficult behaviors as part of the evaluation. <em>See</em> attachments 1 and 2.</p>
<p>For a person in the early stage of AD, occupational therapy intervention may focus more on compensation for the loss of cognitive abilities and recognition of remaining abilities rather than on the remediation of deficit areas. This is helpful since new learning may be impaired or absent as the dementia progresses.</p>
<p>For persons in the later stages of the disease, the intervention focus may become adaptation of the environment and instruction of caregivers to promote continued occupational performance, as well as learning ways to minimize any unwanted behaviors (such as agitation, combativeness during caretaking) or complicating conditions (such as weight loss, or falls). Addressing the safety of the person with AD is paramount.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of occupational therapy intervention for someone with AD is to set up a program to promote independence, participation in the community, utilize retained abilities for as long as possible, ensure safety, and enhance quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat AD by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>In the absence of a cure, this goal seeks to develop effective prevention and treatment modalities by 2025. Toward this end, HHS proposes to convene an AD research summit with national and international scientists (Action 1.A.1) and convene a scientific workshop on other dementias in 2013 (Action 1.A.4). AOTA asks that you include occupational therapy in these events. HHS also plans to solicit public and private input on AD research priorities (Action 1.A.2) and continue clinical trials on the most promising lifestyle interventions (Action 1.B.6). In these areas, AOTA asks HHS not to neglect research on effective treatment, education, and support for caregivers and to study lifestyle interventions for caregivers</p>
<p>Outreach efforts to more effectively inform the public about research findings and results are also planned, and AOTA reminds the department to take advantage of using professional associations to educate members and providers (Action 1.E.3).</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Optimize Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>HHS recognizes that high-quality care for people with AD requires an adequate supply of qualified, culturally-competent professionals with appropriate skills and expertise. AOTA notes that the Draft Plan places the bulk of its emphasis on physician providers, when patients will be seeing many other allied health care professionals in the new health care system. It is the nonphysician practitioners, such as occupational therapists, who provide most of the support for patients with AD and certainly their caregivers. The $6 million dollar investment of the Obama Administration for provider education and outreach should include specialized training for occupational therapy, and other efforts by both the Veteran's Administration (VA) and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) should include support not only for physicians and nurses, but other qualified and licensed professionals (Strategy 2.A.2).</p>
<p>As far as dementia-specific work (Action 2.A.3; 2.D.1), occupational therapy has a proven track record in caring for patients with dementia and is working with the American Medical Association (AMA) --convened Physician's Consortium for Performance Improvement (PCPI) to develop and manage quality measures for dementia. <em>See</em> Gitlin, L. N., Winter, L., Dennis, M. P., Hodgson, N., &amp; Hauck, W. W. (2010). A biobehavioral home-based intervention and the well-being of patients with dementia and their caregivers. <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em> 30(9), 983--991; Strzalecki, M. (2010). The dementia care difference. <em>OT Practice</em> 15(12), available: <a href="http://www.aota.org/Pubs/OTP/2010/OTP071210.aspx">http://www.aota.org/Pubs/OTP/2010/OTP071210.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>In examining improved care transitions through Medicare's Community-Based Care Transitions Program and the Aging and Disabilities Resource Center (ADRC) Evidence-Based Care Transitions Program (Action 2.F.2), AOTA reminds decision-makers that occupational therapy has an established role in discharge planning, home evaluation, safety, and caregiving training that is an asset in these areas.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with AD and their Families </strong></p>
<p>This third goal acknowledges the important role that caregivers plan in the life of a person with AD: they provide care and support, help lessen feelings of depression and stress, and help delay nursing home placements. To further support caregivers, HHS plans to partners with private organizations to review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations (Action 3.B.3). Occupational therapy should be part of these private-public partnerships.</p>
<p>HHS has also noted that medications, including anti-psychotic drugs, can be used inappropriately to manage the difficult behaviors of nursing home residents who have AD. Occupational therapy practitioners would like to be part of collaborative efforts to reduce inappropriate and off-label use of behavior modifying drugs and agents. AOTA encourages the use of occupational therapy interventions to address inappropriate behaviors without the use of pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>In order to further its goal of enhancing public understanding of AD and engagement stakeholders who can help address the challenges faced by persons with the disease and their families, HHS plans, in part, to work with state and local governments to improve coordination and identify model initiatives to advance AD awareness and readiness (Strategy 4.B). AOTA applauds plans to involve state and local governmental entities to further the National Plan, but we wish to note the importance of involving professional associations at the state level in these efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Track Progress and Drive Improvement </strong></p>
<p>Finally, HHS plans to identify the gaps in existing data and pursue roads to expand and enhance the data infrastructure in this field and to make data more easily accessible to federal agencies and researchers (Strategy 5.A). Occupational therapy practitioners are also cognizant of information gaps related to the study of AD, and will be interested to access and utilize any improvements HHS is able to make, particular in the area of new quality measures, participating in new data collection efforts, or more easily viewing improved data sets or links between data sets.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>AOTA looks forward to working with HHS to implement NAPA. AOTA's Occupational Therapy Practice Guidelines for Alzheimer's Disease are en route via U.S. mail, and additional materials about occupational therapy contributions to the field are available upon request; please do not hesitate to contact us with questions.</p>

<p>Below and attached are comments I am submitting on behalf of the Healthy Brain Workgroup of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded Healthy Aging Research Network (CDC-HAN).</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p><strong>Response to Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease: Submitted on behalf of the Health Brain Workgroup of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded Healthy Aging Research Network (CDC-HAN)</strong></p>
<p>The Healthy Brain Workgroup of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded Healthy Aging Research Network (CDC-HAN) strongly supports the vision statement of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) presented by President Barack Obama, which aims to alleviate the suffering and burden associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to "<em>confront the challenge it poses to our public health</em>."</p>
<p>The Healthy Aging Research Network (HAN) was formed in 2001 to help develop and implement a national research and dissemination agenda related to the public health aspects of healthy aging. The HAN consists of a coordinating center, seven member and affiliate universities, and representation from and participation by over 10 national agencies with interests in the well-being of older adults, including AARP, the Alzheimer's Association, the American Medical Association, the US Administration on Aging, the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors, the National Council on Aging, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This network has played a vital role in national initiatives to ensure the inclusion of AD, cognitive impairment, and cognitive health promotion in the Healthy People 2020 Older Adult objectives. The network has also worked successfully to inform the National Public Health Road Map to Maintaining Cognitive Health, released in June 2007 by the CDC and the Alzheimer's Association [1].</p>
<p>Between 2005 and 2009, the HAN conducted community-based research with over 600 diverse older adults, caregivers, and healthcare providers. Interviews and focus groups were conducted in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Vietnamese, with representation from African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic, and Non-Hispanic White communities, in urban and rural locations across nine states. [2-4]. Theseolder adults and those who care for older adults represent the stakeholders to whom NAPA is targeted. Findings from this large-scale, multi-site initiative (published in The Gerontologist, volume 49, supplement 1, June 2009) indicated that older adults, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, language, or geographic region, agree that cognitive health is essential to healthy aging [5, 6]. Older adults also stated that existing media messages about cognitive health and its association with lifestyle factors can be conflicting and confusing [7]. It is imperative that researchers, educators, and policymakers continue to examine communication strategies to better inform the public about the evolving science of maintaining cognitive health and reducing the risk of cognitive impairment. Based on its strong track record, the HAN is well positioned to participate in such efforts.</p>
<p>As currently written, the NAPA does not explicitly state the impact of AD and other dementias on public health or the role that public health can play in this important area. We therefore strongly recommend the explicit inclusion of HAN expertise in public health research and practice in addressing each of the goals outlined in the NAPA. This document provides recommendations for roles that the HAN might fill in implementing the Plan.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>Public health has a long history of fielding prevention research and educational efforts in multiple chronic diseases such as heart disease, musculoskeletal disease, and cancer. HAN member centers have helped develop, evaluate, and implement successful health promotion programs in primary care, senior centers, and other community-based organizations. HAN researchers, in partnership with community collaborators, have developed and tested effective, evidence-based, and widely-used older adult exercise programs, including EnhanceFitness[8-9], Fit and Strong! [10, 11], and A Matter of Balance [12-14] and have demonstrated chronic illness risk reduction and improved health outcomes in these investigations. Although research is still needed about the impact of such lifestyle changes on AD [15], epidemiological and early randomized clinical trials (RCTs) show promise [16]. A cadre of experts within the HAN can help advance this work, both by conducting focused reviews of existing literature and large datasets, and by planning and implementing large scale lifestyle-enhancing initiatives. In addition, as noted above, the HAN has a proven track record in partnering with diverse groups who represent the growing numbers of racial and ethnic minorities in the US and recruiting them to participate in research and the implementation and dissemination of evidence-based findings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize Care Quality and Efficiency</strong></p>
<p>Initiatives focused on expanding dementia-specific capabilities in primary care settings are already underway within the HAN. HAN centers have examined primary care providers' perceptions and practices regarding AD and cognitive impairment [17, 18]. A current CDC-funded Special Interest Project (SIP 10-37; PI: M. Snowden) is reviewing the scientific literature to determine the impact of cognitive impairment on co-occurring chronic illnesses, including morbidity, mortality, and how AD and dementias influence the medical care that an individual receives. The project will also identify and catalogue the elements of existing research databases for use in future studies to better understand the relationship between dementia and chronic conditions. The HAN member centers' established associations with racial and ethnic minority, low income, and rural populations provide resources and expertise for assessing and addressing the complications and obstacles faced by these groups who are at high risk for inadequate health care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>There is a need for more broadly distributed evidence-based services through involvement of a variety of service providers, including State Health Departments, Area Agencies on Aging, non-profit organizations, faith-based organizations, and other facilities within local communities. Public health has a long history of working within these organizations, and can help mobilize communities to meet these challenges. HAN members and affiliates are actively engaged in working with the Administration on Aging (AoA) in this effort (e.g., University of Washington HAN investigators are currently working with the states of Washington, Oregon, and Ohio on translating evidence-based interventions for individuals with dementia and their family caregivers into existing community health systems [19]).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services should take advantage of the formative investigation already conducted by the HAN that was cited earlier [2-7]. This investigation found low health literacy and lack of access to culturally relevant information about cognitive health across all ethnic and language groups, and in both rural and urban environments. Older adults often reported that recommendations that they heard were ambiguous, contradictory, or impossible to comply with, and recommendations from health providers were often vague and lacked specific planning processes [7]. Thus, there is an urgent need for culturally and educationally appropriate materials and resources for individuals with cognitive impairment, individuals at risk for dementia, caregivers, and providers. The HAN comprehensive data set can provide guidance about messages and media that will be most effective in disseminating this information. The HAN has tremendous reach for public health and aging focused message testing and awareness campaign development, implementation, and evaluation.</p>
<p>In addition, each HAN site has worked for over 10 years with community advisory groups to facilitate communication between and among state and local government agencies, nonprofit partners, racial and ethnic minority service providers, and academic public health researchers. These partnerships have actively developed and disseminated healthy aging programs, and can be leveraged to promote dementia-prevention education and intervention programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Track Progress and Drive Improvement</strong></p>
<p>Public health researchers have long been instrumental in evaluating large-scale programs to promote health in older adults, including both lifestyle (e.g., exercise, nutrition) and primary prevention (e.g., immunization) interventions. Any effort to measure and evaluate the impact of NAPA on health outcomes for older adults and caregivers and on policy change must be informed by public health, taking advantage of existing expertise in population-level evaluation planning, data collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. The HAN has been involved in developing aging-specific questions for a number of large surveys [18, 20], and has a long history of experience and expertise in this area. It should be noted that the CDC Healthy Aging Program (funder of the HAN) developed a 10-question Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) module on Perceived Cognitive Impairment. Twenty-two states included the module on their state BRFSS in 2011; an additional 16 states are including the module in 2012 (total 38 states, including the District of Columbia). The CDC Healthy Aging Program is working with partners, including the states, to expand the module in 2013 to all 50 states.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>In summary, to achieve the goals of NAPA, collaboration with and among public health researchers across the nation is needed. The HAN is an example of a successful and productive collaborative effort, and we look forward to helping move the science forward to address this important public health issue.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Response to Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong><br />
					HAN Recommendations</p>
<p>Submitted on behalf of the Healthy Brain Workgroup of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded Healthy Aging Research Network (CDC-HAN)</p>
<p>The Healthy Brain Workgroup of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded Healthy Aging Research Network (CDC-HAN) strongly supports the vision statement of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) presented by President Barack Obama, which aims to alleviate the suffering and burden associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to "<em>confront the challenge it poses to our public health</em>."</p>
<p>The Healthy Aging Research Network (HAN) was formed in 2001 to help develop and implement a national research and dissemination agenda related to the public health aspects of healthy aging. The HAN consists of a coordinating center, seven member and affiliate universities, and representation from and participation by over 10 national agencies with interests in the well-being of older adults, including AARP, the Alzheimer's Association, the American Medical Association, the US Administration on Aging, the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors, the National Council on Aging, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This network has played a vital role in national initiatives to ensure the inclusion of AD, cognitive impairment, and cognitive health promotion in the Healthy People 2020 Older Adult objectives. The network has also worked successfully to inform the National Public Health Road Map to Maintaining Cognitive Health, released in June 2007 by the CDC and the Alzheimer's Association [1].</p>
<p>Between 2005 and 2009, the HAN conducted community-based research with over 600 diverse older adults, caregivers, and healthcare providers. Interviews and focus groups were conducted in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Vietnamese, with representation from African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic, and Non-Hispanic White communities, in urban and rural locations across nine states. [2-4]. These older adults and those who care for older adults represent the stakeholders to whom NAPA is targeted. Findings from this large-scale, multi-site initiative (published in The Gerontologist, volume 49, supplement 1, June 2009) indicated that older adults, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, language, or geographic region, agree that cognitive health is essential to healthy aging [5, 6]. Older adults also stated that existing media messages about cognitive health and its association with lifestyle factors can be conflicting and confusing [7]. It is imperative that researchers, educators, and policymakers continue to examine communication strategies to better inform the public about the evolving science of maintaining cognitive health and reducing the risk of cognitive impairment. Based on its strong track record, the HAN is well positioned to participate in such efforts.</p>
<p>As currently written, the NAPA does not explicitly state the impact of AD and other dementias on public health or the role that public health can play in this important area. We therefore strongly recommend the explicit inclusion of HAN expertise in public health research and practice in addressing each of the goals outlined in the NAPA. This document provides recommendations for roles that the HAN might fill in implementing the Plan.</p>
<p><strong>1. Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>Public health has a long history of fielding prevention research and educational efforts in multiple chronic diseases such as heart disease, musculoskeletal disease, and cancer. HAN member centers have helped develop, evaluate, and implement successful health promotion programs in primary care, senior centers, and other community-based organizations. HAN researchers, in partnership with community collaborators, have developed and tested effective, evidence-based, and widely-used older adult exercise programs, including EnhanceFitness [8-9], Fit and Strong! [10, 11], and A Matter of Balance [12-14] and have demonstrated chronic illness risk reduction and improved health outcomes in these investigations. Although research is still needed about the impact of such lifestyle changes on AD [15], epidemiological and early randomized clinical trials (RCTs) show promise [16]. A cadre of experts within the HAN can help advance this work, both by conducting focused reviews of existing literature and large datasets, and by planning and implementing large scale lifestyle-enhancing initiatives. In addition, as noted above, the HAN has a proven track record in partnering with diverse groups who represent the growing numbers of racial and ethnic minorities in the US and recruiting them to participate in research and the implementation and dissemination of evidence-based findings.</p>
<p><strong>2. Optimize Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>Initiatives focused on expanding dementia-specific capabilities in primary care settings are already underway within the HAN. HAN centers have examined primary care providers' perceptions and practices regarding AD and cognitive impairment [17, 18]. A current CDC-funded Special Interest Project (SIP 10-37; PI: M. Snowden) is reviewing the scientific literature to determine the impact of cognitive impairment on co-occurring chronic illnesses, including morbidity, mortality, and how AD and dementias influence the medical care that an individual receives. The project will also identify and catalogue the elements of existing research databases for use in future studies to better understand the relationship between dementia and chronic conditions. The HAN member centers' established associations with racial and ethnic minority, low income, and rural populations provide resources and expertise for assessing and addressing the complications and obstacles faced by these groups who are at high risk for inadequate health care.</p>
<p><strong>3. Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>There is a need for more broadly distributed evidence-based services through involvement of a variety of service providers, including State Health Departments, Area Agencies on Aging, non-profit organizations, faith-based organizations, and other facilities within local communities. Public health has a long history of working within these organizations, and can help mobilize communities to meet these challenges. HAN members and affiliates are actively engaged in working with the Administration on Aging (AoA) in this effort (e.g., University of Washington HAN investigators are currently working with the states of Washington, Oregon, and Ohio on translating evidence-based interventions for individuals with dementia and their family caregivers into existing community health systems [19]).</p>
<p><strong>4. Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services should take advantage of the formative investigation already conducted by the HAN that was cited earlier [2-7]. This investigation found low health literacy and lack of access to culturally relevant information about cognitive health across all ethnic and language groups, and in both rural and urban environments. Older adults often reported that recommendations that they heard were ambiguous, contradictory, or impossible to comply with, and recommendations from health providers were often vague and lacked specific planning processes [7]. Thus, there is an urgent need for culturally and educationally appropriate materials and resources for individuals with cognitive impairment, individuals at risk for dementia, caregivers, and providers. The HAN comprehensive data set can provide guidance about messages and media that will be most effective in disseminating this information. The HAN has tremendous reach for public health and aging focused message testing and awareness campaign development, implementation, and evaluation.</p>
<p>In addition, each HAN site has worked for over 10 years with community advisory groups to facilitate communication between and among state and local government agencies, nonprofit partners, racial and ethnic minority service providers, and academic public health researchers. These partnerships have actively developed and disseminated healthy aging programs, and can be leveraged to promote dementia-prevention education and intervention programs.</p>
<p><strong>5. Track Progress and Drive Improvement </strong></p>
<p>Public health researchers have long been instrumental in evaluating large-scale programs to promote health in older adults, including both lifestyle (e.g., exercise, nutrition) and primary prevention (e.g., immunization) interventions. Any effort to measure and evaluate the impact of NAPA on health outcomes for older adults and caregivers and on policy change must be informed by public health, taking advantage of existing expertise in population-level evaluation planning, data collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. The HAN has been involved in developing aging-specific questions for a number of large surveys [18, 20], and has a long history of experience and expertise in this area. It should be noted that the CDC Healthy Aging Program (funder of the HAN) developed a 10-question Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) module on Perceived Cognitive Impairment. Twenty-two states included the module on their state BRFSS in 2011; an additional 16 states are including the module in 2012 (total 38 states, including the District of Columbia). The CDC Healthy Aging Program is working with partners, including the states, to expand the module in 2013 to all 50 states.</p>
<p>In summary, to achieve the goals of NAPA, collaboration with and among public health researchers across the nation is needed. The HAN is an example of a successful and productive collaborative effort, and we look forward to helping move the science forward to address this important public health issue.</p>

<p><strong>Comments on Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Merck &amp; Company, Inc. appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Merck is an innovative, global health care leader that is committed to preserving and improving human life. We continue to focus our research on conditions that affect millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>We commend you and the Advisory Council on the first Draft of the National Plan. The plan is comprehensive in scope and addresses many of the most significant challenges to changing the course of Alzheimer's disease in the US and globally. As indicated in the Draft Plan, we encourage you to make subsequent iterations of the Plan far more specific, and to give a practical sense of what can be accomplished not only through government action but by bringing government, industry, and academia together to align and build on each other's already substantial activities on Alzheimer's disease. We applaud the government's leadership in organizing and hosting the Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit in May to bring a wide array of stakeholders to the table, and we look forward to participating in this meeting.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Goal I</strong></p>
<p>We are particularly pleased with the first Goal of the Draft Plan: to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025. Only by setting such a challenging goal and by allocating sufficient resources and aligning critical partners can we hope to achieve such an important global public health outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Broad Collaboration Needed</strong></p>
<p>This is not a goal the US federal government can accomplish solely through its own actions or by directing the actions of others, particularly in light of the limited resources currently at its disposal. Rather this is a goal that all of us committed to a breakthrough in Alzheimer's disease must chare; and must, indeed, share with our colleagues around the world. It will take a true partnership of research, business, advocates, health care and government and the combined resources of all parties to develop and apply the needed therapeutics at the rate required to attain this goal.</p>
<p>Leadership is critical, and the government, through this Plan and its funding and convening powers, can to do much to provide that leadership. Achieving key milestones in advancing therapeutics will require a collaboration of government, academia, and industry.</p>
<p><strong>Industry Partnership Is Essential</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Streamlining Regulatory Pathways</strong></p>
<p>While the Draft Plan proposes a number of areas in which greater collaboration with industry can be productive, there are a number of proposed actions where more constructive engagement of industry could be helpful. Specifically, Action 1.E.1 to identify ways to accelerate time to market, should engage industry as a full partner in identifying ways to simplify the approval process, provide greater clarity and predictability in validation and application of diagnostics and biomarkers and in the selection of endpoints.</p>
<p><strong>In Establishing New Approval Standards</strong></p>
<p>Currently, efficacy can only be established in large and lengthy clinical trials. Advances in knowledge of disease pathophysiology, risk factores, and disease biomarkers through academic, government and industry sponsored research is critical to develop more efficient new approaches for clinical trials. Industry should be directly involved in an ongoing dialogue with the FDA on how to translate the rapidly evolving science of Alzheimer's disease into standards for establishing safety and efficacy of treatments. Developing new approaches that can be used to shorten this timeline and remove risk earlier will require the combined efforts of industry and the FDA. Collaboration with the EMA and other major regulatory bodies will be essential as well to ensure global consistency in the translation of science into regulatory pathways to get therapeutics to patients.</p>
<p><strong>In Accounting for Different Disease Segments</strong></p>
<p>Imaging and biomarker development in Strategy 1 C should contribute to clear differentiation by the FDA of segments of disease -- prevention, early treatment and later treatment -- which have different issues and may have different pathways for approval. For each segment, the FDA will need to provide guidance on acceptable diagnostic criteria and clinical end-points needed to prove efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>In Designing and Conducting Clinical Trials</strong></p>
<p>Clinical trial design and conduct is another area where much can be gained from a true partnership with academia and industry. Action 1.B.5 proposes that HHS, VA, and NIA develop and fund clinical trials on the most promising therapeutics. This Action does not account for the amount of time and effort, and the amount of uncertainty that is involved in finding safe therapeutic candidates and testing these mechanisms in trials. Nor does it acknowledge the existence of the substantial infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new agents for trials and the relationships that already exist with regulators to ensure that medicines are approved. This is an infrastructure today fully engaged in developing the more than 100 Alzheimer's disease candidates currently in the pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency Needed in Research</strong></p>
<p>It is important in Strategy 1 B in expanding the research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, to ensure the most efficient use of all partners and resources, and make the best use of the limited number of patients that will be available for clinical trials. Studies need to be adequately powered, with agents that effectively test mechanisms and produce evidence of brain target engagement to avoid studies that confuse the field and do not advance the state of knowledge, in order to make the best use of patients that enter clinical trials.</p>
<p>Again, we commend you on the progress to date on this important project. We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. We look forward to the opportunity to remain fully engaged in this important mission of developing an effective prevention and treatment for Alzheimer's disease by 2025.</p>

I believe my comments may be most appropriate and relevant for the Advisory Council and their considerations, and therefore sending to you. Please let me know if I should also send directly to napa@hhs.gov.</p>
<p>I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the March 14 Advisory Council teleconference as well as the opportunity to submit my comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and its importance for the more than 400,000 individuals with Down syndrome in the US and their families and caregivers as well as associated stakeholders. More explicit inclusion of Down syndrome as integral to the Plan, particular concerning fundamental, translational and clinical research, will be important for accelerating progress and success not only for individuals with Down syndrome, and associated very high Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and dementia, but also for the entire population that will develop or currently have Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments Regarding Draft National Plan To Address Alzheimer's Disease<br />
					March, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the development of the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, and for the opportunity to submit comments.</p>
<p>The Down Syndrome Research and Treatment Foundation is a national/international 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the mission to stimulate and support biomedical research that will accelerate development of treatments to significantly improve cognition, including memory, learning and speech, for children <strong>and</strong> adults with <strong>Down syndrome</strong>. The major objectives include creating new opportunities for <strong>all</strong> Individuals with Down Syndrome to: 1) Lead more independent lives; 2) Participate more successfully in schools &amp; employment; and 3) Prevent additional early cognitive decline with aging &amp; <strong>Alzheimer's disease</strong>. Since its founding in 2004, DSRTF, through its novel research strategy and grants program, has identified and substantively supported much of the research that has led to the recent rapid and unprecedented advances in Down syndrome cognition research and the first clinical trial with a novel drug candidate to focus on as a primary indication and specifically address overcoming cognitive and behavioral impairments in individuals with Down syndrome by a major international pharmaceutical company, Roche.</p>
<p>We acknowledge and appreciate the explicit recognition, inclusion and designation of attention to intellectual disabilities populations as unequally burdened by Alzheimer's disease within Strategy 2.H: Improve care for populations disproportionally affected by Alzheimer's disease and for populations facing care challenges. However, this is far too limited within the overall plan; it is more than just initiatives addressing only care. As discussed further below, there is a very strong rationale to <strong>explicitly include Down syndrome</strong> in each of the strategies, and designated strategic sub-actions, comprising the National Alzheimer's Plan and resulting initiatives, and Strategy 1 involving fundamental, translational and clinical research in particular.</p>
<p>As research has documented, virtually all individuals with Down syndrome, now numbering more than 400,000 individuals in the US, develop the characteristic neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease by age 40. Research has also shown that, very conservatively, at least 25% increasing to 75% or more of the individuals with Down syndrome between the ages of 40-60 develop the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia and the percentage increases with age. These facts underscore the very significant and important relevance of this population as a key and explicit element to be included not only in the National Alzheimer's Plan but also in the development and implementation of all aspects of the Plan, including research (fundamental, translational, and clinical) to effectively prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease, enhancing care quality and delivery, and expanding supports for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Given these facts, explicit and integral inclusion and consideration of Down syndrome in the Plan and associated initiatives can not only significantly address the significant number of individuals with Down syndrome but also the larger non-Down syndrome population developing or with Alzheimer's disease. This requires significant increases in awareness and rational considerations among researchers and clinicians, which can be partly addressed through explicitly including Down syndrome more prominently in the Plan as well as in resulting initiatives and increased proportional funding.</p>
<p>Given the significant size of the Down syndrome population (&gt;400,000 in the US, and up to 10-times that number worldwide) and the virtual certainty that the individuals will develop the characteristic neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease and ultimately the associated dementia further compromising their cognition and life, inclusion of Down syndrome, particularly in the research initiatives (fundamental, translational, and clinical) would significantly contribute important novelty, unavailable otherwise, to as well as enhance and accelerate essentially all aspects of the major objectives specified under Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 as well as Goal 2. NIH grants and funding for <strong>all</strong> of Down syndrome research have remained disproportionately very low, e.g. $20M in FY 2011. This includes a much smaller and too limited subset of research grants investigating the aspects of Alzheimer's disease associated with Down syndrome. As only one contrasting example, explicit and significant attention and funding by NIH and its Alzheimer's disease research initiatives, both basic and translational, have been targeted to so-called dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease, both basic and translational (see e.g., the DIAN initiative) that is much more rare and with a much smaller population. In both Down syndrome and dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease myriad research has confirmed the significant involvement of the same gene, APP, and its products (The APP gene is located on human chromosome 21, the chromosome trisomic in Down syndrome, as are a number of additional genes demonstrated to be involved in mechanisms associated with Alzheimer's disease.). Through more detailed and sufficient investigations in the Down syndrome population, researchers can obtain invaluable insight into how and why Alzheimer's disease develops, and can compare and extend their findings to the much more common late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease as well as enhance and accelerate development of new therapeutics. The relevant trajectory to Alzheimer's disease and size of the Down syndrome population provides a strong rationale for greater recognition and explicit inclusion in the National Alzheimer's Disease Plan and resulting Alzheimer's disease fundamental, translational and clinical research initiatives.</p>
<p>Although by no means an attempt to thoroughly include detailed or exhaustive rationale and recommendations in these comments here, in addition to the suggestions and requests above with respect to more prominent and explicit integral recognition and inclusion of Down syndrome in the ultimate version of the National Alzheimer's plan, I submit the following recommendations for further consideration:</p>
<ul><li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Goal 1 as well as each of the proposed "Actions" under Strategy 1A, including Actions 1.A.1-5.</li>
<li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.B. including Actions 1.B.1-6. This would include not only research in animal models of Down syndrome, but with respect to human clinical studies explicit designation and inclusion of relevant and appropriate cohorts of individuals with Down syndrome, together with and/or in parallel/addition to those clinical studies initiatives involving non-Down syndrome cohorts. The results would be expected to be mutually informative and beneficial.</li>
<li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.C. including Actions 1.C.1-2. Again, given that essentially every individual with Down syndrome develops the characteristic neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease by age 40 with a significant proportion also developing the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia and further increases with age earlier, inclusion of relevant and appropriate cohorts of individuals with Down syndrome, together with and/or in parallel/addition to these research initiatives involving non-Down syndrome cohorts would uniquely provide important relevant and additional information, insights, direction and acceleration of success.</li>
<li>As is true for Alzheimer's disease research and development, relevant Down syndrome research is ongoing, and increasing, internationally. It will be important to coordinate with and expand relevant Down syndrome research internationally and collaboratively. Therefore, explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.D. including Actions 1.D.1-2.</li>
<li>Explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategy 1.E. including Actions 1.E.1-3. With respect to Action 1.E.1., again, given that essentially every individual with Down syndrome develops the characteristic neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease by age 40 with a significant proportion also developing the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia and further increases with age earlier, inclusion of relevant and appropriate cohorts of individuals with Down syndrome, together with and/or in parallel/addition to these research initiatives involving non-Down syndrome cohorts would uniquely provide important relevant and additional information, insights, direction and acceleration of success. With respect to Action 1.E.2., inclusion of private-public collaborations and partnerships between Federal entities such as NIH and non-governmental nonprofit organizations such as DSRTF with its focus on Down syndrome cognition research will enhance productivity, accelerate significant progress and success as well as minimize duplications of efforts and resources. With respect to Action 1.E.3., the critical importance of the increasing development and very significant impact of Alzheimer's disease on individual with Down syndrome and their families and care givers underscores the importance of involvement and communication with this community and associated stakeholders.</li>
<li>As indicated above, given the particular and significant relevance and importance of and impact of Alzheimer's disease on the relatively large population of individuals with Down syndrome, their families and caregivers as well as the healthcare system, it is not sufficient to generally designate "intellectual disabilities" in only Strategy 2.H. "Down syndrome" should be explicitly included in proposed Strategies 2.A.-H., 3.A.-E., 4.A.-B. and each of the Actions included under those strategies. Therefore, explicitly recognize and include discussion and components specifically involving Down syndrome in Strategies 2.A.-H., 3.A.-E., 4.A.-B. and each of the Actions included under those strategies.</li>
<li>Finally, based on the comments, rationale and recommendations outlined above, we would encourage and recommend that a representative from the Down syndrome community be added to the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) Advisory Council, as the important deliberations, priorities and implementation will have mutual benefits to science/research, clinical care, and long term care not just additionally for individuals with Down syndrome and associated Alzheimer's disease but also for the broader population and research efforts involving Alzheimer's disease.</li>
</ul><p>I would be very pleased to further discuss, as may be helpful and informative, any aspects of the above concerning the importance of explicit inclusion and considerations of Down syndrome relating to Alzheimer's disease in further detail with those involved in developing the National Plan, including members of the Advisory Committee. I have registered for and plan to attend the upcoming May 14-15 NAPA/NIH Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit in Bethesda, and look forward to the opportunity for further discussion of the importance and relevance of Down syndrome for the Plan and its successful implementation as outlined above.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Professor, Researcher and Author comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting the public to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." For over three decades I have worked as an educator at the University level, and therapist with individuals who have either been just diagnosed with early on-set of Alzheimer's Disease, mild- to moderate stages of the disease as well as late stage Alzheimer's disease. In addition, I have taught at Colleges and Universities across the United States as well as in many countries internationally. Being a two time Fulbright Scholar in Global Health Studies, I have dedicated my academic career to both teaching, researching and authoring creative and innovative approaches on how to best provide programming to those afflicted with this disease. I welcome the opportunity to provide recommendations for your consideration.</p>
<p>In recent years, various non-pharmacological approaches to care such as creative arts-based programming; cognitive stimulation; exercise and movement programming; meditation; learning methods; sensory therapy, and cognitive training are recognized in small scale studies and are the basis of research information taught and practiced at the University level in career areas such as Therapeutic Recreation, Creative Arts Therapies, Movement and Dance Therapy and Art Therapy. These non-pharmacological approaches have emerged as a grassroots movement responding to an evolution of evidence, put into research and implemented in Social Adult Day Programs, Assisted living Facilities, and Long Term Nursing Facilities.</p>
<p>However small these studies, research is continuing to suggest that some individuals will slow the progression of dementia and have the potential to improve or revert back to normal memory with early interventions due to structured cognitive stimulation (Pressley, J., Trott, C. &amp; Tang, M., 2003; Chertkow, H., et al., 2001). Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that activities in the mental, physical and social domains have protective effects against cognitive decline and dementia (Flatiglioni, et al. 2004; Gilley, W., Wilson, L., Bienias, L., Bennett, A. &amp; Evans, A., 2004; Claire, L., Wilson, B., Carter, G., Roth, I. &amp; Hodges, J.,2004; Davie, J., et al., 2004). More specifically, continued active participation in life through social involvements and activities that are individualized and person centered to each individuals needs and skills have been documented to enhance feelings of self esteem, self worth and directly impact overall quality of life (Pruessner, J., Lord, C., Meaney, M. &amp; Lupien, S., 2004; Manly, J., et al., 2005; Kumara, R., et al., 2005). A National study of all research related to early stage dementia indicated that the need for psychosocial support for persons newly diagnosed should take place soon after receiving the diagnosis to prevent dropping social support networks, cognitive decline and leading to increased institutionalization rates (Brodaty, H., Gresham, M., &amp; Luscombe, G., 1997; Fernandez-Ballesteros et al., 2003). In a review of the literature regarding early stage AD it has been documented that multi-modal approaches have the most significant outcomes (Burgener, S., et al., 2007). The TTAP Method, a multi-modal approach has been documented in a pilot study (Alders, A. &amp; Levine Madori, L., 2010) to improve cognition in Hispanic elderly in a Social Adult Community Day Center in Buffalo, New York and in a research study with Rehabilitation Patients at Helen Hayes Hospital the method proved to increase overall feelings of self control and pain management (Levine-Madori, L., 2009).</p>
<p>Research in the area of non-pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's care is still being ignored, and yet it continues to remain the most economically sound approach. In a data collection in 2010 on a Gero- psychiatric unit at Lyndon Oaks at Edward Hospital located in Naperville, Illinois, staff was trained in The TTAP Method. Pre- training data collection documented the unit had an average of 90 hours of aggressive interventions a month. These interventions were carried out by a Nursing Supervisor. Six months into staff implementing of thematic person-centered creative arts programming the aggressive behaviors went down to an average of 4.6 Nursing Interventions. Falls went from an average of 5 per month to 3, this statistics validate a direct healthcare savings of over $80,000.00 in just a six moth period. <a href="http://www.levinemadoriphd.com/content/site/educational-courses.php">http://www.levinemadoriphd.com/content/site/educational-courses.php</a> .</p>
<p>A world without Alzheimer's, might very well be a real possibility in the future. However, the current 5.4 million people who currently have the disease and the estimated 10,000 people daily diagnosed each and every day will still need daily non-pharmaceutical innovative programming, treatment and care. As an Art Therapist, Recreation Therapist and Ph.D. it is my belief that the current research agenda is narrow in scope and leaves research in the non-pharmaceutical -creative arts completely out of the discussion. For decades we as a society have poured millions of dollars into pharmaceutical research, which to date has yet to make an impact. It is my belief that it is crucial at this point in time, just as the baby boomers are starting dramatically impact the "graying of America". As you probably are aware, it is estimated by the National Association on Alzheimer 's disease, in 2011, that one of every 8 baby-boomers are predicted to have some form of cognitive impairment in their lifetime.</p>
<p>The time for researching the non-pharmaceutical approaches and putting research into practice is now! Those who have dedicated their lives to people afflicted by this disease process understand that these individuals LIVE with the disease for many years. The average person diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease now lives 15 years and must be given meaningful and person-centered daily therapeutic interventions. Without research we cannot move forward in the healthcare areas such as Art Therapy, Recreation Therapy, Music Therapy, etc. to provide research based, best practice approaches. Please know that these healthcare fields in the Creative Art Therapies, Therapeutic Recreation, and Music Therapy are in fact where daily treatment and ongoing cognitive, social, emotional and physical stimulation comes from. Research money is needed to be earmarked for these healthcare professionals and the research that they do in non- pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's care.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to share thoughts and suggestions with you.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p>While the Draft National Alzheimer's Plan mentions nonpharmacological treatments and initiatives for dementia, it does so in a way that enables these important initiatives to be easily sidelined through lack of funding, lack of understanding and inappropriate research.</p>
<p>We the undersigned believe that the unique and positive alternative paradigm of nonpharmacological interventions in Alzheimer's must be recognized. This paradigm has several key dimensions that the National Alzheimer's Plan must recognize as a legitimate treatment modality for Alzheimer's and related dementias that can significantly improve the lives of those with these conditions and can significantly reduce costs in the care and treatment of those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p>The following must be recognized and included in the plan if these significant care options are to be valued as they clearly need to be so the many millions of people with Alzheimer's and other dementias today and tomorrow receive the quality of life and human rights they deserve.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><em>A DIFFERENT PARADIGM<br />
							Nonpharmacological interventions represent a global paradigm of Alzheimer's treatment; much more than just individual actions such as chocolate, dolls, and environmental design. This paradigm, based on neuroscience theory, applied research, and clinical practice, has been developed by many experts over decades. If this powerful approach to dealing with dementia and reducing symptoms is to be taken seriously, the particulars, no matter how exceptional (such as museum programs for people with Alzheimer's, providing improvisational theatre, or giving chocolate), need to be taken as examplars of a larger way of thinking about Alzheimer's and dementia--a new paradigm--not as ends in themselves. </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE<br />
							There is a huge cache of evidence-based knowledge demonstrating how non-pharmacological interventions reduce symptoms and improve daily lives of people living with dementia and their care partners. This research is often discounted and rejected because although it is meaningful and fits the needs of the evaluation being conducted, it does not fit a particular research model--the double blind randomized controlled trial. It is important to assess these data carefully to calculate the statistical effect sizes they represent and thus their impact on people's lives. </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>METHODOLOGY AND METHODS<br />
							Much existing research is discounted by policymakers, researchers, and others because they are convinced that the only evidence worth counting is generated by double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RCTs represent one important way to generate knowledge; but only one way. Other methodologies contribute substantially to our knowledge of nonpharmacological interventions and need to be taken seriously. It makes little sense to discredit a large body of knowledge that could immensely help policy and decision-making. The following summarizes two alternative ways to think about research methodology. </em></p>
<p><em>The RCT gold standard assumes that 1. It is the highest level of proof, no matter what the research question, 2. It is at the top of a hierarchy of methods where other methodologies are "lower" on the continuum, and 3. That statistical significance is a measure of meaningfulness of a finding. </em></p>
<p><em>The alternative gold standard for nonpharmacological and other research assumes that 1. The best methodology for any research question is the methodology that fits the question best--not any particular one, 2. There is no single continuum of methodology and no absolute hierarchy, and. 3. That effect measures are an important addition to statistical significance as a measure of a finding's "meaningfulness." </em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>HUMAN RIGHTS<br />
							Freedom to choose, getting what you want, being part of the larger society and taking part in cultural activities are human rights everyone deserves--including those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias. We ought to be shocked at the limits to human rights being imposed daily on those with dementia (no chocolate and no visits to museums) rather than amazed that human rights are being respected in a few places--Arizona, or New York, or Massachusetts or wherever. </em></p>
<p><em>The World Health Organization defines the rights of all people as dignity, independence, self-fulfillment, participation and care. Respecting these for people living with Alzheimer's could well be a rallying cry for those who care about people living with this condition.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>THE WAY OUT OF THE ETHICAL DILEMMA OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS<br />
							In the name of science and further research, there is a movement taking place to diagnose Alzheimer's disease long before those being diagnosed show any cognitive or behavioral symptoms. Although these tests are presented as limited to research purposes, they are highly likely to be employed in everyday practice. For the millions who will receive this early diagnosis tomorrow and the millions living with this dementia diagnosis today, early diagnosis presents a major ethical dilemma: What to do with a diagnosis if no medications are available that stop the progress of the disease? The nonpharmacological paradigm and its associated interventions represent an ethical way to respond to the call for early Alzheimer's diagnosis since they offer a clear solution to improve the quality of life of people living with dementia. </em></p>
</li>
</ol><p>For these reasons, we urge that an expert and champion of nonpharmacological approaches and treatments for dementia be appointed to generate research, direct information gathering and otherwise serve the needs of those with dementia today employing nonpharmacological approaches.</p>
<p>We also urge the Federal Advisory Panel and others administering research programs for dementia to include on an equal basis in all research, both nonpharmacological treatments and pharmacological ones. By nonpharmacological "treatments" we mean all health related activities that research has demonstrated have positive behavioral and health outcomes. These include, among others: engaging activity, exercise, targeted nutrition, music, visual arts, film, drama, museums, an appropriately designed and stimulating environment, memory books, high-touch end of life care, external written cueing, information technology, training family and formal caregivers, counseling, meditation, yoga, tai chi, exercise, poetry, storytelling, pets, and even chocolate.</p>
<p>We also urge the Federal Advisory Panel and those administering Alzheimer's-focused research programs and Alzheimer's-focused intervention strategies to develop and make explicit key performance indicators suited to nonpharmacological interventions. We also urge them to include in research protocols all evaluation methods and methodologies suited to studying the effects of real-world applications of nonpharmacological treatments. We urge that all research involving treatment of dementia, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions, include reporting the clinical significance of effects produced by treatments, as well as statistical significance.</p>

<p>Please find attached comments from the National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services regarding the <em>Draft National Plan To Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
</td>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>The National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services (NASDDDS) is a professional organization comprising the directors of state agencies serving individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia. The Association assists state IDD agency officials respond to emerging state and federal policy issues that that affect their efforts to ensure the delivery of services and supports to individuals with IDD in their respective states and jurisdictions. Association staff provide member state agencies with extensive technical assistance on a wide range of system and program related issues, in-depth analyses of Medicaid and other federal statutory and regulatory policies affecting people with IDD, and cutting edge information on state-of-the-art programs and service delivery practices. NASDDDS collaborates closely with the American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry (AADMD) and the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices (NTG) to improve health and healthcare of people with IDD nationwide.</p>
<p>State IDD service delivery systems are large with total annual state and federal expenditures in excess of $53 billion. Data reported by the University of Minnesota Research and Training Center on Community Living reveal that over 1,000,000 individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, including autism, cerebral palsy and related conditions received publicly financed residential supports through Medicaid and other state/federally funded programs. The majority of these individuals, approximately 57% live with their families, receiving the supports that they need at home, at work and in a variety of in day programs in the community. Of the approximately 440,000 remaining individuals, about 72% live in local group homes or other neighborhood settings of less than 6 persons. Fewer than 28% reside in large state and privately operated institutions.</p>
<p>The purpose of this correspondence is to provide feedback to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services regarding the <em>Draft National Plan To Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. We are pleased that the Draft Plan specifically identifies people with intellectual disabilities in Strategy 2.H as a group of Americans who are at exceptionally high risk for contracting Alzheimer's disease. Including people with IDD in the report recognizes their particular vulnerability to these conditions and suggests the challenges that publicly financed systems of support will need to meet in the very near future. We believe, however, that the report does not go far enough in addressing the specific issues identified by NASDDDS member state agencies and articulated by a national report prepared by NTG entitled, <em>My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports</em>, and the related <em>National Dementia and Intellectual Disabilities Action Plan</em>. Our specific concerns and suggestions include the following:</p>
<p><strong><em>Issue 1</em>. The relationship between the presence of Down Syndrome and the risk of Alzheimer's disease is not given proper focus in research and practice recommendations. </strong></p>
<p>Goal 1 of the Draft Plan highlights research but does not reference the need for targeted examination and analysis of the etiology and course of dementia for people with Down syndrome, a group of individuals expressing a particular high risk for Alzheimer's disease. Sustained research in this area is clearly warranted to better understand the course and treatment of the disease and to inform and hopefully improve public policy in this area. We believe that continued support of research concerning and involving people with Down syndrome will not only potentially benefit the general population, but will also benefit the thousands of adults aging with Down syndrome and who are at high risk for and are affected by early onset dementia. Like individuals with genetic mutations resulting in early onset Alzheimer's disease, people with Down syndrome demonstrate early onset of symptoms and more research into this phenomenon is necessary. It should be emphasized that focused research into a relatively homogeneous population such as individuals with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's dementia can provide important clues when generalizing to the larger population of people with Alzheimer's but absent Down syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong>. NASDDDS strongly recommends that Goal 1 of the Draft Plan emphasize the need for focused basic and treatment research addressing the conditions and support needs of people with Down syndrome at high risk of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong><em>Issue 2</em>. Addressing the specialized programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities in Goal 2. </strong></p>
<p>NASDDDS agrees with the observations and recommendations of the NTG that the Council revise the Draft Plan to recognize the importance of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities in Goal 2, under Strategy 2.H (Action 2.H.1). And that the discussion of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities be mentioned earlier on in this section to make it clear that the strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population. It is important that the Draft Plan recognize that Alzheimer's disease impacts adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in the same manner as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound effect due to particular risk factors - including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation. Furthermore, we believe that it is important that any NAPA-related task forces created (as cited in the Draft Plan) not only address improvements of care for this specific population, but also, are designed to increase awareness, improve screening and early recognition, and conduct population specific clinical trials involving adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong>. NASDDDS recommends that:</p>
<ul><li>The Draft Plan and any resulting guidelines produced include reference to the special circumstances and challenges involved in assessing and determining the presence of dementia in adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities, and that this acknowledgement be placed earlier in the second section so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population.</li>
<li>The Draft Plan reference under Strategy 2.B the need for specialized screening instruments that are designed and normed for use with adults with intellectual disabilities. The administrative screening tool currently under development by the NTG will have specific application to people with intellectual disabilities who otherwise may not be adequately or successfully screened by tools in existence and applicable to the general population that are not normed for use by people with cognitive disabilities.</li>
<li>The Draft Plan reference under Strategy 2.E the need for long-term 'dementia capable' services and supports to be offered in small community settings rather than institutional facilities, consistent with the 2002 Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing. Research in the intellectual disabilities services area has shown this small group home model to be particularly effective in providing quality care for those adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Issue 3</em>. Need to address the special support needs of aging caregivers providing long-term in-home care of adults with intellectual disabilities. </strong></p>
<p>As noted above, the majority, over 57%, of all people with IDD receiving publicly financed support reside in the home of a family member. The age of family caregivers, like the average age of the U.S. population in general is growing older however, and these caregivers are now themselves needing support. Tragically, the availability of services has not kept pace with the demand for support. Plummeting state budgets and reductions in Medicaid and state-funded supports have expanded waiting lists and placed a greater burden on families with relatives in need of personal care and assistance. The ability to provide quality care to people with IDD who are aging both now and in the future depends on the ability of state and federal service delivery systems to support the capacity of families to furnish needed long term assistance.</p>
<p>The majority of adults with Down Syndrome and other intellectual disabilities need assistance in decision making and consent. Adults with intellectual disabilities are not the ones planning for their own long-term care needs and consideration must be given to enabling parents or other family members, providing primary care, to undertake productive long-term care planning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong>. NASDDDS strongly recommends that the Draft Plan address the special challenges faced by life-long caregivers of some persons with intellectual disabilities, (see Strategy 3.C.1)</p>
<p><strong><em>Issue 4</em>. Need to expand public education activities to include individuals with IDD and their families. </strong></p>
<p>NASDDDS believes that Goal 4 be expanded to ensure that the needs of family caregivers and people with intellectual disabilities are specifically addressed by public education campaigns and to improve coordination efforts by government and the voluntary sector. State IDD agencies are instrumental in organizing, managing and delivering services and supports to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families. It is essential that these state agencies be included in public education efforts and that education and training for health professions with respect to aging individuals with dementia -- especially of the Alzheimer's type -- should be included as part of primary health care education. Aggressive education campaigns addressing the nature of intellectual disabilities and the needs of individuals with IDD should be targeted to universities, hospitals, emergency rooms and general medical specialists.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong>. NASDDDS recommends that the Draft Plan include consideration of additional and targeted efforts related to public and medical education so that these efforts have a functional effect on helping people with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</p>
<p>NASDDDS member state agencies furnish a wide array of publicly financed services and supports to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. As the age of the population increases, state service delivery systems are working to develop effective strategies for meeting the needs of people with IDD in a way that allows them to age in place and remain a part of their families and communities. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's is an important step forward. We appreciate the work and recommendations of the Advisory Council, not only for the population in general, but particularly for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities who are especially vulnerable to this condition. NASDDDS gratefully acknowledges the work on this issue by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices and their assistance in forming the recommendations of this Association.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Making the case for Public Private Partnerships for NAPA</strong></p>
<p><em>The Problem</em><br />
					A crisis in medicine today is that there are increasing investments in biomedical research but decreasing numbers of new medical products, especially drugs, that obtain FDA approval and are available to patients.<sup>1,2</sup> In order to respond to this crisis, the field of drug development is undergoing transformational changes.</p>
<p>Taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product that finally reaches patients faces overwhelming challenges including the long length of research, high rate of failures of potential candidates and enormous costs. This research and development process is so difficult it is called the "Valley of Death." As many as 80-95% of promising drug candidates fail.<sup>3,4</sup> Drug companies will spend tens of thousands to perform research on millions of compounds and spend in excess of a billion dollars over a 10- to 20-year period just ot have one drug reach patients.<sup>5</sup> A pressing example is Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for which diagnosis is difficult and there are only a few FDA approved treatments to temporarily slow the disease but no cure, at a time when this debilitating disease is exploding in the aging population. In fact, the pace for development and FDA approval of Central Nervous System (CNS) drugs is even longer than other drug classes.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>These challenges mean that companies have to be smarter and more efficient in managing drug discovery and development. Innovation is needed to create greater efficiencies to help move therapies through development, review and approval for patient use. John Castellani, President PhRMA, stated that "The regulatory process is a strategic priority that if done right can reduce time, cost and uncertainty in drug development."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><em>The Solution</em>: Increasingly, public private partnerships (PPP) are presenting an opportunity to meeting these challenges. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Innovation comes from focusing on science that can improve the process of drug development and be applied to regulatory decisions. Efficiences come from building collaborations and sharing.</p>
<p>The flagship success of PPPs in AD is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (<strong>ADNI1</strong>), a $60 million, 5-year study to test whether imaging and biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments could measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Begun by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and supported by other federal agencies, private-sector companies and organizations, the ADNI1 investment would have been prohibitive for a single stokeholder. However, ADNI1 has transformed the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD. Additionally, many other PPPs are having an impact in AD, some of which are described below:</p>
<ul><li><strong>ADNI2</strong>: Approximately 1,000 people aged 55 to 90 will be followed with imaging and biomarker measures to identify who is at risk for AD, track progression, and devise tests to measure the effectiveness of potential interventions. This ~ $60 million study is funded by NIH and companies.</li>
<li><strong>FNIH Biomakers Consortium</strong>: One project is the first part of a multi-phased effort to utilize ADNI samples to construct multiplex panels in plasma and CSF to diagnose patients with AD and monitor disease progression.</li>
<li><strong>Alliance for Aging Research</strong>: The Alliance initiated Accelerate Cure/Treatment forAlzheimer's Disease, a coalition of national organizations representing patients, providers, caregivers, consumers, older Americans, researchers, employers, and health care industries seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for AD.</li>
<li><strong>Alzheimer's Association Global Standardization</strong>: This organization is leading global efforts to standardize Alzheimer's biomarkers with the World Wide AD Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) and the Alzheimer's Association Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Quality Control Program.</li>
<li><strong>Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable</strong>: Members facilitate the development and implementation of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease by collectively addressing obstacles to research and development, clinical care and public health education.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Path Institute's Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD)</strong>: CAMD accelerates the development of therapies for AD by advancing drug development tools for regulatory approval. CAMD developed AD data standards with CDISC, a pooled clinical trial database with 6,000 patients, and a clinical disease progression model. CAMD obtained regulatory approval for imaging biomarkers from the EMA and is collaborating with the FDA on CSF and imaging biomarkers.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Path Institute's Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium</strong>: A workgroup is developing and evaluating a PRO instrument on MCI for use in clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new AD drugs.</li>
<li><strong>IMI PharmaCog</strong>: The five-year €20M PharmaCog project, funded under the European Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI), will provide tools to define the potential of a drug candidate, reduce the development time of new drugs and thus accelerate the approvals of promising new medicines.</li>
</ul><p>While the impact of these PPPs is extensive, there are still significant challenges and opportunities for preventing and treating AD. One challenge is in the regulatory arena. For approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company engages exclusively with the regulatory agency and all information within the drug approval process is proprietary. Lessons learned from one AD drug trial are not shared, so any insights on why drugs fail or how particular biomarkers track with disease progression are lost. However, in recognizing the need for change, the FDA established an innovative approach in the Critical Path Initiative. The FDA formalized a process for submitting tools as biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments to be "qualified" for specific uses in supporting drug development.<sup>7</sup> Tools that receive a designation of "fit for use" from the FDA's qualification process8 can then be widely shared.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br />
					Providing the extensive evidence needed for qualification of tools by regulatory authorities can optimally be carried out through public-private partnerships. PPPs can support publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification.</p>
<p>The challenge then becomes funding PPPs that move products toward regulatory approval. The cost of qualification for a single biomarker is several million dollars over a time frame of up to 5 years. Such costs require significant investment by both public and private sectors and in-kind contributions in order to be successful. However, the end product is a tool that FDA can have confidence in to produce better data and be used by all drug companies in clinical trials. The result benefits all stakeholders, including patients.</p>
<p>Since not all PPPs conduct research as ADNI does, there needs to be new models of PPP funding, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such an AD PPP could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because PPPs rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided by a multi-stakeholder board to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>

<p>Thank you for your efforts to develop a national plan to address the growing crisis of Alzheimer's Disease. As an elder law attorney who has worked for many years with low income caregiving families in diverse ethnic communities, I understand the urgency of your work. I applaud your efforts to be both comprehensive and realistic in the development of this plan. My own work with Alzheimer's families began through a program called El Portal -- a Latino Alzheimer's project that was funded through the Alzheimer's DiseaseSupportive Services Program (ADSSP), once called the Alzheimer's Federal-State Matching Grant Program. Later I worked with Asian caregivers through another ADSSP-funded program, the API Dementia Care Network. Like many other elder care professionals in this community, this grant brought me into the Alzheimer's cause where I have worked for over 20 years.</p>
<p>As I look over the plan, I am concerned that I do not see any reference to this program. I believe it is the only federally-funded program that uniquely targets dementia patients and their families with support and education services. Specifically, this is a program that could help to fund the part of the plan devoted to populations disproportionately affected by AD and populations facing care challenges, such as racial and ethnic minorities (Strategy 2H). It could also be referenced in section 2.C.2 as it definitely enhances assistance to people with AD and their caregivers. This program supports and educates people with the disease and caregivers, a significant concern addressed in the plan.</p>
<p>I have heard that there is a possibility that funding for the worthy program may be eliminated and that it has already been reduced. I urge you to use the NAPA planning process to assure that this program remains in place and continues to help develop services for under-served, at-risk populations. It may not be a perfect program but it is the ONLY federal program supporting this work for patients with AD and their families.</p>
<p>Thank you for attending to my feedback. I hope it will strengthen our plan to prepare for the public health crisis that is Alzheimer's Disease.</p>

<p>We, Drs. Matthew P. Janicki and Seth M. Keller, are the co-chairs of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices. On behalf of the National Task Group, we wish to make our thoughts and recommendations available to the Advisory Council with respect to the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. To complement the National Alzheimer's Plan Act process, the National Task Group was convened and produced a report titled, "<strong><em>My Thinker's Not Working: A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports</em></strong>", which was designed, in part, to develop and enhance community care options for aging adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The National Task Group also issued the "<strong><em>National Dementia and Intellectual Disabilities Action Plan</em></strong>" as part of this report. The National Task Group issued this Action Plan in January 2012 in the hopes that it would promote better understanding of how adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities age and how dementia, in particular, affects them.</p>
<p>We note that the issues we identified in the National Task Group's report, which was submitted to the Advisory Council at its January 17th meeting, has many parallels with those raised in the Draft Plan. Our report summarized and addressed some of the challenges facing the nation due to the increasing rate of dementia found in older people with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities. Our report also noted that older adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities have special needs that at times require different actions than those provided for people in the general population. Alzheimer's disease affects everyone; but not everyone can be treated the same way when they are affected by this disease.</p>
<p>We have submitted these comments in order to clarify and provide feedback to the Advisory Council regarding its Draft Plan. First, we would like to note that the National Task Group is pleased that the Draft Plan contains mention of intellectual disabilities (in Strategy 2.H) as this group of Americans is composed of a significant number of individuals who are at exceptionally high risk for Alzheimer's disease. We also would like the Draft Plan to contain at least mention of some general issues that we have raised in our Report and also have more elaboration on some key specific issues affecting people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>Given this, we'd like to offer the following comments:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>Missing mention of the significance of Down syndrome in Alzheimer's research</strong></p>
<p>We are concerned that the text under Goal 1, neglects mention of the research with respect to the needs of people with Down syndrome, a group of individuals expressing a particular high risk for Alzheimer's disease. Certainly sustained research is warranted to better understand the etiology and course of dementia in this group of individuals. Additionally, notwithstanding the competing beliefs of whether research involving people with Down syndrome will benefit general research into the nature and cause of Alzheimer's disease, we feel that continued support of research concerning and involving people with Down syndrome will not only potentially benefit the general population, but will certainly benefit the thousands of adults aging with Down syndrome and who are at high risk for and are affected by early onset dementia. Like individuals with genetic mutations resulting in early onset Alzheimer's disease, individuals with Down syndrome also demonstrate early onset of symptoms and more research into this phenomenon is necessary. We would like to emphasize that focused research into a relatively homogeneous population such as individuals with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's dementia can provide important clues when generalizing to the larger population of people with Alzheimer's but absent Down syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include mention that given the high risk of Alzheimer's disease among adults with Down syndrome, there is the continued need for focused basic and treatment research involving people with Down syndrome -- and this should be included under Goal 1. </em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>We note with satisfaction that the Advisory Council's Draft Plan recognized the importance of the special programmatic and care challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities and included mention of this in Goal 2, under Strategy 2.H (Action 2.H.1). However, we would like to recommend that mention of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities receive mention earlier in this section, so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population. We would like to see the Draft Plan recognize that Alzheimer's disease mostly impacts adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in the same ways as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound effect due to particular risk factors - including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation. Further, under the Strategies noted under Goal 2, it is important to propose that any NAPA-related task forces created (as cited in the Draft Plan) not only look into improvements of care for this specific population, but also, and perhaps more importantly, increase awareness, improve screening and early recognition, and conduct population specific clinical trials involving adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include mention of the special circumstances of adults with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities earlier in the second section, so that it is clear that the Strategies included under Goal 2 apply equally to this population.</em></strong></p>
<p>Under Strategy 2.B, we would also like to recommend that mention be made of the challenges of carrying out effective screening and diagnoses for dementia among most individuals with intellectual disabilities due to their inherently varying abilities and cognitive functions. When nationally applicable instrumentation is developed or recommended it would be highly beneficial to make mention in the Draft Plan of the need for specialized screening instruments for use with adults with intellectual disabilities. The National Task Group is currently undertaking the development of such an administrative screen, which would have specific application to people with intellectual disabilities who otherwise may not be adequately or successfully screened by tools in existence and applicable to the general population. Recognition of this special need and work by the National Task Group would go far to gain acceptance of a regularized screen applicable to adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>We also would recommend -- adding text under Strategy 2.E -- that the notion that community care, as noted in the 2002 Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, be the paramount means of long-term 'dementia capable' care delivery. We note specifically the growing evidence-based research that is supporting the inclusion of small group homes -- as a viable assisted living model -- and their role as a potentially powerful alternative care setting for people with dementia, and in particular those with lifelong disabilities. Research in the intellectual disabilities services area has shown this model to be particularly effective in providing quality care for those adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of the special challenges in assessing and determining the presence of dementia in adults with certain intellectual disabilities and that any national guidelines produced contain this consideration.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We also strongly recommend the consideration of the use of small group homes for the community 'dementia capable' care of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia as backed by evidence-based research in the intellectual disabilities field.</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the special support needs of aging caregivers providing long-term in-home care of adults with intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>As many adults with intellectual disabilities and in particular those with Down syndrome remain in their family homes living with their parents or other family caregivers as they grow older, it is crucial that under Goal 3 inclusion of the challenges faced by these caregivers -- when providing care-at-home to their relatives with intellectual disabilities and dementia -- be given due mention. These 'life-long caregivers' warrant special attention in the Draft Plan as they are providing an important and crucial bulwark against costly institutionalization and oft-times inappropriate admissions to long-term care facilities. They are also often vexed by emerging symptoms of dementia in their adult children who have successfully mastered many general activities of daily living and now are manifesting decline. Special mention to the situations of these lifelong caregivers should be made in the Draft Plan. In this context, the National Task Group also recommends that Strategy 3.C.1. be amended to recognize that in many settings concerned with adults with intellectual disabilities, decisions are often made by proxy (and not by 'middle-aged adults') and that adults with intellectual disabilities are not the ones planning for their own long-term care needs. Thus, consideration should be given to enabling parents or other family members, providing primary care, to undertake productive long-term care planning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of the special challenges faced by life-long caregivers of some persons with intellectual disabilities. </em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention of the enhanced public education resources related to intellectual disabilities</strong></p>
<p>Under Goal 4, we strongly recommend including the needs of family caregivers and people with intellectual disabilities under public education campaigns and that the greater coordination efforts by government and the voluntary sector should get mention. As the state developmental disabilities authorities (agencies) are instrumental in helping organize state functions and programs with respect to intellectual and developmental disabilities it would be extremely beneficial to include these entities (and state developmental disabilities planning councils) in any public education efforts at the state level. Also, education and training for health professions with respect to aging individuals with dementia -- especially of the Alzheimer's type -- should be included as part of primary health care education. As there are health care disparities, an aggressive education campaign should involve universities, hospitals, emergency rooms and general medical specialists as it relates to cognitive and functional disability and its detrimental effect on caregivers and quality of life of the individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thus, we strongly recommend that the Draft Plan include consideration of additional and targeted efforts related to public and medical education so that these efforts have a functional effect on helping people with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.</em></strong></p>
</li>
</ol><p>The National Task Group recognizes that dementia has a devastating impact on all people -- including people with an intellectual disability and their friends, families and the staff who may be involved with them as advocates and caregivers. Given this, we are very pleased that the Advisory Council recognized the import of the special challenges faced by people with intellectual disabilities and included mention of this group in Strategy 2.H. We would hope for those adults with intellectual disabilities currently affected by dementia and those in the next generation who may be affected (as the timeline for the NAPA process encompasses the next 13 years) that the Advisory Council will recognize other areas of inclusion of the specific issues affecting individuals with intellectual disabilities within the Draft Plan and accept our recommendations for additional areas of mention and focus.</p>
<p>We trust the our comments and recommendations will be accepted in the spirit in which they are provided -- as the collective concerns and thoughts of a significant body of professionals, scientists, administrators, family caregivers and advocates, and persons personally affected by dementia -- who are represented by the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Mr. Ellenbogen for his supportive remarks regarding my comments on the National Plan to fight Alzheimer's disease. I hope that HHS and the Secretary will consider these comments as they revise the Plan. We are truly at a unique stage in our fight against Alzheimer's that will have implications for years to come. Developing an Office that is singly focused on coordinating and organizing efforts to fight Alzheimer's disease as well as to provide feedback to HHS and the Advisory Council as well as Congress is essential as we move forward. While there is certainly the possibility that this may step on toes within HHS and/or the NIH, it is something we literally cannot afford to do if we are serious in our efforts to fight Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, developing this infrastructure at the beginning of the Plan rather than years later will likely save money and lives into the future.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>

<p>I would like to commend and thank Bruce Lamb, who is an Alzheimer's researcher and Staff Scientist at Department of Neuroscience, in the Lerner Research Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. He shared his view points on January 13, 2012, under the SUBJECT: Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, in the public forum.</p>
<p>I found his view point's very interesting and highly recommend reading if you have not already done so. He also had an attachment that was titled, Right sizing funding for Alzheimer's disease, which was written by Todd E Golde, Bruce T Lamb, and Douglas Galasko and published May 6, 2011.</p>
<p><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/Comments/cmtach27.pdf">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/Comments/cmtach27.pdf</a></p>
<p>I really like these paragraphs, which I extracted for your reading.</p>
<p>If one assumes that funding for HIV/AIDS was right sized to enable translation of basic discoveries to successful therapies, then given the lack of effective AD therapies, one possible implication is that funding for AD has been insufficient. A quick comparison of funding levels for HIV/AIDs relative to AD in the United States suggests this may be at least one factor that has hindered the translation of AD discovery to effective therapies. Based on publicly available data, National Institute of Health funding for HIV/AIDS in the United States is currently approximately $3 billion [5]. With approximately 1 million HIV-positive subjects in the United States, this equates to $3,000 of NIH funding per person with HIV/AIDs. In contrast, current NIH funding for AD is at a level of approximately $450 million [5], with perhaps another approximately $100 million to $200 million in NIH funding that might have some relevance to the study of AD (cognitive decline in aging, related neuro degenerative conditions). With a current prevalence of approximately 5 million individuals affected with AD in the United States, this equates to a maximum of $130 of NIH funding per person affected with the disease. So, on a per affected individual basis, NIH funding for HIV/AIDs is 23 times the level of that for AD.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many different ways to evaluate proportional or relative funding. Another one that is quite germane is economic impact. For AD in the United States this is estimated at more than $170 billion per year (and worldwide at $600 billion per year) [6]. Again focusing only on the United States, the yearly funding for research by the NIH represents 0.4% of the yearly costs of the disease in the United States. In other words, for every $2 the disease costs the United States, we spend less than 1 cent on research.</p>
<p>There are many people who believe in reinventing the wheel when undertaking a new project or endeavor. I have always been a firm believer that the people before us have laid the framework need to get started so we are not wasting a lot of time on the basics. The only approach I always followed along with that is, to delete, enhance and critique to make the plan even better. I always did that by asking the previous plan makers what they realized they did wrong and what would they do different. Ninety percent of that frame work would usually come from the best of many minds. I really believe the input and suggestion made by Bruce Lamb, be discussed when building this framework.</p>
<p>One thing that keeps coming to mind is the disparity issue related to AD. Am I the only one that sees this, or do we all just not want to talk about it. For example AD was first identified and named in 1906, while AIDS was identified in 1981. I see us now in the same stages as HIV was in 1988, when a focused effort was begun towards treatment or cure, with the creation of The Office of AIDS Research. It took an additional 5 years to strengthen this OAR (The NIH Revitalization Act), which really made a huge difference. Within three years of that day and by 1996 we started to finally have an impact on AIDS.</p>
<p>Let's not make a similar mistake as we did with HIV. Let's create a diseased focused agency for AD, with all the necessary strength, as of day one. Just think you can make up for the disparity that has been created and just maybe we could have a cure in less than 5 years.</p>
<p>Let me leave you with one last thought that I have not heard or seen anywhere. I think the government should offer a large sum of money to anyone who can come up with the cure for this disease first. While I am not sure what that amount should be it can be in cash and partial tax credits. I think that will drive many more into this arena and more efforts if the pie is big enough. Just think of all the savings insurance companies can benefit, not to mention the government. They may all be willing to help in that funding. Just a though. Sometimes you have to be creative and think outside the box.</p>

<p>Cambridge Cognition offers the attached document for consideration.</p>

<p>Cambridge Cognition welcomes the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease. In response to the request for comments relating to Strategy 2.b 'ensure timely and accurate diagnosis', and action 2.B.2, 'identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools', the Committee is invited to consider a computerized solution; and the following is submitted:</p>
<ul><li>In the context of an annual wellness check and also in the context of early diagnostic assessment, the careful choice of an appropriate cognitive test is imperative. Many cognitive instruments do not measure with adequate sensitivity the changes in episodic memory that are the characteristic feature of early in course Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.</li>
<li>Cognitive assessments should be sensitive to the changes that occur at the early stages of dementia, norm-referenced, culturally unbiased, easy-to-use and standardized in administration. One example of such a test is the CANTAB Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test, a non-verbal, visuospatial measure of cued episodic memory.</li>
<li>Computerized assessments are a vital part of the future of cognitive testing. CANTAB PAL, a test presented on touch screen, is being used in leading scientific and clinical institutions worldwide and by major pharmaceutical companies in their clinical research. This widespread use has resulted in over 70 peer-reviewed publications in dementia. Across a number of studies, the PAL test shows very high levels of sensitivity and specificity in differentiating mild Alzheimer's disease from healthy aging and clinical depression. Furthermore, impaired performance on the PAL test has been shown to predict rate of subsequent cognitive decline in patients with MCI (Swainson et al., 2001; Blackwell et al 2004, 2005; Mitchell et al., 2009; Egarhazi et al 2007; Chandler et al 2008) and in community dwelling samples of older adults (de Jager et al., 2002, 2005). Performance on the PAL test has also been shown to be associated with CSF amyloid beta:tau levels (Barnett et al., 2011).</li>
<li>Beyond its scientific credibility, any test used in a primary care setting must be easy to use, fast and reliable. Ideally, the same test should also be appropriate for use within the context of a comprehensive diagnostic work-up.</li>
<li>Experience gained from the deployment of CANTAB PAL in over 1000 centres has shown that the elderly find the touch screen presentation intuitive and easy to interact with, accommodating a broader range of motor function than other computerized interfaces or even pencil and paper tests.</li>
<li>The wide availability of iPad and other similar devices enables CANTAB PAL to be made available to mainstream healthcare for the first time. This form of the test, known as CANTABmobile, is particularly well suited for use in primary care settings. By using adaptive methodology, the test is completed within 5-7 mins.</li>
<li>CANTABmobile offers key benefits in being both language invariant and culturally neutral. The test instructions are automatically administered using a voiceover in the language selected onscreen. Currently 18 language options are available within the test, including American English and Latin American Spanish. This facility reduces the cost of translation services and ensures patients are assessed quickly regardless of their language. The voiceover and automated stimulus presentation also enables full standardization in test delivery, allowing non-specialist health care professionals to administer the test, again reducing costs and improving quality.</li>
<li>The test takes 5-7 minutes, and automatically finishes if the patient fails at a given level, avoiding patient distress, and ensuring efficient use of time. The results are automatically scored comparing performance against a database of more than 4000 adults, fully adjusting for age, education and gender. The test instantly produces a single page report which clearly indicates the suggested action using a simple traffic light system. The report can be immediately emailed, printed or saved as a pdf.</li>
<li>The CANTABmobile test platform also includes computerised rating scales for depression and activities of daily living, fulfilling the criteria for other aspects of the wellness check, reducing risk of misclassification due to depression. The outputs for these are similarly included in the physician report.</li>
<li>Furthermore, CANTABmobile allows monitoring patients over time (Fowler et al 1995, 1997, 2002), and also anonymized data collation across systems, achieving the aim of facilitating public health outcomes research.</li>
<li>CANTABmobile has been developed for primary care physicians alongside a partner product covering a multi-domain toolkit designed for specialists.</li>
</ul><p>In summary, CANTABmobile delivers a high level of scientific rigor and patient/practitioner convenience. Furthermore, the computerized format enables many additional and desirable features. Embracing computerized solutions, both in primary and specialist services, will enable effective early detection of memory loss and provide an expedient route to diagnosis and intervention.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTARY RE: "DRAFT NATIONAL PLAN TO ADDRESS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE"</strong></p>
<p>With all due respect to the contributors and authors of this draft plan, I submit that, if finalized as written, it will do more to destroy the Alzheimer's community and set back any hope of progress toward a solution than anything seen to date in my lifetime.</p>
<p>WHY?</p>
<p>As written this is a blatantly politicized piece of campaign rhetoric. I, perhaps surprisingly, am a life-long Democrat and strong supporter of liberal causes who has burned a lot of shoe leather knocking on doors on behalf of liberal candidates starting with Adlai Stevenson in 1952, but I am and have been also a dementia caregiver for over 20 years. This Alzheimer's Disease issue SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY! THE PROBLEM IS APOLITICAL, AND SO SHOULD BE THE SOLUTION!</p>
<ol><li>Starting with the Vision Statement. There is NO better vision than that of The Alzheimer's Association - "A world without Alzheimer's Disease".</li>
<li>Certainly President Obama should be given credit for his support, and his supporting statement deserves recognition in the plan, but other people such as former House Speaker Gingrich deserve equal recognition for their contributions toward developing and supporting these efforts as well.</li>
<li>This entire issue of age related cognitive impairment (I've read that there are nearly 100 probable types/causes) deserves the support of EVERY citizen, whatever their political persuasion, and this draft plan mitigates any possibility of achieving that necessary broad level of support.</li>
<li>Further, in the 27 pages of text, I count at least 8 specific references to the "wonderful" AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. Why? One should be more than enough, Zero would be better since a) The administration is wavering on implementation with refusal to implement some parts of the law, b) the administration is providing multi-state waivers to other parts, c) there seems to be little agreement or consensus on interpretation of key elements among those few who have struggled to review those nearly 3000 pages, and lastly d) this controversial law has yet to be reviewed for constitutionality by The Supreme Court (partiallly or completely).</li>
</ol><p>I suggest that the intent of those statements can be preserved in a much less controversial way by simply replacing "Affordable Care Act" language with something like "existing and proposed legislation". I think that the PLAN might also allow for the possibility for proposing new, additional legislation should it be considered useful.</p>
<p>With respect to Strategy 1C, I feel it would be most appropriate to add an additional action to address the legal and ethical aspects of early detection. What about those people that show no signs of dementia but are discovered to have major plaque accumulations? Should they be told?</p>
<p>I agree that measurement of the disease's progression is extremely valuable to the caregivers, researchers, and medical professionals, but I think that more than imaging and biomarkers is needed. Today, the "gold standard" of American neurologists and gerontologists is probably the MMSE (Mini Mental State Exam), although many more assessment tools have been developed and found useful around the world. Of even more significance is the Allen Cognitive Scale measuring patients ability to contribute to their care in later stages. The PLAN should include recommendations for assessment tool standards to be applied nationwide in evaluating AD/Dementia progression for use in clinical trials, medical reporting, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Another observation formed from my having read the proposed draft report numerous times is that the research portion, despite expressing some valid points, still appears to be another somewhat disorganized "hip-shoot" relying on far too much luck and too little deliberate, well thought out planning. Dr. Eric Kandel said it best when he applauded the successes so far and recognized that this whole issue was extremely complex and we had a lot more to learn. The complexity of the challenges clearly represents a "system of systems" which the late Russell Ackoff defined to be a "mess". This entire program cries out for a well-organized systems engineering approach if any progress is to be made in an affordable, rapid manner. Ackoff would have been our guy, but perhaps a colleague or student of his might be found to accomplish this task as soon as possible. A few calls to the systems thinking community in Academia or the International Federation for Systems Research might identify some key people.</p>
<p>Speaking of complexity, I think we can rely on the following:</p>
<ol><li>Age related dementias (other than major vascular events) are slow in development (Some have said that AD may begin in a persons twenties).</li>
<li>AD mechanisms change as the disease progresses and as damage occurs.</li>
<li>Each stage may require markedly different treatments to achieve delay or prevention.</li>
</ol><p>Is it possible that we are discarding treatments because we are applying trials to an inappropriate stage of the disease? (or even to those that may be incorrectly diagnosed?) Can we confidently rely on the FDA to make the appropriate treatment decisions for all stages of AD? I assure you that the "front-line" families become more desperate as the disease continues it's slow progression. I further suspect that most people in the AD community care very little if the treatment is "FDA Approved". The issues really boil down to:</p>
<ol><li>Is the treatment available (anywhere in the world)?</li>
<li>Is the treatment affordable?</li>
<li>Where, when, and how can I get it?</li>
</ol><p>An example of a layman's assessment of possible "treatments" as of today is shown as Attachment 1 to this commentary.</p>
<p>With regard to rapidity, I also have seen other criticisms of the 2025 goal suggesting that a 2020 goal might be better. Certainly, I would like to see a goal of 2010, but I believe that 2025 might be attainable only if we restrict ourselves to those things that are in the "pipeline" today, which in turn have no guarantee of success. I would urge you to consider scheduling several goals, with separate time objectives, recognizing that we are in a cancer or AIDS-like program that might take 50 years to find a "cure". By the way, I also noted that "finding a cure" is not in the list of research objectives. Have you given up?</p>
<p>I would suggest starting as follows:</p>
<ol><li>Identify and treat risks (2012) - Suggestions for good/bad environmental and diet approaches (subject to vary with time and knowledge -- remember discarding our aluminum cookware?) This is like "No Smoking" in the fight against cancer.</li>
<li>Slow and/or stop degradation (2015) This is partially available now for those who respond to Aricept/Namenda combo treatment. Solutions are needed for the large number of people who do NOT respond favorably.</li>
<li>Early Prevention (2020)</li>
<li>Minimize Symptoms (2022)</li>
<li>Delay Onset (2025)</li>
<li>Reversal of Afflictions (2050) - "THE CURE"!!!!</li>
</ol><p>Of course, the above dates are unsupported figments of my imagination, but I hope you see the concept here.</p>
<p>I also found some statements and titles in the described actions that gave me a "where did this come from" moment. Namely, Action 1.B.3 that discusses clinical trials and international outreach. Do you intend to request non-citizens, off-shore, to participate in our clinical trials? This needs some explanation. Another point that underwhelmed me was Action 1.B.4. Is this just pro-forma government speak or is there a real point? Frankly, I am of the very solid opinion that Alzheimer's Disease is about as racially and ethnically diverse and unbiased in selection as is possible in all of humanity. Are you implying that there is bias in the clinical trial community? Is there managed selectivity in who gets the "stuff" and who gets placebo? I highly doubt that! In fact, I doubt that your assumption of higher risk for AD being either racially or ethnically related has any validity at all. I submit that the REAL reason for those observations lie in differences in life-long histories of environment, diet, and health care practices. For example, we are fairly certain that Americans (of my generation) of Greek or Italian ethnic heritage are at lower AD risk levels, most likely due to preferences for a mostly Mediterranean Diet. This risk reduction may not apply to younger generations if they've switched to Drive-Thru Bacon Cheeseburgers. In any case, I suggest that tracking data on historical environment, diet, and health care practices will be much more meaningful, and tracking racial/ethnic populations as suggested will provide little or no contribution toward improved outcomes.</p>
<p>A small, but significant, item that I have some issues with is the stated expected cost of nursing home care at $78,000. A much more representative (and far more meaningful) number can be shown if it were expressed as a range of state cost averages ($70,000 to $150,000) and further adjusted to determine the level of pre-tax retirement income required to sustain the nursing home option (don't forget to include costs for incidentals like toothpaste, shaving cream, haircuts as well as Medicare parts B,C, and D with those costs adjusted for "means testing").</p>
<p>I suspect you will be looking at $150,000 to $250,000 per year. Thus it will be much easier to understand the future economic pressures on Medicaid and will go a long way toward determining the adequacy of an individual's long-term-care planning.</p>
<p>Also, I am very disappointed that this draft plan promulgates the social stigmas so dreaded by those in the Alzheimer's community. I understand the enticement to encourage high funding levels and popular support through fear, but I believe this is counterproductive to the tasks of living with and caring for those with AD. I am also a strong supporter of redefining those people as being "deeply forgetful" as opposed to "Alzheimer's victims", "Alzheimer's sufferers", "Senile individuals", "People with Dementia" or "Cognitively Impaired". Please realize that NOBODY wants to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It WILL rapidly result in loss of life-long friendships, loss of independence, loss of self, loss of peer respect, etc. This is clearly why early diagnoses seldom happen, and why public education is SO important. The stigma extends and becomes tragic when overzealous and uneducated agents of Adult Protective Services who believe the unsupported and unproven claims spread throughout the Elder Abuse channels of government that "most elder abuse comes from spousal and parental relatives/caregivers". I believe that too many malicious prosecutions are executed throughout the country due to proliferation of this myth. Occasionally, States have admitted to errors, documented those errors, and revised state policies (see "HANDCUFFED" by Wisconsin DHS). Other states rigidly support their mistaken beliefs, and I have seen personally the destruction of families, and early, wrongful patient deaths not to mention large legal costs to these families or to the states if public defense is necessary.</p>
<p>Many caregiving families are threatened daily by the health care/ adult protection bureaucracy. Has no one heard of self-inflicted injuries due to agitation? This is why nursing homes use Posey Mitts (soft handcuffs) and load their patients with unwanted drugs. Should patients be arrested and confined if a caregiver is injured? Should caregivers be arrested and confined if a patient exhibits self-inflicted injuries? Should a caregiver be arrested and confined if a patient is inadvertently injured or bruised during an effort to protect another innocent person? Or attempting to protect the general public? Should families be destroyed, Power of Attorney ignored, and spouses of 50 years be separated without visitation upon arrest, with NO conviction? The Plan's legal advisors would provide a great service to the community by prioritizing for both home and professional caregiver's a list of who should get protection/arrest first: a) the general public, b) close bystanders, c) professional caregivers, d) home caregivers, e) spouses and children/parents, or f) the "deeply forgetful" themselves.</p>
<p>Lastly, some comments on caregiving support needs. The PLAN needs to clearly state as part of Goal 2 that the priority is to provide for in-home care as long as possible in order to provide more favorable outcomes, extend life and quality of life at less cost to both families and government taxpayers. My own personal experiences indicate that respite care for family caregivers and supervised productive day care experiences for the "deeply forgetful" are absolutely mandatory to the achievement of this objective. The only successful application that I have seen was a 1991-1992 experimental program in the State of Georgia with several counties participating. While I understand this program has ended, I believe it was well documented, and I guarantee that as implemented it was indeed a lifesaving experience for participants and caregivers.</p>
<p>As to Nursing Homes, reducing the inappropriate use of anti-psychotics is a good start, but further improvements are necessary, and should begin with significant modification to the criteria by which state licensing authorities evaluate these facilities. Current criteria covers physical safety very well, but ignore many quality of life issues that affect the "deeply forgetful" residents. We often need to remind ourselves that the deeply forgetful are NOT "empty shells", but simply require unique communication techniques. The Plan should look specifically at the results achieved by advanced compassionate thinking in facilities modeled after Lakeview Ranch, those practicing The Eden Alternative, Montessori based care for the "deeply forgetful" and suggest significant modifications to existing licensing and evaluation criteria that could be addressed by all State Licensing Authorities. Also, I am told that many facilities consider it to be too costly to maintain and update resident's care plans, apparently in direct violation of federal laws. This may be lack of education, but certainly indicates lack of enforcement.</p>
<p>Hospitalization offers additional caregiver challenges. "Deeply forgetful" patients require special care, and have special needs above and beyond normal expectations. Electronic (although privacy protected) records are a great idea but should be expanded to include primary caregiver advice and concerns. Hospital personnel need to understand time, behavior, and observation problems as well as the patient's inability to express needs, particularly if in discomfort and pain. Similar observations might be made about any social situation that is not a part of daily routine and familiar people. Examples such as travel (particularly by air), home care visitations, family outings, and especially holidays come readily to mind. People that interact with the "deeply forgetful" need to know that respect and personal dignity are paramount.</p>

<p>Attention:<br />
					2012 Public Comments on the National Plan for Alzheimer's Disease and the National Alzheimer's Project Act</p>
<p>Proposal: Early Stage Dementia Care (STAR-10R), a New Thinking For Dementia Care:<br /><strong>STAR-10R (Non-medication Dementia Care): PREVENTION, JOBS, &amp; $1B+ Annual Healthcare Savings</strong></p>
<p>Background:<br />
					STAR-10R has been developed over more than two decades and it is the most innovative and pioneering proactive system of Dementia Care and methods in existence today. It is intended for Early Stage Dementia and it is presently the only comprehensive non-medication alternative for Dementia Care. Through innovative and proprietary methods and techniques, STAR-10R addresses the top 10 most prominent ("10R's") and well known symptoms of Dementia while patients are still within the Early Stages of Dementia (i.e, stages 1-3). It proactively intercepts and intervenes with the known symptoms, rather than an existing "wait and see" or "cause &amp; effect" approach. Our approach and principles with STAR-10R, also sets the stage for a major overhaul in our traditional "cause &amp; effect" Healthcare system, which is outdated at best. In other words, STAR-10R could be the foundation of a new dawn in Preventive Healthcare system for all Americans alike. STAR-10R is also aimed at reducing medication side-effects, by reducing medication, inherent in the cases associated with excessive medication. The latter is usually the case with each occurring Dementia symptom.</p>
<p>Implementation:<br />
					STAR-10R can be implemented at minimal cost, by giving the Healthcare professionals the new tools that they simply do not have through traditional means or existing services. STAR-10R can be implemented by Communities of all classes and categories including Memory Care Units, Assisted Living, Nursing Homes, Home Agencies among others.</p>
<p>Implications:<br />
					STAR-10R is intended for the Early Stages of Dementia and will reduce medication, side-effects and cost of healthcare, all while having the potential to create many thousands of new (and badly needed) highly skilled professional jobs in America. STAR-10R, relatively speaking, costs little to implement. For every $10M investment in its implementation, STAR-10R can serve at least 10,000 Early Stage Dementia patients. That is only $1K annual investment in Dementia Care using our intervention methods, where as the same patients would have otherwise cost in excessive $100K+ annually per Dementia patient, only 3 years later, as they would otherwise progress rapidly through Dementia Stages. In other words, that $10M implementation investment for every 10,000 Early Stage Dementia could save $10M in Dementia Care cost for every 10,000 Seniors (meaning the system pays for itself, and ends up costing nothing). Having said that, when considering the projected increase in baby-boomer population and the relevant projection in Dementia population increase, over the next 10 years the savings to the nation can be well in excess of $10B annually, just in Dementia Care alone. This would mean a savings of $100B over the next 10 years. This will, most definitely, make a major dent in our national debt that is presently out of control! STAR-10R will also help America take a global leadership role in Dementia Care and Intervention and Prevention methods. For more information, please visit our non-marketing and highly information web site below. Thank you for taking this note worthy proposal in consideration; savings alone worth the implementation of this proposal, to say nothing about the impact on Quality of Life for our Seniors, all while offering more Hope to families and better alternatives to traditional wait/see/medicate/spend approach of symptom treatment.</p>

<p>What EXACTLY is HHS and NIH doing to ensure that people who are enrolled in your Medical (Human) Research and Clinical Trials that you are desperately trying to recruit Alzheimer's patients for have the CAPACITY to give INFORMED CONSENT?</p>
<p>History has shown that some of the most abusive governments in History used vulnerable elderly and incapacitated patients for medical and human research. This was addressed international laws and federal laws in this country.</p>
<p>As an elder rights advocate, I am extremely concerned about the mad rush to do testing on individuals who have been declared incompetent or incapacitated and who do not have the capacity to give informed consent. No surrogate decision maker should be allowed to give informed consent on behalf of any other human being. The surrogate decision maker cannot feel the pain and horrific side effects and the incapacitated person with Alzheimer's may suffer immensely but not be able to even communicate the pain they are involuntarily being forced to endure.</p>
<p>What do you plan to do about this? An all out campaign is needed to HALT any plans to use incapacitated Alzheimer's and dementia patients for human research trials (including drug and other medical research) without informed consent being provided by the individual who will be subjected to the human research and testing!</p>
<p>The press needs to get involved in warning the American people about this travesty.</p>
<p>Please let me know what we can do to ensure that these concerns are addressed.</p>

<p>In relation to your research,published by the European College on Psychopharmacology, published by Reuters agency on 05.09.2011, from Prof.Dr.Hans-Ulrich Wittchen,I'm sending you the attached material.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>SCREEN OF THE HEALTH IN THE HAIRY BACK</strong></p>
<p>Today we are living in a wold filed with tension, broken families, psychological whirlpool and local wars.The human self is torn apart, and it seems that prevents milion of people from being together and free.We consider that the reason for this is the Syndrom of the Emotional Breakdown (SEB),that has a visible external sign.We are convinced that there is a functional virus,that penetrates the limbic system of the human barain,as a result of improper emotional impact.</p>
<p>Reretfully,during the course of evolution,the human had developed his brain to a level,to be able to hurt himself by means of thoughts.There exist mental viruses,or functional viruses.They cause a contamination in the emotional assessments of the humans,and as a result of this he develops a diagnoses SEB.The contaminated person generates in the course of his daily life toxic thoughts that create in egological contamination.</p>
<p>In a person living with SEB, in the hairy back of the head could be visualised a red patch in different shades - from light pink , through bright red, to dark purple.It could be on spots , or on well-seen red figures- different variants exist.When the patch becomes dark purple, it means that this individuals is about 30-40 hours away from death.</p>
<p>We consider that the SEB is a reason for destruction of personality, the reason makes people live in disharmony with themselves and with society.</p>
<p>How could Homo Spiens be infected with the SEB f.virus?</p>
<p>By receiving improper emotional value,quarrel in a bus, short negative telefone conversation, scolding a child for breaking by accident the Christmas toy, not keeping the right of way on a crossroad, watching a conflicting T.V. show - in short experiencing negative feeling. (1)</p>
<p>The very act of infecting is a mental action, armed at hurting someone.In such a way an individual,or the society as a whole could be infected.Each person is in constant contact with other.Even the mere presence without talking, or seeing is a form of contact.</p>
<p>Long time ago the man had invented the mental weapon, but still there is no vaccine, or some kind of defence against the negative impact, that only humans are able to inflict upon each other.That is why when we are hurting others, we are hurt ing also ourselves.</p>
<p>After the f.virus gets in the limbic system it may be inactive for a period of time - sometimes it may take years before it strikes the host.An egological contamination of the planet is being created.</p>
<p>It has been observed, that in infants, the patch dissapears after a proper drug treatmentand parents care.There are adults with a well visible path, their body is fightingto reach the necessary balance.</p>
<p>A man is a buld in such a way, that from the day he was born till his last day he fights with the debalancing cataclysms.All the known pharmakopea exist in the human body - it is a system by itselfs. The patch is like a screen that reflects one's health status.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,still the drug or the vaccine to fight the SEB is not invented. There is a danger to human health when the SEB becomes host's essence. The f.virus contaminates the emotional assessment,which like a ruffled mirror reflects the incoming emotional values feelings like agression,envy,hatread, jealousy,indifference,addictional to alkohol, drugs,gambling,lonelines and pathology like diabetes,AIDS,cancer,cirrhosis, etc - the list could be quite long.There are different medical brands,fighting to balance the existing total disbalance.</p>
<p>For better clarity in determing the degree of contamination the following levels of SEB are distinguished:</p>
<p>Level 1<br />
					Humans,trying to get into conflict at first opportunity, or that are impartial to the suffiring of the surrounding people.The most typical feelings of these people are agression, hatred,jealiusy, greediness.The patch is light pink in colour,small in siza, andvery dangerous to to the host himself and to the surrounding.Family quarrels, cold blooded and cruel murders, divorces, etc. are due to the fighting hormons in the blood and cells of the host.We observe these people not as defendants,but as victims.Of course according to the law, everybody is responsible for his own actions.The people at 1-st level are most dangerous for themselves, and for the society as a whole.Their live is subjected to this plague of 21-st centuary.</p>
<p>Level 2- This level is causing the world economic crisis!<br />
					People that are infected with Level 2 cannot make a reightful assessment of the necessity of the investments for the benefit of the society.If we appoint a Level 2 infected person at leading position at a financial structure,the collaps of the institutiun is immienent. This condition is known as business destroyer.These are people that cannot distinguish between a friendly and enemy hand.Such people have difficulty finding a job, and cannot find their place in prosperous structures, if ultimately they get into such structures, it is for a very short time - 2 - 3 months.The patch is like drops of spray - small, red and very dangerous for the host's business.Such person is better not be an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Level 3<br />
					This is the level of the addicted to drugs, alcohol, tobacco, gambling, etc.These people think that being healthy or not is out of theirmanageability. Is there an alcoholic that considers that alcohol is dangerous to his health? Is there a gambler who does not belive that with the next bid he will get back the lost money, of not today, then tomorrow? The patch is red and big.It is very difficult to get out of this level, and it will long time.Large part of the body is contaminated, and this could be overcome only with relevant therapy and will.</p>
<p>Level 4<br />
					This is level of chronic diseases like diabetes, cancer high blood pressure, apathy, depression, psoriasis, etc. The patch is very big and pink to purple in colour.People at this level are better strict to medecines an diets, known to the traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Level 5<br />
					Level 5 is litle known, because there is no coming back.The patch is big purple - a warning that death is knocking on the door. Mothers had observed such patch at the back of their children that commited sucide.The patch dissapears 12 hours after death.</p>
<p>It is possible to suffer from chronic illness, without having SEB.It is possible to live the whole live without SEB.The patch is like a screen of the health status that warns, that if body could not cope by itself, it will need appropriate intervention - medical, egological or surgical.Many people live having the patch, but SEB had not turned to be their essence.</p>
<p>When SEB controls the man?</p>
<p>When the emotional perception is constantly distrubed.In a strong way the f.virus modifies the incoming emotional values.It is known, that when the SEB f.virus settles in the limbic system of the Homo Sapiens, it transforms the impulses to the pituitary. In the limbic system are built chains of neurous lymbic ways.Some of them by means of the talamic cores end in the cortex.In such a way the impulses coming from the limbic system are integrated into the nervous system.</p>
<p>Other ways end in the hypotalamic cores.Through the cores the functional influence is transmitted to the cores the functional influience is transmitted to the pituitary gland and to the entire endocrine system. Trough these ways an influence is effected also on the vegetative visceromotor cores.Thus the activity of the limbic system is interconnected with the endocrine orgnas, locomotive organs, the heart. They participate in the emotional behavoir of the individual.</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Advisory Council for developing goals and strategies that address the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families within the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Also significant is the Advisory Council's action to set a timely objective for the development of effective prevention and treatment modalities in the Framework. Enclosed please find comments on the Framework developed by LEAD around research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development. We hope that the Advisory Council will consider these comments and recommendations as it advises on a national strategic plan for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The comments and recommendations provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals and supporting strategies within the Framework. However, it is important to note that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private and non-profit sectors and by establishing quantified metrics to track progress. LEAD strongly urges that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be allocated to each of the outlined goals and strategies included in the final national plan. Furthermore, each goal and strategy outlined in the final national plan should include a targeted budget with assigned milestones and metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established four workgroups -- one each in the areas of research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the Alzheimer's community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has set an aggressive goal to develop effective prevention and treatment modalities for Alzheimer's disease by 2025. The lack of tools such as biomarkers and an understanding of the biological basis of Alzheimer's disease currently impede the ability to appropriately address the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. The strategies outlined in the Framework have the potential for accelerating the therapeutic pipeline and rapidly translating basic science into new therapies for people with Alzheimer's disease. Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1:</p>
<p><em><strong>1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones </strong></em></p>
<p>With limited resources, private and public funders of Alzheimer's research must develop methods to coordinate research funding to assure that resources are spent strategically on the most promising areas and that investments are outcome-oriented and accountable. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council will consider input from the upcoming May 2012 National Institute on Aging Conference, which will seek to identify strategies and milestones to slow progression, delay onset and prevent Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, LEAD recommends the following:</p>
<ul><li>Development of methods to more efficiently and expeditiously determine diagnosis, prognosis and response to therapies using appropriate biomarkers and genetic markers.</li>
<li>Development of methodologies and tools needed to quantify the outcomes of interventional approaches that are more sensitive--but relevant--indicators of therapeutic effectiveness. While such research should include biomarkers and genetic markers, the primary focus should be related to the identification of more relevant clinical endpoints that may ultimately be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of novel therapeutic approaches. It is essential that such research be closely aligned with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) so that any progress in the field can be rapidly adopted by regulators, thereby expediting regulatory review and patient access to successful therapeutics.</li>
<li>Development of better methods to study individuals who are non-symptomatic or have mild cognitive impairments to effect better prediction of risk factors, primary and secondary prevention, and effective delay in progression.</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>To enhance research and drug development aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, the Advisory Council should advocate for the use of large-scale patient registries to facilitate faster and less expensive clinical trial recruitment. To assist this effort, public and private sectors should work together to address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation. Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a specific study and narrow purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data is essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. LEAD recommends a mechanism be developed to let patients opt into having their de-identified data used for broader research purposes that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The National Plan should also encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) which will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data rich in biomarker information should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's Disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p>While Alzheimer's disease researchers have identified promising candidate biomarkers, providing the level of evidence needed for qualification by the FDA requires additional data and rigorous analysis. Such efforts are beyond the scope and resources of companies or academic researchers and are best carried out through existing public-private partnerships such as the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Also, the lack of standardization for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes can delay the FDA from qualifying a biomarker for use in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Standardization of analytic methods together with establishing a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards, therefore, should be part of any national Alzheimer's research strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, quantitative clinical disease progression models should be developed to inform the design of Alzheimer's disease clinical trials in the evaluation of new medicines. These models would offer a tool to differentiate between symptomatic and disease-modifying drug effects, as well as help determine the optimal sample sizes and sampling times. A disease model will also help to identify subpopulations with unique characteristics for trials, and assess the impact of baseline disease severity on drug response.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>The Advisory Council should consider the term "presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease treatment" to refer to those interventions that are initiated before apparent cognitive decline and are intended to reduce the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease-related symptoms. This will accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, address uncertainties surrounding the term "prevention" and be more acceptable to regulatory agencies conducting reviews of clinical trials. In addition, a cognitive assessment tool should be developed that can be used to assess therapies at earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a patient registry of subjects that can be used for prevention trials. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease. Finally, biomarkers should be identified for tracking earlier cognitive decline by developing consensus on the scientific evidence.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends the establishment of a central Alzheimer's disease research coordinating entity within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This entity should maintain the authority and ability to convene inter-agency and non-government constituencies, domestically and internationally. We propose that the entity gather and distribute data, and make recommendations to the HHS Secretary for federal policy regarding funding strategies for stopping Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In addition, an international action plan against Alzheimer's disease should be developed by nations with national Alzheimer's disease plans in place or in progress. Developing a plan is an important first step to coordinate efforts against this global challenge. The global plan should include efforts to standardize biomarkers and surrogate end-points, coordinate surveillance and enhance regulatory cooperation. Any global effort should also include funds for research, strategies for cost containment efforts and goals to improve the delivery of clinical care and long term services.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the Framework will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans that require care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are additional strategies that could, if implemented, improve care quality and efficiency for people with Alzheimer's disease:</p>
<p><em><strong>2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings </strong></em></p>
<p>To achieve quality care and a safe transition for people with Alzheimer's disease between care settings, it is imperative that healthcare professionals are more adequately reimbursed for services such as comprehensive, longitudinal evaluation and management services, acute and chronic psychiatric management, evaluation of cognitive function (including psychometrics) and caregiver education and counseling.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems </strong></em></p>
<p>Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in both public and private hospital settings. In addition, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the Advisory Council should advocate for the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure the translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors, and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such Centers will also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>Often, even though a physician has identified cognitive impairment, the diagnosed individual and his or her family are not told of the diagnosis. Further, once a diagnosis is made and disclosed, as few as half of diagnosed individuals and families receive counseling, support or information about next steps, which would include available home care support, long-term care, and palliative care options and qualifications. This information is important, especially for individuals in the early- stage of the disease who experience positive outcomes when physicians are involved in planning and advance care counseling.</p>
<p>It is especially important that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated early in the disease process about palliative and hospice care. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><em><strong>New Strategy: Ensure People with Alzheimer's Disease and their Families Have Access to New Alzheimer's Therapies </strong></em></p>
<p>As new biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease over the coming years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented through regulation. This will be particularly important as CMS continues to improve the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of the Medicare program. Due to the absence of spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, it could cause an ACO to be "penalized" for providing the new treatment to its patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse the new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes goals and strategies seeking to improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that strategies are included that would help individuals with Alzheimer's disease remain in the community by establishing infrastructure to provide resources for family caregivers and support planning for long-term care needs. It is important that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Framework:</p>
<p><em><strong>3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally-Sensitive Education, Training and Support Materials by all Health and Social Service Providers who Interact with People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><em><strong>3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being </strong></em></p>
<p>In order to meet the unique care requirements of this population, the Advisory Council must advance proven federal, state and local programs supporting both the diagnosed individual and family. While Federal programs are in place that provide many of the services required by people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level, additional funds should be appropriated to implement evidence-based, non-pharmacologic interventions for people with dementia and their family members.</p>
<p>LEAD members are concerned with the current and proposed cuts to the Administration on Aging's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP). ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their families, and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve goal 3 in the Framework funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level.</p>
<p>Below is a list of successful federal programs that the Advisory Council should include and expand upon under strategy 3B in the final plan:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>

<li>It seems to me that the value of solid reproducible fundamental research should be more emphasized. At present, there are many stories coming out in the AD field in major journals almost every week, but at least some of these stories, may be the majority even, turn out to be simply wrong after closer consideration. I have the impression that we need to emphasize that at present there really are not that many 'translatable' research findings, and that obtaining a better fundamental definition of the underlying biology may be boring, but is necessary.</li>

<td>HHS and its Federal partners will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease and manage and treat its symptoms. HHS will build on recent advances and expand research to identify molecular underlying mechanisms in areas such as genetics, protein aggregation, neurovascular biology, and the cell and molecular biology of the nervous system to identify risk and protective factors as well as new candidate therapies. To achieve this strategy, new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions.</td>

<td>To me, an important part of the initiative is "Strategy 1.B Enhance Scientific Research..." The FDA really does need to "<strong>aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease</strong>". Human clinical trials provide crucial information about which targets and mechanisms are most valid and currently they are a bottle neck for advancing our understanding. Basic research using transgenic models has identified a large number of potential mechanisms and targets, but we won't know which leads are most promising until they are tested in humans. There is increasing evidence that the disease process starts well before cognitive symptoms, so clinical trials designed to prevent AD could be the key to providing a therapeutic breakthrough.</td>

<td>Amy R. Borenstein, Ph.D., FAAN James A. Mortimer, Ph.D, FAAN (University of South Florida (via Alz Forum))</td>
<td>We and others have shown that given a level of pathology, people with more brain reserve can delay their symptoms of AD. What has not been done is to test interventions that increase brain reserve in population-based samples in the community. Most intervention studies of non-pharmacologic agents thus far have used volunteer subjects. We don't know which non-pharmacologic interventions work best in the population at large, and we don't know the relative ranking of such interventions, or if and how they interact with one another. Also, we feel strongly that interventions should be done on information that is personalized. In other words, someone who does not exercise and smokes should be targeted on these factors, whereas someone else who is obese and has diabetes should be targeted on those factors. Also, while biomarkers indicate that we can predict about 10 years before symptoms who is going down a malignant trajectory vs. a more normal trajectory, we know that the pathology of AD develops over decades, and that prevention must occur at a much younger age.
<p>								Therefore, what is needed in the NAPA are community-based studies of young-middle aged adults. We would need to gather careful epidemiologic data, including family history, head trauma, vascular diseases, exercise habits, diet, cognitive and social stimulation, and measures such as BMI, waist and head circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, insulin levels, DNA (APOE and others) and follow these populations over time with neuropsychologic measures and perhaps with MRI. AD is a complex disease occurring probably over the lifespan, and if we had a large enough population-based study we could design the study cleverly so that we can see what is happening at different, say, 5-year age groups over the life course (beginning perhaps as low as 20).</p>
<p>								Biomarkers are good for predicting high-risk individuals about 10 years before symptoms occur. This is occurring over a back-drop of decades of accumulating pathologies. We don't just want to predict who is at high risk - we want to take those people (and perhaps those at moderate risk) and put them into prevention programs to delay onset of the disease. If we only have the prediction part and not the prevention part, we will not be successful in Goal 1. The study does not have to be decades long, but it must have a sufficient number of people to accomplish the goal of discovering which preventions work best (by explaining the population attributable risk) and which interact.</p>
<p>								We have proposed such a study to be done in China where there is a lot of vascular brain disease and where it is easy to get thousands of people involved on a detailed research level but while we were well reviewed in study section our grant did not get funded. Dr. Mortimer and I would be happy to be involved in the design of an observational/interventional epidemiologic study in population-based subjects of primary preventions.</p></td>

<td>David Holtzman (Washington University School of Medicine)</td>
<td>Significant advances in the use of imaging and biomarkers in brain, blood, and spinal fluids have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease, track its progression and monitor the effects of treatment in people with the disease. Without these advances, these neurodegenerative processes could only be evaluated in non-living tissues. Accelerated research will improve and expand the application of biomarkers in research and practice. These advances have shown that the brain changes that lead to Alzheimer's disease begin up to 15 years before symptoms. Identifying imaging and other biomarkers in presymptomatic people will facilitate earlier diagnoses in clinical settings, as well as aid in the development of more efficient interventions to slow or delay progression. While additional work needs to be done on biomarkers, we have enough information now that should allow secondary prevention trials in presymptomatic people to begin immediately with the most effective therapies.</td>

<td>When these trials fail, they don't tell us anything useful because the rationale for testing them was that they were harmless rather than their targets were implicated in the disease. They need to be more aggressive in testing other compounds that have a strong mechanistic rationale for prevention. If the government thinks that it will just "continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials", then they are blowing smoke because what they are doing now is not aggressive. In cancer trials, the FDA has approved trials where the treatment has killed a substantial percentage of the group because it had the potential to cure some of them and they were all going to die soon anyway. The FDA just doesn't look at AD the same way. The most significant thing to accomplish is to change the way the FDA looks at clinical trials for AD. We have lots of targets and drugs that just aren't getting tried on a reasonable time frame.</td>

<ul><li>Make "third party" or "pass through" Alzheimer's organizations (such as Cure Alzheimer's Fund) eligible for federal funding. The funding should NOT be used for organizational overhead or indirect expenses, but should be used by the organization to fund breakthrough Alzheimer's research. Such organizations are excellent "aggregators" and consortia builders --- much better than the research institutions themselves which have more of an interest in funding their own institutions. Private, non-bricks-and-mortar organizations are designed to put together leading researchers for innovative research. Help from the government for these kinds of initiatives has the potential to move the field much farther much faster.</li>
<li>Similarly, there should be more opportunity for co-funding of projects from government and private entities.

Currently, promising research and interventions are published in the research literature and presented at scientific meetings. Additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, industry, and public health systems quickly and accurately.

<td>I feel there is a gap there on a larger scale although there have been some good examples as well how to breach that gap. One problem when you talk with clinicians is that many of them still view Alzheimer's disease to be a very separate category from so-called 'vascular-dementia', although vascular factors and circulatory problems in brain including blood-brain barrier problems have been frequently indentified in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In that regard the present document is not clear about whether the goal will be to cure dementias of either Alzheimer's type or so-called vascular, which to my own bias is only a different phenotypic expression of similar diseases that in some cohorts more openly shows vascular feature than in others. I feel this issue should be addressed somehow because this might impact the numbers.
<p>								Another gap is between genetic studies and the biology of disease. For example, we still do not know how mutations in some genes that have been recently associated with sporadic AD relate to the biology of disease. More specific emphasis perhaps can be placed on these studies.</p>
<p>								In general it will be great to expand Strategy 1E with some more specific examples. But, perhaps that can be done after the May summit which I understand should provide some concrete guidance on the research priorities. Are we going to be represented at the May summit?</p></td>

<ol><li><strong>Committing Additional Resources to Research</strong><br />
										The planned NIA sponsored conference in May 2012 will provide invaluable insight into the goals and strategies required to achieve the goal of a treatment/prevention by the year 2025. However, while a reorganization and coordination across all research domains will increase research productivity, without additional research funds, the goals of having a treatment/prevention by 2025 is likely unattainable. There is currently no effective treatment for AD and thus additional funds are necessary to promote basic research, translational research, drug development and clinical research. Currently, funding rates at NIH and most non-profits is in the single digits (5-10% of all grant being funded), thus leaving a very large number of meritorious applications (the top 20-25%) unfunded. If we are truly serious about achieving the goals set forth in the Draft Framework, additional federal, non-profit and industrial investments in Alzheimer's research have to be part of the answer. While there will likely a considerable debate about the exact amount of investment required to achieve this goal, a starting point would likely be $2 billion/year as put forward in the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2010. As clearly laid out in the attached paper by myself, Dr. Todd Golde and Dr. Doug Galasko, similar types of investments in other diseases (i.e., HIV/AIDS) have proven transformative and lead to effective therapies. While I appreciate that the current funding climate is very tight and highly political, it is only with these types of investments are we likely to transform the Alzheimer's research endeavor and achieve Goal 1 of the Framework.</li>
<li><strong>Strategies/Goals</strong><br />
										The conference in May of 2012 will certainly help identify the key research areas that need to be addressed to achieve Goal 1 of the Framework. As part of the detailed National Plan, it will be important to both identify these targets as well as commit funding commensurate to achieve the goals identified. Funding one research domain at the expense of another with not enable us to achieve the ultimate goal laid out in the Framework. For each target, clear goals must be identified and a infrastructure/organization (see below) put in place to regularly assess progress within these areas.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure/Organization</strong><br />
										To achieve Goal 1 of the Framework, it will be absolutely critical to have an infrastructure and organization that can coordinate federal research efforts across all funding agencies, interact with non-profits and industry, promote awareness of the disease and the role that research will play in combating the disease as well as reporting to the Advisory Council directly as outlined in the Framework. In order for this organization/infrastructure to be truly successful and transformative, it will be essential that its efforts are entirely focused on combating Alzheimer's disease. This will provide a uniquely focused organization that will have the most chance of success. A similar "disease-focused" agency was created in 1988 for HIV/AIDS entitled the "Office of AIDS Research" (OAR) within the Office of the NIH Director, that played a key role in successfully coordinating the federal response to AIDS. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 strengthened the OAR, providing it with increased authority in the planning, coordination and evaluation of AIDS research. If we are truly serious about transforming Alzheimer's research and achieving the goals laid out in the Framework, a similar type of organizational structure (perhaps an Office of Alzheimer's Research?) is required.</li>

<td>My bias is to support Goal 1 of the Draft Framework in order to raise urgency, create more awareness and focus resources on the issue.
<p>								However, for this to be an effective strategy, we need to be able to:</p>
<ol><li>Set a time limit as is being suggested.</li>
<li>Define the goal as precisely as we can. Does our goal mean: " Delay onset of Alzheimer's disease, minimize its symptoms, and delay its progression" as the text goes on to say in this Goal? If so, we need objective metrics to measure these outcomes. We also need to be clear about expectations around the nature of the therapies to be developed. Almost certainly there will not be one blockbuster drug that "cures" people, but rather different interventions used at different phases of the pathology and with different genotypes. This is not easy stuff to convey --- no bumper sticker phrasing here, but rather a need to be patient and clear about the expectations for effective therapies. To mount an all-out national effort, we need to be very clear about the endpoint, "aspirational" or not.</li>
<li>Suggest at least the order of magnitude of the resources needed to achieve the goal.</li>
</ol><p>								It has been pointed out that setting these objectives is risky business. Particularly in AD, but not unique to the field, some researchers and others have raised false hope and expectations repeatedly with promises of a "cure within the next five years" for a long time. Credibility for this effort and responsibility to patients and their families demands that we define our objectives as carefully as we can within the context of an aspirational goal.</p>
<p>								Finally, we need to emphasize that this focus on research is not at the expense of, but in support of clinical efforts to help people already affected. The language concluding this goal does this and should be retained and if anything, strengthened.</p>
<p>								HHS will prioritize and accelerate the pace of scientific research and ensure that as evidence-based solutions are identified they are quickly translated, put into practice, and brought to scale so that individuals with Alzheimer's disease can benefit from increases in scientific knowledge.</p></td>

<td>One thing that strikes me over and over is that when people go to their "regular" practioners, they often get very vague information and appropriate diagnoses. People who go to most geriatricians get the latest information.
<p>								Somehow we need to have training for the variety of family and internal medicine practioners, and even specialists to enable them to recognize the early/all signs of the various dementias and the overlaps of the various complications such as diabetes, concussions, and Parkinson's etc. Without specific education of the medical community in the form of continuing education, all the research in the world won't be disseminated and used to its potential. We need further training of all doctors to recognize the problems, and make the connections to a disease that devastates!</p>
<p>								I hope these ideas will be included as part of the national plan proposed.</p></td>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." The Alzheimer's Association is the leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans with Alzheimer's disease and almost 15 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top ten in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Caring for people with this heartbreaking disease cost Medicare and Medicaid an estimated $130 billion last year.</p>
<p>Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, the future will be even bleaker. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the cost of care will surpass $1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). However, if through the National Plan the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years, similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease, would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050. This is both the challenge and promise of the National Alzheimer's Project Act and the development of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment -- a strategic plan is within our grasp. The Draft Framework sets that plan in motion. But while this framework is extensive in scope, there are a number of items that need to be addressed. Those items are raised in this letter.</p>
<p>Having reviewed this Draft Framework, however, the leading comment of the Alzheimer's Association is that <strong>the Draft Framework should be adjusted to facilitate the Department's incorporation of the recommendations of the three Advisory Council subcommittees, as presented at the January 17, 2012 Advisory Council meeting, into the National Alzheimer's Plan</strong>. These recommendations represent a bold, transformative, and comprehensive way to address the Alzheimer's crisis -- exactly what is needed in a National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>General Comments </strong></p>
<p>We believe the firm deadline of 2025 in this initial framework is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones may be needed, the Department is to be commended for including, for the first time, a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently needed treatment advances.</p>
<p>Second, the draft includes often neglected, but important, issues such as public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection, which are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact.</p>
<p>Third, there is a strong section on expanding and strengthening the health care workforce. Without an adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained, individuals living with Alzheimer's will not have access to coordinated, quality care in all health care settings, including acute care, long-term care, and home care settings.</p>
<p>These are three leading examples of the Draft Framework's many strengths. However, before a draft plan is released, several gaps must be addressed to fulfill the promise of a comprehensive and bold National Alzheimer's Plan. The largest omissions in the Draft Framework are a clear call for adequate and sustainable funding for Alzheimer's disease research, and for the resources required to implement the national plan. A strategy without funds to implement it or resources to drive research breakthroughs will not achieve the goals laid out in the Draft Framework by 2025.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming is that there is little mention of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) beyond general references to increasing clinical trial participation and expediting the development and use of biomarkers, and there is no mention of ways to spur development of treatments or other regulatory science efforts. The draft plan must create opportunities for multi-sector partnerships to stimulate new ideas and innovations, and the FDA must play a pivotal role in the development and translation of these new treatments.</p>
<p>A final overarching weakness in the Draft Framework is the limited emphasis on educating affected individuals, their families, and their caregivers about Alzheimer's. The importance of understanding Alzheimer's disease, particularly in context of other health conditions, should be emphasized, as should educating individuals and their families about the support services available to them and the need for advance planning. Similarly, there is no mention of how to improve documentation of a diagnosis, which is crucial to enabling care coordination among health care providers. A formal and documented diagnosis allows individuals to participate in their own care planning, better manage other chronic conditions, participate in clinical trials, and ultimately alleviate the burden on themselves and their loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments </strong></p>
<p>Following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and strategies as outlined in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong></em><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, there is no mention of funding for Alzheimer's research or what will be required to implement the National Alzheimer's Plan. Without this commitment to adequate research funding, 2025 risks appearing more a hope than a goal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes that Alzheimer's research needs to be a goal of the entire National Institutes of Health (NIH), not just the National Institute on Aging (NIA). NIA is underfunded, so prioritizing funding within NIA does not hold the potential to sufficiently elevate Alzheimer's research. Making Alzheimer's research a priority of the entire NIH is also important to help ensure coordination among the 27 Institutes and Centers, 23 of which are currently funding Alzheimer's research. 3</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					The phrase "...will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials..." should be characterized relative to the scale of the crisis and, by that measure, we strongly disagree that current levels warrant a description of "aggressive" -- aggressive is what we <em>need</em>, not what we <em>have</em>.</p>
<p>When examining how to manage and treat symptoms of Alzheimer's, research should be more closely linked to quality measures. Moreover, novel ways to conduct and encourage prevention trials and trials on agents that are not patentable should be included. This strategy must also address information protection, patents, and technology transfer in academic institutions.</p>
<p>Other than increasing clinical trial participation or expediting the development and use of biomarkers, the Draft Framework does not mention the FDA. FDA is a critical piece to the puzzle and is a necessary player in addressing ways to provide incentives that spur development of treatments or other regulatory science efforts, including biomarkers and critical scientific methods and tools.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					With regard to advances in imaging and other technologies that may enable an earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical settings, the coverage determinations and reimbursement hurdles associated with accessing these new technologies are not addressed in the Draft Framework. In addition, longitudinal trials, which were explicitly endorsed during the 2010 NIH State of the Science Conference, are not addressed but should be in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities</em></strong><br />
					The Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense should work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities, which may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated individual or office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em></strong><br />
					We strongly support a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained will help ensure that people with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and will ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system. Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties should be expanded. 4</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. The Medicare Annual Wellness Visit will help on this front, but we recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection separate from the strategy for diagnosis. While the Draft Framework refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is a mistake to conflate the issues of detection and diagnosis in a single strategy. And, in fact, this strategy could be read as confusing the distinct processes of detection and diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strategy is silent on educating health care professionals, particularly physicians, on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often, many physicians do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing physicians, their lack of training in the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delay detection of cognitive impairment and further diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support Patients and Families Upon Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					The education component within this strategy appears limited. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed after a diagnosis, including referrals to existing community supports and services. It is also important that patient education emphasize the importance of understanding Alzheimer's disease in the context of other health conditions. Moreover, family consultation with appropriately-trained health care professionals should be provided and reimbursed under Medicare, even when the patient is not present, so families do not feel abandoned after a diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the measurement of quality indicators. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems</em></strong><br />
					There is no mention of the use of electronic medical records or the importance of making sure a diagnosis is actually included in a medical record. This is especially important for safe and effective care transitions. Prior to any care transition, an individual should have a documented diagnosis in his or her medical record, as well as a list of relevant medications. In addition, acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					Alzheimer's disease is progressive and terminal and therefore general research on care coordination may not address the unique needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or their caregivers. Additional research should be conducted specifically on care coordination for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					A National Plan must identify the specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias. However, we are looking forward to reviewing specific plans that will meaningfully address the challenges faced by these populations. 5</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</em></strong><br />
					During the course of the Alzheimer's Association's public input sessions last summer, this was a consistent theme, and we commend its inclusion in the Draft Framework. A National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong><br />
					The intent of this strategy is unclear. If the goal is to encourage the purchase of long-term care insurance -- or at least educate families about the option of long-term care insurance -- it is important to realize that the private long-term care insurance market presents particular challenges to those with Alzheimer's disease. It may not be a viable option, and families should be made aware of the potential issues.</p>
<p>In addition, while planning for long-term care is important, there are other future needs for which a diagnosed individual needs to plan -- planning regarding finances, driving and safety, advance directives, and end-of-life care. The Draft Framework should refer to the importance of advance planning education once someone receives an Alzheimer's diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As indicated in Strategy 2A, all health care practitioners should have proper dementia training, which should help mitigate abuse. In addition to health care practitioners, training efforts should include first responders.</p>
<p>The National Plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. This includes the issue of self-neglect, which is not addressed in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p>State Adult Protective Services (APS) agencies are over-burdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire circumstances. The Draft Framework does not address the need for additional resources for APS agencies so that they can adequately protect the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As indicated in Strategy 2G, education campaigns must be language-specific and culturally appropriate.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 5.A: Enhance HHS' Ability to Track Progress</em></strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government. 6 At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance both on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they more adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 5.B: Monitor Progress on the National Plan</em></strong><br />
					Although sometimes overlooked, improving data to track progress is critical, and we commend its inclusion in the Draft Framework. This critical information should be publically available, or at least available to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (early stage through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>The Draft Framework provides a good foundation for a National Alzheimer's Plan. But much work needs to be done to fulfill the promise of a detailed National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, would result in just such a National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) is pleased to submit the following comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (the "Draft Framework"), released by the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) on January 9, 2012.<sup>1</sup> BIO represents more than 1,100 biotechnology companies, academic institutions, state biotechnology centers and related organizations across the United States and in more than 30 other nations. BIO members are involved in the research and development of innovative healthcare, agricultural, industrial and environmental biotechnology products.</p>
<p>As the representative of an industry that is devoted to improving health care through the discovery of new therapies, BIO believes that any framework for improving diagnosis and care for serious, complex illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, must include measures to provide access to innovative treatment options, including new drugs and biologicals. We are pleased that the Draft Framework specifically includes strategies for enhancing scientific research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, coordinating research with international public and private entities, and facilitating the translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs. <sup>2</sup> We offer the following comments to make these strategies more effective.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Draft Framework Should Include a Strategy to Protect Patient Access to Innovative Therapies for Alzheimer's Disease </strong></p>
<p>The draft framework correctly recognizes that after research findings are published in the clinical literature, "additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, industry, and public health systems quickly and accurately."<sup>3</sup> In addition to being shared with patients, caregivers, and practitioners, new clinical evidence also must be adopted into health plans' coverage and payment policies in a timely manner to ensure that access and reimbursement is available for advanced treatment options and improved diagnostic tools that address the eight cognitive domains that may be impaired in Alzheimer's, as recognized in the NINCDS-ADRA Alzheimer's Criteria: memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving, and functional abilities.<sup>4</sup> This is particularly important now because there are exciting new diagnostic tools and treatments for Alzheimer's disease on the horizon, at the same time our health care delivery system is undergoing dramatic change, from the creation of Accountable Care Organizations to increased packaging.</p>
<p>There are several ways the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) can protect patient access to care. CMS should assign Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes in a timely manner for new drugs and biologicals to facilitate claims processing and payment by all health plans. CMS also should expeditiously add new cognitive tests to Medicare's Annual Wellness visit so that beneficiaries will have access to this service on a regular schedule and without out-of-pocket costs. In addition, CMS should work with stakeholders to identify new preventive services and issue national coverage determinations that add those services to Medicare's preventive benefits. Other payers, including Medicaid and private insurance plans, as well as the state agencies that regulate health plans, will need to act promptly on similar matters to protect access to innovative diagnosis and care for patients within their programs as well. CMS and other payers also may need to reconsider their current rules on coverage and payment to support adoption of new approaches to care, such as use of telehealth and increased participation in care by family members and caretakers, and to ensure that bundled payment systems do not discourage the use of novel therapies. BIO recommends that the Draft Framework be revised to explicitly acknowledge the need for prompt action by Medicare and other payers to provide comprehensive coverage, coding, and payment for new methods of preventing, diagnosing, and treating Alzheimer's disease to help meet the needs of this vulnerable patient population.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Draft Framework's Strategies Should Support the Development of Treatment by Facilitating Participation of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease in Clinical Trials </strong></p>
<p>BIO recognizes that no progress can be made without clinical research, yet we also realize that it is difficult for many older patients to participate in trials due to comorbidities and limited access to sites of care that offer trials. These obstacles are particularly significant for patients with Alzheimer's disease, who may have more difficulty deciding to participate in a trial or remaining in a trial unless they have strong support from their family members and caregivers and health care practitioners. The Draft Framework notes that "new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions."<sup>5</sup> BIO believes these efforts are needed. Enhanced outreach is essential to increasing participation in clinical trials through educating patients' families and caregivers, facilitating their access to the patient's health information, and supporting their role in helping patients make treatment decisions. These efforts also need to be applied across all research efforts -- in the U.S. or other countries, public or privately funded -- to encourage optimal participation in these essential trials. BIO recommends that the Draft Framework specifically recognize the need for enhanced efforts to address the factors that frequently inhibit patients with Alzheimer's disease from participating in clinical research. To facilitate this, we recommend that the Secretary involve, consult and engage with industry to address those factors through "new partnerships and outreach efforts."</p>

<p>BIO appreciates this opportunity to comment on the Draft Framework. We look forward to continuing to work with ASPE to refine and implement this plan to improve diagnoses and care for Alzheimer's disease.

<p>Below are two comments received from my readers regarding the draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan. Thank you for your work on this incredibly important project.</p>
<p>Norman Roberts says:</p>
<p>After reading the document I am pleased so much interest given to finding a cure. However I would like more emphasis on reasearch on finding better ways to help those expreiencing AZ problems now. We have waited a long time finding a cure and during the continued wait please spend more money, research &amp; engergy helping us now. My specific request is for research to help couples, both are a patient and a caregiver. Skilled people to assist us the with flustration [social &amp; psycological] would help us continue in our home and not cost us or government to care for us in a more expensive setting. After a extensive search I find no specific help for COUPLES both having MCI. I think our medical &amp; government should do better by us.</p>
<p>February 7, 2012 at 5:39 am<br />
					(11) Trevor Mumby says:</p>
<p>We have 80 staff who are coached in small groups to manage the daily challenges whilst they are living -in with families who are experiencing dementia. Our visiting carers undergo the same coaching. Families are invited to attend coaching groups. It is the DAILY 24/7 domain where NEW, simple skills need to be learned which fit the UNIQUE circumstances of the family dynamic. Our experience is that cosmetic generalised approaches can frequently create even more erratic responses. The results are proof that we have found a method to empower the family, including the person with dementia to live a more well being life. We are based near Oxford UK and would be glad to share.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and commitment to the NAPA process. Your efforts are greatly appreciated. As you work diligently to prepare this landmark national plan which will help our country prepare for the coming onslaught of Alzheimer's disease, I want to urge you to address a current program that has helped thousands of families over the past twenty years but which is currently slated for dramatic cuts in 2012 and probable elimination in 2013. The Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP), also known as the Alzheimer's Disease Demonstration Grants to States Program, was created by federal legislation in 1991 with the hope that it would increase access to quality services for people with Alzheimer's disease and their family caregivers nationwide. Since its inception, this program has created services for many under-served populations; Latinos, African Americans, Asian Pacific Islanders, and rural families have all benefited from this investment. Many of the innovative programs created with this funding have been replicated in new cities and states such as the Guidelines for Management of Alzheimer's Disease, n evidence-based, a practice guideline for primary care physicians and the El Portal Dementia Care Network model for reaching under-served populations.</p>
<p>There have been criticisms of the program and like all programs, it could be improved. The major criticism has been that ADSSP serves relatively few families. There are two good reasons for this. First, the program was developed to serve hard-to-reach families. The initial evaluation of the program completed by Dr. Rhonda Montgomery demonstrated that you must reach thousands through culturally appropriate outreach and education in order to bring direct services to relatively small numbers of hard-to-reach families. More recently, the program refocused on bringing evidence-based programs to the broader community. While this is a good goal, it means that fewer families can be reached as these evidence-based programs deliver more intensive services to fewer people.</p>
<p>I want to urge the Council to include support for the ADSSP program in our national plan. The program needs to be institutionalized rather than remain a demonstration project. This is the only national program that is Alzheimer's-specific, delivering respite, support and education to hard-to-reach Alzheimer's families in their communities. Without it, thousands of families will get no services.</p>
<p>I urge you to restore and preserve this important program.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this input.</p>

<p>We welcome government's leadership in developing a National Plan to help focus public and private resources on common goals and strategy. The Framework provides the right priorities, balance, and general focus for the effort.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's research and drug development stands on the threshold of a major advance in treatment, with the potential for significant disease modification in the near future. It is a critical time when greater collaboration and resources can have a substantial impact. We look forward to working with HHS to develop a clear pathway in the National Plan for achieving a therapeutic breakthrough in Alzheimer's Disease. This type of breakthrough will not only improve the lives of patients, but will also help ease the cost pressures currently being experienced by government health care programs.</p>
<p>A real advance in therapy will require regulatory alignment with emerging science, including prompt government action to establish biomarkers, provide guidance on clinical trial design, and review and approve new drug applications. We look forward to working with the Secretary to ensure a favorable environment that facilitates efficient clinical trials and expenditious review of new treatments.</p>
<p>We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the Draft Framework of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Please feel free to contact us with any questions.</p>

					Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease<br />
					February 3, 2012</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease</em>. CCAL is a national advocacy organization working to ensure that person-centered practices are always the foundation of all aging services and supports. Ensuring that person-centeredness is integrated into healthcare practices elevates the experience from a clinical one to a humanistic one. The human emotional experience is important to achieving well-being as are clinical outcomes. The bond between the person receiving services and the individual (as well as the organizations' culture) that provides a healthcare service must be based on the following four principles all working in harmony:</p>
<ul><li>Relationships - valuing the uniqueness of each person</li>
<li>Compassion -caring to build a connection and bond with the person</li>
<li>Empowerment - providing information and options to the person and their caregiver(s)</li>
<li>Autonomy/Choice - respecting the right of the person and their caregiver(s) to make their own choices</li>
</ul><p><strong>Global Recommendations: </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Person-Centeredness </strong></em></p>
<p>Nowhere can principles and practices of honoring the personhood of each individual be more significant than in a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, yet the draft framework is silent on person-centeredness. We respectfully submit that this National Plan should include person-centeredness in its philosophical foundation, core principles , strategies and goals as does the Department of Health and Human Services' National Health Care Quality Strategy and Plan (NHCQS): "Person-centeredness and family engagement will guide all strategies, goals, and improvement efforts". This is "one of the core principles intended to serve as the underpinning of NHCQS and should be reflected not only in the framework, but in how goals, targets, and plans are developed across health care and long-term care settings."</p>
<p>Person-centered language should be used throughout the National Plan. To honor the personhood of each individual and recognize that patient only refers to clinical services and not the broader holistic context, the term "patient" should be changed to "person" throughout the Plan; i.e., "Educate and Support the <em>Person</em> and their Family Members Upon Diagnosis". Indeed, person-centeredness should be a fundamental component of all prevention and treatment plans; i.e. Strategy 2.D - "Guidelines for delivery of high-quality <em>person-centered</em> care and measures of quality are needed…"</p>
<p><em><strong>Enhancing Quality of Life as well as Quality of Care </strong></em></p>
<p>This framework does not reflect our national commitment to providing meaningful lives for all older Americans. Enhancing quality of life and meaningful engagement for individuals with Alzheimers and related dementias must be a fundamental principle and a goal, implemented through training, education, and outreach strategies in tandem with, and comparable to, those for Goal 2 Enhancing High Quality of Care.</p>
<p>Meaningful relationships, purposeful engagement, social interactions and impromptu conversations all serve to enhance the individual's psychological, social and emotional well-being. All should incorporate the person's interests, preferences, strengths, and skills to best maintain their sense of self and to slow down the deleterious effects of the disease. The National Plan should include training for family, caregivers, and staff to heighten their sensitivity to and understanding of positive pathways for communication, interactions, relationships, and meaningful engagement.</p>
<p><em><strong>Family Engagement </strong></em></p>
<p>For those of us who care for loved ones with Alzheimers' and related dementias, we know this National Plan must move beyond encouraging "family engagement" to encouraging caregiver/family/ provider partnerships to best guide and enhance person-centered quality of care and quality of life.</p>
<p>Individuals and families should be empowered through interactions and resources so that they are prepared to make informed choices and be active participants and decision-makers regarding their loved one's care. We recommend the following goals and approach from "Partnering with Patients and Families to Design a Patient and Family-centered Health Care System: A Roadmap for the Future, A Work in Progress" (<em>2006, Institute for Family-centered Care and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement</em>)</p>
<p>"…Develop a shared vision and action plan for improving health care by advancing the practice of patient-and family-centered care and creating partnerships with patients and families in all health care settings and within the organizations and agencies having an impact on health care"</p>
<p><em><strong>Utilize Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) Methodological Approach </strong></em></p>
<p>We suggest adopting the CBPR methodological approach to AD applied research efforts to best inform the work through multiple perspectives and expertise of community-based partners (representing key stakeholders, including family members, direct care staff, practitioners, social workers, long-term service providers, etc.) to inform the research, ensure its relevancy, and enhance understanding and dissemination across research, policy and practice sectors.</p>
<p><em><strong>Public Education Campaign </strong></em></p>
<p>We firmly believe that any public education campaign should highlight non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatment options for enhanced quality of life and care.</p>
<p>We would encourage sustained community-based outreach to the general public through the creation of a "Real People; Real Life with AD" component of this campaign to enable the general public to meet, greet and hear from regular individuals and families who are going through this journey of AD-related life experiences and challenges. We are not suggesting celebrities or authors who have written about family caregiving. We do suggest including the voices, perspectives, and insights of individuals who are living with AD or whose loved one has AD.</p>
<p><em><strong>Improve Coordinated Dissemination of Information </strong></em></p>
<p>We suggest adding this goal as there is no national coordinated network of information about Alzheimer's and related Dementias for professionals or non-professionals. DHHS funds numerous AD research centers, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, and initiatives throughout the country, i.e., Administration on Aging's AD Demonstration Grants; but information and findings are not networked and easily made available.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Recommendations: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1 - Prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>Psychosocial treatment modalities (non-pharmacologic) for AD should also be included in the framework for the national plan</p>
<p><strong>1.A</strong> Ensure that invited expert participants to NIH's May 2012 summit include an appropriate number of non-research, non-clinical dementia experts as well as family caregivers in order to best inform and shape the national plan.</p>
<p><strong>1.C</strong> Consider : a) ethical issues related to such efforts; and b) the potential psychological, social-emotional, medical and economic impact (and unintended consequences) on individuals and their families receiving a diagnosis 10 years prior to emergence of symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>1.E</strong> Consider educational campaign on appropriate and safe use of psychoactive drugs and sedatives and non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatment modalities as related to individual's quality of life</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2 - Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. A</strong> The plan should address solutions for recruiting and retaining high-quality direct care and paraprofessional workers. Best-practice models for AD training should be noted.</p>
<p><strong>2.C &amp; 2.D</strong> The plan should address how individuals and families can be actively engaged in decision making and act as partners on the care team if they so choose. Some individuals and families may just wish to receive counseling, support and information. Both should be addressed.</p>
<p>Palliative care and end-of-life care should be addressed. What interventions are available; what decisions need to be made to have personal wishes carried out by healthcare and long-term support system(s); i.e., individuals with Alzheimer's may want to leave a living will; families should understand the decisions that they may need to make.</p>
<p><strong>2. D CCAL</strong> suggests using a community-based participatory process in which individuals, families, and direct care staff can be partners with experts in developing the guidelines. We suggest examining the national Center for Excellence in Assisted Living (CEAL) "Person-centered Care Domains of Practice" for HCBS which identifies domains of: personhood, relationships and community, governance/ownership, leadership, workforce practices, meaningful life and engagement, services, environment, and accountability.</p>
<p><strong>2.E</strong> Even "safe and effective" transitions can be traumatic for people with Alzheimer's disease, particularly for people with advanced Alzheimer's who are sent to emergency rooms for relatively minor conditions. Emphasis should be on: 1) limiting transitions; and 2) when transitions are necessary--how to make them safe and effective.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3. Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>We strongly recommend including families and direct care staff as active partners in the process of Expanding Person &amp; Family Support, from creating and disseminating culturally sensitive education and support materials to serving as Person &amp; Family Support Guides.</p>
<p>CCAL commends all who were involved in creating the framework for a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias; and appreciates the opportunity to contribute to the process by providing person-centered feedback on its contents.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>New Study Challenges Accepted Approaches to Research in Senile Dementia (Alzheimer's Disease)<br />
					Published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>NEWS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>Amsterdam, NL, 7 November 2011 -- Impacting millions of families and devouring billions of dollars globally, Alzheimer's disease is the focus of exhaustive research to find a cure. Although intensely investigated over the last three decades using cutting-edge technologies, the "pathogenic cause" of Alzheimer's disease has not been found. While many research "breakthroughs" have been claimed and high-profile drugs trials carried out, why does the promised "cure" still seem to elude scientists?</p>
<p>In an effort to address this question, Ming Chen, PhD, Huey T. Nguyen, BS, and Darrell R. Sawmiller, PhD, Aging Research Laboratory, R&amp;D Service, Bay Pines VA Healthcare System and University of South Florida, undertook an independent and systematic analysis of the underlying research assumptions against the established scientific principles. This analysis led them to hypothesize that perhaps the main problem is the research community's perception of the disease.</p>
<p>In an article scheduled for publication in the December issue of the <em>Journal of Alzheimer's Disease</em> the authors suggest that when the National Institutes of Health separated out dementia from other senile conditions and redefined it as a distinct and "curable" disease -- Alzheimer's -- in the 1970s, it opened a Pandora's box and may have misdirected research for decades. It triggered the search for pathogenic factors and cures, and disregarded the role of demographic change and its diverse end results in the elderly.</p>
<p>The authors argue that senile disorders -- diseases occurring after age 60 and eventually affecting the majority of the elderly, such as tooth, hearing or memory loss -- are caused by aging, thus differ fundamentally from distinct diseases by origin, study paradigm and intervention strategy.</p>
<p>Moreover, the authors contend that a central regulator in cognition - the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling system - has been misconceived by institutional thinking that favors a "cure" for senile dementia. The dominant hypothesis, although unproven, is that Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels rise throughout the aging process, leading to cell death, and thus research has focused on calcium antagonists to lower those levels. This viewpoint has been promoted by policy makers, and the subject of a number of high profile clinical trials, but to date no positive results have emerged.</p>
<p>In contrast, the authors propose that declining functionality of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling as a result of the aging process, among a myriad of other age-related changes, leads to cognitive decline. Therefore interventions for senile dementia could activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> function by promoting energy metabolism and also by Ca<sup>2+</sup> agonists such as caffeine and nicotine. At the same time, risk factors play a key role. "Aging and Ca<sup>2</sup>+ deficits set the stage for senile dementia, but do not always lead to senile dementia in real life," explains Dr. Chen. "Lifestyles and other risk factors are the key. So we think that senile dementia may be explained by 'advanced aging plus risk factors.' This model points to a new direction for prevention. This means we must support the elderly in healthy lifestyles. And we should develop medications to extend the lifespan of old neurons, rather than looking for ways to inhibit far-fetched 'pathogenic' factors."</p>
<p>"The model implies that senile dementia is, by and large, a lifestyle disease," says Dr. Chen. "This view, in fact, has been shared by many in the medical and clinical community, but contrasts sharply with current dominant theories in the Alzheimer research field, which assume a linear and 'cause and effect' mechanism. Since they have not taken into account the fundamental roles of aging and risk factors, it is clear that these theories, though highly appealing to the public and researchers alike, are of little relevance to the scientific nature of senile dementia."</p>
<p>"The two overwhelming concepts, senile dementia as a distinct disease and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload hypothesis, have effectively blocked any meaningful progress in senile dementia research, and have inhibited the self-correcting mechanism of science," concludes Dr. Chen. "An independent scrutiny on the field may be helpful."</p>
<p>"Although incurable", Dr. Chen is optimistic. "Our research, if guided by correct theories, will produce medications to help delay dementia to a certain extent - similar to the drugs that delay or ameliorate atherosclerosis and osteoporosis today."</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>On behalf of the American Psychological Association, I would like to commend the Department of Health and Human Services and its federal partners, the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your efforts to develop the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>The American Psychological Association (APA) is a scientific and professional organization that represents psychology in the United States. With more than 154,000 members, APA is the largest association of psychologists worldwide. The mission of the APA is to advance the creation, communication and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives.</p>
<p>APA would also like to submit the following coments for your consideration as you refine the Plan Framework.</p>
<p>We stand ready to assist by recommending content experts (including researchers, clinicians, educators, specialists in multicultural practice and neuropsychological assessment), publicizing the Advisory Council's efforts, and reviewing and disseminating its work. APA remains committed to partnering with other organizations to prevent and reduce the burdens of this devastating disease. We very much appreciate your consideration of these comments.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions, comments or concerns to Deborah DiGilio, MPH, Director of our Office on Aging.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>APA Comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The science and practice of psychology are integral to efforts to prevent this disease and slow its progression, to assess, diagnose, treat, and support those with AD, and to lighten the burdens of the families and institutions that care for them.</p>
<p>Psychologists:</p>
<ul><li>conduct basic and translational research</li>
<li>develop and implement neuropsychological tests for assessment and diagnosis</li>
<li>develop evidence based behavioral interventions to address age-related cognitive decline and the known behavioral risk factors for AD, to reduce caregiver stress and burden, and to manage the challenging behaviors often associated with the disease, a</li>
<li>assess decision making capacity</li>
<li>use psychotherapeutic approaches to help individuals with AD and their caregivers cope with the illness and its associated consequences</li>
</ul><p>Independently, and as a part of interdisciplinary teams, psychologists have been at the forefront of research and treatment of AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Given the important efforts by psychologists to understand and address AD, it is surprising that there is no mention of the role of psychology in the Draft Framework: not in the sections on research or its translation into practice, nor in the list of professions that provide high quality health care, nor in the discussion of timely AD diagnosis, nor in the framework's discussion of education and support of patients and families. Most notably, neuropsychological evaluation, a component of the original and current gold standard for AD diagnosis, is not mentioned.</em></strong></p>
<p>APA offers its support to your efforts to refine and finalize the Draft Framework. Below, please find our feedback, organized in response to the strategies listed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</em></strong></p>
<p>APA is eager to participate in the development of a strategic Alzheimer's research agenda proposed by the Framework, and in the May 2012 research summit to be convened by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). We encourage NIA to invite scientists who understand not only current gaps in AD research but who also have a broad understanding of such integral topics as normative aging, cognition, clinical care, or caregiving. We also hope there will be an opportunity for scientists who didn't participate in the meeting to comment on the research agenda before it is finalized.</p>
<p>While a focus on biomarkers is propelling the AD field forward, how biomarkers cause or relate to the dementia syndrome (with which we are ultimately concerned) is still poorly understood. Therefore, we believe the participation of scientists who are working in interdisciplinary teams and who understand biomarkers AND behavior would be especially important. We say more on this issue in 1.C.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </em></strong></p>
<p>While the draft plan emphasizes the need to expand research on molecular and cellular mechanisms and genetic research to identify risk and protective factors, a research agenda that neglects the critical behavioral and social aspects of AD would be unsuccessful and insufficient.</p>
<p>The research agenda for the National Action Plan should prioritize research that underlies each section of the plan, e.g., research to enhance communication between caregivers and health care providers, to better tailor interactions with the health care system to the special needs of persons with AD, to enhance communication among interdisciplinary care teams to develop and disseminate 'best practices' for caregivers and to provide support for the caregivers themselves. Significant health risks to caregivers are well documented. To that end, APA would support the convening of additional summits to focus on clinical care research and caregiving.</p>
<p>In the domain of prevention, research focused on enhancing cognitive function may demonstrate pathways to prevention. Two promising areas include research on lifestyle, particularly connections between cognition and exercise (Anderson-Hanley, et al., in press; Colcombe, et al., 2003; Head, et al., in press) and research on cognitive training (Ball, et al., 2002; Basak, et al., 2008; Smith, et al., 2009).</p>
<p>More research needs to be focused on understanding how AD interacts with "other" diseases to cause dementia, and other vulnerabilities caused by normal aging (e.g. vascular changes, inflammation, and immune system changes). Most community based studies indicate that multiple pathologies play a role in the clinical syndrome and <em>all</em> autopsy series would suggest that multiple pathologies <em>must</em> be present in order for a person to have the disease clinically.</p>
<p>Because the first draft of the Framework dealt so cursorily with the issue, we want to emphasize again the importance of expanding research to understand how biomarkers relate to AD symptoms. It is perhaps the single most important area of focus for the reserach agenda, and is discussed more fully in our response to Section 1C.</p>
<p>We also request that the term "non-pharmacologic" be replaced with "behavioral." Behavioral describes a wide variety of interventions that NIA and other NIH institutes have funded and supported, and that may be extremely valuable for prevention and intervention. For example, for the management of behavioral disturbances in dementia, most reviews of this field suggest that behavioral interventions are preferred, due to their effectiveness, and because they help to avoid the serious side effects that are common with pharmacological approaches to dementia management (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Camp &amp; Nassar, 2003; Cohen-Mansfield, et al, 2007; Salzman, 2008; Sink et al., 2005).</p>
<p><em><strong>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presumptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</strong></em></p>
<p>While the increased ability for scientists to monitor changes in biomarkers is certainly promising, psychologists and others are concerned that there is considerable heterageneity in how pathogenic factors in AD are related to the symptoms of the disease. There is strong evidence that some neuropsychological measures can more sensitively predict conversion to Alzheimer's than most biomarkers (Gomar et al, 2011; Heister, et al., 2011; Landau, et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Research to understand and chart the earliest course of the disease should support biomarker development in tandem with neuropsychological research, not to the exclusion of it. More psychological/neuropsychological research needs to be supported to understand the behavioral manifestations of the putative biology. The use of biomarkers to monitor the effects of treatment only provides information on how the treatment affects <em>that biomarker</em>, which may or may not lead to improve in the clinical syndrome associated with the disease. We need better psychological and behavioral markers that are sensitive to disease progression over shorter periods to understand whether treatments improve the symptoms of the disease rather than simply the putative biological features. Right now, treatment trials use neuropsychological outcomes that are specific to diagnosis but may not detect disease progression with high sensitivity. More sensitive neuropsychological markers for diagnosis also need to be developed given that the biology of the disease starts years before evidence of the clinical syndrome. We believe the expertise of psychology in defining relationships between the biology and behavior is critical, and is not acknowledged in this draft of the Framework.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize that the first sentence in the draft Framework's Strategy 1.C is the subject of much disagreement. It is <strong>not</strong> currently possible to track the progression of AD through tracking biomarkers. And it is only possible to monitor the effect of such treatment as may be targeted specifically to a biomarker, not to a larger clinical syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate Translation of Findings into Medical Practice and Public Health Programs</em></strong></p>
<p>It is important for research findings to be translated into a universe much larger than medical practice. Because of the complex needs often presented by individuals with AD and their families and caregivers, the provision of care by an interdisciplinary health care team is generally needed. Thus, useful findings must be translated into the practices of <em>many</em> health care providers and in a <em>variety</em> of settings. Individuals with AD and their caregivers are found in multiple settings, not only traditional, medical settings, including long term care, community, and home care. We recommend the terms "medical" practice and "medical" practitioners be replaced by "health care" practice and "health care" providers to capture this inclusive model of care. Finally, individuals with AD and their caregivers should be explicitly mentioned as recipients of information regarding effective interventions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em></strong></p>
<p>We urge you to include psychologists among your list of specialists that care for people with AD and their families. The major initiatives to expand geriatric training opportunities at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Health Resources and Services Administration cited in this section both include psychology as one of the disciplines targeted.</p>
<p>Psychologists are integral members of the geriatric and dementia care workforce. They include highly trained professionals with unique skills in assessment, research and evaluation, behavioral health, geriatric and neuropsychological practice, evidence-based behavioral treatment and behavioral medicine practice, group dynamics, and systems that are of critical importance in addressing the health care needs of individuals with AD, their families, and caregivers.</p>
<p>Care provided by interdisciplinary health care teams ensures optimal assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning and implementation, and outcome evaluation that is responsive to the physical, behavioral, mental health, and social needs of patients and their families (APA, 2007). Caregivers of individuals with AD, and the individuals with AD themselves when possible, should be included as memebers of the team.</p>
<p>In addition, given the pressures faced by physicians, counseling efforts proven most effective in educating family members about how to handle the problems of AD are impossible to complete during the time allotted to a brief office visit.</p>
<p>Finally, Medicare reimbursement policies act as a deterrent to building the health workforce necessary to provide high quality care to individuals with AD and their caregivers. For example, Medicare will not pay for CPT codes 90846 (family psychotherapy without the patient present), or for 96155 (health and behavior intervention for the family without the patient present). Nor will Medicare pay for a physician service such as an office visit with a patient's family if the patient is not present. For patients with cognitive impairment, there must be options for reimbursement when working with families and caregivers without the patient present. In terms of integrated care teamwork, there are Medicare CPT codes (e.g., 99366 and 99368 initiated in 2008) that allow team conferences that involve interdisciplinary professionals from at least three disciplines to assess a patient's care plan and progress, however these codes are very poorly reimbursed. Reimbursement of behavioral interventions, other than psychotherapy, which would allow psychologists and other mental health professionals to intervene on behalf of people who cannot benefit from traditional therapy because of their cognitive deficits, e.g., behavior management interventions, is also critical.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>We would like to emphasize that the current gold standard for AD diagnosis involves a neuropsychological evaluation - - the integration of objective measures of cognitive performance with historical, neurological, and other diagnostic information. Psychologists, with specific compentency in evaluation of cognition and expertise in the integration of cognitive data with other psychodiagnostic approaches, clearly need to be represented as primary practitioners involved with enhancing AD care quality and efficiency through timely and accurate diagnosis. The APA <em>Guidelines for the Assessment of Dementia and Age-Related Cognitive Change</em> (APA, 2012) note that neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing remain among the most effective differential diagnostic methods in discriminating pathophysiological dementia from age-related cognitive decline, cognitive difficulties that are depression-related, and other related disorders. Even as biomarker identification and analysis improve, neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing will still be necessary to determine the onset of dementia, the functional expression of the disease process, the rate of decline, the functional capacities of the individual, and, hopefully, response to therapies.</p>
<p>The citation for this sentence: "Research has helped identified some assessment tools that can be used to rapidly assess patients showing signs and symptoms of AD and to help health care providers make a diagnosis or refer for further evaluation" focuses almost exclusively on biological markers. However, behavioral (neuropsychological) markers remain the gold standard against which biological markers are validated (Blacker, et al., 2007; Gomar, et al., 2011; Jacobs, et al., 1995; Tabert, et al., 2006). Neuropsychological assessment tools are non-invasive, highly accessible, and reasonable for the assessment of AD either in isolation or with other markers of disease. We request that the literature documenting the usefulness of behavioral markers be included in this section of the framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support Patients and Families Upon Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>Multiple health care providers, including psychologists, are involved in assessment and planning of advance care counseling for individuals with AD. Assuming that these tasks are the sole purview of the physician is incorrect. Thus the term "physician(s)" should be replaced with "health care provider(s)."</p>
<p>The APA Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (2011) state, "individuals concerned about cognitive and behavioral changes associated with aging, generally come to the evaluation process seeking information as well as emotional support. This often is a severely distressing situation for the individual, who may or may not have been the key individual in making the decision to have an assessment conducted (American Bar Association &amp; American Psychological Association, 2008; American Psychological Association, 1998). ... Providing feedback, education, and support to persons significant to the individual, with the individual's informed consent, are also important aspects of evaluations and enhance their value and applicability. Knowledge regarding levels of impairment, the expected course, and expected outcomes can help these significant other to make adequate preparations. Working with the individual's support network in this way can provide them with effective means of responding to the challenges posed by behavior changes stemming from a diagnosis of dementia. Healthy older adults who have had concerns about their cognitive functions can benefit from reassurance based on results of testing and from suggestions as to how they may enhance their everyday cognitive function."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, research on advance care planning for persons with cognitive impairment shows that even when physicians and social workers in a Memory Disorders Clinic encourage advance care planning only about 40% of clients do so (Garand, 2011). It appears that the most effective way to foster the development of advance care plans is to involve multiple face-to-face educational sessions (Bravo, 2008). Thus, support for more intensive interventions is necessary if we are to increase advance care planning.</p>
<p>We would also like to note that at this time, the evidence does not indicate that early detection will lead to improved treatment, or actually help people to plan for their future care. There is a risk to early detection (as noted in recent guidelines for cancer screening) -- large numbers of individuals being identified as patients, or at risk. This can create needless psychological distress because there are so few current treatment options, and those few options are often inappropriate. This may lead to discouragement on the part of families whose support and partnership with care providers is critical to the person with AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong></p>
<p>Identification and implementation of high-quality dementia care guidelines should include both those that focus on pharmacological and behavioral intervention and take the whole person into account, including behavioral and mental health considerations along with physical care. Interdisciplinary consensus development processes, such as the Consensus Statement on Improving the Quality of Mental Health Care in U.S. Nursing Homes: Management of Depression and Behavioral Symptoms Associated with Dementia (American Geriatrics Society, 2003) in which 15 health provider organizations participated is one effective model for developing high-quality dementia care guidelines. APA has developed Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (<a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf</a>) and is interested in working with other organizations to develop additional dementia care guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of health services available to individuals with AD. Psychologists and other mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with individuals with AD and their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of psychotherapy. Behavioral interventions are effective in addressing dysphoria, agitation, anxiety, and apathy in persons with dementia (Teri et al., 2005). Behavioral interventions are an especially important tool as medication treatment of behavioral disturbances in dementia is of limited efficacy and should be used only after environmental and behavioral techniques have been implemented (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Sink, et al., 2005). At more advanced stages of dementia, use of sensory stimulation often assists in addressing issues related to agitation or anxiety (Lin et al., 2009). At all stages of dementia, apathy is the most common behavioral challenge facing caregivers. Therefore, provision of optimal stimulation and ensuring positive engagement are critical features of interventions to improve the quality of life of both persons with dementia and their caregivers (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>A major challenge arising from the anticipated rapid growth in the population of those suffering from AD is provision of support, both to the individuals with AD and to their caregivers. It may not be feasible to construct the number of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) required to provide a continuum of care for individuals with dementia in the coming decades. Even if it proves possible, the cost of maintaining people in such facilities may be prohibitive without a rapid enrollment of people into long-term care insurance programs. In addition, home and community-based care is often preferred by patients and their families. Finding ways to support those with AD and other dementias in their homes is going to be critical to effective coordination of care.</p>
<p>Randomized control trials, such as REACH and REACH II, have shown that innovative health care tools, such as remote delivery of services through telemedicine with the support of integrated health care teams, can relieve caregiver burden, particularly depression, for those caring for people with AD (Eisdorfer et al., 2003; Czaja &amp; Rubert, 2002; Finkel et al., 2007). Such interventions can be structured to provide effective, culturally-sensitive support (e.g., Belle et al., 2006).</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>APA concurs that improved care is necessary for populations disproportionally affected by AD. Health care providers must understand and competently manage the cultural differences in these populations. In many ethnic minority groups, familial support extends beyond the immediate family system. Thus it is important that providers be as inclusive of the extended family system as possible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials</em></strong></p>
<p>We concur that ensuring the development and receipt of culturally sensitive education, training and support materials by family caregivers is crucial as there is evidence that the problems experienced by caregivers differ in occurrence and intensity across racial and ethnic lines (Dilworth-Anderson, Williams, &amp; Gibson, 2002; Janevic &amp; Connell, 2001; Pinquart &amp; Sörenson, 2005). Replication and dissemination of model interventions such as REACH II (Belle et al, 2006; Burgio, 2009; Elliott et al., 2010) that are proven to be effective with diverse populations, is encouraged.</p>
<p>The strengths and coping mechanisms of culturally diverse groups should not be overlooked. For example, in a study of caregivers of patients with AD, Morano and King (2005) found that caregivers with higher levels of religiosity reported significantly lower levels of depression. Inter-ethnic comparisons showed that, African American caregivers reported the highest level of religiosity and the lowest levels of depression.</p>
<p>When considering issues of diversity and the effective provision of culturally sensitive education, the special needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities who develop AD should be considered. In addition, culturally sensitive education should include efforts directed to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. In these communities, "familial support" includes "families of choice," a term which is often used in lieu of family of origin for many LGBT adults.</p>
<p>Psychologists have a long history of involvement in the development of culturally competent health care interventions (e.g., many of the lead investigators on the REACH and REACH II projects were psychologists) and could provide additional direction in the development of this strategy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</em></strong></p>
<p>Rather than beginning the description of this strategy with a sentence about the eventually of nursing home placement, it would be more useful to begin with the second sentence that speaks to supports for families and caregivers. This is an area in which we <em>do</em> have evidence-based interventions to assist caregivers in maintaining their own health and well-being. Research on the effectiveness of behavioral inteventions for caregivers of individuals with dementia has been quite prolific (APA, 2011). For example, The New York University Caregiver Intervention (NYUCI) benefits the caregiver's mental and physical health and delays institutional placement of the care recipient (Mittleman et al., 2006). This intervention provides dementia caregivers with 6 sessions of individual and family counseling, support groups participation, and additional on-call telephone consultations in a flexible counseling approach that is tailored to each caregiving family. The STAR-C intervention (Teri, et al, 2005) produces benefits for both the caregiver and care recipient, improving caregiver depression, reducing burden, improving sleep, lessening subjective ratings of burden, improving caregiver reaction to behavioral problems, improving care recipient quality of life and memory-related behavioral problems. The STAR-C program has been successfully taught to community consultants, providing evidence that it can be disseminated into diverse community settings. In this intervention, caregivers are taught to monitor problems, identify possible environmental or interpersonal triggering events, and develop more effective responses in order to improve patients' environment, maximize their abilities, and minimize their impairments. Psychologists have been involved in the development and evaluation of each of these interventions and have trained masters level professionals and aging and community service workers to implement them in community settings.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that the use of the term "supports" is a bit misleading in this strategy's description. The meta analysis cited (Sorensen, 2002) shows that interventions that <em>only</em> offer supports are much less effective than interventions that offer caregivers information and skills training -- that is, psychoeducational interventions with an "active" component. Cognitive behavioral therapy was found to be the most effective intervention in decreasing caregiver depression in this meta analysis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong></p>
<p>Assistance is critical for family members who must prepare to transition from care partners to caregivers (Aneshensel, et al., 1995). Families need not only education but skills training and the availability of counseling services as they take on multiple roles and responsibilities (Zarit, 2009). As noted elsewhere in this document, individuals with AD should also be included in planning for their future needs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the resources for planning and meeting long-term care needs are woefully inadequate. Many families and caregivers of individuals with AD perceive themselves as not 'fitting' many of the support options communities may have to offer. Often the individual with AD does not qualify for services because they do not have IADL limitations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Psychological interventions stress the importance of personhood and preserving the individuals' dignity in AD and person-centered planning during MCI and mild AD. Enabling family members to accept, support, and engage the person with dementia as he or she is now is an important challenge to address. It is also critically important that therapeutic goals be discussed directly with the individual who has dementia. This not only provides the respect and dignity that should be given any individual, but also provides highly relevant information regarding the individual's understanding and attitude about the goal, his or her motivation in achieving the goal, and his or her willingness to expend time and energy working toward the goal (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>Regarding safety, although physical neglect and abuse tend to occur most of the time during the more severe stages of the AD, it is also important to recognize that older adults during the stages of MCI and mild AD are vulnerable to neglect and abuse in other domains. This is particularly true for financial abuse as there is evidence that diminished financial capacity or decision making is one of the early signs of cognitive decline (Marson et al., 2000). Individuals who are living independently are at high risk. It is not enough to say that we have APS or the Ombudsman program in place -- we must be much more proactive to prevent abuse before it happens. Psychologists play a key role with regard to assessment of capacity (e.g., capacity for medical consent, financial capacity, testamentary capacity, capacity for independent living).</p>
<p>APA and the ABA Commission on Law and Aging have jointly published a series cost-free handbooks on the Assessment of Older Adults with Diminished Capacity for psychologists, lawyers and judges <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx</a>. The handbooks have proved useful to a variety of health and aging professionals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The public health initiative described focuses on enhancing public awareness about AD, including misconceptions about diagnosis and treatment. We believe the main focus of a public education campaign should be on modifiable risk factors for AD -- including diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity or low educational attainment, and physical inactivity - and actions individuals can take now to reduce their risks. We know enough about these modifiable risk factors to institute a public health/awareness campaign, even if the risk factors are not related to the putative pathology. A recent study (Barnes, et al, 2011), notes that up to half of AD cases worldwide are attributable to seven potentially modifiable risk factors -- and that a 10-25% reduction in all seven risk factors could potentially prevent as many as 1.1-3.0 million AD cases worldwide.</p>
<p>In addition, the educational effort should not be alarmist, rather clearly state that the <em>majority</em> of older adults before the age of 80, which is currently about the average life expectancy for U.S. citizens, do not develop AD. AD is not a normal part of cognitive aging. Findings from longitudinal studies of intellectual development, such as the Seattle Longitudinal Study (Schaie, 2005), suggest that individuals who develop dementia after the age of 60 need to show multiple risk factors, including both genetic and behavioral risk factors. To be specific, estimates of the prevalence rates of dementia (i.e., most of the time estimates of dementia of the Alzheimer's type) for different age groups vary across study and range from about 5% to 13% for individuals age 65 and older to over 40% for adults age 85 and older (Hebert et al., 2003; Plassman et al., 2007). Thus, it is well established that the prevalence rate increases disproportionally with age and that individuals who are at greatest risk for showing signs of dementia are not individuals in the young-old age range, but individuals in the old-old and very-old age range (i.e., 80 years and older). This information should inform the public education campaign.</p>
<p>There are also pronounced racial differences in the prevalence rate of dementia and that this should be taken into account when raising public awareness and discussing the needs of this segment of the population. Gurland et al. (1999), for example showed that while the prevalence rate for white Americans was 2.9%, 10.9%, and 30.2% for the age groups of 65-74, 75-84, and 85+, respectively, the rates for the same age groups for African-Americans were 9.1%, 19.9%, and 58.6%, respectively. The pattern of prevalence rates for Hispanics was even higher in the age groups of 75-84 and 85+ (i.e., 27.9% and 62.9%), respectively.</p>

<p>Thank you for accepting comments on the draft of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>As a rhythm facilitator with a good deal of experience in elder care, I have often noticed that people experiencing the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease strongly gravitate toward any rhythm experience. The research indicates that Alzheimer's causes the brain to lose its sequencing function to a greater degree with time. The research also indicates that the experience of making or participating in rhythm helps the brain coherently sequence events.</p>
<p>This seems to be the initial draw for patients with Alzheimer's. I have heard many of them comment to the effect that participating in rhythm events helps these people "feel normal again," as they usually put it. I find that they will attend rhythm-making events even when most other activities lose their interest.</p>
<p>Rhythm-making in a group also provides multi-faceted wellness opportunities for people with Alzheimer's in all seven dimensions of wellness, as formally defined by the International Council on Active Aging:</p>
<p>Physical exercise<br />
					Intellectual stimulation<br />
					Social interaction<br />
					Emotional expression<br />
					Spiritual connection<br />
					Occupational satisfaction<br />
					Environmental awareness of surroundings</p>
<p>Rhythm is innate to all humans, and when motor or brain functions begin to falter, normal respiration, pulse, and heart rate can be stabilized and strengthened by the artful use of rhythmic activity.</p>
<p>Much store has been put in the efficacy of computer programs to boost brain efficiency. While brain efficiency is important, it is not the only aspect of being human that matters. Brain efficiency directly depends on the function level of all the body systems. We must stop treating humans as simply brains supported by a superfluous body structure. To retain quality of life, and indeed the quality of humanness itself, all the dimensions of wellness must be addressed together.</p>
<p>I hope you will consider inserting a recomendation for social rhythm-making in your final protocol for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Thank you for accepting my comments.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Are dental X-rays causing Alzheimer's disease?</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon. My name is Caroline Rodgers. I am a researcher and writer specializing in public health issues.</p>
<p>I am sure that everyone here would agree that Alzheimer's disease has turned the prospect of aging into a scary and uncertain future that will rob many of us of our memories, our dignity and even our lives. I am here because I envision a world in which Alzheimer's is once again a rarity and our senior years are a true Golden Age.</p>
<p>Last year my article proposing that dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's disease was published in the Journal of Medical Hypotheses<sup>1</sup>. I also made a poster presentation on the subject at the 2011 Alzheimer's Association International Conference<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The technical explanation of my hypothesis is:</p>
<p><em><strong>Ionizing radiation from dental X-rays shortens the telomeres of microglia, which are critical to maintaining neuronal health. This reduces the lifespan of microglia, stranding neurons. Stranded neurons subsequently die, causing irreversible dementia. </strong></em></p>
<p>More simply stated:</p>
<p><em><strong>Head exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation is causing us to outlive the brain cells designed to support our neurons all lifelong. </strong></em></p>
<p>NOTE: Dental X-rays are the only form of ionizing radiation that virtually all Americans are routinely exposed to at regular intervals throughout their entire lives, starting in early childhood. Although low-dose ionizing radiation amounts have been compared to background radiation exposure received during long airline flights, the amount of whole-body ionizing radiation received cannot be fairly compared to the amount beamed directly into the head.</p>
<p>It is not realistic to believe that decades of dental X-ray exposure would be without consequence for all people. The question is not, "Why should we consider whether dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's," but rather, "Why didn't we think of this sooner?"</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis foundation: </strong></p>
<ol><li>Alzheimer's prevalence data</li>
<li>Population-based dental care information</li>
<li>Scientific studies<sup>1-4</sup></li>
</ol><p><strong>Dental care &amp; dementia: A sampling of countries </strong></p>
<p>INDIA</p>
<p>67% have never visited a dentist<sup>5 </sup><br />
					Dementia prevalence estimated at 1/5 -1/4 that of Europe's<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>CHINA</p>
<p>30% to 43% adults have never visited a dentist<sup>7</sup><br />
					Dementia prevalence about half of Europe's<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>UNITED STATES</p>
<p>1% have never visited a dentist<sup>8</sup><br />
					13% of people 65 and older have AD<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><strong>Let's test this hypothesis against the facts </strong></p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: The emergence of AD symptoms is delayed 10 or more years following the presence of AD brain pathology.</p>
<p>Microglial telomere shortening would have a delayed effect on neurons because it reduces microglial lifespan, not function.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD mortality increased rapidly after 1979, making it the sixth leading cause of death by 2000.</p>
<p>Since AD symptoms are delayed by 10 or more years, it is worthwhile to look at health trends taking place in the decades before the surge in AD mortality. This was a time of major changes in the nation's dental health habits.</p>
<p><strong>1940</strong> it wasn't until the '40s that X-ray machines were common in America's dental offices<sup>10</sup>. However, nearly two decades later, in 1954 . . .<br /><strong>1957</strong> only 37% had visited a dentist within the year, while 18% reported never visiting a dentist<sup>11</sup>.<br /><strong>2008</strong> 59% had visited a dentist within the year, with only 1% never having visited a dentist<sup>8</sup>.<br /><strong>2010</strong> The national average that had been to a dentist or dental clinic within the year was 69.7%<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: The hippocampus is one of the first brain regions to suffer AD-related damage.</p>
<p>It contains both microglia and neural progenitor cells which -unlike other mature brain cells -- keep dividing, making them more susceptible to radiation-induced damage.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Men die sooner than women following an AD diagnosis<sup>12</sup>.</p>
<p>Older men have shorter telomeres than women the same age<sup>13</sup>, so they would have less time if their microglia telomeres were prematurely shortened.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Virtually all people with Down syndrome have AD brain pathology by age 40 -- but there is a wide variance in the onset of dementia<sup>14,15</sup>.</p>
<p>People with Down syndrome lose telomere length faster than the general population, but just like others, there is variation in newborn telomere length<sup>16,13</sup>. Also, people with Down syndrome are subject to many genetic dental anomalies that could entail additional X-ray exposure.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD prevalence is higher in urban areas<sup>17</sup>.</p>
<p>City dwellers make more dental visits<sup>18</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD is increasing most rapidly in developing countries -- especially Latin America<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>In the last few decades, many countries started providing free dental care to all citizens, such as Cuba in 1976, Venezuela in 1999 and Brazil in 2004,.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: AD does not respond to anti-inflammatory or cholesterol-lowering drugs -- even though AD is associated with brain inflammation and high cholesterol<sup>19,20</sup> .</p>
<p>Neither treatment can help neurons that have lost their support system.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Mentally stimulating activities initially delay AD, yet ultimately accelerate it<sup>21</sup>.</p>
<p>Additional brain growth would eventually overwhelm microglia struggling to support existing neuronal networks.</p>
<p><strong>If dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's, it raises new questions and concerns, such as:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Could diligent dental care explain the increase in non-familial early-onset AD?</li>
<li>At what price, a smile: What are the long-term risks for orthodontia patients exposed to cone-beam CT scanners that create 3-D images -- at much higher radiation levels?</li>
<li>Could head X-rays after sports injuries contribute to early-onset dementia?</li>
<li>If dental X-rays pose risks, could brain imaging utilizing ionizing radiation to monitor AD accelerate disease progression?</li>
<li>Do plateaus in declining cognition relate to intervals between X-ray exposures?</li>
<li>Could the ratio of dental professionals to population be used to create accurate algorithms to predict dementia trends?</li>
</ul><p><strong>What are the prospects for Alzheimer's prevention, treatment or cure? </strong></p>
<p>If dental X-rays are causing Alzheimer's disease, future cases can be decreased by eliminating or strictly limiting dental X-rays. Dentists can also turn to alternative imaging technologies already developed, yet not in common use. Interventions for people already exposed to dental X-rays yet without AD symptoms could include developing ways to safely transplant self-donated bone marrow or dental stem cells to replenish microglia populations. Other possibilities would be to develop ways to preserve or even lengthen microglia telomere length or to selectively remove permanently senescent microglia cells to stimulate replacement microglia that would actively provide neuroprotection. Sadly, there is no evident cure for people who have already lost their microglial support system to the point where enough neurons have died to cause symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Closing comments </strong></p>
<p>I don't know the answer to the questions I have raised in this short talk. I do, however, know that we have to look in new places with open minds to solve the puzzle of AD's emergence as a major killer and to restore health, dignity and luster to our "golden years."</p>

<p>I heard about this Federal, national initiative with great interest. Like cancer care, there needs to be an emphasis on research; however, there also needs to be an emphasis on finding high-quality, low cost, exceptional long-term care with dignity for persons with Alzheimer's and their families.</p>
<p>I am attaching a proposal I have for such (nationwide) care. I would like it to be considered by the committee as part of the national plan. I think it addresses care-giver support, the health care and other financial expenses, and the need for persons with Alzheimer's to live the rest of their lives with dignity.</p>
<p>Please contact me if you have additional questions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>PROPOSAL FOR A NEW STATE (NATION)-WIDE MODEL FOR LONG-TERM ALZHEIMER'S CARE DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The problem</strong></em>: We know that Alzheimer's Disease is putting an ever increasing burden on persons with the disease, their care-givers, the health care system, and society at large. It presents an urgent problem for our Nation, our State and our local communities.</p>
<p><strong>One key issue is finding affordable care for persons with Alzheimer's</strong>. This presents significant challenges for spouses, children and friends of those with Alzheimer's. Adult children often have to leave the workplace to provide care for aging parents, resulting in economic hardships and increased emotional stress as well as physical illnesses for themselves and their family members. Spouses may also end up with financial struggles as well as social isolation and additional psychological and physical ailments at the end of their lives, taking care of their spouse with dementia. The toll on children, spouses, friends, businesses, the healthcare system, and governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, mark this challenge as a future crisis for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>Currently, there is a lack of affordable care options for persons with Alzheimer's</strong>. The cost of care ranges from $4,000-$5,000/month for assisted living/memory unit care to $5,000-$7,000/month for nursing home care. Daycare is around $10/hour. Long term health insurance often pays for a limited number of years of care, requiring families to assume costs after this period ends. For many persons with Alzheimer's, Medicaid may eventually pay for their care.</p>
<p><strong>Most would agree that whenever possible, care should be given at home</strong>. The benefits of optimal home care are many, and include:</p>
<ol><li>the familiarity and security of a home-like setting</li>
<li>24/7 supervised care from familiar individuals</li>
<li>constant interaction/stimulation/socialization</li>
<li>adequate diet and nutrition</li>
<li>the possibility of regular outings outside the home, such as trips to the gym, salon or dinners out with familiar companions</li>
</ol><p><strong>In a word, such care ideally enables the person with Alzheimer's to age with dignity, respect, optimal health, and have excellent, continuous care for the rest of their lives. </strong></p>
<p>But what does this require? It often means the care-giver leads two lives, theirs and that of the person with Alzheimer's. Those who have done it know this is unsustainable and will take a significant and dramatic emotional, physical, and financial toll on them and their families.</p>
<p><strong><em>The solution</em>: What is needed for persons with Alzheimer's is <em>optimal, AFFORDABLE care in a home-like setting without requiring 24/7 care from their family members or friends</em></strong>. Imagine a world in which NO ONE WITH ALZHEIMER'S WOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LONG-TERM CARE! You and your family members/friends could rest assured that you would have an optimal, affordable long-term care option if you had or were to develop Alzheimer's. Although this sounds like a dream, <strong>it can become reality if several parties who are impacted by this problem (basically, all of us!) work together. THIS REQUIRES A DIFFERENT CARE DELIVERY PARADIGM, one that is NON-FOR PROFIT, IN WHICH LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS FAMILIES AND LOCAL BUSINESSES WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN</strong>.</p>
<p>What would this look like? How could this be achieved? The following is a suggested model.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong><em>First, there would be a registry of individuals needing such care</em></strong>. This could be developed by the State for each county. Registries would include personal and financial information for each applicant. In addition, APPLICANTS WOULD NEED TO BE LOCATED IN THE SAME AREA (COUNTY) AS THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS/FRIENDS WHO WOULD BE ASSISTING IN THEIR CARE. So, for each county in Florida, a registry (waiting list) would be established showing individuals with Alzheimer's needing care as well as locations of nearby family members/friends who would need to commit to helping in their care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Local homes for sale/in foreclosure would be purchased to create home settings in which the applicants would live</em></strong>. This would be the responsibility of the State, working with local governments, possibly with Federal/agency grant support. Initial costs for setting up the home might also be covered by Federal grants, possibly coupled with local government tax breaks as well as local business and charity support. Each home would have 3-4+ residents living there (depending on the size of the home) The residents for each home would be selected on the basis of their monthly incomes, with each home including a mix of upper, middle and lower income residents to insure a sufficient income stream to take care of home costs (mortgage, utilities, food). Each person in the home would be required to pay only their monthly income (be it Social Security or other pension or income source), allowing for spousal support, if that were an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Staffing for each home would include a small number of full-time professional staff (again, supported by State funding/Federal grant support) as well as MANDATORY VOLUNTEERS comprised of family members/friends</em></strong>. A REQUIREMENT OF RESIDENCY IN THE HOME IS THAT FAMILY MEMBERS/FRIENDS <em>MUST</em> WORK A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF HOURS/WEEK IN THE HOME. The less income a person living in the home has to provide to the home for his /her care, the more hours would be required of their family/friends as "sweat equity" to support the home. Volunteers would undergo criminal background checks and mandatory drug testing at their own expense. They would also undergo possible inservice/orientation training. THEIR ATTENDANCE FOR WORK SHIFTS AT THE HOME WOULD BE MANDATORY. Not showing up for their scheduled weekly times could result in their family member/friend being expelled from the home. (Family members could substitute time shifts for each other, provided they were in-serviced/screened to work at the home.) These volunteers would take care of all home needs such as meal preparation, home maintenance (cleaning, lawn work, home repair, etc.), driving residents to appointments, socializing with residents, etc. They would also complete select activities with their own family members, such as bathing and when working their shift, dressing their family member, as possible. Their general supervision and schedules would be established by the permanent staff. Given the presence of the volunteers, at any given time, there would be a minimum of a one-to-one or greater staff-to-resident ratio. That is, there would always be optimal supervision, socialization, and attention given to each resident and their individual needs. Also, given that family members would always be working at the home, <em>everyone would have a vested interest in the success of the home</em>. This arrangement would also insure that family members/friends would have exposure to Alzheimers/senior needs and care and the aging process, resulting in a more educated, informed population with respect to these issues. Finally, family members and staff would have an available, in-house network of support, to assist with any issues or emotions they might be experiencing as family members/caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Salaries of the permanent staff, although possibly a government expense, would be small in comparison to the increased burden to the State and Federal governments of escalating healthcare costs. For example, how much would Medicare and Medicaid save in not having persons with Alzheimer's over-medicated, incorrectly medicated and/or in and out of emergency rooms/hospitals/doctor's offices for preventable problems, not to mention the costs of taking care of the health issues of their family/friend care-givers? How much would Medicaid save in not having to provide indigent care to these individuals once they've exhausted all their resources?? These cost savings could be enormous.</p>
<p>A further benefit to the healthcare system might be in the training of professionals dealing with Alzheimer's care and care of the elderly given that resident physicians and other professionals in geriatric medicine might staff the homes or be on-call for the homes, increasing their direct exposure to aging individuals and those with Alzheimer's. Such an arrangement might significantly decrease the need for emergency room visits, doctor's visits, and hospital stays for persons with Alzheimer's. This would also increase professional education/experience and, as a result, might dramatically decrease healthcare costs for this population. An alternate model might include established physicians volunteering some of their time to examining residents of the homes or consulting with the permanent staff in the homes re: health issues of the residents, again eliminating unnecessary use of the medical system.</p>
<p>Residents would stay in the home, with hospice care as needed, until the end of their lives. Transfers to nursing homes might be needed in some cases. When a resident left the home permanently, another resident on the registry (waiting list) would take that individual's place, preferably matched on the basis of financial criteria to insure the continued viability of the home.</p>
<p>If less homes are needed at some time in the future (possibly due to effective Alzheimer's treatments or a cure), homes could either be sold with the purchasing agent (State or Federal government) recouping the costs + profit OR the registry model and homes could be used for those with different, chronic health issues, such as housing for adults with Autism. THIS MODEL OF CARE WOULD <em>NOT</em> AFFECT CURRENT DELIVERY MODELS in that there will always be a need for existing assisted living facilities for persons who do not want to relocate close to family members/friends, have sufficient funds to be cared for as part of different care models or in their own homes, who prefer current facilities, and/or have significant medical needs to require nursing home care. WHAT IMPLIMENTATION OF THIS MODEL PREVENTS IS THE PROFLIFERATION OF NEW FACILITIES AND THE ESCALATING COSTS TO CONSUMERS, WHO, ALONG WITH LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, WILL BE CRUSHED BY THEM.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><strong>In conclusion, we all know that something MUST be done to care for persons with Alzheimer's. The current model of care delivery, whether done at home or in a facility, is UNSUSTAINABLE for the majority of citizens</strong>. It is crushing to care-givers, the government, the business community, and society at large. The care given to the person with Alzheimer's is often inadequate. The current model will destroy our healthcare system and economy if something isn't done soon to change it. And the human toll is most significant, for persons with Alzheimer's as well as their family members, friends, and community at large.</p>
<p><strong>What is needed is a dramatically different model of care deliver AT THE STATE LEVEL with Federal support. It must be not for profit to contain costs. It must be a model in which all levels of government (local, state, federal) work with patients, families and local businesses to provide compassionate, dignified, and quality care to persons with Alzheimer's until the end of their lives</strong>. Our country is well positioned to show the world how this can be done, and Florida, with its large elderly population, should be at the forefront of this effort. If we can put a man on the moon 40 years ago, we can solve this health care crisis and show the rest of the country and world how it can be done!</p>
<p><strong><em>Background</em></strong>: Dr. Smith is a speech pathologist, currently in part-time practice. She cares for her 93 year old mother, who has moderate Alzheimer's, at home. She is well acquainted with assisted living facilities of various types, where her mother has stayed for respite care. She is also familiar with local activity groups for Alzheimer's, which her mother attends, as well as a local senior gym, where she takes her mother 3x/week for exercise. Dr. Smith's husband, James Ingram, assists in her mother's care.</p>

<p>I have attached a letter from Rep. Markey and Rep. Smith, Co-chairs of the Alzheimer's Taskforce and House authors of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA), with their recommendations for the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p>Please forward this letter to any any all staff working on NAPA, both at HHS and elsewhere.</p>
<p>We thank you for all of the work you are doing to implement the law and are excited to see the draft plan soon!</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>As the Co-founders and Co-chairs of the Bipartisan Congressional Taskforce on Alzheimer's Disease and House authors of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA), we are writing to urge the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to continue its swift and efficient implementation of the Act. NAPA is intended to be transformative, creating a groundbreaking, far-reaching, and thoughtful National Alzheimer's Plan to improve care for Alzheimer's patients across the country and ultimately cure this disease.</p>
<p>We applaud the ongoing work of the Nation Alzheimer's Project Act's Advisory Council and federal agency working groups. We are pleased to hear that a draft National Alzheimer's Plan required by the law will be read by early next year. As you know, several of the largest Alzheimer's advocacy, care, and research organizations have submitted ideas and priorities for the National Alzheimer's Plan.<sup>1</sup> We hope that the agencies working to develop the draft plan will strongly consider these various proposals.</p>
<p>We provide below our recommendations for your consideration as you prepare the National Alzheimer's Plan:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Increase medical research funding and coordination</strong></p>
<p>As millions of baby-boomers age and retire, Alzheimer's is becoming a national pandemic, threatening to undermine our Medicare and Medicaid systems. Today the federal government spends $93 billion out of Medicare to care for Alzheimer's patients -- almost one out of every five Medicare dollars (18%) each year. This money pays for hospitalizations, doctor visits, and drugs associated with the disease. An additional $37 billion comes out of the Medicaid budget every year -- more than one out every 10 Medicaid dollars (11%). Taken together, that's $130 billion every year from Medicare and Medicaid that is spent on this one disease alone.</p>
<p>In addition, nearly 15 million caregivers provide approximately 17 billion hours of unpaid care to family members and friends with Alzheimer's, which represents a large drain on the time and the resources of families and employers. Now more than ever, we need to accelerate research breakthroughs in the causes, treatments and prevention of this disease and reduce the emotional and financial burden of Alzheimer's on families and federally-funded programs.</p>
<p>Basic research is our best hope for understanding the fundamentals of this disease and finding a cure. Currently, Alzheimer's research is underfunded across the federal government, academia and the private sector. According to data from HHS, Alzheimer's disease receives a franction of the research funding at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) compared to other diseases. Today, the NIH spends about $6 billion a year on cancer research and $3 billion a year on AIDS research. Alzheimer's has five times as many victims as AIDS, yet receives only $469 million in research funding a year -- less than 1/6 the amount spent on AIDS research.</p>
<p>Deaths from AIDS, cancer, and heart disease have fallen in the last decade. As a nation, we should learn from our past successes. Prioritizing and funding medical research has lead to breakthroughs and treatments and ultimately saved lives. In the same way, we must expand funding for basic medical research for Alzheimer's disease, which continues to have a dramatically increasing number of patients every year across the country.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>It is also our hope that in drafting the National Alzheimer's Plan, HHS will also explore ways to better coordinate research and grants dollars within the centers and institutes of the NIH. Currently, over a dozen institutes at the NIH support or conduct Alzheimer's related research. Perhaps there is a need for an institute focused solely on the disease or a way to enhance data sharing amongst researchers. Whatever the solutions, the National Alzheimer's Plan should include concrete ideas to guarantee that all money, given through grants or used internally, is spent effectively and in coordination with other research projects in support of a larger research agenda.</p>
<p>In addition, we urge HHS to consider innovative projects to facilitate research and therapy development across public and private sectors. For instance, HHS should consider the feasibility of increasing accessibility to lumbar punctures for patients in order to develop national databases and registries for at risk patients. Cerebral spinal fluid tests are proven to identify those at high risk of Alzheimer's disease.<sup>3</sup> Increasing access to this screening technique would help facilitate entries into clinical trials, and, once therapies have been developed, identify those who should receive such therapies.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Incent private sector research and development</strong></p>
<p>Biopharmaceutical companies have approximately 21,000 ongoing clinical drug trials in the U.S., yet only 100 of them are focused on Alzheimer's disease. It is our hope that new incentives for pharmaceutical companies to invest in research and therapy development, including the development of new drugs, devices, biological products, biomarkers, or diagnostic tools, are included in the National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p>Federal agencies have adopted methods in the past for encouraging research and therapy development under adverse conditions, including: extended market exclusively for demonstrably effective treatments, priority review or fast-tracking by the Food and Drug Administration for treatments in the pipeline, review of guidelines regarding clinical trials, and patent life reform. It is our hope that the benefits and consequences of all methods are thoughtfully examined and considered in this case.</p>
<p>In addition, we urge HHS to consider ways to increase public-private partnerships for research and therapy development including possible strategic investments in start-up or growth companies engaged in advanced research and novel therapeutics, especially those companies willing to match funds from HHS.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Expand public awareness efforts</strong></p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Plan should call on relevant government agencies to work with local and state governments to develop public awareness campaigns around Alzheimer's disease, in the way HHS and the Centers of Disease Control have spearheaded public awareness campaigns in the past. It is our hope that the campaigns would focus on: the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, the importance of diagnosis, how to access clinical trials, and the availability of resources and services for patients, families and caregivers.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Provide reimbursement for comprehensive diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Reports estimate that as few as 19 percent of people with Alzheimer's disease have a documented diagnosis of their condition in their primary care medical record.<sup>4</sup> African-American and Hispanic populations are even less likely to be diagnosed than whites despite being at higher risks for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Medicare currently covers diagnostic evaluations and some imaging tests. However, if the signs of dementia have not been detected in the first place, a diagnostic evaluation is not conducted. Furthermore, after a diagnosis has been made, time constraints and lack of reimbursement often preclude a necessary discussion with the newly diagnosed patients and their caregivers regarding the diagnosis, treatment options, and support services available. As a result, many people with dementia and their families are not effectively connected to resources to help them manage the condition and avoid crises.</p>
<p>With an early diagnosis, patients and families can prepare for the oncoming symptoms of the disease. Facilitating conversations between doctors and caregivers and providing resources for patients' families can help mitigate the number of hospitalizations and complications for patients and ultimately bring down Medicare costs.</p>
<p>H.R. 1386, the Health Outcomes Planning and Evaluation Act (HOPE) for Alzheimer's, which we co-authored, proposes that the Centers for Medicare And Medicaid Services develop a new Medicare reimbursement code for a comprehensive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease to help drive best practices among doctors. This includes reimbursement of the following: screening of dementia, diagnostic evaluation, discussion with doctor and caregiver, and medical record documentation.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Expand outcome-oriented care programs and dementia training for healthcare professionals</strong></p>
<p>Models such as Independence at Home (IAH) and Resources for Enhancing Caregiver Health (REACH) have proven to improve the quality of care for patients and reduce health care costs by keeping patients in the comfort of their own homes longer and coordinating care services. IAH, currently a demonstration project slated to begin January 2012, creates a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, pharmacists, physical therapists and others to provide proactive care in the home for seniors with multiple chronic conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and congestive heart failure. As you know, there are more than 57 million Amerians living with multiple chronic illnesses in our country. These patients typically have numerous prescriptions written by an array of doctors, and struggle to visit their physicians when they need care. IAH aims to end the current disjointed approach of caring for these patients. Such successful programs that reduce costs and improve health care outcomes should be considered in the National Alzheimer's Plan and enacted across the country to support caregivers and increase access to quality care for all patients.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>In addition, it is our hope that the National Alzheimer's Plan will call on federal agencies to work with state and local governments to increase Alzheimer's and dementia training for health care professionals, social workers, employees of long-term care facilities and law enforcement. Increased training and education could dramatically improve the treatment of Alzheimer's patients and help avoid unnecessary costs and harm as the result of wrongful diagnosis and mistreatment.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Encourage State Plans</strong></p>
<p>30 states currently have or are in the process of developing plans for supporting Alzheimer's patients.<sup>6</sup> The Massachusetts Executive Office of Elder Affairs, for example, established a committee of experts to evaluate services and resources available to Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers and develop a strategy for improving care. Their initial reports focused on the need to diagnose patients early, connect patients and their families to available resources, and facilitate at-home care.</p>
<p>The challenges associated with Alzheimer's disease are too varied and far-reaching for the federal government to tackle alone. From improving transportation services for patients in rural neighborhoods to assisting in the creation of new adult daycare centers, state and local governments are well positioned to improve the day-to-day care of Alzheimer's patients. In order to fully support the millions of Americans with Alzheimer's disease and their families struggling to care for them, we need local and state governments involved in developing appropriate service models.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we hope the National Alzheimer's Plan will encourage states to assess the services they currently provide and develop plans for caring for the growing number of patients in the future. In addition, the National Alzheimer's Plan should look for ways the federal government can support or reward state efforts to improve and coordinate care, especially if states develop innovative solutions with measurable cost-savings or improvements in care.</p>
<p>Caring for the aging baby-boomers will be one of the greatest tests of our society. Today, over 5 millions Americans and their families are struggling with Alzheimer's disease. Unless we find a way to prevent, slow, or cure this disease, in less than one generation those struggles will nearly triple, as millions more Americans face the prospect of an Alzheimer's diagnosis. We must change our current trajectory. NAPA was intended to outline innovative and large-scale strategies for improving care for our senior citizens, to which we owe so much, and ultimately find a cure for this devastating disease. We encourage HHS and its partnering federal agencies to continue their diligent, timely, and thoughtful work to implement NAPA and draft this historic National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p>How exactly can these clinical trials be conducted on individuals with cognitive disorders? How do they give informed consent ?</p>
<p>A guardians should NEVER be allowed to give consent for testing and for that matter no person other than the subject who will be tested should be allowed to give informed consent for clinical trials.</p>
<p>Can the proxy individual who is giving informed consent feel the physiological consequences? I think not and this practice is in violation of international human research testing laws I believe.</p>

<p>CAUSES AND PREVENTION CAN BE DISCLOSED WITH STATISTICS! I am an 84 year old woman and a member of a genetic-Alzheimer's family. In my lifetime I am aware of eight family members who have been victims of Alzheimer's, the last three in my generation. Like so many families, I have watched my mother and my sister slowly lose their identities to this tragedy.</p>
<p>In the 21 years since an autopsy specified my mother's AD, dementia-research has mostly consisted of the very limited success of pharmaceutical trials, and more recently, gene-testing. This tunnel-vision has resulted in many family's continuing tragedies.</p>
<p>Currently, researchers are seeking new ways to identify pre-symptomatic members of such genetic families. They are searching for methods to identify those at high-risk, who are not yet experiencing cognitive impairments, so as to test "preventive" medications or life-styles.</p>
<p><strong><em>There is no need of evaluating pre-clinical subjects, when critical diagnostic testing and histories already exist, or can be researched, for those who have already been diagnosed with dementia. </em></strong></p>
<p>Current testing is uncovering conditions that may be causing dementia; injuries, diet, diseases, pathologies, environment, without the additional knowledge of possible <strong><em>linkage to commonality!</em></strong></p>
<p><em>It is time to invest in a "National/International Registry" to uncover the comparative histories of millions of patients. A computerized dignostic framework and guiding terminology needs to be created, to organize a vital public-reference as an ongoing global study of all brain diseases. </em></p>

<p>I am writing because I would like to become involved in advocacy work on behalf of U.S. citizens suffering from Alzheimer's. I was the sole caretaker for my mother, who passed away in February 2010; I began my long, sometimes difficult, but very rewarding journey with her in 1999. She was housed for several years in assisted living facilities, and my experience clearly showed me that Alzheimer's patients are not receiving the specialized care they deserve. Further, I also learned about traumatic housing transfer issues, and the need for the Alzheimer's patient to have one-on-one care daily with someone they are familiar with, whether or not recognition is still available.</p>
<p>I attended the Alzheimer's Association International Research Conference in Paris this July, learning about the disease process and lifestyle factors that may aide in prevention. My prior education included a B.S. in Psychology and graduate classes in Adult Education and Counseling. Prior to my care taking journey, I was (and still am) a Certified Alcohol and Drug Counselor. I have had a few brief classes in Pharmacology and Neurology, but nothing that fully addresses the mechanisms of Alzheimer's and other dementia diseases.</p>
<p>When I heard that a national advisory council was forming, I relayed feedback via e-mail. However, it seemed so little with such a huge problem / concern looming for the nation. I wish to be involved and helpful in other ways. I am willing to go back to school, move from my current residence -- anything to really make a solid difference in this complex, multi-faceted issue.</p>
<p>Do you have any advice as to a course of action that I can take? Does the National Advisory Council or any other organization involved with Alzheimer's need help that I am qualified to do? I sincerely wish to make a difference.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's has a very simple and avoidable cause: steam-refined polyunsaturated vegetable oils. I have been working this out since 1990.</p>
<p>The unsuspected vitamin E deficiency in these widely consumed food oils leads to brain cell membrane oxidation, that impairs the function of important enzymes that normally degrade the beta-amyloid protein. This protein therefore accumulates, incredibly slowly, in the brain of a regular consumer of deodorized vegetable seed oils.</p>
<p>After the age of 65 or so, accumulated beta-amyloidmay release highly toxic soluble aggregates (called oligomers), that are the immediate cause of synaptic toxicity and neuronal death.</p>
<p>That is exactly how over 5 million Americans have ended up with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>My suggestion to your Government, is simply to legislate a requirement for all refined seed oils in your country to have any vitamin E deficit (usually 30%) corrected before distribution and sale. This simple step will also prevent ADHD occurring during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Already, this basic preventive step is under consideration by the Australian Government's Food Standards Authority, and we may be the first nation in the world to eliminate the twin brain epidemics of Alzheimer's and its prenatal partner, ADHD.</p>
<p>The USA--where vacuum steam-refining of seed oils was invented, in 1899 (David Wesson, Savannah)--has no shortage of brain power. What you lack is a safe level of vitamin E in your brain-oxidizing vegetable oils.</p>
<p>Can you fix the problem, and catch up with Australia?</p>
<p>When your Norfolk, Virginia shipyards were mass-producing Liberty ships for WW2 Atlantic convoys, a large banner was hung across the docks, saying:</p>
<p>IT CAN AND WILL BE DONE!!</p>
<p>Can you make vegetable oils safe? Can you do this too?</p>
<p>I attach a draft hypothesis for your inspection: I shall be trimming it down shortly, for submission to The Lancet, in London.</p>
<p>Here, at long last, is the direct cause of the disease: knowing this, we can easily prevent it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Disease And Attention Deficit Disorder May Share A Single Cause: Refined Vegetable Oil</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>By Dr Robert Peers, General Practitioner, North Carlton, MELBOURNE</strong></p>
<p>In 1990 I identified a potential cause of typical late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), reporting my findings (a small case/control study) in a letter to the New Zealand Medical Journal [Ref 1] in 1993 (letter: "Alzheimer's Disease And Vegetable Oils"). I found that 12 cases of diagnosed AD had all consumed refined polyunsaturated seed oils for many years, contrasting with 20 age-matched control subjects with good memories, none of whom used such oils.</p>
<p>The reason for seeking a dietary cause was simple and compelling: AD had been seen to sometimes affect only one of a pair of identical twins [Ref 2], a striking finding that points strongly to some toxic or dietary cause. In addition, it was very unlikely to be caused by ageing itself, since the other twin was the same age, but remained unaffected in the long term; and because most older people do not in fact get the disease. I reasoned that those who were affected were somehow getting it from their diet, but how?</p>
<p>My initial reading even disclosed a likely dietary suspect: Professor Scott Henderson, an Australian research psychiatrist, cites in his 1988 AD review/hypothesis paper [Ref 3] a remarkable study [Ref 4] done by Professor Denham Harman in 1976, in Nebraska. Harman had a free radical theory of ageing, and knowing that both seed oils and the brain are rich in oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids, he wondered whether feeding safflower oil to his rats might cause free radical damage to the brain: it certainly did, as his rats soon lost their way in a maze. Furthermore, giving vitamin E to a new group of rats, fed the same oil, prevented these cognitive deficits--a finding that suggests that his oil, and perhaps other seed oils too, were low in vitamin E.</p>
<p>This work made me very curious about common vegetable seed oils, which were well known to reduce cholesterol and heart disease risk, but nobody had previously suspected them of actually causing a disease, and here they were evidently oxidizing the brain!</p>
<p>Soon after setting out on my library search for a dietary factor in 1990, I discovered that deodorized seed oils lose about a third of their antioxidant vitamin E during refining [Ref 5]--a potentially serious deficiency not seen in the soft margarines made from the same oils, which suffer polyunsaturate losses during hydrogenation, restoring the vitamin E/polyunsaturate balance. I realized immediately how important this deficiency would be in the brain, whose nerve cell membranes are very rich in highly oxidizable long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p>
<p>Since the main function of vitamin E is to protect these vulnerable essential fatty acids against oxidation, a low level of vitamin E in the nerve cell membrane would invite cerebral "lipid peroxidation". Oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids breaks up the fatty acid chain, and among the fragments are neurotoxic aldehyde molecules.</p>
<p>Oxidized Omega-6 fatty acids, in particular, release the highly reactive aldehyde 4-hydroxy nonenal (4-HNE), whose toxic effects on nerve synapses may account for the faulty memory seen in "Seed Oil Syndrome", described below. But 4-HNE does more than that: it activates a key enzyme involved in AD development, and may also--more importantly--mediate the impaired beta-amyloid clearance caused by cerebral lipid peroxidation.</p>
<p>Elena Tamagno, in Turin, has shown [Ref 6], in recent years, that 4- HNE indirectly activates the pivotal AD enzyme beta-secretase (BACE 1), a small rise in the activity of which causes a sharp increase in betaamyloid formation [S Cole, Ref 7]. Beta-amyloid is a peptide--a small protein fragment--that is the molecular cause of AD, as in rare genetic cases, where a gene mutation increases the production of a more toxic form of this peptide (the longer form, with 42 aminoacids, rather than the 40 residues seen in the much less toxic and more abundant form).</p>
<p>Although small amounts of this important protein fragment are produced in the normal brain, it is easily cleared away by degrading enzymes, and it can also exit the brain through the blood-brain barrier. However, people consuming refined vegetable oil will be forming increased beta-amyloid in abnormal oxidizing conditions, that may damage the clearance mechanism, resulting in progressive betapeptide accumulation and, ultimately, Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>One possibility is that lipid peroxidation products, like the same 4-HNE, might inhibit a key clearance enzyme, called Insulin-Degrading Enzyme (which also degrades beta-amyloid). In fact, an amyloid clearance problem is all that is required to cause AD, since even a mild over-production of beta-amyloid--as I postulate above--may still be successfully cleared.</p>
<p>So my theory does require a clearance defect, whether or not amyloid production is increased. And now, in 2009, Dr Y Nishida in Japan has shown [Ref 8] that by blocking vitamin E transport to mouse brain, lipid membrane peroxidation ensues, which impairs beta-amyloid clearance, by somehow reducing the expression of the gene coding for the above Insulin-Degrading Enzyme. Vitamin E-depleted seed oils, likewise, lower vitamin E levels in most tissues, causing lipid peroxidation [Y H Wang, Ref 9], which must include the brain, as shown by the early cognitive deficits seen in Harman's pioneering work (above), and their notable prevention with vitamin E.</p>
<p>Common Omega-6 seed oils, which are usually steam-deodorized, have been linked to cognitive decline in Holland [S Kalmijn, Ref 10], and also in Greece [D Psaltopoulou, Ref 11]), and to over double the risk of incident dementia (70% being AD) in the prospective "Three Cities Study" in France [P Barberger-Gateau, Ref 12]. Processed safflower oil, as discussed above, was shown many years ago (1976!) to cause memory faults in rats, which could be prevented with vitamin E. For some reason, Dr Harman did not alert the US food safety authorities to this alarming discovery.</p>
<p>Low vitamin E levels in corn, soya and safflower oils were first demonstrated by Dr David Herting in Rochester, New York State (Ref 5--see "herting d and 1963" on <a href="http://www.pubmed.gov">http://www.pubmed.gov</a>, to find and download his free Journal of Nutrition paper). He concluded that widespread vitamin E deficiency would occur in populations consuming processed polyunsaturated seed oils. However, he did not realize the extreme peroxidation vulnerability of the brain and retina, where reduced vitamin E levels mean rapid lipid peroxidation of long-chain Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, in synapses and in retinal rod cell disc membranes. Had he known this, he could have predicted a new disease of the brain, with the further possibility of a new childhood brain disorder, arising in the fetal brain during pregnancy.</p>
<p>It was precisely these most vulnerable tissues that were tragically ignored in the landmark nutritional study, completed in 1960 in Illinois, on which current recommended daily intake of vitamin E is based [Ref 13]. Although lead investigator Dr Max Horwitt should have been aware of the brain's rich concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (mentioned, for example, in 1950s biochemistry texts), he judged vitamin E requirement exclusively by testing the fragility of red blood cell membranes in vitamin E-deprived human subjects, finding even greater fragility when the subjects were given vitamin E-stripped corn oil.</p>
<p>It did not occur to Horwitt to ask his vitamin E-deprived subjects about higher mental functions like memory or mood. Memory difficulties (and glare sensitivity and night-blindness from retinal damage) are likely to occur long before the red cell test becomes positive in response to gradual dietary vitamin E depletion, because the oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids are much less concentrated in the red cell membrane, than in retina and brain. Lipid peroxidation is a very rapid chain-reaction, that proceeds much faster in a vitamin E-depleted cell membrane containing a high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially when those fatty acids--as in brain and retina--are of the long-chain variety, full of oxidizable double bonds.</p>
<p>To his credit, Horwitt did realize that the main function of vitamin E is to protect polyunsaturated fatty acids, so he based the recommended daily intake on the ratio of vitamin E to the intake of these fatty acids. He assumed that higher polyunsaturate intake, for example seed oil, would automatically mean higher vitamin E intake, but neglected the possibility that processed seed oils might lose some of this vitamin E during refining, and so cause some new disease specifically involving tissues prone to lipid peroxidation.</p>
<p>Indeed, he failed to pursue this possibility, even when he found that some members of staff at the Elgin Mental Hospital, who were not on the vitamin E deficient test diet, also had an abnormal red cell test. He did not ask himself how that could have happened, but could have taken a dietary history, and might have discovered that they were consumers of common vegetable oils, which could therefore have had something in common with his experimental stripped corn oil: low content of vitamin E. He may then have gone on to investigate the vitamin E content of such oils, and found it to be low--as David Herting found three years later, in 1963. Had Horwitt detected mild memory faults in consumers of refined seed oils, and set himself to do a little thinking, he could have nipped Alzheimer's in the bud, in 1960.</p>
<p>Any child, young person or adult consuming refined seed oils will report, if asked, memory problems, poor dark adaptation and glare sensitivity (photophobia--which is irreversible). I discovered this syndrome in general practice, and I call it Seed Oil Syndrome, and it probably reflects 4-HNE neurotoxicity in the synapses. Lipid peroxidation, which in the long term causes impaired beta-amyloid clearance, has early clinical effects due to synaptic damage: 4-HNE impairs neuronal glucose uptake, among other effects.</p>
<p>I have seen this hitherto undescribed syndrome in 100s of oil-using patients in family practice, over many years. The memory responds well to vitamin E (I sometimes add fish oil, for a faster response), except after the age of 50 or so, when subjects report long-term stability of memory, without actual improvement.</p>
<p>I am hoping that these cases, who, after some 20-30 years of refined oil exposure, may have a significant brain amyloid load, will not progress to AD, once off seed oils, and using olive oil, vitamin E and fish oil supplement. I also have some of them on Inositol, a seed sugar known to neutralize toxic Abeta oligomers [Ref 14] and improve language and orientation in established AD [Ref 15].</p>
<p>This simple glucose isomer, which is easily obtained in the diet (from grains, nuts, legumes, soymilk, cantaloupe and citrus), may prove to be a powerful weapon--along with cessation of refined-oil exposure-- in preventing Seed Oil Syndrome progressing slowly to Mild Cognitive Impairment and, ultimately, diagnosed AD. Given the extensive neuronal damage already evident in these two later stages, ultra-early prevention is now thought to be the only way to stop this disease, and nutrition--if it can do the job--is far preferable to preventive drugs.</p>
<p>From the public health angle, all cases of Seed Oil Syndrome--which is easily identified by symptoms and diet history--should change to olive oil (or any cold-pressed oil), eat a high.Inositol diet (even citrus juice is very rich in Inositol), and preferably take fish-oil capsules as well.</p>
<p>Saturated fat intake from butter, cream, cheese, fatty meat, pastries etc., must also be reduced, for it commonly causes co-morbid vascular dementia in the Alzheimer victim.</p>
<p>Inositol, given as a higher dose (5 gm/day) via supplement, also reverses anxiety disorder and depression [Ref 16], which affect perhaps 40% of AD cases. Anxiety alone doubles the risk of progressing from Mild Cognitive Impairment to AD [Ref 17], possibly because of cortisol-induced hippocampal damage, low Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor levels and poor hippocampal neurogenesis. Depression, often resulting from anxiety plus fatty diet, may increase inflammation--pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin 1-beta may aggravate neuronal damage and increase stress axis activation even further. Anti-anxiety doses of Inositol also have a place here, by greatly decreasing stress-induced comfort-eating of fatty foods like chocolate, cheese, cakes and pastries [author's clinical observations].</p>
<p>One extra benefit from Inositol in brain disease is its unexpected antiageing effect [Ref 18], a possible example of which is the NIH 31 grain-rich mouse diet, that prolongs the median lifespan of female mice by 25% [Ref 19]. By altering the same genes that are altered by caloric restriction--including the key mitochondrial biogenesis gene PGC 1 alpha--Inositol is clearly a caloric restriction mimetic, with the same potential as dietary restriction to provide neurotrophic, antioxidant and energizing benefits in brain, as described by nutritional neuroscientist Mark Mattson [Ref 20]. Already, a multiple sclerosis animal model has been found to respond well to caloric restriction [Ref 21]: Inositol is a more practical intervention.</p>
<p>Variations in AD incidence around the world (low in West Africa, very high in Wadi Ara Arabs in Israel, 4 times higher in Pittsburgh than in Ballabgarh, Northern India) probably reflect local patterns of refined seed oil consumption. In Northern India, unrefined traditional oils are still very popular (eg. pungent mustard oil, crude peanut oil), and in the South there is mostly coconut oil and crude peanut oil--and possibly an even lower AD rate.</p>
<p>Refined oils are, however, encroaching on these traditional markets. Palm oil is the main cooking oil in Malaysia and Indonesia, where AD rates may be low, but in the US and Europe--and the Middle East too-- refined oils are the rule, apart from those people lucky enough to still use mainly olive oil. A study in Bari, Italy, some years ago, showed cognitive decline in older subjects not using olive oil [Ref 22]; they were apparently using common refined supermarket seed oils, which are widely used in Italy for frying.</p>
<p>An oil that causes a serious brain disease in adult life might also be expected to affect the fetal brain: when asking many oil-using patients about symptoms of Seed Oil Syndrome, I have noticed--as a family doctor--that young adults with the syndrome frequently have children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). I proceeded to do a pilot case/control study on retrospective pregnancy diet, in 80 cases versus 80 controls.</p>
<p>Almost all (78) of the mothers of ADHD cases gave a history of regular consumption of refined seed oils during all or part of the pregnancy, often from fried takeaway food. All of these mothers had permanent glare sensitivity (most carried sunglasses, usually perched conveniently on their head), and those who still consumed these oils had ongoing memory difficulties and impaired night vision.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have met young adults with residual ADHD, who report that their mother, if still using such oils, and now in her mid- to lateforties, has an obvious memory problem. The Scottish breath-analysis scientist Brian Ross has found evidence of lipid peroxidation (increased breath ethane gas) in some children with ADHD [Ref 23], probably due to ongoing childhood exposure to the same refined seed oils that caused their condition during gestation.</p>
<p>In my child patients, such further exposure significantly worsens the ADHD, by increasing cognitive problems, mood issues, aggression and impulsivity--all of which improve rapidly by stopping the exposure and recommending fish oil, to assist synaptic recovery and plasticity. Not only does fish oil work faster when refined oils are first excluded from the diet (to prevent peroxidative destruction of the fish oil fatty acids in vitamin E-depleted synapses), but the synaptic benefits of fish oil may be greatly enhanced by adding two more "synaptic building blocksh--uridine and choline--as proposed for Alzheimer's, by nutritional neuroscientist Dr Richard Wurtman, at the Massachusets Institute of Technology [Ref 24]. Uridine sources include brewer's yeast, broccoli and beetroot, while choline is found in egg, chicken, lecithin and wheat germ. Wurtman's "Souvenaid" synapse-restoring mixture, which increases synaptic density and cognitive function in gerbil rats, does improve Alzheimer symptoms, and may work even better in the developing ADHD brain of a young child, to the extent that usual medications for the latter disorder may become obsolete, due to advances in brain nutrition.</p>
<p>I believe there is enough evidence available to conclude that deodorized seed oils are a major public health hazard, being directly responsible for ADHD, widespread Seed Oil Syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease. I notice in my clinic that Seed Oil Syndrome causes depression and irritability in anxious subjects, and aggravates ADHD in children and adolescents, promoting delinquency, serious aggression, antisocial behaviour, and substance abuse. These problems are now endemic in Western cities, and increasing world-wide.</p>
<p>Correction of all such brain peroxidation problems is very simple: to protect their citizens, while at the same time keeping these heartfriendly oils available, governments must be persuaded to pass laws requiring that all deodorized seed oils be rendered safe, with respect to their vitamin E content, before being sold. Natural vitamin E can 8 easily be recovered from the steam distillate at the food oil refinery, and replaced in the deodorized oil: or synthetic vitamin E could be used instead. Urgent action is required.</p>
<p>The highly desirable result of fixing this seed oil catastrophe would be to eliminate the twin epidemics of Alzheimer's and ADHD, along with the alarming antisocial effects of refined seed oils, as specified above.</p>
