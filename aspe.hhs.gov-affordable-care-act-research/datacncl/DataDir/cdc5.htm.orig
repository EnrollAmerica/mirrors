    <p><strong>TITLE:</strong> CDC Firearm Injury Surveillance Study</p>
<p><strong>ACRONYM:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>AGENCY/PROGRAM:</strong> National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has launched an effort to understand the magnitude and characteristics of nonfatal firearm-related injuries (FA) in the United States. These injuries have a tremendous impact on our society in terms of morbidity, cost of medical care, and long-term disability, especially associated with head and spinal cord injuries.</p>
<p>Data are being obtained through the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) and these data have been very usefulf or monitoring national estimates of the incidence of nonfatal FA injuries treated in hospital emergency departments (EDs). The NEISS consists of a stratified probability sample of all hospitals with EDs in the United States. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) operates NEISS and uses the system to identify hazards and track product-related injuries. Currently, 98 NEISS hospitals participate. This study is being conducted through an interagency agreement and in collaboration with the CPSC. We have demonstrated that NEISS can provide valid national estimates of nonfatal FA injuries treated in hospital EDs.</p>
<p>Ongoing national surveillance of nonfatal FA injuries using NEISS was initiated in June 1992. We are currently collecting information on method of transport to the ED, demographic characteristics of the injured person, type of injury, primary body part affected, hospitalization, intent of injury, victim-offender relationship, type of firearm used, and other circumstances about the injury incident.</p>
<p>These files contain data on: Functional/Health Status; Age/Gender; Other Demographic/Sociocultural; and Other (circumstances/ nature/intent of injury).</p>
<p><strong>RACE/ETHNICITY:</strong> Race categories are: American Indian/Alaskan Native; Asian or Pacific Islander; Black; White; and Other. Ethnicity categories are: Hispanic; and Not of Hispanic Origin.</p>
<p><strong>DATA LIMITATIONS:</strong> Data on race/ethnicity are obtained as specified on hospital emergency department records. If a person is reported as Hispanic, race is usually recorded as "other." NEISS provides national estamates, but does not provide state and local estimates.</p>
<p><strong>STATUS:</strong> Started in June 1992, this continuous data collection is active.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO ACCESS DATA:</strong> Data are available in scientific journals and written reports. Public use files are also available for NEISS FA data obtained from 1993 through 1999. Data can be accessed through the University of Michigan's Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), National Archive of Criminal Justice Data <a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/archive.html">http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/archive.html</a>, study number 3018.</p>

<hr /><p><strong><a name="neissaip" id="neissaip"></a>TITLE:</strong> National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) All Injury Program (AIP)</p>
<p><strong>ACRONYM:</strong> NEISS AIP</p>
<p><strong>AGENCY/PROGRAM:</strong> National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is collaborating with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to expand the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on all types and causes of injuries treated in a representative sample of U.S. hospitals with emergency departments (ED). National estimates of nonfatal injuries are available for 2000 and will soon be available for 2001.</p>
<p>The NEISS All Injury Program is designed to provide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes of nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in U.S. hospital EDs. Its scope will go beyond routine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related products in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and poisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and distribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States; (2) monitor unintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time, (3) identify emerging injury problems; (4) identify specific cases for follow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems; and (5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion effort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in a timely manner to a number of federal agencies with unique and overlapping public health responsibilities. Annually, the final edited data will be released on a public use data tape for use by other public health professionals and researchers.</p>
<p>NEISS provides data on age, race/ethnicity, sex of the patient, diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, died), the locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the <em>International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification</em> (ICD-10-CM) coding rules and guidelines. In this way, if additional resources become available in the future, these data could be coded using ICD-10-CM external-cause-of-injury codes.</p>
<p>NCIPC's Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS), which can be accessed at the NCIPC home page <a href="http://www.cdc.gov">www.cdc.gov/ncipc</a>, provides a quick and easy interactive method of obtaining injury statistics in tailored report formats. In addition to the fatality data module, the NEISS AIP nonfatal data are available in two formats: Nonfatal Injury Reports and Leading Causes of Nonfatal Injury.</p>
<p><strong>RACE/ETHNICITY:</strong> The four categories are: white, non-Hispanic black (including hispanic and non-hispanic), Hispanic (for all races other than black), and unknown/unspecified.</p>
<p><strong>DATA LIMITATIONS:</strong> The nonfatal data does not offer the option to request leading causes of injury by race/ethnicity because of the relatively high percentage (appx. 17 %) with unknown race/ethnicity. For nonfatal injury reports users can request the number of injuries from a specific cause and intent of injury by race/ethnicity by selecting "race" as a sort option. Annualized national estimates presented for each race/ethnicity category will be low because they do not count cases recorded as "unknown" race/ethnicity. Another limitation is that state and local estimates are not available.</p>
<p><strong>STATUS:</strong> The NEISS AIP began in July 2000 and is ongoing.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO ACCESS DATA:</strong> The Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS) is an internet-based injury statistics system designed to provide the user with the NEISS AIP data in two report formats: Nonfatal Injury Reports and Leading Causes of Nonfatal Injury. In addition, the user can create tailored reports to meet their individual needs. WISQARS can be located through the NCIPC home page at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov">www.cdc.gov/ncipc.</a></p>

<hr /><p><a name="tbiss" id="tbiss"></a><strong>TITLE:</strong> CDC Traumatic Brain Injury Surveillance System</p>
<p><strong>ACRONYM:</strong> TBISS</p>
<p><strong>AGENCY/PROGRAM:</strong> National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had developed and maintains a surveillance system to understand the magnitude and characteristics of hospitalized and fatal traumatic brain injuries in the United States. These injuries have a tremendous impact on our society in terms of morbidity, cost of medical care, and long-term disability.</p>
<p>CDC began promoting the development of a multistate traumatic brain injury surveillance system in 1989, after the Federal Interagency Head Injury Task Force Report identified the need for better information on the public health impact of brain injuries. The surveillance system's purpose is to collect program wide information that can be used to help design targeted prevention programs addressing specific causes of TBI and populations at higher risk, to improve injured persons' access to health care, and to improve other services they need after injury.</p>
<p>In 1995, CDC published Guidelines for Surveillance of Central Nervous System Injury2 to help ensure that the multistate TBI surveillance system would generate valid and timely information representative of the U.S. population. These guidelines provided standard case definitions and clearly defined the data elements necessary to describe the occurrence, severity, and outcome of these injuries, their external causes, and associated risk factors. The core of these data elements are obtained from hospital discharge reports that are available to most state health departments.</p>
<p>In 1997, CDC published initial findings from this multistate TBI surveillance system, including data from four jurisdictions: Colorado, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Utah.</p>
<p>As a result of the Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-166), CDC was able to add 11 states to the system in September 1997, bringing the total number of participants to 15. Participating states now include Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Utah. Together, these states represent much of the diversity of populations found throughout the United States.</p>
<p><strong>RACE/ETHNICITY:</strong> Categories of race are: American Indian/Alaskan Native; Asian or Pacific Islander; Black; White; and Other. Categories of ethnicity are: Hispanic; Not of Hispanic Origin.</p>
<p><strong>DATA LIMITATIONS:</strong> Since information on nonfatal cases is obtained from hospital discharge data systems, data on race/ethnicity are not available from states.</p>
<p><strong>STATUS:</strong> Ongoing</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO ACCESS DATA:</strong> Data are available in scientific journals and written reports. Public use files are not available yet. Data are available in statistical reports for 1990-1994.</p>

<p><strong>ACRONYM:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>AGENCY/PROGRAM:</strong> National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> This pilot system is designed to capture the state-wide incidence of emergency department related injuries. MA, MN, and SC are the states currently participating in this system, each using slightly different methods to achieve the same set of standardized data elements. Each of the three participating state health departments may choose to analyze subset areas within their states; and they may even want to provide a participating emergency department with summaries or analyses of the data it has submitted. Data will be available for all or part of 1998 and collection will probably continue in the future. At this time, it is expected that data will be collected quarterly and that each state will produce data-based reports at least annually.</p>

<p><strong>ACRONYM:</strong> NIPRCS</p>
<p><strong>AGENCY/PROGRAM:</strong> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Immunization Provider/DMD/AB</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> The NIPRCS is a component of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The NHIS is a cross-sectional face-to-face household interview of the civilian, non-institutionalized population of the U.S. The NHIS collects a broad array of health information to monitor the health of the nation. Included in the NHIS is an immunization section which collects the immunization histories of children under 18 years of age.</p>
<p>The purpose of the NIPRCS is to validate the immunization histories of the children 12-35 months of age included in the NHIS. The immunization provider of the child is contacted by mail and/or telephone to complete a self administered questionnaire which includes a section to report all immunizations the child has received. Data from the NIPRCS are used to produce immunization coverage estimates for the nation. Data are collected on an ongoing basis; data are available for 1994 and 1995.</p>

<p><strong>ACRONYM:</strong> NIS</p>
<p><strong>AGENCY/PROGRAM:</strong> National Immunization Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> The National Immunization Program works throughout the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories and commonwealths to maintain and enhance early childhood vaccination coverage levels. To monitor vaccination coverage for all recommended vaccines for children 19 through 35 months of age, the National Immunization survey (NIS) is being conducted in 78 areas, consisting of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and 27 metropolitan areas. Beginning with the second quarter of 1994 the NIS data collection effort will conduct independent quarterly surveys in each of the 78 IAP areas. This will make it possible to combine four consecutive quarters of survey data with a degree of precision sufficient for analytic purposes to provide annualized estimates of the coverage rates for the five antigens (DTP, Polio, MMR, Hib, and Hep B) within each of the 78 IAP areas recommended in 1994. The survey has been flexible to allow monitoring of newly recommended vaccines.</p>
<p>The data collection methodology and sample design use list-assisted random digit dialing methods to sample households and conduct computer -assisted telephone interviews. Screening for households with children 19 through 35 months of age is conducted through brief interviews. When an eligible household is identified, data on vaccination history, including dates and/or numbers of immunization events and socio-demographic information are obtained for each child and household interviewed. These files contain data on: Functional/Health Status; Socioeconomic; and Age/Gender.</p>
<p><strong>RACE/ETHNICITY:</strong> Race categories are: White; Black; American Indian; Asian; Other; Don't Know; and Refused Specification. Ethnicity categories are: Not Spanish/Hispanic; Mexican; Mexican-American; Chicano; Puerto Rican; Cuban; Other Spanish; Don't Know; and Refused Specification.</p>
<p><strong>STATUS:</strong> Started in April 1994, this continuous data collection is active.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO ACCESS DATA:</strong> Findings from the NIS are currently available in MMWR publications. In addition, there are plans to include results from the NIS in an annual CDC/NIP surveillance report and in manuscripts published in peer-reviewed journals.</p>

<p><strong>ACRONYM:</strong></p>
<p><strong>AGENCY/PROGRAM:</strong> National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> The Alaska Trauma Registry (ATR) collects data from all hospitalized traumatic injuries that are admitted to any of the 24 hospitals in Alaska. The Alaska State Department of Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Section of Community Health and Emergency Medical Services administer the ATR with assistance from NIOSH focusing on work-related injury surveillance. Each hospital identifies cases and abstracts information from the patient's medical record. ATR cases are identified by a discharge diagnosis ICD-9-CM "N code" ranging from 800 through 995.99 and they have to be either admitted to a hospital in Alaska, transferred to another hospital and admitted, or have expired in the hospital emergency department. The abstracted information is then sent to the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services to be entered into the Alaska Trauma Registry computer database. Data are currently available for the period 1991 through 1999. Data in the ATR surveillance system are used to focus on nonfatal work-related injuries in Alaska. These data allow us to focus on industries, workers, and causes of injuries for priority setting and further injury prevention research.</p>

<p><strong>ACRONYM:</strong> FACE</p>
<p><strong>AGENCY/PROGRAM:</strong> National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> The Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) surveillance system contains first reports of traumatic occupational fatalities in 15 states obtained through multiple sources of notification including death certificates, coroner and medical examiner reports, OSHA, law enforcement, the media, and other injury surveillance systems. Data are collected by 15 state programs funded through five-year cooperative agreements with NIOSH. FACE programs are housed within state departments of health, departments of labor, and universities. Data are currently available for the period 1990 through 1997. Because of varying funding cycles, not all states have yet contributed five years of data, nor are the data limited to the 15 states now being funded. The data in the FACE surveillance system allow description of the nature and magnitude of traumatic occupational fatalities and are used to set research and prevention priorities within the 15 program states. Because the FACE data are submitted monthly and include detailed narratives describing injury circumstances, they are used by NIOSH researchers to identify emerging injury hazards in the workplace.</p>
<p>The FACE program also maintains supplemental data files that contain information on fatalities for which a site investigation was conducted. Active emphasis areas include machinery-related fatalities, fatal falls from elevations, and logging-related incidents. Supplemental files cover employer characteristics, safety programs, worker training, use of personal protective equipment, environmental and site conditions, machinery maintenance, and other factors.</p>
<p>Files contain data on: Functional/Health Status; Age/ Gender; Other Demographic/Sociocultural; Other (narrative data on occupation; industry; cause of death; circumstances of injury).</p>
<p><strong>RACE/ETHNICITY:</strong> Race categories are: White; Black; Native American; Asian or Pacific Islander; and Other. Ethnicity: Hispanic; Non-Hispanic; and Unknown.</p>
<p>DATA LIMITATIONS: Currently, FACE first reports are limited to 15 states. Participating states change from year to year because states enter and leave the program based on competition for funding.</p>
<p><strong>STATUS:</strong> Started in January 1990, data collection is active, with data submitted electronically each month by participating states.</p>
<p>START DATE: January 1990</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO ACCESS DATA:</strong> Tabulations provided. Data are not published or released in any format that would allow identification of an individual.</p>

<p><strong>ACRONYM: </strong>NOMS</p>
<p><strong>AGENCY/PROGRAM: </strong>National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> The purpose of the data system is to provide a resource for surveillance and research in occupational health. The data apply to all decedents in the States providing data to the system. The States are not consistent from year to year. Data collection was instituted in 1979. Presently the system contains data from 1979 through 1999, with yearly additions of data through this period. The database is a nonrandom sample of the United States. Through 1999, the database contains about 24% of the U.S. deaths, with a total sample size of about 10,600,000 deaths. Substantially fewer states are providing data for years after 1999. Cause of death, occupational, and demographic information is collected for all ages, including State, county and city identifiers. For most States, the death certificate information is collected and coded by state health departments and provided to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS edits the data and provides it to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the National Cancer Institute. A few States have provided the data directly to NIOSH. The record unit is the decedent. Information is available about 2 years after data collection.</p>
<p>Files contain data on: Functional/Health Status; Socio-economic; Age/Gender; Other Demographic/ Sociocultural.</p>
<p>Additional information collected for the decedent which may help explain racial or ethnic disparities includes: date and place of death, cause of death, sex, age, marital status, state of birth, place of residence, occupation, industry, and education.</p>
<p><strong>RACE/ETHNICITY: </strong>The race/ethnicity coding scheme varies across the project years. For all years, the following race/ethnicity categories exist: White; Black; American Indian (includes American, Alaskan, Canadian, Eskimao, and Aleut); Chinese; Japanese; Hawaiian; Filipino; Other Asian or Pacific Islander; and Other.</p>
<p>For 1979-1988 the category "All Other Races" was used. Additional codes added after 1988 are: Asian Indian; Korean; Samoan; Vietnamese; Guamanian.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a Hispanic Origin and an Hispanic Origin/Race recode in the database after 1988.</p>
<p>Hispanic Origin coding after 1988: Non-Hispanic; Mexican; Puerto Rican; Cuban; Central or South American; Other and Unknown Hispanic; Hispanic Origin Unknown.</p>
<p>Hispanic Origin/Race recode after 1988: Mexican; Puerto Rican; Cuban; Central or South American; Other and Unknown Hispanic; Non-Hispanic White; Non-Hispanic Black; Non-Hispanic Other Races; Hispanic Origin Unknown.</p>
<p>Race or ethnicity is identified from the death certificate. Through 1998 the number of deaths by major race or ethnicity group is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>White 8,785,347</li>
<li>Black 1,136,545</li>
<li>American Indian 40,628</li>
<li>Chinese 10,296</li>
<li>Japanese 12,837</li>
<li>Hawaiian 5,205</li>
<li>Filipino 7,232</li>
<li>Other Asian/P.I. 14,223</li>

<p><strong>ACRONYM:</strong> SENSOR Silicosis</p>
<p><strong>AGENCY/PROGRAM:</strong> National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> This system compiles information about cases of silicosis identified by two currently participating states--New Jersey and Ohio. Silicosis is an occupationally-related dust-induced lung disease. Case ascertainment methods vary by state but generally include the following sources: hospital discharge diagnoses, physician reports, Workers' Compensation, and death certificates. The SENSOR program links case findings to prevention/intervention activities. NIOSH has recently begun to electronically aggregate SENSOR silicosis data across the participating states. Data are currently available from NIOSH for SENSOR silicosis cases identified from 1993-1995. States submit data to NIOSH a variable number of years following initial case ascertainment to enable states to complete their case and workplace follow-up activities.</p>
<p>Methods of data collection for this system include:</p>
<ul><li>direct interview</li>
<li>notification of case(s)/events</li>
<li>Computerized information</li>
<li>Data are originally collected by:</li>
<li>state/local health departments</li>
</ul><p>Data are collected yearly.</p>
<p>Files contain data on other socio-demographic variables collected in this system that may explain racial and/or ethnic disparities include:</p>
<ul><li>occupation</li>
</ul><p><strong>RACE/ETHNICITY:</strong> Race categories are: American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, White, Other, Don't know. Hispanic Ethnicity: Yes, No, Don't know</p>
<p><strong>STATUS:</strong> This system collects data actively and passively.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO ACCESS DATA:</strong> CDC internal use files only. Interpreted results can be accessed through:</p>
<ul><li>internal reports</li>
<li>external reports</li>
<li>MMWR Weekly Reports</li>
<li>MMWR Surveillance Summaries</li>
