<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>There is much to praise and to be grateful for in the 2015 National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Thanks to Secretary Burwell, Assistant Secretary Frank, Deputy Assistant Secretary Elam for their leadership on the plan and the impressive progress that has been made since 2011 in all areas.</p>
<p>Calls for additional investment in Alzheimer's disease research and care have been a consistent theme in the 3.5 years since the National Alzheimer's Project Act was implemented. The 25% increase in AD research funding at the NIH since 2011 is significant and appreciated.</p>
<p>A larger issue that we've been discussing around NIH funding prioritization is for NIH to consider costs to public healthcare programs (i.e. Medicare and Medicaid) as part of its prioritization for research investment in specific conditions. Economic burden on public healthcare programs is <strong>not</strong> currently considered as part of the existing strategic planning process at NIH. An April 2014 GAO [<a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/gao-14-246">http://www.gao.gov/products/gao-14-246</a>] study found that the five selected ICs--awarding the largest amount of research funding--that it reviewed did so considering similar factors and using various priority-setting approaches. In priority setting, IC officials reported taking into consideration scientific needs and opportunities, gaps in funded research, the burden of disease in a population, and public health need, such as an emerging public health threat like influenza that needs to be addressed. Those are all very valid and important considerations, but we would argue that costs to healthcare programs should also be a part of the research funding prioritization equation.</p>
<p>We encourage everyone here to take up this issue as part of the request for comment to the NIH-wide Strategic Plan by August 16, and I would ask that ASPE provide the RFI and instructions on how to submit comments at <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=46">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=46</a></p>
<p>Additionally, I want to call everyone's attention to the report FDA released about a week ago called "Targeted Drug Development: Why are Many Diseases Lagging Behind?" that specifically points to the scientific challenges that are thwarting drug development in complex diseases. Alzheimer's is one disease they mentioned <a href="http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/ucm454955.htm">http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/ucm454955.htm</a>. The piece basically say FDA is doing all it can but they need more science: "Like many other diseases of the brain, Alzheimer's illustrates the obstacles to development of biomarkers and targeted drugs when scientific research has not yet uncovered the underlying causes or pathways of a disease." It is sobering report, but very much on point and we look forward to exploring these issues further with the Neurology Review division at our September 16 ACT-AD meeting.</p>
<p>I was excited to see the reference to "expansion and enhancement" of Lifespan Respite Care in the plan as well as the regulatory review of adult day services. Both respite and adult day services are incredibly important aspects of family caregiver support that may reduce or delay institutionalization among individuals with dementia. While the initial work has been promising, these programs need much wider support and coverage in order to meet the huge demand.</p>
<p>I want to say a more specific word about the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer Caregiver Health (REACH) program. Believe it or not, this program was first funded by the NIA and NINR in 1995--20 years ago. There has been a REACH I study and a sequel, REACH II. It has been a VA-wide program since 2011 and AoA has also funded REACH programs throughout the country. Findings from the REACH studies showed improvements across many areas. Caregivers reported less "burden" and depression, and improved emotional well-being overall. They also reported gains in the areas of self-care and healthy behaviors, social support, and management of problem behaviors on the part of their loved ones with Alzheimer's disease. Plus, they gained an hour a day of time that was not consumed with caregiving duties.</p>
<p>While expanding REACH to Indian Country is another great step for this awesome program, I am wondering why HHS has not yet taken the step of making this a CMMI model program, or better yet, just going for it and implementing REACH CMS-wide. How many more years do folks have to wait?</p>
<p>Last, it is terrific that HHS is refreshing the Alzheimer.gov website. Two things I noticed: 1) it takes several clicks to get to specific info on research studies. It would be great if this could be more streamlined and if folks could access it more directly from the home page with a "find out about research studies in your area" subhead.</p>
<p>And 2) the tagline for the site- "alzheimers.gov- for the people helping people with Alzheimer's" seems to unintentionally overlook individuals with the disease, as well as others who may know someone dealing with it, or just want to learn about it. I'd love to see another tagline that invites everyone in. The community needs it, and it's getting bigger and bigger every day.</p>

<p>Re: Recommendations for a National Uniform Law Regulating Elder Facilities, Court PrefilingMediation of ADRD Family Caretaker Responsibility and Compensation, Amendment to the SSA on Caretaker Disability Entitlement and the establishment of a World Alzheimer's Institute</p>
<p>I have reviewed the NAPA Plan, as updated, and thank the Alzheimer's Organization for its awareness efforts. Consolidated informal comments and recommendations from caretakers, attorneys and health care professionals follows. I thank NIH for its continuing publications on clinical trials and health related issues and the FDA for its oversight function and providing assistance to caretakers filing notices of clinical trial mismanagement. Specific recommendations fully within NAPA authority are contained at the end of this statement.</p>
<p>I am an attorney who has been in the Alzheimer's trenches for fifteen years. We had a triple dose of this insidious disease in my extended family. I handled a level 6 case 24/7 for ten years. During this period and continuing post DOD, I remain committed to interdisciplinary research from the progression of clinical efforts to find a cure to identifying ways to improve the quality of life of those afflicted with Alzheimer's in the absence thereof. I retain an ongoing interest in the welfare of the hundreds of caretakers I have met over the years and concern with the inevitable ruinous impact of this disease on the next generation.</p>
<p>The industry report on AD entitled "<strong>Alzheimer's Drugs Market, 2012 - 2017</strong> was issued in May 2013. It is a comprehensive document which the extensive outline, (including mention of NAPA) clearly demonstrates with key objective to establish the likely evolution of leading drugs, generics and launch of new drugs across the different regions in the world. I watched the NIH sponsored Alzheimer'sDisease Research Summit 2012: Path to Treatment and Prevention in real time, paid particular attention to counsel and came away with no hope of cooperation for obvious proprietary legal intellectual property and economic reasons which are without the control of the NIH. In fact, it appears that the scope of any cooperation is extremely sensitive since even the appearance of infringement could result in litigation which holds up distribution of a viable curative pharmaceutical indefinitely.</p>
<p>There is some disappointment with a few NAPA initiatives perceived as a disservice to victims of ADRD without a voice who are pleading for protection and to the caretakers who give up everything to provide support.</p>
<p>I don't see the DOJ, the FDA or the IRS and United States Patent Office on your federal agency list? I don't see the ABA Commission on Aging/NAELA charged with a NAPA mandate to address legal issues in this area. Perhaps you need a broader resource base. Everyone wants to help.</p>
<p>As to the alzheimers.gov, you have a list of drugs on your site for ADRD care. The FDA has stated that certain drugs are contraindicated with elderly with dementia and are in fact life threatening. Would you please coordinate your representations with the FDA before another elderly person is seriously hurt? Regardless of the $100 million False Claims Act charges and sanctions against J&amp;J relating to Omnicare bribery, either these drugs are approved for use by the elderly ADRD or they are not. Clarification would be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>ADRD population</strong></p>
<p>There is a concern that first, the base from which linear extrapolations have been made as to the number of ADRD is not statistically significant and existing and future service delivery needs will therefore be underestimated. We are not supporting the caretaker population, estimated at 25-30 million, directly or by providing adequate support for prevention of facility neglect and abuse so alternatives to home caretaking will be available.</p>
<p>What will the future hold for high school and college students who justifiably want to know whether and why they should invest in their future if everything is going to fall apart with 50% of the future population ADRD caretaking? At minimum, ADRD educational/training materials should be made available through the state library systems so caretakers/children will have easy and immediate access to free resources.</p>
<p>Second, taken to the extreme, without resolution of the causation issue, does the potential for prion scabie migration/replication through surgical equipment and water supply raise the potential for contagion and exponential as opposed to linear expansion of this population? There are patents available which deal with prion destruction in surgical equipment sterilization not currently accomplished with traditional techniques. Is it possible to address these concerns?</p>
<p><strong>Social Security Disability and Caretakers</strong></p>
<p>The SSA discriminates against caretakers of ADRD as a class in denial of disability benefits. The theory of liability as to the SS is unjust enrichment No one wants to see this mushroom into a class action but if this injustice is not rectified, another forum for redress will be pursed.</p>
<p>Caretakers of Alzheimer's patients, who collectively save the government billions of dollars are (1) denied Social Security disability benefits, no matter medical conditions which would otherwise justify entitlement or prior contributions to Social Security, usually spanning decades, because of the time restricted credits contribution prerequisite to qualification, (2) further penalized by reduction in future social security benefits by inability to contribute during the protracted caretaking period which often consumes what would have been the most economically significant period of their lives, and (3) denied unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>Caretakers do not receive compensation (or later assert unjust enrichment claims against the estate) because of (1) insufficient resources, (2) family dissension, (3) exhaustion, and/or (4) a general feeling of obligation toward the afflicted parent or spouse which would make taking compensation for caring personally offensive. They are usually unaware of the loss of disability benefits for failure to contribute during the caretaking period, have no idea of the potential for their physical harm and immune system collapse from the disease or are unable to do anything about it. They can lose income, savings, assets, and children's college funds during a caretaking period which can continue for ten years or more.</p>
<p>Many of us started caretaking in the 90's when we were in our 40's and continued through our late 50's. There is no way to accurately convey the absolute shock of initial ADRD diagnosis and the immediate and complete upheaval and destruction of finances, health, and professional and personal life. The unrelenting stress of the behavioral challenges of this horror of a disease, ongoing sleep deprivation occasioned bysundowning and the sporadic and unpredictable agitation/violence which can result in actual physical injury to the caretaker are not the only challenges. The caretaker must deal with non ADRD medical conditions attendant to the aging process.</p>
<p>Spouse caretakers usually predecease the AD patient since the stress of caretaking destroys the immune system. If children take on the responsibility they are similarly affected. Although ADRD manifests itself differently in each individual, the one common thread is the impact on the caretakers. They deal with the protracted trauma of losing the essence of their loved one years before the actual physical death. At best, if a personal caretaker, at the end, they are old, they have lost their professional marketability, they don't have the physical strength or emotional stamina to pick up their lives and they are usually medically in trouble.</p>
<p>The experience is not unlike PTSD and the caretaker has become the patient without a caretaker.</p>
<p>At that point, caretakers are advised that, not only is the enrichment of SS by their efforts not acknowledged, but they are penalized by SSA for the caretaking period in the denial of essential benefits. This injustice needs to be addressed and rectified through (1) amendment to SSA disability prerequisites relating to entitlement based time restricted contribution period for ADRD and other caretakers, or (2) a class action against the SSA for unjust enrichment of the fund attributable to private caretakers efforts and in the denial of benefits to caretakers who would otherwise qualify for disability.</p>
<p><strong>Court Mediation Services on Caretaker Responsibility and Compensation</strong></p>
<p>In recognition of the statistically significant percentage of the future generation who will be full time caretakers of ADRD parents, disputes as to responsibility and compensation for care whether during the life of the ADRD patient or as to unjust estate enrichment for uncompensated services provided as a post DOD claim thereafter, will impose an overwhelming burden on the courts.</p>
<p>There is an immediate need for the state courts to make available, publicize and encourage prefilingcourt mediation of any and all family/beneficiary disputes relating to care, including caretaker compensation, whether continuing during the term of the caretaking or post DOD in estate distribution, immediately on diagnosis or indication of need, and reducing same to written agreement. In the absence of such agreement and to the extent this becomes an estate issue, mediation should immediately follow the assertion of an unjust enrichment claim by the caretaker.</p>
<p>When care facilities are undesirable or financially impractical, the burden falls on the family particularly in the case of ADRD where 24/7 care is involved. In many cases, qualified at home care providers are not available or are unwilling to do AD because it is just too hard. The comment I received from an agency representative was "life is too short". Unqualified at home care providers pose a danger to the patient.</p>
<p>There is a saying in the AD community that "there is always one" (family member) who assumes primary and often sole responsibility for care. Most family disputes are based on allocation of caretaking responsibilities and compensation. Family members may refuse to participate except when their financial interests are concerned at which time they become highly active. Caretakers struggle to find time to sleep much less take on a court battle for compensation particularly when liquidity is limited, they have already lost their income and the only asset is the home.</p>
<p>Absent agreement or early court intervention, an unjust enrichment claim may be asserted against the estate post DOD. Historically these were difficult because there was a presumption that family caretaking should be gratuitous. However, recently and thanks to the Alzheimer's Organization, the nature of ADRD and the demanding nature of the care is receiving international public attention. Courts are now recognizing this claim in ADRD cases and some states have passed laws specifically providing for caretaker compensation.</p>
<p>Provision for special needs or other trusts may not be available or have been addressed in many of these cases. This goes further. Caretaking is sufficiently traumatic without family dissension. Early, expeditious and affordable recourse is essential. Mediation provides it.</p>
<p><strong>The ABA Commission on Aging/NAELA should draft a uniform national law regulating facilities and employees. License should be conditioned on compliance or relinquish entitlement to federal and state benefits/subsidies.</strong></p>
<p>There is an absolute necessity for a national uniform statute/regulations for state enactment regulating ECC, ALF's and SNF's, otherwise conditioning the provision of federal subsidies and benefits on facility compliance and providing stringent sanctions for violations, not only as to the facility, but as to participating health care professionals.</p>
<p>The ABA has successfully taken on uniform national laws in the past and it is particularly critical here. The attorneys from the ABA Commission on Law and Aging/NAELA have the talent and the experience in the trenches of facility abuse to handle this issue. If NAPA fails to give a voice to elderly ADRD through strong advocacy and protection of their interests, they will have failed their mandate.</p>
<p>The Miami Herald issued a three part investigative report in 2011entitled, "Neglected to Death" <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com">http://www.miamiherald.com/neglectedtodeath/index.html#morer</a> This is essential reading for anyone in this field. The Nursing home abuse blog and other resources provides an overview of, for example Emeritus (California - wrongful death, Florida - bed sores, medication misadministration and falsification of medical records etc. etc.) Usually the response is simply to convert to a lower classification of care (independent living) to circumvent future state oversight. The Florida legislature has twice failed to enact legislation to remedy abuse. The industry is now attempting to enact legislation in Florida which will make it more difficult to sue for abuse.</p>
<p>With advance apology to truly outstanding health care professionals delivering quality care, caretakers do not place their loved ones in facilities because the (1) the health, safety and security of the ADRD cannot be assured in substandard, understaffed facilities (2) there is excessive doping (chemical restraints) to compensate for inadequate staffing, (3) the facilities do not take high level ADRD without a 24/7 private aide making it a cost prohibitive venture, (4) Medicaid beds are not made available to ADRD unless the condition developed post initial admission, and (4) the state is lax or nonresponsive in enforcement.</p>
<p>Please understand our collective, absolute fury with your "15%" reduction in doping and demand for clarification. This is a civil rights if not a criminal battery issue. It is not subject to arbitrary and callous treatment as an administrative efficiency issue. Visit an AL or SNF and speak with families and attorneys who specialize in this field. Look at your own deficiency reports on the 620 nursing facilities in Florida alone and the court abuse claims against assisted living facilities. There are a substantial number of attorneys in the ABA Commission on Law and Aging/NAELA who would be happy to provide education.</p>
<p>When elderly are ignored or have ADRD or are otherwise doped with off label drugs for behavioral control purposes, they cannot articulate pain. It is a form of involuntary imprisonment not unlike the Argentinean prisons in the 50's which used a rudimentary form of psychotropic drugs on inmates. (In Florida, drugs are also being used on juvenile detainees to control behavior.) If elderly ADRD are doped when they act out and they act out because they have untreated cancer or undiagnosed medical condition which they are unable to communicate, they face years of pain in a semi comatose condition before their life ends strapped in a wheelchair or urine soaked bed without relief. There is an urgent need for immediate action. This conduct is criminal and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>Which 8.5% of this group are you comfortable abandoning?</p>
<p>We had three experiences with respite in ten years in two high level SNF's and one hospice, each stay under two weeks. The first resulted in a hip fracture with the elderly woman in the next bed in the same condition. (The other woman was given haldoland cried for hours.) The second stay resulted in extensive bruising, a cut on the forehead and a hematoma on both arms. The hospice, situated in a hospital, was advised preadmission that the ADRD could not call for help and, as a fall risk, did not need diapering but needed a commode next to the bed which she could utilize. They put her as far away from the nursing station as possible in a room with a woman who was incapable of any communication, put her in diapers she would not use and put the side bed rails up. Within 8 hours of admission, she had fallen attempting to get out of bed to go to the bathroom and had ripped open her leg about 10 inches. When I arrived at 5 am, she was bleeding on the bed. (My father entered a hospital without a mark on his body and was discharged with a stage 3 decubitus with MRSA on his coccyx.) All of this has to stop now.</p>
<p>To the extent doping, neglect and abuse is not rectified, elderly will continue suffering and families will forfeit their livelihood, savings, children college funds and quality of life to keep their loved ones safe at home. Please do not make it the policy of NAPA to tolerate any form of institutionalized abuse.</p>
<p>Many facilities are not capable of or are unwilling to provide essential services to insure the safety and care of their elderly residents. There are too many profiteer operators opening what are essentially extended stays with food service, mandating understaffed facilities to achieve a substantial owner benefit/ROI without regard for the quality of life of their residents.</p>
<p>There is an absolute necessity to continuously inspect and severely economically sanction those substandard facilities which harm the elderly. Take action to discipline or revoke the licenses of operators and staff that participated in or were aware of violations or falsified records and failed to report same. Similarly, federal or state trustee supervised independent contractor assumption of operational activity should be provided to bring a facility into compliance with the cost of same borne by the owner/operator. Sanctions should be automatic and not negotiable.</p>
<p>The foregoing does not overlook and in fact should aggressively pursue actions for assault, battery, criminal negligence and endangerment, pain medication theft and financial abuse as appropriate through the prosecutor, not the ombudsman, who, in turn, should immediately notify all concerned federal and state concerned authorities of the pendency of any investigation and subsequent charges. I have discussed this matter with major city police from San Francisco to Boston and they have horrifying tales.</p>
<p>This industry is unable to regulate itself. The recent ALA request for state plans was disappointing. Florida ALA declined to do its own report and adopted the Texas plan. None are particularly effective in addressing resident issues if reform would economically burden the owner.</p>
<p>The uniform national law act should set forth, with specificity, optimal minimum standards for facility operation including but not limited to</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Qualification and licensing of owners/operators (in Florida you need high school to operate an ALF),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimum facility per patient staffing,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Background investigation, qualifications and training of staff,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALF classification of care, as it currently exists, should be eliminated in its entirety,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explicit verifiable protocol for the prescription and administration of medication for ADRD as to nature, duration and dosage, documentation of use of off label drugs and physician (not nurse) justification for exceeding any recommended dosage or duration of administration <strong>after seeing the patient</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Program of cognitive/sensory activities for ADRD. Identification of advanced cognitive conditions which mandate immediate facility release and transfer to a specialized facility dealing with memory care or to a SNF if attendant medical issues, (The advent of IPADS and touch screens opens new door in this area for ADRD who could not negotiate a mouse)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior court approval (after family and beneficiary notice) of any gift, behest, testamentary or other property transfer to a facility or any of its employees,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provision of distance web cams to permit HSC and staff monitoring of their charges, particularly in the case of ADRD. There is ample evidence to suggest that when staff are under surveillance, abuse abates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heat sensoredmonitoring of fall risks and ADRD so movement leading to bed vacation at night can be identified by staff prior to injury or wandering and without alarms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mandatory immediate notification to HSC of injury to patient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State of the art lifting devices/equipment to prevent staff injury have to be provided in each facility. Staff has a brutal experience lifting physically challenged/obese without injuring themselves. (Robots exist to deliver medication in hospitals. Cornell has a robot to take a beer out of the refrigerator deliver and pour it. Why not a robot to help? It has to be less in cost than repeated hip fractures, rehab and OSHA damage awards.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HCS's should be able to directly access the patient's records, including medication management and nurses notes through online interactive software access between HCS's and facility. No medication or medical treatment should take place without an HCS's consent. Interactions between medications or other medical conditions and side effects should be self contained within this data base, continuously monitored and addressed. There is no need for handwritten files which can be manipulated/altered pre inspection.</p>
<p>I am an attorney who is aggressive in medication management and I quickly discovered that nurses resented any inquiry. This has to stop. We are HCS's and we need this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There needs to be strict guidelines as to the use of the ombudsman function, the obligation of the ombudsman to immediately refer elder endangerment or possible financial abuse to the appropriate authorities and to advise HSC, POA and family of their options, including referral to counsel and a NAELA contact number or availability of court mediation services. The ombudsman role should be carefully redefined and restricted in scope to matters not possibly criminal in nature. (Some issues are just not appropriate for the ombudsman.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be an absolute prohibition of facility license downgrading to avoid continuing state scrutiny and oversight when the facility is faced with closure at the higher level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DNR forms and living wills have to be uniform nationally. (Florida requires the forms to be in a particular format on yellow paper?)</p>
</li>
</ol><p><strong>The WHO has declared ADRD as an international health crisis. International cooperation requires a different approach from the NAPA plan with consolidation and dedication of international resources solely to scientific research. </strong></p>
<p>The World Health Organization calls on nations to recognize dementia as a global public health crisis. Nobel Laureate, Dr. Stanley Prusiner, immediate past Director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases at UCSF, and recently appointed Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board at the Cleveland Clinic Lou RuvoCenter for Brain Health, along with The Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation which funds the work of Nobel Laureate Dr. Paul Greengardand every other internationally prominent scientist considers Alzheimer's one of the most devastating and grossly underfunded illnesses affecting society and are staunch advocates of a significant increase in funding to make substantial breakthroughs.</p>
<p>A World Autism Center in Jerusalem is underway through the support of the International Center for Autism Research and Education, which is based in New York City. It plans to include a state of the art research facility, a "global platform" for field researchers, continuing education programs and "university level" courses on the condition. It will also have a residency program and will otherwise include advances in autism research including early detection. In other words, it plans to be the world's "largest multidisciplinary center for autism research, diagnosis, treatment and prevention."</p>
<p>A World Alzheimer's Center under the umbrella of the 78 nation Alzheimer Federation in affiliation with the WHO providing technologically advanced facilities for scientist and independent NGO research, as well as consolidation and development of available international resources and technology addressing cognitive challenges should be created. (See eg. Norway's Snoezalen rooms <a href="http://www.snoezeleninfo.com/main.asp">http://www.snoezeleninfo.com/main.asp</a>, advances made by John Hopkin'sCopper Ridge, Melabev in Israel, the Fisher Institute at NYU, the University of Florida's Smart Room, games and brain training to name a few.)</p>
<p>While seed money could be provided through NAPA, this fund is insufficient to provide national support for ADRD research demands much less international efforts. Similarly, the Alzheimer's organization has its own challenges in infrastructure support particularly given the scope of their service delivery.</p>
<p>In June and July 2013, Tampa Bay Tribune issued an expose' of charitable industry abuse, misuse and outright fraud in solicitation practices. "America's Worst Charities" is the result of collaboration with the California Center for Investigative Reporting, the nation's largest and longest serving nonprofit newsroom dedicated to watchdog journalism. CNN joined the partnership in March. Reports indicate that even the best charities may have a solicitation/public relations cost of up to 40%. After that, take away the balance for infrastructure support which may still not be sufficient if labor intensive services are involved. How much makes its way down the pike to the victims? It is just an overwhelming struggle particularly in today's economy when governments are facing their own crisis. <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page">http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities.page</a></p>
<p>In the absence of sufficient government appropriation and given the cost of fundraising/air time, a new vehicle to accomplish the $5-10 billion needed for ADRD research must be identified and pursued through the international community. It has been suggested (and inspired in part by Google's Razoo) that the search engines should be engaged as the only viable means of effectively coordinating, in every language, a coordinated time restricted massive campaign on the front page of the engines to elicit international financial support to expeditiously achieve essential support. Properly structured, the engines can slice through the overhead to accomplish direct benefit to scientific research in fulfillment of the intent of the donor and the international public trust through the Alzheimer's Federation of 78 nations in affiliation with the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>The current reaction to NAPA is that, despite the best intentions and through no fault, the current approach is underfinanced, piecemeal at best and holds no ascertainable hope of accomplishing an expeditious cure. You need a great deal of money and resources to save the next generation. If you want to accomplish significant goals, you have to put international firepower behind your efforts.</p>

					Dementia-Friendly Vision</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
<p>As a person living with this disease I find it a challenge these days to be able to communicate with the rest of the team. While I appear to be very normal when we have short talks, there are many issues that I struggle with. I have lost the sharpness and quick response needed to be able to interact with you all at your level. It makes it even harder when many of you have very high IQs. With time you will learn that while I may not respond immediately, answers come to me many hours later. Sometimes they never do. When I hear conversations I do not hear the entire sentence but part of it, and in my mind I fill in the blanks. It's weird to know you have many answers in your head, but cannot find a way to retrieve them.</p>
<p>Because of all this, and because we are breaking up into various teams I want to ensure I will have the opportunity to share my visions of what I would like to see. Some of these ideas come from others who have created them before me, and many are my own ideas or a combination of both ideas.</p>
<p>There is no true order and some things may even be duplicated due to my lack of recall. I did have help from others in the editing of this document. Below is my short list of issues as I see them from my introduction statement on June 7th.</p>
<p><strong>Public Awareness, Education, &amp; Engagement </strong></p>
<p>In my opinion awareness is the biggest problem. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show younger people who don't understand that Alzheimer is a disease that affects all ages; it is not just associated with getting older. I know of a 30-year-old and a 29-year-old who have it.</p>
<p>The stigma must be eradicated.</p>
<p>Companies and communities must treat this like any other disability.</p>
<p>State laws needs to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve immediately.</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is.</p>
<p>People should be fast-tracked for social security instead of being treated like crooks while they are getting deeper into hardship.</p>
<p>First responders need educating, and a system needs to be created that will help identify us without becoming a target for others.</p>
<p>We need a way to deal with our guns.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those who are no longer capable, and not to impact those that are still able to drive.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways if we are looking to make it better for those impacted.</p>
<p>Need to encourage dementia-friendly communities and business.</p>
<p>We must be able to live life to the fullest even though we have the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Create work environments in which we can still feel productive without penalty to the employer or the person living with the disease.</p>
<p>We must encourage the researcher and provide funding.</p>
<p>Trials need to provide more flexibility by using communication technology.</p>
<p>Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia.</p>
<p>Patients should be made aware of the living wills which should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Communities </strong></p>
<p>My vision of a dementia-friendly community is a bit involved, but if it's implemented it will have a huge impact in many ways. When I think of a dementia-friendly community it refers mostly to those who are in the early to mid stages of the disease. This idea was first started in the UK by my friend Norm McNamara who is living with Lewy Body Dementia.</p>
<p>This community should include first responders, health providers, local businesses, public transportation providers, airports, and the public.</p>
<p>I think the best way to achieve this is to create a system that allows individuals to register with the state, or someone of equal standing, this should include care partners as well as it's important to have emergency info on the caregiver. I would like to see something similar to MedicAlert at a state level.</p>
<p>What follows is a brief outline of the MedicAlert system.</p>
<p><strong>MedicAlert® + Alzheimer's Association Safe Return</strong>® is a 24-hour nationwide emergency response service for individuals with Alzheimer's or a related dementia who wander or have a medical emergency. We provide 24-hour assistance, no matter when or where the person is reported missing.</p>
<ul><li>If an individual with Alzheimer's or a related dementia wanders and becomes lost, caregivers can call the 24-hour emergency response line (1.800.625.3780) to report it.</li>
<li>A community support network will be activated, including local Alzheimer Association chapters and law enforcement agencies. With this service, critical medical information will be provided to emergency responders when needed.</li>
<li>If a citizen or emergency personnel finds the person with dementia, they can call the toll-free number listed on person's MedicAlert + Safe Return ID jewelry. MedicAlert + Safe Return will notify the listed contacts, making sure the person is returned home.</li>
</ul><p>Six in 10 people with dementia will wander and/or get lost. A person with Alzheimer's may not remember their name or address, and can become disoriented, even in familiar places. For people with dementia wandering is dangerous, but there are strategies and services to help prevent it.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association has developed training tools and support programs to prepare law enforcement, EMTs, fire fighters and other first responders when they encounter a person who is wandering.</p>
<p>Anyone who has memory problems and is able to walk is at risk for wandering. Even in the early stages of dementia, a person can become disoriented or confused for a period of time. It's important to plan ahead for this type of situation. Wandering and getting lost can happen during any stage of the disease.</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for the following warning signs:</p>
<ul><li>Returns from a regular walk or drive later than usual</li>
<li>Tries to fulfill former obligations, such as going to work</li>
<li>Tries or wants to "go home", even when at home</li>
<li>Is restless, paces or makes repetitive movements</li>
<li>Has difficulty locating familiar places like the bathroom, bedroom or dining room</li>
<li>Asks the whereabouts of current or past friends and family</li>
<li>Acts as if doing a hobby or chore, but nothing gets done (e.g. moves around pots and dirt without actually planting anything)</li>
<li>Appears lost in a new or changed environment</li>
</ul><p>The information on your medical alert bracelet will connect health professionals with your emergency medical information. We provide memberships and services designed to protect you and your loved ones during a medical emergency or time of need.</p>
<p>MedicAlert's medical bracelets, medical IDs, and other medical jewelry have been used to alert responders of the underlying medical conditions a patient may have - such as allergies, anaphylaxes, diabetes, and autism. First responders are trained by MedicAlert staff to recognize all forms of medical IDs, and our services ensure they get your up-to-date medical information, the moment they need it, to make informed decisions about your treatment and care. MedicAlert services and medical IDs are also used to communicate advance directives and can even help those with Alzheimer's or dementia make it home safely during wandering emergencies.</p>
<p>For more information please visit their website: <a href="http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-safety.asp">http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-safety.asp</a></p>
<p>Those who choose to register would wear a bracelet similar to the one above or some type of dog tag on a chain. By registering the people would be able to take advantage of many benefits. Family would need to register and could be set up when in the clinic for diagnosis as well as info bracelet... ordered and resources given out.</p>
<p>All those registered would be given a unique identification number that will have basic information that could be used in case of emergency. To stop the system being abused or compromised, this information should only be accessible by the relevant people, following a secure procedure and calling a special telephone number and providing the person's ID number. (This would only be accessed by calling a provided number)</p>
<p>It may include information like blood type, allergies, drug information, doctors, emergency contacts, and addresses.</p>
<p>This system needs to be linked with the 911 systems, and the yellow dot program. When a person calls the fire department the address should be flagged immediately when it comes up as a person with dementia living in the residence they are being dispatched to. This is important for many reasons.</p>
<p>A person with dementia may panic in this situation and may not know how to respond to the emergency conditions. They may be much worse than a child in some cases, and just curl up in a corner in fear and just stay there. They may not even speak out when people are calling their name. They may have even started the fire and are scared. They could be combative and the firefighters need to know how to deal with that situation. There are many other reasons why the firemen need to be aware before arriving.</p>
<p>If we ever have some kind of a natural disaster or need to evacuate for some emergency this system will be a major asset, especially for those who may be at home on their own. By being registered this will insure a much better outcome for those who may not be able to think for themselves. Many of these people would not leave with just a simple call and they may not even understand what is said in robo-call type alerts.</p>
<p>If the police are called that should also be flagged immediately. It could be the person with dementia calling in, and not able to articulate the problem. It could even be a false alarm because they are scared when there is really no threat. Sometimes people with dementia have been known to make serious accusations of being threatened by their spouse with a gun, which has led to spouses being locked up for days because the system was not aware of the person's dementia. Again, if members of the emergency services are coming to a house where a person with dementia resides, they need to treat threats in a completely different way otherwise it can escalate and even become deadly.</p>
<p><strong>Issues with Police: Weapons &amp; Driving </strong></p>
<p>While I am on the subject of issues with police there is a document which I shared with the chief of police a few years ago. While some changes are being implemented in some parts of the US, I am not sure they are being addressed in PA. I tried to reach out to my local police department and training facilities, but was just blown off. One of the biggest and most serious issues that I feel needs to be addresses is that of weapons. I came very close to taking my life, and even told a police officer on the telephone, but he refused to do anything. I just wonder how many other people pleaded for help and ended up killing themselves because nobody answered their cry for help. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Sometimes people with dementia get confused or feel threatened and may make accusations that could land someone else in jail. Be prepared to deal with cases like this. They need to be handled very differently from someone without dementia. Some would say like a mental illness. They believe what they are saying is fact.</p>
<p>We require a place to store or remove guns from a home when needed - I came up with a simple way that this could be accomplished without too much impact on the police. A gun safety device can be used to secure the guns in the person's home, and the key can be given to someone responsible. There were other suggestions made.</p>
<p>If someone with Alzheimer's is stopped for a sobriety test they may fail because they have trouble following instructions or poor gait. They may also be much slower with their responses, and may even give you a blind stare because they are confused. They may not be able to follow complex directions. Directions need to be broken down into steps.</p>
<p>I know we want to make the roads safe so we need better testing methods for Alzheimer's patients who drive.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's patients can sometimes become very aggressive and defensive during an argument, they can even become threatening. This is the wrong time to try to remove them from their home. They need to be calmed down first; otherwise it can become a disaster for that person, because many will not understand what is going on.</p>
<p>Be prepared to deal with people who may seek help when they are lost. We can get lost while driving; this does not mean we cannot drive. These two issues are often confused by many.</p>
<p>The car should also have some sort of identification mark. It could be tied-in with the yellow dot system; however, I am concerned that we may become a target because of that. We are much more gullible because of this disease and that could be a very serious issue. I was someone who always kept all those scammers at a far distance, and now I am starting to fall prey to some and think it will only get worse as time goes on and I get worse. It could be on a driver's license, like a donor or class B license. It could be a code that is not obvious to all.</p>
<p><strong>Universal Symbol: The Purple Angel </strong></p>
<p>There is a common logo that is slowly becoming the internationally known symbol for those living with dementia and I think we should use it. It is called the Purple Angel.</p>
<p><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-site-pages/163251/PurpleAngel.jpg" style="height:25px; width:27px" />To be used on all websites and dementia patients information and hospitals</p>
<p><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-site-pages/163251/PurpleAngelStamp.jpg" style="height:28px; width:30px" /> For stores and businesses to show they know and have been educated</p>
<p>This was created by Norm McNamara and is starting to get a lot of recognition. In fact it is now going to be used in some US hospitals as an indicator that the person has cognitive issues; they hang it on the door of the hospital room of the patient. I recommend that we adopt this symbol for all programs connected to dementia-friendly communities.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Hospitals </strong></p>
<p>While I am speaking about hospitals, below is a list of issues that I have been working on with a local hospital in hopes of starting the first dementia-friendly hospital in PA. I was trying to build a training program with the Alzheimer's Association along with a question and answer session with people like me who are living with the disease. Below is the list I have shared with them. Some hospitals are actually doing a quick cognitive test by asking 3 words upon registering to see if there may be a concern even if the person does not have a diagnosis. I would expect that all hospitals would educate staff on the issues, for instance we can easily get lost while trying to find a department as an outpatient.</p>
<p>At registration, identify a person that can and will be able to be involved in all decision-making, along with the patient.</p>
<p>At registration, identify a person that will be given full access to all records on behalf of the patient.</p>
<p>Patients bring in a list of current medications. If for some reason you must change the drug or dosage for any reason, the issue should be addressed with the patient and caregiver to ensure there are no issues (even if it's as simple as converting to a generic). Sometimes patients cannot take another form of the same drug-ask them.</p>
<ul><li>Example: My doctor switched me to Galantamine rather than Aricept because of side effects. In the hospital, they substituted Aricept. (My wife had Galantamine with her, but of course it is a big deal that you should not take your own meds.)</li>
</ul><p>A special ID bracelet should be placed on this type of individual so the staff is alerted that this patient has some form of dementia. This will help them if the patient is acting confused or wandering or just needs a little extra help or explanation. It may also mean that the patient isn't great at making good decisions. If you need a color, purple is perfect.</p>
<ul><li>Example: I needed a Fleet's enema pre-op. The nurse asked if she should give it to me or if I wanted to use it myself in the bathroom. Of course, I offered to do it myself. I found I had difficulty once I got in the bathroom by myself; a bad decision on my part. The nurse should have not given me the option. (We do not want to appear stupid or show our flaws so we may do something to show we are still capable when we may not be.)</li>
</ul><p>I know they always ask the patient for their full name and birthdate - that may be hard at times for us. I can become confused on a good day, in the hospital it can be worse because of pain medication or being awakened suddenly or the stress of just being out of our routine. Maybe another way can be figured out. (Before a name tag is placed on a dementia patient it may require 3 or 4 staff individuals to ask the patient for that information and each must identify the same information before the ID is placed. This will insure the wrong tag is not placed on the patient. Use the verbal ask on critical things like surgery and drugs given the first time the nurse may see the patient)</p>
<p>There are special things one needs to know about using Anesthesia. Anesthetic agents are a cause for concern in AD pathogenesis. Luckily, the field of Anesthesiology has addressed these concerns in an excellent and honest manner. I would defer to their consensus statement:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/108/5/1627.full">http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/108/5/1627.full</a><br /><a href="http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/">http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/</a></p>
<p>The bottom line seems to be to avoid isoflorane.</p>
<p>Do not always consider a patient being confused as a part of the dementia, but it could be much worse due to the drugs they are on. When I was on pain killers my wife could not even get a response from me that made much sense, and she knows what's normal for me.</p>
<p>A real concern exists on what type of drugs the patient may receive for Anesthesia. Pain killers will also have a much greater impact on this type of person.</p>
<p>While ordering food from a menu is simple, it is very overwhelming for me to keep track of things and what items may even go together, or are even needed. I will probably need help with this task.</p>
<p>Don't assume we can figure out how to use items in the room like TV, Phone, call button, and anything else. Please point them out and provide a simple explanation on their use.</p>
<p>Aides should not be the first point of contact. I am not always good at explaining what I need and the aide was not always good at interpreting what I was trying to say. Aides are okay for follow-up or to help with food menus. Again this is why training on all levels is so critical.</p>
<p>When asking a question, give them a minute or two to answer without going on to some other question. You could even ask them to think about it and come back in 5-10 minutes, no longer. This is very subjective depending on the person. We often need a few minutes to gather our thoughts. We might even answer a question right away and then realize a few minutes later that that wasn't what you asked.</p>
<p>Somehow you need to insure the patient response is really correctly given - they sometimes give an answer just to not appear stupid or show they did not understand. Maybe some visual aid or clues can be given along with the verbal depending on the stage the patient is in.</p>
<p>Try to keep items and things in the room in the same place once they determine the best location for them.</p>
<p>I personally feel these patients should be kept a bit longer than the average person, for observation. This would just be to make certain there are no issues at time of release.</p>
<p>Offer a pen and paper to keep in the room. Tell them to write down questions they want to remember to ask when the nurse comes in the room.</p>
<p>Keep in mind many patients with dementia can no longer spell correctly and may use the wrong context for words.</p>
<p>This is the wristband that will be implemented to all patients with dementia at Brooksville Regional Hospital, along with this square magnet to be place on the outside of the patient's room on the doorframe. Before any of these wristbands will be used, training seminars from the Alzheimer's Association will held for all of the hospital staff members. Training should start in about a month. This is a major step forward in maintaining the safety of all dementia patients during hospital stays.</p>
<p>The hospital loves the purple angel logo, We went through three different band designs before this. The problem being that purple is also the national color for DNR. What I love about it the most is that it's for "all dementias," which is what we truly need in the hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Businesses </strong></p>
<p>Moving on to dementia-friendly businesses; I envision that businesses take a 7 or 8 hour course provided for free by the Alzheimer's Association and others, to make them aware of the issues that people with dementia deal with, and what they may need help with. On completion of the course they will get a sticker that they can place in their place of business that says Dementia-Aware with a picture of the logo. By doing this we will be creating awareness, and educating many on how to make it easier for us to still function as members of society; something that is not always easy when you are an adult who is slowly becoming a child again.</p>
<p>Some of the issues may be</p>
<ul><li>feeling panic in a large store when becoming separated from the person they came with</li>
<li>being asked a question and not being able to respond, or even giving the wrong information</li>
<li>having trouble locating items in stores</li>
<li>no longer being able to calculate how much they have spent or can spend if they have a budget</li>
<li>getting lost, losing sense of direction, or not being able to locate the car in the parking lot</li>
<li>it would be nice to get assistance when there are similar products to choose from, because I can no longer do comparison shopping based on price, or if an item in the same category is on sale</li>
</ul><p>Not everyone will easily display, or even be willing to wear the bracelet or dog tag because of the stigma surrounding this disease. Only when this changes will people feel more comfortable about sharing their diagnosis with others.</p>
<p>Even though we are living with AD we should be encouraged to live life to the fullest. We need to keep our minds engaged. We should be able to work, and to still do high level functioning jobs, and the company not be penalized, and the person with the disease should not be impacted by SS because they are working. As volunteers I would expect that our transportation expenses be paid for, and maybe even lunch. This will have a positive impact on the people with the disease and be of great benefit to a company that can utilize the person. Some do not want jobs like pushing hospital beds around, or doing simple tasks when we have a high function skill set.</p>
<p>The state can help AD people to live life to the fullest in many ways. For those that are still driving they should be given a disabled sign for their car. It helps me in many ways such as finding my car when I park in a strange place or large lots. For those that are not driving, allow us the same opportunity as seniors. This will help us get around much easier. For suburban areas allow us access to the transportation for the disabled at the discounted rates.</p>
<p>The state can offer free access to national parks, fishing and boating for a small size water craft for the person living with the disease and a caregiver since in many cases they will need someone to take them. All of this can be centered on having the bracelet which will simplify the process and minimize any costs.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you need to make it simple for these people because they will most likely not be able to fill out many of the forms needed to qualify. I am sure there are many other things that can be made available.</p>
<p>Writing skills can be impacted hindering communicating. An idea would be to forward our unedited letters to schools to be used as a part of the English classes; the students would edit the letter and send it back so we can send it. It would also be great if we could take college courses for free with the idea that we are not getting a degree or credits.</p>
<p>When it comes to purchasing tickets for travelling on trains etc. staff need to be aware that we may need help. We may not be able to check in at the airport unaided. We should not be penalized for not being able to take advantage of online offers because we cannot use computers. We may need to be taken to a gate or to a temporary room until our flight or train is ready (this does not mean we need to be ferried about in a wheelchair!)</p>

</ul><p>I would like to see a simple pamphlet be put together for those who are living with the disease covering all the benefits available to us with AD. It must be simple to understand, short and to the point. The procedure should include all of the resources available and where one should turn. Today one has no clue and they do not know what is available. This should be handed out with a diagnosis from your doctor.</p>
<p>Laws need to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve. Let's stop burdening the social security system. Because there is no clear test for the diagnosis of YOAD, many diagnoses are delayed. Many people are terminated from jobs, and are unable to collect their long-term disability insurance, because of the two-year law. Most diagnoses occur much later, as in my case. I paid a lot of money into a long-term health disability plan in my company and I lost it all because of the law. I now get less than a third of what I would have been entitled to, and no medical coverage which I would also have had, all because of a law that does not work for individuals with this disease. Changes must be put in place until we have better tests available. If someone is terminated for non-performance and they have been diagnosed with dementia at a later time, they should have the right to go back at least six years to prove their case. Companies should not get a free pass because we all pay for this injustice. The two year law is a failure for people like me with dementia.</p>
<p>I was terminated from my job before I got a diagnosis which took another 6 years. Now I am forced to rely on government disability. Alzheimer's is a sickness. This is a disease, and the people who have it should be treated that way.</p>
<p>Companies need to treat AD like any other disability. The following comments were put together from a person who works in HR.</p>
<p>Tell your story to HR Management. What kind of company do they want to be? How will they protect their human resource that has dementia - and be good risk managers by taking appropriate action to minimize the risk of litigation for wrongful termination under ADA? What are the costs of unrecognized dementia in employees i.e., lost productivity, errors, quality, odd/unexplained behavior, a decline in management skills leading to more of the above? What are the State percentages? Give examples - If they are a company of 1,000 employees that equates to xx employees who will have early onset dementia - can they afford to be blind to the problems these individuals will cost the organization? Alzheimer's is not all about the needs of the caregiver. Little to no attention is given to the INDIVIDUAL WITH DEMENTIA. If the company has a PEP program (Personal Employee Program that typically provides 8 to 12 sessions of counseling when an employee suffers from personal problems (divorce, runaway kids, elderly care, etc.) why not have a Dementia Hotline/Exploration. Why not help people self-diagnose early and assist them to seek a medical diagnosis, so TOGETHER the employee and company can make a plan for them to ultimately exit from the company with dignity - example: an employee is still skilled, but may need to move from having the responsibility of being a manager to becoming an individual contributor. Why wait to FIRE someone for non-performance, when you could continue to employ the person until the day comes where there is no job which matches the employee's skills. A diagnosis of dementia IS protected under ADA. Why wait to be sued by an employee who was unfairly terminated because of his disability. Why not be proactive and humane, keep the person off unemployment; mitigate your exposure to litigation. Such a small cost to set up a program to assist and empower employees to work TOGETHER with them, give them dignity and determine together when it is time to go. Help them transition to retirement with disability; unemployment; assistance from the Alz Association.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Issues &amp; Necessary System Change </strong></p>
<p>Younger-onset Alzheimer's, also known as early-onset Alzheimer's, generally refers to those who are affected by the disease before the age of 65, usually in their 40s or 50s. Because of their younger age and healthy appearance, doctors often attribute symptoms of Alzheimer's to depression or stress, resulting in delayed diagnosis. These symptoms, such as challenges with short-term memory, impaired judgment and difficulty making decisions, eventually progress to a point where they affect workplace performance, and ultimately, jeopardize employment. Many individuals living with younger-onset Alzheimer's are in their prime earning years and supporting loved ones at home. The loss of income and access to employer-sponsored health benefits can be devastating.</p>
<p>This document reflects State and Federal issues that may not be working. My goal is that if the existing jurisdiction responsible is not able to enhance the process, the other will step in and fill in the gaps so people are not impacted. It is my hope that they can work together to fix the weaknesses in the system that may have been overlooked.</p>
<p>To help address their financial need, many individuals with younger-onset Alzheimer's rely on Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). In March 2010, the Social Security Administration (SSA) added early-onset Alzheimer's to its Compassionate Allowance Initiative, which expedites the disability determination process and serves as a trigger to begin the two-year wait for Medicare benefits for those under the age of 65. Family members (e.g. spouses and minor children) may also be eligible for benefits based on the applicant's work record. This addition by SSA has been a huge relief for individuals and families dealing with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Many are treated like they are crooks when they apply for Social Security Disability. It creates an added burden on the family and the patient. People say that the Compassionate Allowance act will help people, but it did not help me, and many keep saying that it works. The following story is from an ongoing case. This program may be better but the people who run the programs are clueless in many ways on what a person with AD can or cannot do. This person is not only struggling financially, but has no one to look out for them. I cannot even imagine the hell they must be going through because it would take me forever to complete the same forms.</p>
<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>It's so nice of you to think of me. I wanted to add that the reason I was turned down on the first application and reconsideration was because I filled out the RFC form myself (I lived alone at the time and it was a necessity) and not for lack of medical evidence. My son now lives with me but only minimally supervises me and does the driving. An examiner at Social Security took it upon himself to send out an investigative unit because he felt I must be faking Alz even though in the course of the application and reconsideration, I saw 5 doctors, 4 of whom thought I had Alz disease and 1 CE examiner who thought it was possible but hesitated because I still have average intelligence (my IQ was in the 140s when I was in graduate school and now around 100, which I think this is an alarming decline). This SAA evaluator then proceeded to imply that all the doctors I saw were fooled. He even sent out an investigative unit to actually <strong>videotape me without my knowledge</strong> (following me to one my CE appointment one day and sending undercover police officers to my home the following day). I don't remember the investigators coming to my home and didn't see them at the hospital (obviously quite good at the stealth part). At the hospital, the doctor walked me out to the lobby because he was afraid I would get lost said a few minutes later I "disappeared (I got my ride, of course)." They went back to the doctor looking for me, and he apparently was very concerned I had actually gotten lost in the hospital. At my house, they said I walked slow to answer the door but I didn't limp (???) and was polite and had my hair combed (implying I was not disabled based on my outward appearance and probably less than 30 seconds of conversation). The evaluator felt that anyone who could describe their symptoms on an application, write mostly coherently, (though always needing multiple edits, spell check, and entailing a lot of repetitiveness) answer the door, use a phone, live alone, or drive in the early stages had to be faking it regardless of MRI, neurological tests, etc., that clearly gave me a diagnosis of EOAD. Long-winded, I'm sorry. I'm still feeling kind of abused and outraged. As for now, my lawyer thinks he can get me a hearing OTR and I'm hoping for that and a favorable decision If not, it will be another 12-15 months before I have a hearing date, this because the SSA evaluator apparently does not understand that early-stage Alzheimer's is not immediately visible on the surface. In the meantime, I am now in the process of selling my home to live with my adult son as we can no longer afford the upkeep (this is a modest home - but now far above my means).</p>
<p>I'm very lucky that my son is living with me to help, but it means I do not qualify for Medicaid because his income is now considered my income and puts us just above the income limit. He can't put me on his insurance as I don't qualify as a dependent because of my small LTD policy, which in turn needs to be repaid to the insurance company if I do get SSDI. I've gone from a single, self-supporting middle class woman, to lower middle class, now to poverty level in the course of about 4 years. Without my son's help, I'm probably within 3 months of living on the street. At the same time, I'm suddenly placing a tremendous burden on him and fouling up his goals in life.</p>
<p>Another note: I find it ironic that my neurologist tells me to exercise vigorously, take care of my health, and socialize as much as possible in order to function longer whereas I sense the government is telling me that I'm not eligible for disability insurance (despite working since age 13 and paying into the system for years) unless I give up, lie in bed, and wait to die.</p>
<p>It would be great if the Alz Assoc could find a way to educate the SSA evaluators on what Alzheimer's disease looks like in younger people in the early stages so that other people don't go through what I'm going through now. It would also be great if they could lobby for earlier Medicare benefits (rather than the 2 year wait after SSDI) for all disabilities that are only going to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Awareness is the biggest problem.</p>
<p>Awareness of YOAD will change the public perception of who gets Alzheimer's - young people. People who are under 30 get it. Use commercials, billboards or posters in key places to get the word out. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show younger people because most don't understand that Alzheimer is a disease not just a result of aging.</p>
<p>Awareness of outcomes for AD -- Currently people who have Alzheimer's cannot be cured. There is no way to slow the progression of the disease, and most die within 4 to 8 years of diagnosis. While these two statements are strong I feel this is what it's going to take to reach younger generations and others to jump in and help. We cannot beat around the bush; the public needs to know that this is a horrific way to die. Death by Alzheimer's is slow and painful not to mention the impact it has on the family. Places like the Alzheimer's Association and others need to open with all the facts about the disease so people are prepared.</p>
<p>Remove the negative stigma associated with the disease. Too many people are ashamed to let others know that they have this disease. They act like they did something wrong to get it. Now is the time to join me, come out of the closet, hold your head up and be proud in making a difference in how we are looked upon by ourselves, and others. WE need to show that we are still capable of doing some things at our own pace.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those that are no longer capable, while not impacting those that are still able to drive. It should be based on the person's true driving experience and ability, and not on perceptions or fears. It should have nothing to do with getting lost; GPS tracking devices can help us if that is a concern. Many people have the misconception that if a person with AD is in an accident the insurance company will not pay for the claim, or may even sue them. While there are many tests available to test one's driving, many are not fair to a person living with AD. In fact if the average person was given the same test they may even fail. Better tests that deal the individual living with the disease are needed and all must be able to test this test. Some of the cognitive tests do not correlate to driving ability, but to failing and singling out people with AD. That is completely unfair. For example I fail the Trail-Making Test, Part B and I still drive very good. The testing should be free or paid by insurance. These tests can cost around $300 -$350, and provide annually. Every 2-3 months we should drive with a spouse or other person who understands us to see how well we drive. That should be a regular part of our future lives, and they should be the ones to tell us when they feel it is time to give up driving. I am not saying that people with AD should not eventually stop driving, but it should be done for the right reasons -- that they will become a danger to them or someone else. What we need to focus on are the real problems of driving, and not the side issues related to them. We must embrace new ways to deal with people with AD and find new opportunities and technologies to use to our advantage so we can enhance the lives of those suffering with this disease, and so they can continue to lead a normal life for as long as possible. Do not fall into the one-size-fits-all trap because all those living with AD are different from each other and we must figure out a way to make everyone feel safe including those living with the disease. We are still human beings.</p>
<p>My biggest fear is that one day I will have an accident and my license will be taken away. It may not have anything to do with my Alzheimer's, but it will be perceived that way. I have had 3 to 4 car accidents in my lifetime, some being my fault while most were others. We all have them. As a person living with AD I seem to notice much more. I see many people run through lights, not use turn signals or come to a complete stop at the stop sign. I see people cut others off or shift in to other's lanes without paying attention. All I can think is that if people saw me do any of these things they would want to take my driver's license away, yet all of these folks are normal and they just get a free pass. Why?</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is. One should not be impacted by other laws that were not designed or intended for those living with this type of disease. There are many state and federal programs that limit us from being able to contribute to or benefits we are not entitled to because of our age. Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia. A family should have a cap on what they must payout. Why should the surviving spouse be left penniless because their partner was sick? Is it enough that most of us have already had to deal with financial hardship we were not accustom to?</p>
<p>Pa. Caregiver Support Program (care recipient/household income must be @ 200% of poverty or below for max. reimbursement.</p>
<p>Below are just of a few of the ways this disease is costing me more money than ever. I once did most things around the house and now I have to rely on others and the cost is adding up very quickly. Many things are becoming neglected which will have a greater cost in the long run. I used to be good at comparison shopping and now I no longer do it because I cannot recall the price so I can compare. This has such a huge impact from food, gas, utilities and everyday items.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), individuals with a pre-existing condition receiving SSDI can join high-risk insurance pools3 and receive immediate health insurance coverage while they wait for Medicare benefits to become available. This has been particularly helpful for those who are unable to find affordable health insurance because of their Alzheimer's diagnosis. The program will end in 2014, at which time individuals can purchase health insurance through their state-based insurance exchange or qualify for Medicaid under its expanded criteria. Pennsylvania has yet to decide whether or not it wants to participate in the Medicaid expansion, which according to one estimate, will cost the state 1.4 percent more than current spend to reduce the number of uninsured adults by over 40%.</p>
<p>In addition to the cost of care, Alzheimer's imposes an immense burden on families. Last year, there were an estimated 664,384 unpaid caregivers in Pennsylvania, providing 756,600,213 hours of unpaid care valued at over $9 billion. Unfortunately, the physical toll of caring for Alzheimer's also resulted in over $427 million in additional healthcare costs to unpaid caregivers in your state. To assist those who care for people with Alzheimer's in Pennsylvania, the state offers the Pennsylvania Caregiver Support Program. Preference is given to caregivers of care recipients who are 60 years or older, but eligibility was recently expanded to include care recipients who are 18 years or older. All care recipients must demonstrate functional limitation and financial need.</p>
<p>Regrettably, age is still a barrier to other support programs for individuals with younger-onset Alzheimer's and their caregivers. All caregiver support programs that receive funding under Title III of the Older Americans Act require care recipients to be at least 60 years or older. Likewise, Pennsylvania's Medicaid 60+ waiver and aging block grants are only available to those who are at least 60 years old. Restricting eligibility by age, rather than diagnosis, forces many families affected by younger-onset Alzheimer's to exhaust their own resources and put their own health and financial security at risk.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways to make it better for those impacted. Physician education -- Doctors need to be better educated, and need to commit to a more timely diagnosis so that patients can collect the benefits they deserve and are entitled. Doctors should not act like our lives are over. Once a diagnosis is made it should automatically trigger a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist so the person can learn to deal with the devastating news. Many people are in denial and waste that last few years not knowing what to do. Instead they should be living life to the fullest. Make the memories. We must be encouraged to make living wills and put our financials in order quickly since our minds are going. We have no time to delay. Encourage participation in medical trails and offer frequent checkups.</p>
<p>Living wills should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p>We must encourage research and provide funding. In order to eradicate this disease we need to find more sources of funding and redistribute current government funding to bring Alzheimer's to a level comparable to other disease research. Trials need to provide more flexibility by using technology. Many are unable to participate due to lack of flexibility. Some people do not participate in clinical trials because they feel it will not help them. They need to know that it's not about them but what they do can help someone in their family should they get the disease. Since a cure may be long in coming, it would also be nice to see more funding provided to investigate treatment methods to maintain independent function longer. The drug companies have taken the stage and it's all about what increases their profit and not necessarily about what will help the patients.</p>
<p>Make government grant programs free, fair and balanced - Some researchers using government research grants are discriminating by age and minorities because of rules being set forth by both the provider and the receiving researcher. This will prevent the formation of an accurate picture of this disease. For example, black people are twice as likely to get Alzheimer's. Why?</p>
<p>Eliminate the term Caregiver - Come up with a new term for the word caregiver when used for people in the following stages Very mild decline (2), Mild decline (3) and Moderate decline(4). We find it very demeaning and do not like being treated like a child. Help us where we are weak, but don't give up on us just because we have now been labeled with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>We need away a way to break down many of the silos and built a coalition of companies and sites to work as one. Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) is a diverse and growing national coalition of 58 member organizations including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The only sad part is the Alzheimer's National has not joined due to not being able to set politics aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/">http://www.leadcoalition.org/</a></p>
<p>This is all part of the problem - a lack of willingness to work together. I am not sure what the state can do here but we need to find a way to encourage others to work in harmony for the greater good of what we all seem to claim. We are doing this for dementia. Sometimes I really wonder and I think it just a business for these folks.</p>
<p>I know I have made many recommendations around the use of the Alzheimer Association as part of this document. Because of that I want to give full disclosure. I was a past ESAG member and I am currently still an ambassador for them. For those who know me they would tell you I am not influenced by others and my dedication is to those impacted by the disease. With that being said I do feel they deserve a lot of credit for what they have accomplished in the last 30 or more years. They take a lot of heat for some issue that are out of their control due to some high level expectation of the public.</p>
<p>On the other hand I do not want you to think that they have all the answers because I and many others realize that they do not do justice for many like me who are dealing with the disease. They focus on the caregiver and not us. Part of the problem in my eyes is the lack of a business mind across the board, and lack of a CEO approach to business. Because of that scenario there is much inconsistency in the organization and much time is lost in understanding our needs and minds. That all leads to very slow response or lack of response to the very services they think are great. They have this internal mindset that everything has to be done a specific way and that is always the right way, yet the people are not given the tools. The sad truth- it is not and I have worked on changing some of that and I can assure you it's not an easy task. I encourage that we continue to work with them but at the same time we need to demand change and at a much faster pace.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I am sharing this with you in hope that, as you do your planning, you take my findings in to account when making recommendations to others. We must treat all people who are suffering from dementia, regardless of stage, with the highest level of respect all the way through to the end. While this may not apply to all, it would appear that many who are even in stage seven are still able to communicate in some way.</p>
<p><strong>Living Life with Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>Below are some articles I have written in the past, you may learn how someone with AD is dealing with this disease. These are my favorite that I feel people have been able to learn and see another side that they did not know before.</p>
<p>I have worked on this for about five months, and recently I shared the email below with many sites related to AD for feedback. Most of those who had reached out to me were able to support my findings. The bottom line is that while most of us have limited thinking capacity many are able to communicate; we just have to find a way that suits the individual. I received a lot of feedback. My biggest concern is that most people are clueless, and assume that we cannot understand what they are saying about us; many say cruel things. Just try to imagine for a minute what it would be like to hear what others may say or do to you, and you are never given an opportunity to defend or express yourself. That is what is happening to most of these folks.</p>
<p>We must find a better way to educate caregivers, health professionals, and all those working with people living with this disease. The biggest problem I see is that everything is time-based because of the costs. This view will not work for people. It will also take special training, and the need to break with our normal habits of communicating. If we are going to be able to reach out to them, we need to change. We are still human beings and we deserve to be treated in a respectful and dignified manner.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen and I have been living with AD much longer than most people who have had this devastating disease. I am in need of your help to prove a point. Let me explain.</p>
<p>I have learned that as we progress with Alzheimer's/dementia, we lose our brain functioning and can no longer think. I am starting to believe that this is not true.</p>
<p>It has now happened to me on multiple occasions where I was asked a question, and I am able to formulate the answer in my mind, yet I found myself unable to verbalize it. Sometimes my mouth may move but nothing comes out. It was the weirdest thing, and I could not understand why it was happening to me. I was aware of what was going on, but could do nothing.</p>
<p>Since that time I have asked 18 other people with some type of dementia, and of them 16 had similar experiences. Two of them said they had not. This makes me think that as this disease progresses our brain may still be functioning, yet it is unable to communicate with the rest of the body, allowing it to have less control than it would normally have. I truly believe I am on to something, and was curious as to how I can try to prove this theory.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example. About three years ago I met the daughter of a man with AD. He was no longer communicating with her because, she was sure, he could no longer commutate at all. Someone suggested she ask a question, and keep totally silent for at least two minutes after. About a minute and a half later he finally responded to her question. From that time on she realized what she had to do and was thankful for that advice.</p>
<p>I don't want you to think it's going to be that easy; it will take a lot of work, patience and persistence on your part. Here is what I would like others to try for someone who is in the late stages of Alzheimer's. First of all take the person to a very quiet room; it should not have any kind of background noise even from things like an air-conditioner blowing. Those noises are real problems for me, and would assume it will be a bigger issue for them. Such noises really have an impact on my ability to process and focus. You should also do this at a time of day that they are not tired. It becomes very challenging for us to try to focus and listen to what others say. It really becomes tiring, and we get burned out quickly.</p>
<p>When you start to speak to the person use short sentences, and pause in between them so they have time to process what you are saying. That is very important. Tell them that you think you have found a way to communicate with them. Tell them you are going to look at them closely for some sort of sign. It could be an eye movement, maybe looking to the right or left or down or up. It could be a smile. It could be a finger moving or a fist being made. It may even be them sticking their tongue out. I would start by focusing on parts of the body that may still show signs of control. You must become a detective and keep looking at various body parts for some sign. It may not happen the first time or even a second time. It may never happen and I could be wrong. But if I am right just think of the benefits that will come out of this for you and your love one.</p>
<p>Reassure them that you will continue to look for a signal and they should keep trying the best they can at their speed. Ask them a simple question like "do you love me? If yes lift your finger or lower your finger". Again you will need to keep quiet, and observe for at least two minutes. Keep doing this and try this with different parts of the body. They may not have control over certain parts, and that may be an issue. If you do see something make sure you point that out to them and ask them to do it again to insure they really are responding. If this turns out to work find a way to use that same body part to get yes or no responses from the person. Keep in mind that this may not always work and you may need to be creative. Maybe just keep the finger raised longer if they mean no, or tap it twice etc., but that may be too much to ask.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind if the person has not had any real dialog with someone for a long time this would also take more time. No matter what do not become discouraged, try this at least three different times on different days. Like I said this may never work and I have it wrong.</p>
<p>If this does work please reply to this site with your contact information so I can speak to you. If this works for a few it makes me believe that we need to treat these folks completely different to the way society treats them today. This will change so much about what people really believe is happening to our minds.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>"The Realities of Alzheimer's and Overcoming Stigma"</strong></p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect more than 35 million people worldwide today. An astonishing fact that today someone in the world develops dementia every 4 seconds. By the middle of the century more than 115 million people will be affected by the disease if we do nothing.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen, and I am living with Alzheimer's and trying to make a difference. I was previously a high-level manager in the telecommunication industry. In 2008, I was diagnosed with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD) after struggling to get a diagnosis since my first symptoms at age 39. Losing my job and not being able to work had a huge impact on my life as I was a workaholic. I am now an Alzheimer's advocate and a spokesperson for the Alzheimer's Association (U.S.) as a member of its national 2012 Early-Stage Advisory Group.</p>
<p>I am so frustrated, because no one realizes how seriously disabled I am. If I had a loss of limb or some other visual ailment, it would make people realize. I don't want them to feel sorry for me or pity me, just want to be understood. So many people say you do not seem to have Alzheimer's, and that frustrates me. Let me tell you what it's like to live with this debilitating and progressive disease.</p>
<p>Imagine for one minute that your friend, relative or family member has Alzheimer's and has to deal with the following issues. When I go shopping and look at items, most of them never really register in my mind, even though I see it clearly. I have trouble making decisions, because I question whether I am making the right one. I can no longer enjoy my favorite hobbies, because it requires processing skills that I no longer have. I went from being a gadget person, to now being threatened by technology that I no longer can use. This is what I deal with and so much more.</p>
<p>I go to a happy affair only to be tortured by the noise and surrounding conversations, because of the loudness that cannot be filtered out. If people try to speak with me in a public setting where there are many other conversations, I just don't understand what they are saying. This is because all of the people speaking come in at the same volume level. All the words run together, and it sounds like a foreign language.</p>
<p>I went from being extremely proactive to becoming much less active and motivated. I leave things around the house and don't put them away, because I don't know where they go or feel I may not know where to retrieve them again. One moment I am nice and another I may fly off the handle. I can no longer write or speak like I used to. My friends slowly become distant and usually speak to my wife. I do realize this.</p>
<p>I worry every day about the challenges ahead. Or even worse, I am losing my mind and see it happening, but I cannot do anything to change the course. People always say 'if I can do anything just let me know." If I take them up on that offer, they back out of their commitments. I have become extremely surprised by the lack of public commitment to my pleas for support of Alzheimer's disease. While some may be sympathetic in the moment, there appears to be little follow-through. This is very upsetting, because I feel as though it affects me personally as well as the millions of others living with the disease. I was always there for others when they needed it and now I feel alone.</p>
<p>While many people just coast through the day, I have to use 110% of my processing skills to do most things, which increases the stress and frustration. The worst part about this disease is knowing that I am doing all these things wrong and have no way to control or stop it, and it's only getting worse as the days go by. I used to save lots of money by doing so many things around the house. Now I lost the drive, determination and skills needed to do those things. Many times I hurt myself trying or make it worse.</p>
<p>I cannot begin to explain how it tears me up inside to see my spouse struggling to do the things that I once was capable of doing and know I cannot do a thing to help. I realize that one day I may no longer be able to drive and this devastates me. I see my wife becoming stressed, depressed and overwhelmed, but caregivers know it will only continue to get worse. Sadly, they keep telling themselves that they can do it all even when we know they will need help.</p>
<p>I, the patient, see it definitely. My wife is on the road to hell, and she does not even realize it yet, because she is so busy trying to block it all out. The worst part about all this is, I have not even reached the worst stage. That scares the hell out of me.</p>
<p>I have been so surprised by the stigma associated with this disease. It comes at you from all angles. People think they knew what Alzheimer's is, but they don't. I see this not only from people living with dementia but many media health correspondents, physicians and organizations that are geared to helping those deal with the disease. I have learned that I do not want to share my diagnosis with people I meet until they get to know me. If I was to tell them upfront, I would be treated so differently, which I have learned. I kind of see this disease like HIV use to be. The people who have it are so afraid to let others know, including family. I do not get it. We did nothing wrong to get this disease, and we need to speak up to let our voice be heard. We did nothing and no one should be ashamed of having it. I feel so much better when I share it with others than when I try to hide it.</p>
<p>Because of my frustration with existing environment for people with dementia, I realized change was need. I decided to use my few skills left to advocate. I have spent some of my last few years being on television, radio, newspapers, many blogs and working with many politicians. I also had an opportunity to speak at all of the public sessions to develop the first U.S. National Alzheimer's Plan, all this on my own. But that was not enough, because I ran into so many people who just did not want to get involved. I am now a volunteer for the national Alzheimer's Association Early-Stage Advisory Group. If there is something I want you to walk away with it's that you can make a difference, but it will take persistence. Write a letter to your public official or reach out to local support organizations to create needed programs and services. Your voice and your story are powerful tools. Please get involved.</p>
<p>The simple truth is, if you have not been touched by this devastating and debilitating disease yet, consider yourself extremely lucky. Sadly, it's just a matter of time before it touches you. It is my hope that my actions today may prevent future generations from suffering with this disease. So give yourself piece of mind and do something today. I hope that what I am doing will allow me to leave this world knowing that I did everything possible to make that next generation have a fighting chance. There are no excuses for not wanting to help. The human cost factor is too high, and we are all accountable to do something.</p>
<p>There are many organizations out there like ADI and the Alzheimer's Association that can help you. The Alzheimer's Association got me started in many ways with my new journey. It not only helped me, but it also had helped my wife as my caregiver. They have a website with many resources at www.alz.org. I encourage you to reach out today if you have not already. I would also encourage you to educate yourself.</p>
<p>Please join me and Go Purple on Friday, Sept. 21 for World Alzheimer's Month. I wear a purple Alzheimer's bracelet every day. And for those living with Alzheimer's, stop focusing on what you cannot do and join me in the battle to advocate. We still have so much to give, and we need to use our skills at our own speed. There is nothing to be ashamed of. We are counting on all of you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Over the past few years I have visited many websites that talk about Alzheimer's/dementia. The one thing that they all have in common is that not one of them encourages those of us who have the disease to continue to live and enjoy our lives. While I realize AD is a progressive and devastating disease we are still here, we are still alive, so treat us that way. Do not write us off.</p>
<p>I have always been savvy when it comes to finances and have always been a saver. One day I was speaking to a friend of mine who has AD, and I was telling her how I did not want to spend a lot of the money I had saved, because I wanted to leave it for my wife for that rainy day. My friend told me: "This is the rainy day. What are you waiting for?" She was right, and that's exactly how I started to think.</p>
<p>Just because we are living with AD, does not mean we should curl up and think our life is over before it actually is. There is so much more we can still do to enjoy life. Make wonderful memories with your loved ones before the days turn ugly.</p>
<p>One thing I had always wanted was to own a convertible, so we purchased one. I wanted to drive it down to the Keys in Florida. I have a friend out in California who also has AD. She has an RV and had planned to travel around the country before she declined and was incapable of driving anymore. One day she mentioned that she was going to the Keys and I decided to meet up with her. I also wanted to go deep-sea fishing to catch a big game fish. Don't get me wrong I am not person who goes fishing, but it was something I have always wanted to do. I had looked into it and it was very pricy, but it has always been on my bucket list. I think we all have a list if we stop and think about it.</p>
<p>I had no real plans; I just wanted to go out and drive my convertible, to feel the fresh air and admire the beautiful scenery and enjoy nice weather. I had a great time. I had a permanent smile on my face. I decided to stay with my friend in the RV for a week and visit various campgrounds along the way. That was a whole new experience, and some of the places we stayed at had fabulous views.</p>
<p>It was great to be out on our own, not having to rely on caregivers all the time. We had some difficulties, but we were able to mange on our own. It cost me a few extra dollars along the way because when I purchased something I could not remember the price in order to be able to compare, and sometimes I took the wrong road and had to take the turnpike, but these were minor issues. This road trip made me feel so much better about me. It was good for my mind; I came back stronger because of what I had achieved.</p>
<p>This disease has a way of making you feel like you are no longer cable of doing things on your own. You lose your self-esteem and your self-confidence. After this trip I felt great.</p>
<p>I did have to opportunity to go fishing. It was such a beautiful day with perfect conditions. The fish were not really biting to begin with but it didn't matter I was just happy to be on a boat again. Then I caught a fish that was about 10-12 inches long. Then I caught a barracuda that was at least 18 inches long, and then one over two feet long. Not to long after that I got the big one, a king macro that was 42 inches long! You should have seen the smile on my face. It is memories like this that we need to be making.</p>
<p>My friend in the RV has decided that she will not just use her mother's china and silverware on special occasions. Instead she took them with her in the RV. It gives her pleasure to use them every day. How many of you have a wonderful expensive hand bag or nice watch, which you only use on a special occasion?</p>
<p>Life is short; take pleasure in using those treasured items now. Start to create your own bucket list, don't just write it, DO IT! There are many wonderful memories that you can still make. Make them now before it's too late. Stop focusing on the negative. Make these last few years be the best of your life. You must do this now, before your mind no longer works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Since being diagnosed with Young Onset Alzheimer's Disease I have dedicated much of my time to its advocacy. Over the years I have worked with many people in different parts of the world, and through my experience I have come to realize that a major problem in reaching a cure is our actions. The way we treat not only those who suffer from this disease but those who care for the afflicted, the focus on funding and research and the lack of communication and collective action. Although there are many brilliant people who are involved in Alzheimer's and Dementia action and research I feel that following some simple principals and plans we could bring about real change in the world of these diseases.</p>
<p>PARTICIPATION -- Patients, caregivers, family and friends must become advocates</p>
<p>FUNDING -- Unprecedented action from government and public sector is vital</p>
<p>TEAM WORK -- Organizations dedicated to fighting the cause must work together to reach a shared goal</p>
<p>RESEARCH -- It is imperative that professional medical research personnel work hand-in-hand with patients</p>
<p>LIVE -- Those suffering from the disease must learn to live happy and fulfilling lives</p>
<p><strong>PARTICIPATION</strong> -- The government wants to hear from us! I have been doing this a long time and I am told over and over again by government officials that they need to have a clear idea of the numbers of people with Alzheimer's so they can make the appropriate changes to policy etc. In order for the government to do something they need to see people with the disease. I know people have busy lives but if we want things to change, patients, caregivers and friends need to start taking action.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? By getting involved! Write to the people who can help - government, health officials, and the press. But be mindful that you have to be persistent with these people, you have to fight. Can you imagine the impact if even a small percentage of the millions of sufferers took a little time to have their say?</p>
<p><strong>FUNDING</strong> -- We must look at other funding models for this disease. Unlike HIV and cancer, there are no survivors. Patients will continue to place a massive financial burden on the national economy; we need to be more proactive in how we fund research, care, medication and support for loved ones and caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? By writing to Congress, and the National Institute of Health. These people are responsible for prioritizing the distribution of funds to critical diseases - Alzheimer's disease is not on the list; we need it on the list.</p>
<p><strong>TEAM WORK</strong> -- There are many organizations out there hosting their individual fund raising programs, which is to be commended but the downside to this is that they still insist on operating independently on one another. These people need to see the bigger picture, they need to set aside their politics and differences, and come together as one and work together -- after all, they share the same goal don't they?</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? Well we can stop complaining about these organizations and give them solutions and guidance. Together we have the power to bring about change. Keep informed of all the latest news and action, don't listen to gossip or rumor -- check the facts; do your homework.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen. I am living with Alzheimer's disease. I spend almost every waking hour advocating for increased funding for research that will improve the treatment of this dreadful disease. In 2008, at the age of 49, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after struggling to get a diagnosis since my first symptoms began at age 39. There are more than five million Americans now suffering from this devastating disease.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds research into critical and devastating diseases such as cancer and HIV/Aids. Yet there is much neglect and discrimination regarding the allocation of funds for research into Alzheimer's and related dementias. As a person who experiences the devastating impact of Alzheimer's disease every day I hope that research will lead eventually to postponing the onset or slow the progression of this disease, if not prevention and cure.</p>
<p>Currently, Alzheimer's disease only receives about $450 million for research from NIH, compared to more than $5 billion for cancer and more than $3 billion for HIV/AIDS. I am astonished at the lack of funding dedicated to addressing the number one health epidemic. Historically, leadership from the federal government has helped lower the number of deaths from major diseases such as HIV/AIDS, heart disease, stroke and many types of cancers. This past experience provides hope that increased efforts directed at Alzheimer's disease will be met with similar success.</p>
<p>There are many more Americans living with Alzheimer's than HIV; more funding is desperately needed. If we do not act now this disease has the potential to bankrupt this country. Money allocated today will have an enormous return on investment if it leads to the kind of successes obtained for other diseases.</p>
<p>If you have not yet been touched by this devastating and debilitating disease it's just a matter of time. I hope that my advocacy will help prevent future generations having to suffer my fate and that of many others. You can help by increasing NIH funding for research on Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</p>
<p>I appeal to members of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the respective appropriations committees: Make the hard choices; increase funding for Alzheimer's disease. Do everything necessary to ensure that Alzheimer's disease gets the exposure, commitment and funding necessary to change the course of the disease before millions more Americans are affected.</p>
<p>My work as an advocate has provided opportunities to share my story on a national platform. I have provided public comment during meetings of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services in addition to having my personal essay about overcoming the stigma of the disease featured in the Alzheimer's disease World Report 2012. I have also become a member of the Alzheimer's Association National Early-Stage Advisory Group, helping to raise awareness of the disease and provide insights on the most appropriate programs and services for individuals in the early stage of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p>I hope that what I am doing now will allow me to leave this world knowing that I have done everything possible to make generations to come have a fighting chance. Do not forget these people or the future generations who will develop this disease. We face dying in the worst possible way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>As an Alzheimer's patient, I find it very difficult to perform tasks that I was once very capable of performing. Sometimes I am better than other times at doing the same task. People around me have accepted this fact and have tried to be very forgiving when I run into issues doing a task or when just trying to remember something. I really think that people around me should challenge me more at times.</p>
<p>For example, many of my doctors kept questioning me about whether or not I should still be driving. This of course was mentioned to my wife who also started wondering. I finally had a driving test a few years later. It was recommended that I no longer drive, even though I passed the test. I was almost borderline, but there was concern that I may not recognize when I become worse and could then become a danger. First of all, I have to tell you that the test they performed was not fair. I wonder how many regular people would be able to pass this test. The test also relied on me to learn new things in order to take the test. That is not fair since I have been driving the same vehicle all this time and nothing has changed. This constant talk about my driving has totally killed all of my self-esteem about driving. Every time I was in the car on the road with my wife, she constantly pointed out any mistakes I made, and her reaction time was much quicker than mine. I do realize I am a bit slower in my response time, but that is why I give myself more space between the other cars. Sometimes I am very far back or I just don't want to go around that slow car. There is nothing wrong with not feeling comfortable to go around that person. Let me do it at my speed.</p>
<p>I see many people on the road that I feel are so much worse than me and I wonder why they are still on the road, if I am supposedly so bad. I decided that I was going to drive to visit my daughter in South Carolina. I live in Jamison, PA in Bucks County. I was very scared to take this trip but I was trying to prove something to myself. It could have meant the end of my driving if I made a serious mistake along the way. I drove in one day, about 700 miles, with the help of a GPS in my car. The more I drove, the more I was starting to feel comfortable behind the wheel. A few other people on the road made serious mistakes along the way and I easily avoided a possible accident. This trip was the best thing I could have done for myself. I now have almost all of my self-confidence back and my wife no longer makes constant comments about my driving, unless I have a real issue. I have now had two close calls that required quick thinking and maneuvering to avoid an accident. In both cases, I was able to avoid the issues without my wife's comments. Again it may have taken me an extra second or two to react, but I was fine.</p>
<p><strong>Coping Strategies for Daily Challenges </strong></p>
<p>Because of this situation, I feel even stronger than ever that it is important to be challenged. I know it may be easier for you to do something for an Alzheimer's patient because it's much quicker for you to accomplish the task. But I really believe that if you take the time to coach us along the way, we may do better in the long run. Believe me, I know it's got to be very aggravating at times, but I really appreciate it. It takes a lot of patience on the part of the helper. Everyone is different and you need to know at what point in time you should not push. It's also hard to be patient and not raise your voice at the person you are trying to help, because it will only make it worse.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble remembering dates or things I need to do.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I use my computer and Microsoft Outlook to keep me straight by sending me reminders.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Getting email using regular places like Google or Yahoo is a challenge for me.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: My daughter had set up my Outlook to retrieve emails from all my accounts, and they arrive in the same format which makes it so much easier to read, and it allows me to use common folders.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I forget to reply back to people's emails.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I flag them with a reminder date so it will automatically send me a reminder.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Remembering passwords is a real challenge for me.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have created a personal system that works great, I also rely on the computer to store many of them; however, it is a real challenge when the system does not work. I also keep files with the password information.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble remembering the day, the month and the year.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have watch that displays all the information.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have an extremely complex TV, stereo and entertainment system, which requires many remotes and settings to be used.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I purchased a smart remote that allows me to put in all the steps at once, and press one button which takes care of sending all the commands to all the devices at once. It works great until it fails. Not sure how much longer I can maintain it. It's a bit involved</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Most of my lawn power tools are a struggle to use.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I do not think I have any coping method other then I keep trying different things until I get them to work. The problem is most are new, I find it easier to work with tools I am familiar with.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I drive I don't always feel as comfortable behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I sometimes need to take more precautions, and allow more distance between the car in front of me, and I may drive a little slower. I am also much more alert and focused during these times. It makes it hard because when I travel with my wife she wonders why all of sudden I drive slower, when normally I am flying. There is nothing wrong with going slower and being cautious.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I don't do much of anything anymore.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: The other day I was speaking with my neighbor who was waxing his car. This gave me some inspiration to want to do it. When people mention things to me it sometimes gives me what I need to take it to the next level.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I purchased a camera; however, no matter how many times I read the manual I still don't seem to be able to understand how to use it.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: Make sure you buy one that works completely automatic without needing to do anything. It is frustrating at times when you would like to do something on your own but just can't remember on how to do it. I have learned to accept it but I still try and fail.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Spelling and forming sentences has become a real challenge.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take advantage of using the computer to guide me in the correct spelling of a word. That is becoming harder because often it cannot figure out what I am trying to say. I also ask others to look things over for me, and to correct them for me. It's kind of frustrating for me because I am really concerned that I may not be able to do this much longer. I have seen a big decline in this over the years. I seem to notice this more than my other skills because I do it so often. While I am sometimes ashamed of sharing it with others, I still need to communicate so I try to not think about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Sometimes when I want to do certain things I need to stop and think.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: If I want to work on a project I will spend a lot of extra time trying to think of the best approach, this doesn't always help, but I tend to work at a slightly slower pace and am aware that things will go wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Finding past emails or letters</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: The computer is such a wonderful tool in so many ways. It allows me to search the entire computer as long as I can remember a word or two in the document I am looking for. While it may take a while I would not be able to survive without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I can no longer do many things</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I rely on my wife for many things nowadays. I am not sure if that is a coping strategy. When anything important needs to be considered, I ask her for her help. She does all the financials, and planning of most things. It is frustrating but I realize I cannot do it on my own.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I get lost or cannot figure out how to get from one place to another. Maps are not easy to follow anymore even the ones that you print out from Google.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: GPS! I cannot imagine what it was like for people like me before GPS and the computer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I fear that one day I will be lost or not be able to communicate with others due to a temporary stress or decline in my mental capacity.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have chosen to not be concerned about that. I have a medical tag on me all the time that has my medical condition along with important contact information. I will continue to go wherever I want to go. I realize I will need to rely on others to get there. I will need to ask others for help frequently, and to ask multiple times so others don't send me down the wrong path. It will take me longer to get there, but I cannot let that stop me. Living in fear is also no way to live. I know there are good people that will help me when the time comes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Some things I do get me very frustrated</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I no longer try to do those things so I do not get frustrated</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I write notes as reminders</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I only write a few notes as if I have too many they just become overwhelming, and I would lose track of them because there are too many.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I need more time to do things</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I leave much earlier for meetings and places so I can allow for issues along the way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: If I start to get frustrated doing something.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I move on to something else and then I try to come back and do it later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I fear I may get lost when I go to new and far places.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take a cell phone with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I go shopping and lose track of the person I am with I sometimes start to worry a little bit.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to calm myself down and look for them. If I cannot find them I will try to stay by the door we came in so I can see them at that register</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I had trouble remembering which way to turn off the water in the garage for the hose.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: My wife added masking tape with a marking pointing to off. No more issues. I have the feeling that over time I will need many reminders like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble hearing people speak in loud places.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to not go to restaurants or other places where I will be put in that situation if I can help it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I can no longer use my video recorder.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I now have TiVo which makes it so much easier to do things. I still need some help, and my wife can help when I need it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I try to communicate with much smarter people.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I believe that my reaching out to and working with people who are very smart will delay the deterioration process.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I cut the grass, or do something that requires me to be a bit more stable on my feet.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I use a good pair of shoes, or even a low cut boot. It really helps me become more stable on my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I could get hurt while doing yard work.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I do not wear lose clothes or short sleeved clothes when doing yard work so I do not get hurt. Wearing shorts has already led to a broken foot because the pants leg got caught on the shifter. I also wear safety glasses. The problem I have is I don't always remember to take these precautions, or sometimes I think it's not necessary because I feel I will be careful if I am doing something that will just take a few minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Just the other day I was thinking in my head that I had to turn a grate on my fireplace, and I was thinking it may be hot.</p>
<p><strong>No Coping Strategy</strong>: Instead of being careful and just putting one finger closely to feel for heat, I just tried to touch it with three fingers to lift -- I got burned. How do you get a copping strategy for becoming stupid? It seems that my mind is not communicating with the rest of my body.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ???</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: All the people around me know I have AD, so most of them are keeping an extra eye out on me which is nice to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to keep some type of a schedule. I get up every day at the same time and try to eat at the same time. This kind of helps to do things like taking my drugs or other things. The second I change my routine you can be sure I will forget to take my drugs or do something else.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I double and triple check myself on many things I do. Daily Challenge: ???? Coping Strategy: I try to find some humor in my issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ?????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I ask people for help and ask a lot more questions of others</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take lots of breaks</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ???</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to know my limits and will not start a task if I feel I cannot do it. Or I will have someone work with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>A few months ago one of my friends mentioned that I am always talking about things related to Alzheimer's. While I know I spend my days advocating for this disease I did not realize I was that bad. Especially with those I am not trying to convince or influence. Although I appreciate the person telling me, it has really bothered me.</p>
<p>I started to give it some thought and tried to understand why and what I could do to change that. Not too long after that my wife made a similar comment, and that really hit home because their comments to me were so close together.</p>
<p>I realized many things have contributed to this. The most important is I no longer work and I feel like I am locked in this house; I really have nothing else to do. I wish I could still be working and doing something meaningful, but unfortunately my skills required to perform those jobs are no longer there because of my Alzheimer's. I use to go to work, I used to talk with others about many different topics, not just work but everyday world issues.</p>
<p>I have tried to have similar conversations with people about issues in the news, and I don't always have the right information since I don't always understand it all, and only retain bits and pieces. While there was a time I was a news junkie, now I can rarely recall many of the topics or even can tie other stories together in my mind so I can speak intelligently. I have recently found myself starting discussions that go south because I start out with part of a subject, and when we delved into it deeper I was at loss for information. I felt stupid because I could no longer speak about something I once found very easy. I used to be great about talking about political issues which really requires you to know what you are talking about, but now I can barely defend my position, and I do worse for even bringing the subject up, and then I feel bad because I was not able to point out the real issues so the person could really make a true assessment.</p>
<p>Since I have no real job I have made it my mission to advocate for Alzheimer/dementia. I try to keep my mind as engaged as possible. I also try to focus on things that most don't, like the high hanging fruit which is probably not the best for some on like me. That involves dealing with many high-level people. While I do good at first I don't always have the answers they require, and sometimes may come across as not knowing what I am doing. It is very frustrating knowing that in my brain I have the answers, but I just do not know how to retrieve the information needed to help me do what I need to do. Especially when I need it the most, I may remember later on sometimes, but it's too late. There was a time that I could retrieve everything to my favor and keep track of everything one person would say to me.</p>
<p>Then I finally realized I listen to the weather report multiple times a day and I never seem to know what the weather is supposed to be like, which I always use to know. I just do not seem to retain it.</p>
<p>I use to like reading the paper and I no longer do that because I have trouble retaining what I read or I don't remember how the story relates to something I read a few paragraphs back in the same article.</p>
<p>I used to have hobbies that I can no longer do because of the disease. I use to love boating and tinkering with electronics. I can no longer do any of these things. I rarely do anything around the house because I am afraid I will make it worse.</p>
<p>When I have conversations with others I do not always remember what we have spoken about in the past. I always hated it when you spoke to certain people and they keep repeating the same information you had spoken about in the past. I do not want to become one of them. There are so many discussions I want to have but I just can't because the lack of my ability and more. I miss that so much. To have an intelligent conversation with someone that can reply with meaningful information, where we both walked away with some new and interesting facts would be wonderful.</p>
<p>I was never one to blow my own horn, but I do that today so others can see some of the steps I have made in hopes that they feel they are willing to take risks and help me expand my mission.</p>
<p>I have accomplished some great things and I think that is what I may share with my friends. Maybe I am repeating myself and I don't know it. I keep trying to figure out how I can change, but I struggle because I do not know what to do. It seems that Alzheimer's has taken over my life and not sure what or how to change.</p>

<p>I thought this article might be of interest to your committee. St. Paul, Minnesota has a contest calling for a million dollar idea to set the city a part. I submitted a proposal for St Paul to become the first Dementia friendly city and have been getting a great response from this.</p>
<p>Needless to say we have a long ways to go. First we need to become a finalist via the judging and then there will be a voting process. I thought this might give your advisory council some ideas on how to shift our dementia care culture by working collaboratively to support those in need while we wait for a cure to be found.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's News 4/11/2012</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association commends recognition of Alzheimer's and dementia as global health threat</strong></p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association strongly supports the call to action in the newly released World Health Organization (WHO) report <em>Dementia: A Public Health Priority</em>, which asks for all nations to develop and implement a national Alzheimer's plan, conduct greater efforts in early detection and diagnosis, and increase support of Alzheimer's disease research.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association is pleased that the WHO, in partnership with Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI), has released its first-ever major report on Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Alzheimer's and dementia affects more than <strong>35 million people worldwide today</strong>, and the report reveals the astonishing fact that today someone in the world <strong>develops dementia every 4 seconds</strong>; by the <strong>middle of the century more than 115 million people</strong> will be affected by the disease.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the comprehensive report will serve to elevate much-needed international attention to the grave health threat Alzheimer's and dementia pose to the global community today and in the years ahead.</p>
<p>"The World Health Organization lending its powerful voice and support to elevating awareness and understanding about Alzheimer's and dementia is very significant," said Harry Johns, Alzheimer's Association president and CEO. "It underscores the organization's recognition that Alzheimer's is a public health crisis requiring urgent global attention and action. These conditions will continue to be a major public health threat increasingly affecting the social and fiscal well-being of the global community until a concerted international effort is launched to combat it."</p>
<p>Already, the global cost of <strong>Alzheimer's and dementia consumes one percent of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</strong>, according to an ADI report. In the United States, the direct costs of Alzheimer's disease to American society will escalate from an estimated $200 billion this year to $1.1 trillion in 2050, largely due to baby boomers at increased risk for developing the disease as they age. In addition to the $200 billion dollars in care costs largely borne by government programs, Medicare and Medicaid, more than 15 million family members and friends provide unpaid care valued at $210 billion.</p>
<p>The new report urges countries to take a public health approach to addressing the Alzheimer's and dementia crisis while developing and strengthening policies that improve the quality of life for those living with Alzheimer's. Other goals included strong surveillance systems that allow for earlier detection of dementia and a stronger commitment to support scientific research that could one day lead to effective treatments that could stem the crisis.</p>
<p>The report discusses efforts in countries throughout the world to develop national plans, including highlighting the steps that the Alzheimer's Association took to mobilize advocates to urge passage and enactment of the National Alzheimer's Project Act. This legislation authorized the process currently underway in the United States to create this country's first national Alzheimer's plan. The Alzheimer's Association continues to work closely with U.S. leaders to shape a strong national plan, which will hopefully serve as a model for other countries. Fourteen countries, including France, Australia, Northern Ireland and Japan, currently have national Alzheimer's/dementia plans.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association has long recognized the international impact of Alzheimer's and other dementias and has made significant contributions globally toward the goal of a "world without Alzheimer's." As the world's leading Alzheimer's nonprofit, the Alzheimer's Association provides premier global forums for the greatest minds in Alzheimer's science to collaborate, connect across disciplines, address common challenges and share new discoveries. This is most notably demonstrated through the Alzheimer's Association International Conference, the largest gathering of Alzheimer's scientists and researchers annually. This year's conference will take place on July 14-19 in Vancouver and is expected to be attended by nearly 5,000 of the world's foremost Alzheimer's researchers.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association International Grants Program has been instrumental in advancing the scientific enterprise and shaping the ever evolving Alzheimer's landscape. The Association currently fund grants in 24 countries across the spectrum of Alzheimer's research from molecular biology to medical systems investigations and has awarded grants in excess of $292 million to more than 2,000 projects. In March, the Alzheimer's Association awarded its largest ever research grant -- nearly $4.2 million dollars over four years -- to the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network-Therapeutic Trials Unit (DIAN-TTU), based at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, to enable the program to move forward more quickly with innovative drug and biomarker trials in people with genetically-based, young-onset Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>"The Alzheimer's Association applauds the leadership of both the WHO and ADI in their efforts to elevate global attention to Alzheimer's and dementia. It signals an understanding that the knowledge, insights and resources of all nations must be leveraged to confront the daunting public health threat of Alzheimer's and dementia," said Johns. "The Association remains committed to working with these organizations, other international bodies and countries throughout the world to illuminate the human and economic toll of the disease until the vision of a world without Alzheimer's is realized."</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's Association</strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer care, support and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health. Our vision is a world without Alzheimer's. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.alz.org">http://www.alz.org</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for signing NAPA and putting creation of our first National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease on the fast track.</p>
<p>I preface my comments with brief personal history.</p>
<p>I joined the national Alzheimer's Association early in 1980, co-founded both the Chicago and Detroit area chapters as I moved around the country, joined the National Board of Directors circa 1981 and rose to become a national Vice Chair and Chair of the Public Policy Committee. In 1984 I co-founded the Alzheimer's Disease International. I am also proud to have single-handedly suggested the idea of what became the federally funded program to states to create innovative Alzheimer's programs with special emphasis on serving minority populations. While Chair of the Public Policy Committee for the national Alzheimer's Association I was also successful in getting our board to hire full time professional public policy staff, create our annual spring "Public Policy Forum" to bring our citizen advocates to Washington DC to be educated and meet with their Congressional representatives. We also developed our first coalition efforts, e.g. with the then Long Term Care campaign, and the National Citizen's Coalition for Nursing Home Reform and helped support the nursing home reform bill that became law (OBRA 1987). We also held our first meetings with members of the CBO and Medicare/Medicaid administration officials to examine what information was needed to start developing a plan for how to meet the service and funding needs of people with dementia and their families. Later, in the 1990's while at Wellesley Centers for Women we looked at the scary prospects of the diminished numbers of people available (the baby bust era e.g. my children's birth cohort) to serve as care partners to those baby boomers who would be developing Alzheimer's and other brain/body diseases in 2040-2050. I then was asked to join Boston University's NIH funded Alzheimer's Disease Center and Department of Neurology to continue my clinical intervention studies; I currently have a small phase I trial of nutritional supplements underway, funded by the U.S. Alzheimer's Association.</p>
<p>My work over the past 30 plus years on behalf of Alzheimer's disease and now the broader field of brain health, is all inspired by my mother Frances Fink Emerson who developed Alzheimer's disease in her early 50's, lived 25 years and died in 1990 with no ability for willed action or movement of any sort, and a brain shrunk to half its original size. She received great care both at home -9 years-and in a nursing home -- 16 years- (and thus lived a long time despite her disabilities....no other health issues) in an era when we knew only a fraction of what we know now, thanks primarily to the work of the Alzheimer's Association, and research funding by NIH, Alzheimer's Association and WHO and other organizations and caring people around the world.</p>
<p>Today I am an Alzheimer's researcher connected with Boston University School of Medicine, actively serve on my local chapter board (Alz. Assn of Massachusetts and New Hampshire) as member of the Medical Scientific Advisory Committee, serve as a Board Member Emeritus of the national Alzheimer's Association (an inactive role), and actively attend and present scientific papers or posters at the Alzheimer's Disease International. I also have a small business that brings evidence-based knowledge about brain healthy lifestyles to organizations and individuals and families. My centerpiece is the evidence-based Memory Preservation Nutrition program, which I am proud to be bringing to 6 Boston area Assisted Living communities to help them improve the healthfulness of the foods their residents are served and eating. I am also a popular speaker, mainly on the topic of "Healthy Eating for a Healthy Brain and Body." And was featured as part of a Medical Journal TV news report on Boston Channel 5's Chronicle on March 20, 2012 and November 18, 2011.</p>
<p>I am excited by the breadth and content of the draft national Alzheimer's plan and want to make just a few pointed comments about moving forward. I am also attaching a couple documents that might be of interest in summarizing some of the recent work related to brain healthy lifestyles and reducing risk of Alzheimer's and other brain diseases. Here also is the direct link to the article I wrote for Sage Encyclopedia 'Alzheimer's Disease: Encyclopedia of Lifestyle Medicine and Health' See it at: <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=6kqwthjab.0.ptfnnijab.rplxpbdab.1&amp;ts=S0737&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sage-ereference.com%2Fview%2Flifestylemedicinehealth%2Fn18.xml%3Fp%3DemailAIi5pJ5vQDTvY%26d%3D%2Flifestylemedicinehealth%2Fn18.xml">http://www.sage-ereference.com/abstract/lifestylemedicinehealth/n18.xml</a></p>
<p>First, I am gratified that the draft plan calls for research and program development in the realm of healthy lifestyles, not just innovations in the realm of pharmaceutical and medical research, which of course is needed as we would all like to find the magic bullet(s) to prevent and cure this disease. But given the complexity of this mysterious disease and the delicacy and intricacy of the brain, such magic bullets may not exist. Alzheimer's may be as challenging to reduce risk as has been heart disease, stroke and diabetes, since they are all interrelated in ways we are still seeking to understand. Thus major public health initiatives based on evidence uncovered in the fields of nutrition, physical exercise, sleep, stress reduction and much more may be what works to help our society avoid the catastrophe of doubling, then quadrupling the numbers of Americans with Alzheimer's disease as the numbers of people who could serve as care partners and paid professional providers shrinks in relative numbers.</p>
<p>Second, as an active member of the international Alzheimer's research and practice communities I strongly urge that the HHS Administrative offices charged with designing, refining and implementing the plan be in close liaison with international efforts to combat Alzheimer's disease. People in the US are often very parochial and have no idea of the great strides being made elsewhere. Also, because our healthcare system is presently dominated by for-profit organizations and pharmaceutical companies, it is harder for us to see clearly public health priorities that might be the best use of resources. The international community faces graver restraints in resources but at the same time has the power of being able to find collective solutions that benefit the most people. For instance at our most recent conference of ADI, held in London, the closing debate was whether enough evidence now exists to mount a major public health initiative targeting improvements in healthy lifestyles for middle-aged adults....vs. an even broader public health initiative to improve the health and wellbeing, especially nutrition, of babies and pregnant women and through that route decrease the numbers of future adults with brain diseases. Meanwhile we are all gearing up to try to be ready to serve the millions of adults who already have Alzheimer's, who will develop it if we don't find a way to slow down the progression and delay the age of onset.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's Disease International's small but very competent staff (Mark Wortman is the CEO, based at the UK Alzheimer's offices in London) and with several groups of collaborative research groups who are keyed in on finding practical solutions to this world wide crisis we are all facing together.</p>
<p>One of these research groups is called "10-66" which receives both NIH and WHO funding to conduct important cross-cultural studies in the developing world to establish true and comparable prevalence/incidence rates of both Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, has conducted international clinical trials of caregiver interventions to determine usefulness and costs in a variety of different countries and financial settings, and is now looking at some broader public policy and public health issues. Their annual reports can be found on the ADI website:</p>
<p>In addition, there is a collaborative effort of several country based large research projects examining whether certain lifestyle interventions could help reduce the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, or delay the age of initial symptoms. Each initiative has different founding sources and different specific research objectives and methods, but by combining and collaborating they hope to increase the robustness of their findings. One of the three studies is taking place in Finland, led by Miia Kivipelto with major funding from Finland's Health Department, and some additional funding from the U.S. Alzheimer's Association and perhaps other sources as well. I touch on that study in one of the two papers I have attached to this email.</p>
<p>Another perspective that was discussed at this last London meeting was, how best to proceed in planning CARE in the depressing scenario that we can't prevent most of the cases of Alzheimer's. What public policy is best. One that is disease specific, or that is based on disabilities, across diseases and health conditions. This was very interesting to me arising among a group of people who has fought hard for over 25 years to get their home countries to give proper recognition to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and to develop national plans. But once one has raised awareness, achieved sufficient specific research dollars and developed specific care programs, then one is freer to look at the broader public policy perspectives and see what is the best use of resources for a country, and what is most likely to be politicall feasible.</p>
<p>As you could gather from my resume, I stand ready to volunteer my time and attention to helping you in your efforts should you see a way I could be helpful.</p>
<p>In the meantime I applaud all the work you are doing and say THANK YOU. You all are fulfilling a dream I've held since the 1980's of a true national effort to combat Alzheimer's disease, both through research, public health and programmatic efforts at the local, state and federal levels.</p>

<p>Readers may take away confirmation of the importance of some of the things they are already doing and gain ideas and motivation to adopt brain-healthy nutrition and lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>Prevalence </strong></p>
<p><em>The World Alzheimer Report 2010: The Global Economic Impact of Dementia</em>, published by <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Disease International, reported that around 0.5% of the world's total population live with dementia, predominantly AD, and that the total estimated worldwide costs of dementia were US$604 billion in 2010, equivalent to around 1% of the world's gross domestic product. The <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association reports that there are nearly 15 million caregivers for <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> and dementia patients in the United States. AD is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the one growing most rapidly (by 50% from 2000 to 2007). The growth rate of this epidemic is expected to further accelerate with the aging of the baby boomer generation, increasing personal costs to families, which provide the bulk of care, and rapidly escalating economic costs from $172 billion today to more than $1 trillion by 2050. The U.S. National <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Project Act was enacted into law in January 2011 to create a coordinated national strategy to address this national public health emergency with widespread social and economic consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of AD and Diagnostic Criteria </strong></p>
<p>AD is the most common form of dementia, causing multiple impairments in thinking and cognition, including planning and organization (executive function), attention, short-term episodic memory (especially the recording of events and experiences), and sometimes visual-spatial function. The pathological hallmarks of AD are extracellular plaques composed of a protein called beta-amyloid (also called "A-beta") and the intracellular accumulations of neurofibrillary tangles, the insoluble paired helical filaments of an abnormally phosphorylated tau protein, and a cytoskeletal protein critical to the brain cell structure. Studies suggest that the soluble forms of A-beta, not the more visible plaques, are the toxic form. The normal function of A-beta is to kill microbes, as part of the innate immune system. It is the large amount of A-beta present in AD that is abnormal. Moreover, plaques and tangles appear to be late-stage developments and may or may not reflect the initiating biological sequelae, which may include injury, inflammation, disruptions of cell signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and disruptions in glucose and/or lipid metabolic processes.</p>
<p><strong>New Criteria for Diagnosing and Redefining AD </strong></p>
<p>National Institutes of Health/<strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association working groups in 2010-2011 updated the criteria for diagnosing <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia, added criteria for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to underlying <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology, and set the framework for identifying and testing biomarkers that in the near future could be used to diagnose "preclinical AD." Thus, the definition of AD has expanded beyond dementia and cognitive impairment to include a presymptomatic stage of the disease.</p>
<p>Biomarkers may improve the accuracy of diagnoses of both <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia and MCI due to <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology during life and serve as clinical trial end points. Prominent among the new biomarkers are neuroimaging (e.g., of A-beta levels, glucose processing, and the size and shape of brain structures) and measuring the presence of A-beta and tau in cerebrospinal fluid. These criteria will replace those established in 1984 as the "NINCDS-ADRDA" criteria. These criteria, developed by the National Institute of Neurological Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA), were universally adopted and have been in use, without modification, for more than 25 years. One of the challenges of prevention and treatment trials, both with preclinical AD and in MCI, is the inadequacy of cognitive tests to catch early changes reliably. The emergence of other outcome markers, namely brain imaging, and other biomarkers, is revolutionizing the field.</p>
<p>Scientists participating in the work groups formulating the new guidelines note that the updates were urgently needed for establishing the next generation of clinical trials for possible pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions. In medical practice, the proposed changes represent refinements of existing criteria for the diagnosis of <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia. The guidelines suggest, for example, that physicians recognize that complaints of loss of memory may not always be the first or most prominent presenting symptom. A decline in other aspects of cognition (e.g., word finding, vision/spatial issues, and impaired reasoning, judgment, and problem solving) may be the first presenting or the most prominent symptoms. Many research scientists in the field are concerned that current biomarker criteria give too much emphasis to A-beta and tau (especially A-beta) and too little to the role that oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular pathology, white matter, and other lesions or injuries may play in cognitive decline, in clinical symptoms of dementia, and in the development of abnormal levels of A-beta and tau. Ignoring a large body of evidence could hinder identifying proper treatments and preventive interventions, particularly lifestyle interventions. It is also important to guard against reductionist AD theories because what is now called "<strong>Alzheimer's</strong> disease" may be one or more multifactorial disorders and thus may require "multitherapies."</p>
<p>The evolving understanding of AD includes the recognition that individuals with a diagnoses of AD and MCI can still learn new information and acquire new habits, using a variety of preserved functions such as other forms of memory (e.g., visual, emotional, procedural). In addition, it is important to realize that while people with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> may have lost many brain cells and synapses, they still retain many healthy brain cells, so it is important to work with them to maintain brain health in the hope of slowing progression, maintaining positive emotion, and improving quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Causes or Etiology of AD as Related to Lifestyle</strong></p>
<p>The exact causes and etiology of AD are still not fully known. As of 2011, there are still no methods of perfect diagnosis during life or ways to cure or completely prevent AD. Age remains the biggest risk factor for AD, with (lower) education levels the only other consistent risk factor across all ethnic groups. However, much has been learned in the past 30 years, lifestyles are at the heart of this new knowledge.</p>
<p>Research now recognizes AD as a complex chronic disease with many environmental and genetic factors, whose pathology may begin to accumulate 10 to 30 or more years before the appearance of noticeable clinical symptoms. With such a long prodromal stage, preventive interventions are needed that can be safely used for decades. While a few families have an autosomnal dominant form of AD, most individuals have what is called the "sporadic" form, without clear genetic patterns. The <em>APOE4</em> type of allele confers a dose-related risk for persons of European origin but not typically for those of African origin. While other risk-conferring genes have been identified, most scientists have found that environmental factors are probably at least as important as genetic ones. Recognition of the importance of lifestyle flows directly from the multiple studies that have shown that brain and cognitive health is dramatically affected by the rest of the body, especially the cardiovascular, glucose metabolism, and cell energy systems.</p>
<p>Observational and prospective studies have confirmed this logical relationship and spawned numerous animal studies to explore the relationships between particular lifestyle factors, cognition, and the mechanisms of action. For instance, physical exercise as well as many nutrients and food substances with anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory properties have proven to lower the amount of A-beta in animal models and also lower inflammation. Some nutrients also improve neuronal cell signaling, lipid metabolism, and glucose metabolism and/or decrease oxidative stress.</p>
<p>This sort of evidence, together with numerous observational studies with a variety of human populations in different countries, has established that appropriate nutrition and physical activity are good candidates for helping reduce the risk of dementia, cognitive decline, and AD in humans. In 2010, gold-standard randomized clinical trials for integrated evidence-based nutrition programs had not yet been undertaken, and those for various forms of exercise had just begun. These kinds of lifestyle interventions are very difficult to get funded and then carry out, so scientists cannot yet say with certainty that the various lifestyles indicated by an array of other studies will be sufficient to delay the onset of cognitive symptoms or slow progression. However, scientists have already proven with certainty the link between nutrition, physical exercise, and certain other lifestyle factors to prevent, slow, or even reverse other related chronic diseases such as stroke, other cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and insulin resistance. Therefore, most researchers and clinicians are ready to recommend lifestyle approaches as these offer probable additional benefits to cognitive health. Lifestyle interventions are also of keen interest since, given the multiple decades of presymptomatic development of AD-related pathology, preventive interventions need to be safe and tolerable.</p>
<p>A growing body of research suggests that a variety of nutritional factors, social engagement, mental stimulation, physical exercise, complex activities incorporating multiple domains, and management of stress and depression all help preserve brain health. Managing both emotional and physical stress is important because heightened cortisol levels have been connected to cognitive decline as well as to faster rates of decline in persons with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia. Moreover, research reports an association between cortisol levels, hippocampal shrinkage, and insulin resistance. Adequate sleep is also essential for a healthy brain, neuroplasticity, and memory. Music, art, acupuncture, T'ai Chi, meditation, and certain other spiritual practices, as well as having a meaning and purpose in life, also appear to enhance brain health. Many of these lifestyle factors are related to neuronal plasticity and the generation of new brain cells as well as prevention of deterioration of existing brain cells.</p>
<p>Research indicates some common factors for both cognitive and emotional health. Intervention studies indicate the independent and synergistic efficacy of nutrition, cognitive rehabilitation, physical exercise, and various alternative medicine practices in improving cognition, mood, and quality of life of persons who already live with AD or other memory or brain disorders. The challenge is in actually making behavioral changes to adopt these protective lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>Why Lifestyle Factors Are Important to Brain Health </strong></p>
<p>Epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of AD doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 (with 13% of individuals over the age of 65 having AD and about 40% over 85 years having AD). If lifestyle interventions can delay the onset of AD by 5 years, the prevalence of the disease would be halved, along with all the attendant human and financial costs.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that healthy brain tissue is better able to withstand the ravages of age, genetic vulnerabilities, environmental stresses, accidents, toxins, and disease. Further, healthy lifestyles help enhance and strengthen neurons, dendrites, and other body and brain cells.</p>
<p>Many studies, including gold-standard clinical trials in the case of many other chronic diseases, have suggested that a healthy lifestyle, especially with regard to nutrition and exercise, may help prevent and treat most human chronic diseases. Thus, healthy lifestyles are helpful to both the person with dementia and his or her care partners, who are at extra risk of depression and illness because of caregiving.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular health and normal glucose metabolism contribute to brain health, while the rise in obesity and other chronic illnesses has a direct negative impact on brain health. Dozens of studies have established that each vascular risk factor adds to the risk for AD and severity of dementia.</p>
<p>Diabetes and prediabetes increase the risk of cognitive decline, MCI and dementia, and, according to some scientists, AD in particular. Studies using imaging techniques in adults and teenagers show that diabetes, prediabetes, or abnormally high insulin resistance as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) shrinks the hippocampus, the major site for short-term memory and spatial memory, encoding of new information and experiences, as well as some aspects of emotional function. These findings should raise serious public health concerns because study results show that the hippocampi are already shrinking in obese teenagers with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as in middle-aged nondiabetic adults with insulin resistance. Cognitive impairments in nondiabetic adults were found to be associated with the degree of insulin resistance. Related memory impairments and related white-matter changes were observed in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels were reduced in adults with insulin resistance.</p>
<p>Inflammation is believed to play a key role in the etiology of AD and has been associated with an increased risk of AD. Existing inflammation, as well as inflammatory events such as infections, surgery, or heart attacks, hastens progression in people with AD. Oxidative stress also plays a key role in AD etiology, including increasing inflammation and oxidation of brain lipids. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction is part of AD etiology and relates to the energy systems within the brain cells.</p>
<p>In summary, whatever hurts the heart and blood vessels harms the brain. Problems with glucose metabolism and insulin levels also threaten the brain. The organ and disease silos are disintegrating, with increasingly similar clinical recommendations for better nutrition and exercise and for managing stress to treat or prevent a wide range of chronic diseases affecting nearly every organ in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Lifestyle Approaches for Cognitive Health </strong></p>
<p>Many leaders in the field of brain health believe that the evidence is already sufficient to suggest that regardless of personal risk factors, and with or without pharmacologic intervention, a healthful lifestyle is likely to reduce risk, delay onset, and slow the progression of AD and vascular dementia. Some of these researchers and clinicians conclude that the evidence suggests that it is the combination of vascular lesions (e.g., microstrokes or white-matter lesions) with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology that together result in symptoms of MCI and dementia. If these hypotheses are correct, then they offer another argument in favor of practicing healthy lifestyles to reduce cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Nutrition, physical exercise, and other lifestyle interventions work on multiple pathways to improve overall health in multiple organs with minimal or no side effects, even over many decades, which is important since scientists now believe that the pathology of AD--that is, the development of excess A-beta and abnormal phosphorylated tau--begins several decades before the appearance of cognitive symptoms.</p>
<p>Multiple lifestyle factors can have synergistic or additive effects. One of the most interesting trials involved the 2-year study of aged beagle dogs conducted by Carl Cotman's group at the University of California, Irvine, which showed that an enriched diet alone improved performance on a cognitive task from 25% in the control group to 67% of the experimental animals. A third group, with increased physical activity and social play, improved performance to 80%, while combining enriched diet and exercise-play interventions resulted in 100% of a fourth group of dogs being able to perform the difficult learning task.</p>
<p>Given the well-established connection between cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and diabetes and cognitive function and cognitive decline, and the evidence-based certainty that good nutrition, physical activity, and certain other lifestyle changes help treat or prevent these diseases, more and more people in the AD field have concluded that it is good clinical practice to recommend these healthy lifestyles to persons concerned about their brain health or who already have a diagnosis of MCI or dementia, including AD.</p>
<p><strong>Multidomain Lifestyle Study Under Way in Finland </strong></p>
<p>Many people in the field agree that the preventive intervention most likely to be effective will be multifaceted to be potent enough to delay the onset of AD or slow it down. There is one such multicenter randomized clinical trial under way in Finland, called the <strong>Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability</strong> (FINGER) Trial, under the leadership of Miia Kivipelto and funded by the Finnish government, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the national <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01041989). Persons between 60 and 77 years of age who are determined to be at increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia are randomized to a control group (standard health counseling at baseline) or to a preventive intervention for 2 years. The latter receive multidisciplinary treatment that includes nutritional guidance, physical exercise, cognitive training and social activity, and intensive monitoring and management of metabolic (e.g., diabetes) and vascular risk factors. Importantly, each intervention includes a coach to guide and encourage the implementation of each lifestyle change. In addition to cognitive end points, a variety of potential biomarkers are monitored in relationship to any cognitive change, including biochemical markers of inflammation or oxidation, hormones controlling blood sugars and fats, as well as brain imaging.</p>
<p>Dr. Kivipelto's study reflects the combined wisdom of many leaders in the field, including the International Academy of Nutrition and Aging. The FINGER study builds on more than a decade of research, suggesting the importance of each domain of this combined program. The collective findings of some of these studies are summarized in the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Selected Findings of Lifestyle Studies </strong></p>
<p>Observational studies have established that each of the following lifestyle behaviors may be independently related to a lower risk of dementia: (a) nutrition, (b) physical fitness, (c) social activities and social engagement, (d) organization memberships, (e) productive (meaningful) activities, (f) mental activities (e.g., reading, word spelling/recognition, numbers, and other games), and (g) management of stress. Several researchers, using meta-analyses, have concluded that the most potent activities are complex activities that involve multiple domains, especially activities that include physical activity and social interaction as well as cognitive challenge, such as dancing and golf. Examples of activities involving 2 domains are board or card games, knitting, gardening, T'ai Chi, chi gong or yoga, and doing exercise in a group. Complex and novel activities such as learning a new language, especially sign language, traveling to new places, and playing a musical instrument, especially a new one, are also particularly recommended.</p>
<p>A 2010 Institute of Medicine Consensus conference and a Cochrane review of certain lifestyle interventions for preserving cognitive health concluded that there was insufficient evidence on which to base clinical recommendations. The Cochrane reviews and the Institute of Medicine, however, used very strict criteria for acceptable clinical trials, and for physical exercise, they reviewed only a few clinical trials of very small size or pilot in nature, which were underpowered. Both panels tended to be overly conservative and looking backward rather than forward in a brand new research field where rigorous clinical trials were just beginning to be designed, funded, and reviewed and where, logically, these interventions might have their biggest impact in the preclinical or MCI stage of AD, where outcome measures are still under development. Most reviews also do not integrate the combined weight of observational studies with clinical trials in animal models of AD, which are the first phase of testing some of the factors observed in human longitudinal studies and of researching mechanisms of action. Nutritional trials, especially those with integrated complex nutritional programs, are difficult to design and gain adherence to, and physical exercise programs to some extent suffer the same challenges. Published randomized controlled trials in the nutrition field as of 2011 were limited to single substances or small groups of vitamins.</p>
<p>Nonetheless the body of evidence is growing rapidly.</p>
<p><em><strong>Nutrition </strong></em></p>
<p>One well-structured prospective study published in 2010 found that persons with the highest levels of all 8 forms of vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols) had half the risk of AD, whereas previous studies and intervention trials, less knowledgeable about the necessity of all forms of vitamin E in the brain and body, had looked at only <em>a</em>-tocopherol. This Karolinska Institutet (Sweden) study concluded that it was the combination of the 8 vitamin E forms that was important to brain health.</p>
<p>Various nutritional studies using animal models have shown the power of various single nutrients to lower A-beta levels, reduce oxidative stress, and improve cognitive function. Clinical trials of persons with MCI or AD have been few in number and show mixed results but some limited promise. A Swedish clinical trial of fish oil capsules using a daily dose of 1.7 mg of docosahexaenoic acid and 0.6 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (2 long-chain omega-3 fatty acids abundant in the human brain) reported preliminary results suggesting a slowing of cognitive decline in persons with early-stage AD. A larger trial of just algae-derived docosahexaenoic acid had no effect across all AD patients. One study of 3 B vitamins (B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, and folate) had no effect in persons with AD, but another using lower doses of the same 3 B vitamins improved cognition in people with MCI, but only in those with high homocysteine levels. These results suggest that while combination dietary programs may produce stronger effects on cognition than current pharmacological treatments for AD, single nutrients may be insufficient, and nutritional interventions may have more effect in MCI and very early-stage AD. Continued clinical research is needed.</p>
<p>Of greater interest for clinical study is combining multiple nutrients since the most recent observational studies have suggested that it is combinations of whole foods, such as in the Mediterranean or DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets, that really make a difference. A 2006 integrative review presents evidence of how various nutrients appear to work on the multiple different pathways leading to AD and/or dementia, including inflammation, oxidative stress, glucose or insulin abnormalities, levels of A-beta and tau, cell signaling, and mitochondrial dysfunction. A recent animal study showed that a combination of whole foods-based nutrients, including vegetable, fruit, and herb and spice nutrients combined with fish oil, appears to restore mitochondrial dysfunction in triply transgenic AD mice, and a clinical trial is now under way in healthy older adults. A series of pilot studies with both mice and humans conducted by Thomas Shea and colleagues have shown preliminary success in improving short-term memory and attention in both cognitively normal adults and patients with AD, with a novel combination of vitamins and nutrients: namely, vitamin E, folic acid, vitamin B12, <em>N</em>-acetyl-l-cysteine, acetyl-l-carnitine hydrochloride, and <em>S</em>-adenosylmethionine. These preliminary studies suggest an important focus for continued studies in nutrition and brain health.</p>
<p><em><strong>Physical Activity </strong></em></p>
<p>Most of the meta-analyses of physical activity that had less strict criteria for study inclusion than the Cochrane reviews reported consistently positive results, backing up the observational studies that had linked physical activity to reduced incidence of AD and slower rates of conversion from MCI to AD dementia. An array of intervention studies in healthy older adults, people with MCI, and people with early AD, all found evidence of decrease in the rates of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Animal studies have established that physical activity increases cognitive function and identified at least 2 newer mechanisms of action beyond the known cardiovascular mechanisms: (1) decrease in levels of A-beta in the brain and (2) increased amount and rates of neurogenesis, especially in the hippocampus. Human studies have established that people who exercise more have higher levels of hippocampal BDNF, a brain chemical related to neurogenesis. Increased serum BDNF levels have been correlated with larger hippocampi and better memory performance.</p>
<p>Kirk I. Erickson's randomized controlled study using magnetic resonance imaging as an outcome measure established that aerobic exercise (specifically 1 year of walking 3 times a week for 40 minutes) can increase the size of critical brain structures. Consistent with the expected 1% to 2% annual hippocampal loss in dementia-free seniors, the control group (which spent an equal amount of time stretching) lost about 1.4% volume in this brain region by the end of the 12-month trial. In contrast, the hippocampi of the walkers grew by roughly 2%. In addition, researchers found that greater elevations in serum BDNF were linked to greater gains in hippocampal volume.</p>
<p>The benefit of walking exercise seemed specific to the anterior part of the hippocampus (including the dentate gyrus). Similar effects did not appear in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, or posterior hippocampus. The dentate gyrus is the most metabolically active part of our brain and is involved in spatial memory, short-term memory, and new learning. Neurogenesis is most prominent in this part of the adult brain; many surmise that it is so because creation of new brain cells and dendritic connections is essential to the production of new memories.</p>
<p><em><strong>Meditation and Spiritual Practices </strong></em></p>
<p>Stress management and spiritual practices may also contribute to brain health. For example, a recent study using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in live human participants reported that persons participating in an 8-week mindfulness meditation program experienced measurable increases in the hippocampus regions associated with memory, sense of self, and empathy while reducing areas of the amygdala associated with stress. Numerous studies demonstrate that other spiritual practices such as forgiveness improve emotional and mental health. By relieving stress and depression and decreasing cortisol levels, such practices may also improve cognitive health.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cognitive Training, Cognitive Rehabilitation, and Cognitive-Kinetic Interventions </strong></em></p>
<p>With regard to cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation strategies to improve and preserve cognition, the evidence is particularly strong. Observational studies suggested that "use it or lose it" applies to keeping one's mind active. The groundbreaking ACTIVE randomized clinical trial study demonstrated that even short-term cognitive skills practice interventions had persistent effects in the healthy elderly. A number of later studies suggest that the most effective interventions combine modalities--for example, cognitive training with physical exercise and support groups.</p>
<p><em><strong>Multifaceted Relationship Between Physical Activity and Cognition </strong></em></p>
<p>In population and clinical studies, physical activity and exercise have been shown to have a positive effect on cognitive function in people of all ages. Recent studies have found that physical exercise stimulates a positive increase in executive control processes, including planning, scheduling, working memory, inhibitory processes, and multitasking. The impact of physical activity on cognitive abilities also continues through the entire lifespan. Physical exercise, for example, has been found to be a key facilitator in neurogenesis, particularly in the hippocampus as well as in other areas of the brain. In general, the rate of neurogenesis and other cognitive benefits is related to the intensity, novelty, and dose of physical activity and exercise. Both endurance (aerobic) and strength (resistance training) exercise benefit both cognitively intact and cognitively impaired individuals.</p>
<p>With regard to improvement in individuals with MCI and AD, substantial clinical trial evidence suggests that various cognitive rehabilitation and training strategies may help restore lost function and slow progression of cognitive decline. Different strategies appear to have more or less potent effects in only one area or in multiple areas. For example, a cognitive training strategy targeting episodic memory benefited only episodic memory. A more holistic strategy that combined physical movements based on kinetic/cognitive theory with cognitive training benefitted areas of attention, spatial abilities, language, memory executive functions, and daily functions. Arkin's pioneering study, initially published in 1999, found a combination of simultaneous physical exercise and conversation, and language practice and word games, interspersed with volunteer activity, particularly effective.</p>
<p><strong>Barriers to Adopting Lifestyle Initiatives </strong></p>
<p>There are several barriers to adopting lifestyle changes, including cultural and psychological barriers. Cultural challenges include the overdependence of the American health care system, and therefore of most individuals, on pharmaceuticals and surgery, which have limited preventive roles for many chronic diseases or could be more potent if combined with lifestyle changes. Perhaps the biggest challenge for implementing these interventions as standard clinical practice is financial. Generally, lifestyle interventions are not covered by most current health insurance plans, although the concept of health promotion and prevention of illness is starting to develop. For instance, because research has established that having a "coach" or personal trainer helps individuals make lasting lifestyle changes, some private insurers will supply a free "health coach" even if the actual interventions are not reimbursed.</p>
<p>To promote brain health, prescribed cognitive training and physical activity may be the modalities most likely to be recognized with some incentives. Nutrition for brain health promotion is not currently covered, although individuals with diagnoses may find some limited coverage for counseling with licensed nutritionists. For families working together to provide a healthier home environment for both a patient with brain disease and his or her care partners, one possible source of funding is the National Family Caregiver Support program, which can be accessed online at <a href="http://www.aoa.gov/prof/aoaprog/caregiver/caregiver.asp">http://www.aoa.gov/prof/aoaprog/caregiver/caregiver.asp</a>. Individuals who have long-term care policies also may be able to gain coverage for these services. The future major solutions lie in the realm of public health, public education, public policy, and research envisioned with the 2011 passage of the National <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Project Act.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>4.2.0. Memory and Cognitive Impact of Foods</strong></p>
<p>Research is proceeding rapidly on the connection between diet, including individual nutrients, on memory and other aspects of our thinking.</p>
<p>Most of the research to date has examined how foods relate to memory and cognition. This research has consisted of either animal studies of specific foods or nutrients, or of epidemiological studies of large groups of people (which can show an association, but not prove a direct cause). These studies have explored the relationship between aspects of what we eat and the likelihood or risk of developing general cognitive problems, mild cognitive impairment (including of the amnestic type i.e. involving memory problems), any kind of dementia (i.e. problems in thinking in multiple areas serious enough to cause problems in daily life or work) or specific diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The mechanisms of action (for how specific foods might help or hurt the brain) identified to date appear to vary, and in the case of many whole foods, multiple actions could be working simultaneously (See for example, Emerson Lombardo NB et al. 2006, Sun AY et al 2008. Tian J et al 2010, Howes and Perry 2011, Williams RJ, 2011). Some ways specific foods could enhance brain health include increasing the availability of the memory neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain (apple juice, sage, Melissa, saffron) (e.g. by directly increasing production, slowing its metabolic breakdown, similar to the action of the cholinesterase inhibitors currently on the market), anti-oxidant and/or anti-inflammatory action, regulating amount of various forms of Abeta peptides, slowing or preventing oligomerization or fibrilization of the Abeta molecule (Wang 2008, Frydman-Marom, A.,2011), protecting omega-3 fatty acids in brain cell membranes or fatty acids, regulating blood sugar and insulin, and/or cholesterol, estrogenic effects that can be neuro-protective, promoting creation of new brain cells or connective parts, or slowing their destruction, improving neuronal signaling and synapse activity, restoring mitochondrial function (related to energy) of brain cells, and retarding tau pathology (the "other" problem protein in AD) (Green 2007) . This list is only partial!</p>
<p>The number of human clinical trials is still small but growing.</p>
<p>The body of evidence suggests a clear connection between foods, overall diet and our brain health, including memory and other cognitive skills such as attention and executive function (ability to organize and plan), and is growing each year.</p>
<p>This website and our brain healthy newsletters will keep you informed of this growing body of evidence.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<p>Several studies using various mouse models of Alzheimer's disease demonstrated the positive effects of a wide variety of food substances chosen for their believed health benefits such as strong anti-oxidant properties. Each food type may be comprised of thousands of nutrients. Foods tested that improved cognitive behaviors and/or lowered Abeta levels in TG mice include: apple juice, blueberries, spinach, strawberries, green tea, melatonin, DHA, plum juice, Concord grape juice, resveratrol, grape seed extract and others (Chan A et al, 2006, Rogers EJ et al.2004, Joseph JA. Et al. 1999, 2009, Lee JW, et al 2009, Mandel SA et al. 2011, Calon, F et al, 2004 and Green et al, 2007, Shukitt-Hale B et al, 2009, Shukitt-Hale B et al 2006, Lagouge, M., et al, 2006, Wang et al., 2008). Both almonds and walnuts helped Alzheimer transgenic mice perform better in cognitive tests and lowered levels of A-beta (Chauhan N et al. 2004, Muthaiyah B, et al, 2011 - no published citation for almonds- see continued work by Neelima Chauhan, PhD, of the University of Illinois-Chicago, as reported in 2005 by Society for Neuroscience. <a href="http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=news_111405">http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=news_111405</a>). An unrelated Indian study in aged rats reported almond paste reversed scopolamine-induced amnesia, reduced cholinesterase activity in the brain, and also significantly reduced cholesterol and triglycerides in these aged rats (Kulkarni KS, et al. 2010).</p>
<p>Epidemiological studies have also identified a long list of brain healthy foods. More recently, innovative studies have begun to identify GROUPS of foods that appear to reduce risk of cognitive decline and onset of dementia, MCI or Alzheimer's disease, such as foods typical of the Mediterranean diet (Féart, C et al 2009, Gu Y, et al 2009, Scarmeas N et al., 2006, 2009a, 2009b, or the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet (LINK <a href="http://dashdiet.org/dash_diet_book.asp?google&amp;gclid=CMDj8qOMsq0CFUTc4Aodvz0FlQ">http://dashdiet.org/dash_diet_book.asp?google&amp;gclid=CMDj8qOMsq0CFUTc4Aodvz0FlQ</a> ) (see unpublished study led by Heidi Wengreen, RD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Nutrition at Utah State University).</p>
<p>Combination supplement studies are also gaining interest. Professor Thomas Shea, Ph.D., Director of the Cellular Neurobiology and Neurodegeneration Research Centerat U Mass Lowell (<a href="http://www.uml.edu/research_labs/Cellular_Neurobiology/Staff.html">http://www.uml.edu/research_labs/Cellular_Neurobiology/Staff.html</a> ) is examining, first in mice and now in humans with and without memory impairments, a combination of certain B vitamins, amino acids and anti-oxidants, with some encouraging results. Another study led by Jon Valla in Arizona uses a combination of fruit and vegetable powers, anti-inflammatory spices and herbs, and fish oil, yielding some positive results in TG mice. A similar combination with the addition of vitamin D is currently undergoing a pilot Phase I clinical trial with healthy older adults at Boston University. Also, Nutricia, a subsidiary of the French Danone Company, is pursuing human clinical trials in both Europe and the US, of Souvenaid® (<a href="http://souvenaid.com/">http://souvenaid.com/</a>) a combination of neuron building substrates identified (and patented) by Dr. Richard Wurtman at MIT, together with anti-oxidant isolated vitamins (Kamphuis and Scheltens, 2010), featured at a company sponsored symposium at MIT (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fighting-alzheimers.html">http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fighting-alzheimers.html</a>). The consumer needs to be aware of the differences between medical foods such as Souvenaid, and nutritional supplements such as "Great Mind, as the rules of evidence and FDA regulations are different. The Alzheimer's Forum engaged in an excellent discussion of this topic in 2009, <a href="http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2258">http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2258</a></p>
<p>A Swedish placebo-controlled clinical trial using fish oil containing both DHA and EPA reported that fish oil appeared to slow cognitive decline only in a few persons with early stage Alzheimer's disease. In persons with mid stage disease the main positive effect was to reverse weight loss, which can be a serious problem in some people (Freund-Levi Y. et al, 2006). A larger, more recent clinical trial of just DHA derived from algae, in persons with AD, reported no significant effect on cognition; however the trial neglected to include EPA, the more highly anti-inflammatory long chain Omega 3 which, in nature, usually occurs in conjunction with DHA and which humans typically consume (and synthesize) along with DHA. Since other AD research has established that AD has an inflammatory aspect to its etiology, we believe that EPA may prove to be as important as DHA in its treatment and prevention. Also, psychiatric and attention-deficit disorders research has established that EPA rather than DHA appears to be the active long chain Omega 3 in achieving the desired treatment effect. See for example Jazayeri S, 2008 (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18247193">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18247193</a> ) and work by Andew Stoll, MD (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Omega-3-Connection-Groundbreaking-Anti-depression-Program/dp/0684871386">http://www.amazon.com/Omega-3-Connection-Groundbreaking-Anti-depression-Program/dp/0684871386</a>) and Ned Hollowell, MD. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delivered-Distraction-Getting-Attention-Disorder/dp/034544230X">http://www.amazon.com/Delivered-Distraction-Getting-Attention-Disorder/dp/034544230X</a>).</p>
<p>Cinnamon helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar, is a potent anti-oxidant (see ORAC chart...link) and is anti-inflammatory, and thus through these 4 pathways is thought to be positive for brain health. A January 2011 publication of an animal study (transgenic mice and flies) by a group of Israeli scientists suggests that cinnamon may also have a positive direct brain effect - cinnamon helps retard the development of Alzheimer's pathology by preventing the oligomerization ("clumping") of single Abeta molecules, leading to toxic forms that kill brain cells (Frydman-Marom A). To learn more, see our newsletter on the topic (Link to Cinnamon newsletter CHANGE THIS TO NEW WEBSITE POSITION <a href="http://healthcareinsights.net/home/newsletter-2011/august-2011-newsletter/">http://healthcareinsights.net/home/newsletter-2011/august-2011-newsletter/</a>). Grape seed extract also prevents or slows oligomerization and fibrilization.</p>
<p>A proof of concept RCT in 12 older adults with MCI found significant improvements in one test of memory (verbal learning) in the 6 randomized to drinking Concord Grape Juice for 12 weeks (Krikorian R et al 2010).</p>
<p>Three small pilot randomized controlled studies of three different spices/herbs in Alzheimer's patients, all led by the same medical researcher in Iran, all published in reputable peer-reviewed journals, suggested positive effects in slowing cognitive decline compared to placebo (sage and lemon balm, also known as melissa) or slowing at same rate as a current prescription drug, without the usual gastro-intestinal side effects (saffron). (See Akhondzadeh, S. et al. 2003a, 2003b, 2010)</p>
<p>Diets high in sugar and/or saturated fats appear to be harmful for the brain. A preclinical study in AD transgenic mice demonstrated that simply spiking water with 10% sugar (while offering same healthy mouse chow to two groups of identical, randomized mice) resulted in speedier cognitive decline of the mice drinking the sugared water, higher levels of Abeta in the brain, and abnormal cholesterol levels. Cao D et al. 2007, Suzanne Craft group's proof of concept randomized clinical trial in 50 older adults for just 1 month demonstrated that a high glycemic index, high saturated/high fat diet, compared to a low glycemic, low saturated fat/low fat diet, resulted in significantly worse cognitive performance (using a visual memory test), and undesirable changes in levels of Abeta in cerebral spinal fluid. (Bayer-Carter JL et al. 2011).</p>

<p>From a global perspective, the NAPA law, Council and subsequent plan development have given a shot in the arm to the Alzheimer's community which has been pursuing many of the same aims of the act in countries on all five continents. Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI) would like to offer some brief comments to the NAPA planners about the broader context of your work. Though there are major differences in resources and the cost of care between developed and less developed nations, the similarities of challenges around diagnosis, family support, health system development and quality care are universal, as are the aspirations for improved treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's a disease and related dementias.</p>
<p>We offer our comments based primarily in response to draft strategies 1D and 1E, which recommend more international collaboration in the research and public health education sectors, a concept we heartily endorse.</p>
<p>ADI is the international federation of Alzheimer associations around the world, in official relations with the World Health Organization. Each member is the Alzheimer association in their country who support people with dementia and their families. ADI's vision is an improved quality of life for people with dementia and their families throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong>Alzheimer's as a Global Public Health Issue </strong></p>
<p>The global health community is waking up to the size and scope of the problem of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. These comments review 3 global developments: information reports by our private organisation, Alzheimer's Disease International (of which the Alzheimer's Association is a member), United Nations and World Health Organization reports and actions, which have recently increased and in which the US has played and could continue to play a helpful role.</p>
<p>Since 2009, <strong>ADI</strong> has issued major data reports about Alzheimer disease and related dementias worldwide. Each report is the product of scientific collaboration, led by an epidemiologist and full research team. I would highlight the most recent report, which provides the latest evidence of the medical and social benefits of an early and accurate diagnosis as a tool on which to base further work to fight the gap between prevalence estimates of 36 million worldwide and actually numbers of people diagnosed. It is estimated that probably no more than 1 in 4 people with dementia have received a formal diagnosis, which has been identified as a significant issue in the US draft plan framework and <em>Healthy People 2020</em> objectives.</p>
<p>In September 2011 the <strong>United Nations</strong> held only its second high-level meeting on a health issue in its history. This consultation on non-communicable diseases was held to debate a policy document and the final political declaration urges that member countries: "18. Recognize that mental and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, are an important cause of morbidity and contribute to the global non-communicable disease burden, for which there is a need to provide equitable access to effective programmes and health-care interventions."</p>
<p>This UN session directed the WHO to develop a series of targets, measures and indicators for reducing non-communicable diseases to be adopted by the World Health Assembly in its May 2012 meeting.</p>
<p>The <strong>World Health Organization</strong>'s involvement in Alzheimer's disease dates back to at least 1982, when it held an expert meeting on senile dementia. For many years most of the focus of the WHO has been through its mental health Programme (mhGap). The programme has produced a steady body of work for international professional and public health audiences about Alzheimer's and dementia. Our summary chart of all WHO publications is appended to these comments.</p>
<p>With WHO now deeply involved in follow-on planning from the NCD summit, efforts are underway to get Alzheimer's disease recognised as the fifth major non-communicable disease. <strong><em>However we need support from the US Government to make that happen and include Alzheimer's disease in the next NCD Strategy 2013-2020!</em></strong> Alzheimer's disease was used as an example of how ageing is a factor in the growing noncommunicable disease challenge in a recent resolution passed at the Assembly's executive meeting in January, and it is certain to be debated at the assembly meeting in May.</p>
<p><strong>WHO Global Report </strong></p>
<p>On April 11 2012 the World Health Organization will release a major global report on Alzheimer's disease and dementia. This is the result of collaboration with over 100 experts around the world to produce a volume similar in size and style to the world report on disabilities. Basic themes of the report will include the need for improved and coordinated research, more professional development of medical and non-medical staff, family caregiver support, and better linkages between health and social services in order to support people with Alzheimer's. The report will also focus on population risk reduction for Alzheimer's disease and dementia, identifying what might be done in the public health sector to better define and reduce population risk of dementia. The prevalence/diagnosis gap is also a theme of the report and it has a section on small subpopulations of people with Alzheimer's disease, such as rural, minority language speaking, or people with Alzheimer's referred to as early or younger onset.</p>
<p>The WHO will signal that we are on the brink of a global health catastrophe. Across the world, 36 million people are living with dementia today. But unlike people with other serious conditions, their plight is very often not recognised. They will argue that their condition attracts only minimal research investment and a lack of awareness about adequate care and treatment mean their condition is often made needlessly worse than it needs to be. As the global population ages the problem will only get bigger.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Collaborations </strong></p>
<p>Though there are many cross-national, scientific collaborations we suggest the following three that go beyond the bio-medical focus and highlight some of that work as suggestions for additional directions that international collaboration in research could foster.</p>
<p><strong>JPND</strong><br />
					The EU supports the European Union <strong>Joint Programme - Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND)</strong> to facilitate trans-European research. The idea was launched in 2008 during the French presidency of the European Union. It is a major effort to improve EU alignment of scientific strategy on Alzheimer's disease and make best use of available resources. It now numbers 24 countries.</p>
<p>JPND major effort to date has been to collaboratively create a strategic research agenda to guide activity and investments. Just released, this strategy is based on the most complete compendium of current country-by-country efforts ever created. It lays out five scientific priorities and a robust set of cross-cutting enabling activities to move the strategy forward, of which two are unique when compared to the draft NAPA framework.</p>
<p>The JPND <strong>healthcare and social care research goal</strong> identifies the major disconnect between health and social care systems and proposes research activities that may address the gap. Priority activities planned include coordinated studies to validate social care interventions, evaluation of pathways to treatment and support and their effectiveness, the effects of co-morbidity in dementia care and the study of assistive technologies.</p>
<p>The JPND <strong>treatments and prevention goal</strong> includes a set of activities to examine psychosocial interventions and some population health activities, with a significant public health element of the strategic research agenda is using the planned European Health Examination Study to provide new Europe-wide data on the prevalence of people with early cognitive difficulties. This could be cross-walked with the CDC work on surveillance and compared to the ongoing effort adding cognitive questions to other population health studies such as NHANES, which could to lead to better understanding of population risk factors and the challenges of co-morbid chronic conditions existing with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinated Prevention and Risk Reduction Studies </strong></p>
<p>We would encourage the NAPA planners to begin to think about Alzheimer's disease as the fifth non-communicable disease, and to take advantage of growing evidence that demonstrates that some of the risk of Alzheimer's and dementia is modifiable, with many of the same risk factors as the other major NCDs.</p>
<p>We support additional careful study and our members are careful not to say "prevention of Alzheimer's" but there is sound science on risk reduction and several more large European dementia prevention studies are targeting cardio-vascular and lifestyle related risk factors which will report in 2012 and 2013. These are:</p>
<ul><li>The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER)</li>
<li>The Prevention of Dementia by Intensive Vascular Care (PreDIVA)</li>
<li>The Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT)</li>
<li>The European Dementia Prevention Initiative is a new (2011) convening body of many of these collaborators. (<a href="http://www.edpi.org">http://www.edpi.org</a>)</li>
</ul><p>10/66 Dementia Research Group</p>
<p>The <strong>10/66 Dementia Research Group</strong> is a collective of researchers carrying out population-based research on dementia, non-communicable diseases and ageing in low and middle income countries 10/66 is a part of Alzheimer's Disease International, and is coordinated by the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London. All protocols, survey instruments, and de-personalised 10/66 study datasets are available for secondary data analyses, subject to scientific and ethical review. The group has run carer intervention trials as well as validated measures for dementia identification in low resource countries, both of which might find application in the US with cultural or ethnic minorities.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to submit written comments for the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease as part of the National Alzheimer's Project Act.</p>
<p>In Oklahoma, our aging network formed an interagency workgroup to discuss the draft and make recommendations. The following agencies and their representatives were asked for their input:</p>
<p>Aging Services Division (ASD) Division Director<br />
					ASD Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) Project Director<br />
					ASD Policy and Strategic Planning Supervisor<br />
					Oklahoma Health Care Authority representative (the state Medicaid agency)<br />
					ASD Home and Community-Based Services Program Administrator<br />
					Adult Protective Services Program Administrator<br />
					OKDHS Developmental Disabilities Division Director<br />
					ASD Older Americans Act Program Administrator<br />
					Oklahoma Mental Health Advocacy Coalition Director<br />
					ASD Legal Services Developer<br />
					ASD State Long Term Care Ombudsman</p>
<p>Many of these individuals also served on Oklahoma's task force to study and make recommendations regarding the effect of Alzheimer's Disease in our state. This task force, co-chaired by Senator Tom Ivester and Representative David Dank, met over a year and filed a final report which can be found here: <a href="http://www.oksenate.gov/publications/issue_papers/health_social_services/effect_of_alzheimers_task_force_final_report.pdf">http://www.oksenate.gov/publications/issue_papers/health_social_services/effect_of_alzheimers_task_force_final_report.pdf</a></p>
<p>Our group focused on Goals 2, 3, and 4 of the national draft plan.</p>
<p>General Thoughts:</p>
<p>Our group felt inclusion of the existing aging network is necessary for the success of the national plan. The aging network, through the above listed agencies and programs, already works with family caregivers, documents existing service gaps, and disseminates information statewide. Our statewide ADRC program already works to help families and caregivers to meet current needs and plan for future ones. Our Older Americans Act services specially target those individuals and their families who are facing an Alzheimer's diagnosis through the National Family Caregiver Support Program. Including the aging network would help to optimize existing resources and coordinate implementation of the plan's objectives. Our overarching concern is the aging network and its involvement in the rollout of this plan.</p>
<p>Specific Comments:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>The draft plan references a Research Summit in May 2012 (pg. 7). We were curious if that has been scheduled, who will be participating, what will come out of that summit that could be used and in what way, etc. Likewise, the Federal Interagency Working Group referenced in the plan could be heavily leveraged to support change needed at the state level. Have the members of that group been chosen? What are differences between that group and the to-be-assembled leadership team referenced on pg. 29?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We really liked the references in both plans for 1) veterans 2) private sector. The private sector piece has limitless opportunity. Finally, we think for anything meaningful to happen -- either at the national or state level -- you must see legislative involvement and support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Oklahoma we have recognized the importance of providing case management to inform and coordinate services available to caregivers and their families and would like to see it as a cornerstone of services under this plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oklahoma's Aging Services Division works with the Oklahoma Department of Corrections and would like to see the unique needs of older prisoners addressed: (1) For those who are incarcerated, we would like to see specialized training in dementia information for prison personnel and comparative treatment options and (2) For those who have been released, more "safety net" provisions since these individuals are less likely to have a family/friend support network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We would like the plan to include the following action items under a new Strategy 3.F:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.F</strong>. Provide leadership in understanding legal issues, including legal opportunities and obstacles faced by persons with Alzheimer's Disease, their family members and caregivers. Legal issues of persons with Alzheimer's Disease emerge as the progression of the disease continues. Prompt and early legal intervention, prior to the onset of incapacity, can relieve stress on family members and caregivers who must deal with the consequences of lack of legal planning as capacity continues to diminish. AOA's Legal Services Developers in each state address the development of local legal services and ensure that education is available to inform persons with Alzheimer's Disease, their family members and caregivers about legal options.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3F.1</strong>. Provide information to caregivers and family members regarding legal issues during life of the person with Alzheimer's Disease as capacity diminishes. HHS will prioritize the dissemination of legal information to caregivers and family members regarding legal issues during life of the person with Alzheimer's Disease. HHS will encourage state and local entities to work with local attorneys and legal providers to offer information related to the issues of capacity for decision making along the continuum of the progression of the disease; the uses and abuses of powers of attorney for finances and health care; the execution of advance directives, including living wills, do not resuscitate consent forms and the appointment of health care proxies; the process of legal guardianship that enables caregivers or family members to make decisions regarding the care of the person and/or the finances of the person Alzheimer's disease, and the appropriate use of "least restrictive" means to preserve the dignity of the person with Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.F.2</strong>. Provide information to caregivers and family members regarding legal issues upon the death of the person with Alzheimer's Disease. HHS also recognizes that the need for quality information regarding legal issues upon the death of the person with Alzheimer's Disease is paramount. HHS will work with states to engage local attorneys and legal providers in providing information related to estate planning documents and techniques including the execution of a will and the process of probate that addresses the need to name an executor and beneficiaries; estate planning techniques that may be available in states to avoid probate including living trusts; transfer on death and payable on death documents and deeds; and the use and abuse of joint tenancy as an estate planning tool with finances and real property.</p>

<p>My father is the third person I know to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. First was my uncle who passed away in 2005 and then my aunt or father's sister who, although 6 years younger has had it for over two years now.</p>
<p>The impact of this illness on the family is devastating. There is no one place to go for help or all the information you need. It takes a village to handle an aggressive, geriatric Alzheimer's family member. As a caregiver one needs to find out as much as possible as quickly as possible to get the help needed for a loved one. Nobody tells you all the challenges you will have and the financial impact it has on the family as well.</p>
<p>My father was normally an intelligent man, very good with mathematics, science and spoke English, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. Now we see him unable to handle his finances, becoming increasingly aggressive, suffering from delusions and hallucinations regarding our mother who he has been married to for 62 years.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that a mental healthcare power of attorney was not signed since the lawyers don't mention that when you go to get your will and other papers in order, we had to apply for emergency guardianship to get my father admitted to a level one psychiatric facility. After he is there for three weeks and thoroughly evaluated we are told he cannot come home due to delusions regarding our mother. Now we have to find someplace for him and try to find resources to help us. Unfortunately we end up putting him in a group home which we think is the right thing since it is similar to his home and the advice we get from social workers as well as companies such as Care Patrol, that have familiarity with this illness. Since we have no experience we follow the guidance of these "professionals." Unfortunately in our case perhaps also due to the stressfulness of the situation we did not make the right decision. The home was nice but the caregiver, although a nurse, was not there most of the time, and the other caregivers were Pilipino and did not understand English very well.</p>
<p>The situation gets worse when my brother goes to visit my father and he is in bed at 7:30 since the caregivers don't seem to want to be bothered with the patients. When he arrives my father gets up from bed and falls and the door is locked and the caregivers can't seem to figure out how to get the door opened. My brother finally does and dad is on the floor. The caregivers just leave the area and my brother and his son help my father get back into the bed. My father seems to be in a drug stupor and his eyes roll back in his head. I get a frantic call from my brother and call the hospice since he was on palliative care and ask them to send a nurse immediately since the nurse who owns the group home is not there. I also leave an urgent message for her, which is never returned. I wait and then call for the nurse at the hospice that is on call to find out that she was denied entry into the home by the caregivers who told her he was sleeping and to come back the next day. When I confront the owner of the home the following morning she insists that she called me even though there is no record on my answering machine or caller id on the home or cell phones. Then she also indicates that her mother told her that nobody came to the door from the hospice, which was an outright lie. I immediately started looking for another facility but it was difficult since they are all extremely expensive and my mother is alive and living with physical disabilities at home and all of my father's social security, pension and VA benefits (which I applied for since he was a WWII veteran) have to go in their entirety to his care and we still fall short.</p>
<p>During the time I looked for a facility I asked the group home owner not to transport my father anywhere since there was an issue when we brought him home for lunch prior to that. I had met him at a follow-up appointment with his neurologist and she said we could try to bring him home to see how it went. The first time we tried it he seemed ok but it was after an appointment for a vision test and he refused to get in the car unless we took him home. On that occasion, he managed to get his checkbook which we later found out about since we could not locate it to pay the bills.</p>
<p>The following week he had a dentist appointment due to periodontal disease which we needed to attend to. After that appointment , when we brought him home, he became very agitated and pulled a knife out of a drawer, which usually had only papers(so we can only imagine he had placed it there the week before, since we did not). He sat down and said he was not going back to the group home or as he called it, a jail. Then he said he would kill my husband if he ever saw him again since he was the one who, with my sister, brought him to the hospital. I asked him to return the knife and he took it and put it under some papers behind him. This wasn't a small knife it was a large carving knife. I asked for it back but he refused and then went out back and started cutting plants with it and ended up coming in the house without it. He had hidden it. I sent my sister out to retrieve it and she found it in a bucket outside. I took that knife and the rest that were in the house and put them in the trunk of my car. While I did that he went in the back yard and left from the gate on the side and was halfway down the block on foot. I ran to catch up with him and my sister called the police since we were very concerned and needed to get him back to the group home. When the police came he told them he would go back with us and when they left and we were a few blocks away he lunged over the back seat and grabbed my steering wheel and tried ripping the keys out of my ignition and then grabbed the gear shifter to get the car out of gear. I immediately jammed on the breaks and told my sister, who was sitting next to me, to call 911 and that is when he tried to grab the phone from her. I told him I would go back to the house and proceeded slowly to give the policemen a chance to get there. I went past the house and he became agitated and tried getting out of the car but could not since the child locks were on the doors. Unfortunately I forgot the window locks and he was able to open the window and got his body out up to his hips. I had to stop the car and get his feet back in. This is 5'8" man who weighs 158 lbs. I am only 5'3" and weigh 130. This time four police cars came and the officer ended up having to put my father in his squad car and take him back to the home.</p>
<p>Despite the incident that happened and the fact that the group home owner knew about what happened and was told not to take him out, her husband took my father to the bank a couple of weeks later and the bank rep called my mother and then me since my father was requesting his social security number to take out money.</p>
<p>When I finally found a decent place for my father that specializes in Alzheimer's and dementia care, the group home was very rude and unprofessional with the nurse who came to assess him and asked them in front of my father if they were going to take him to a psychiatric facility. So in addition to all the stress now we had to deal with a group home that was manipulating him so he would not leave. He was also writing them checks, which I got back, but we closed the account to keep anyone from taking advantage of him. He had promised money to them, wrote checks to his attorney who was appointed by the court and was promising thousands to the staff and doctors in the hospital where he was assessed.</p>
<p>On top of everything we ended up getting calls from Elder abuse since the owner of the home was apparently upset that we were taking him out and kept arguing that he wasn't ill despite the medical records from a neurologist and psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Our family has been going through hell. On top of all this there was a tremendous amount of paperwork to get VA benefits, get medications and other medical issues taken care of and the legal expenses for guardianship are bleeding my parent's dry. The emotional impact on our mother and the rest of us has been awful as well.</p>
<p>I tell you all this so you can see what it is like since none of us ever imagined how awful this would be. I don't think anyone knows what it is like until they experience it firsthand.</p>
<p>Waiting until 2025 is too late. In my visits to many facilities I have seen people in their 40's and 50's with the disease and it will only get worse as the baby boomers age. With twice as many of them as their parent's generation we are in for a healthcare meltdown if something isn't put in place soon. We need to do something now. I am sure we are not the only family going through this.</p>
<p>There should be more research into different modalities (allopathic, homeopathic, naturopathic, etc.) to address this illness. I have read that there are studies being done regarding a cancer medication that is on the market that reduces the amyloid plaque in the brain. This is the website: <a href="http://www.case.edu/think/breakingnews/breakthrough.html">http://www.case.edu/think/breakingnews/breakthrough.html</a>.</p>
<p>I have also read about a possible treatment or preventative in raw coconut oil by a doctor who used it on her spouse: <a href="http://www.coconutketones.com/whatifcure.pdf">http://www.coconutketones.com/whatifcure.pdf</a>. Perhaps the cure or prevention lies in a combination of different modalities and all should be considered.</p>
<p>Families need more financial assistance and better resources where they can find all or most of the information needed with respect to legal, medical and assisted living resources as well as support groups to help families get the assistance they need as quickly as possible. Most of what is out there now is just "you are on your own" looking though websites in the midst of a crisis trying to find the help and guidance you need or other families at support groups trying to help each other. When a family is in constant crisis they need as much assistance/guidance as quickly as possible to help them navigate the system of care so they can make the right decisions for their loved one.</p>
<p>I agree with all of the findings but it must also be noted that some co-occurring chronic conditions such as sleep apnea (<a href="http://www.newschief.com/article/20111229/news/112295021">http://www.newschief.com/article/20111229/news/112295021</a>) hearing loss (<a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hearing_loss_and_dementia_linked_in_study">http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hearing_loss_and_dementia_linked_in_study</a>) and periodontal disease (<a href="http://www.breathproblems.com/link-between-periodontal-disease-and-dementia.html">http://www.breathproblems.com/link-between-periodontal-disease-and-dementia.html</a>)should also be included in annual geriatric screenings since they can be directly linked to causing dementia and may be overlooked. In addition something should be put in place regarding hearing loss and the prohibitive cost of hearing aids. Perhaps insurance companies can increase fees by a few dollars a month on their premiums to include some coverage for hearing aids. Everyone is impacted by hearing loss of a senior citizen: family, motorists who drive on the roads along with them, and anyone who the hearing impaired interact with. Since hearing loss can be linked to dementia making hearing aids more affordable through some sort of coverage could help in part, to address this issue.</p>
<p>Anyone directly related to the care of a patient with dementia or Alzheimer's and affiliated with a medical facility, assisted living, or group home should need to be certified to care for a patient with this illness and display that certification where it is visible to family who are looking for care for their family member. There are people who claim to know how to handle patient s with this illness, yet do not, and tend to take advantage of the family as well as the person with the illness.</p>
<p>There should be clear guidelines in place as to what the group homes can and cannot do such as taking a dementia patient to the bank to take out money. I bring this up since this happened with my father.</p>
<p>Medical assessments in the home would help greatly as well since it can be impossible to get a dementia patient to the doctor or hospital unless you have a mental health care power of attorney. If a patient is hospitalized and determined to have dementia, a mental health care power of attorney should automatically be granted without the family having to dish out thousands of dollars to an attorney when the person has received a neurological and psychological evaluation by qualified physicians. This would save the families of these patients thousands of dollars which can be used for their care. A regular health care power of attorney is insufficient since we were told that Alzheimer's and dementia are considered physical illnesses with psychological manifestations. Without a mental health care power of attorney the family has to file for emergency guardianship and then permanent guardianship which can cost upwards of $20,000. This is a progressive disease with no known cure at this point. It is ridiculous to penalize an already suffering family to have to deplete their savings when their loved one is only going to progress in mental deterioration and obviously needs a guardian. Many times they feel that they are not ill and will continue to fight and deplete their funds further until they end up on ACCHHS (Medicaid), which in turn just depletes the government's funds further. If this is a necessity perhaps some cost containment should be put in place so families aren't hurt financially by exorbitant legal fees.</p>
<p>Another issue is medication. The VA indicates it can help with the cost of medication but you have to bring the patient into their facility. Once they are in a memory care facility they are not always amenable to being transported so it would be of great help to have a VA rep come to the patient facility to assess them for the medication benefits or just to have the paperwork from the doctor diagnoses serve as proof that the person needs the medication and provide it and delivery at no cost to the veteran.</p>
<p>The facility that my father is currently in provides dental care via mobile dentistry. It would also be beneficial to have the same with respect to mobile hearing units to help many of the residents in these facilities to get the hearing assessments and hearing aid cleaning, hearing aids, wax removal, etc. to ensure that they can hear effectively. Mobile vision care would also be a plus to ensure that the patients are seeing well or are not developing illnesses of the eye.</p>
<p>Finally decent memory care facilities are very expensive (the one our father is now at costs $4,338/mo.) and that it would help greatly to have some sort of coverage to help as the only thing available is long term care insurance which many people do not have and once you are diagnosed with Alzheimer's, is no longer an option.</p>
<p>I hope you will take these suggestions into consideration in your National Plan. After going through all of this first hand I can tell you that these changes are greatly needed and would help all the families out there who are going through all of these challenges.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

<p>Just wanted to check this through with you. We know we 'informally' presented our National Task Group in Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices' national report and plan to the Council at its meeting on January 17th, but were concerned that perhaps it was not a formal submission and thus may not warrant distribution to the Council and our intent not recognized in official comments submitted to the Council and the NAPA DHHS team.</p>
<p>If that is the case, please accept this submission (with the NTG report attached) as our 'official' submission to the NAPA process. Our cover note accompanying the dissemination of the document is provided below.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help with our effort -- it is much appreciated.</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>National Plan on Dementia and Adults with Intellectual Disabilities</strong></p>
<p>The National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices has issued a plan for improving the community care of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia. "This is an issue that will only grow in intensity and the nation needs to address this challenge head on" said Dr. Seth M. Keller, the President of the American Academy on Developmental Medicine and Dentistry and co-chair of the National Task Group. The Group's report, <em>"'My Thinker's Not Working': A National Strategy for Enabling Adults with Intellectual Disabilities Affected by Dementia to Remain in Their Community and Receive Quality Supports"</em>, summarizes and addresses some of the challenges facing the nation due to the increasing rate of dementia found in older people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>The report offers recommendations for the improvement of services and suggests that its findings and recommendations be considered and integrated into the reports and plans being developed by the federal Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services -- under the National Alzheimer's Project Act. The report notes that Alzheimer's disease mostly impacts adults with lifelong intellectual disabilities in the same ways as it does other people, but sometimes has a more profound effect due to particular risk factors - including genetics, neurological injury, and deprivation.</p>
<p>Dr. Keller said that "families are often the main caregivers for adults with an intellectual disability and when Alzheimer's occurs they are profoundly impacted." Such families not only include parents, but also siblings and other relatives. The report notes that many such families have difficulties in providing extensive care at home once dementia becomes pronounced and care demands overwhelm them.</p>
<p>The report also notes that it is important to recognize signs of dementia-related changes early, and identified an instrument potentially applicable to adults with an intellectual disability. This instrument could also be used for the cognitive assessment provision of the annual wellness visit under the Affordable Care Act. The report recommends adoption of such an instrument by providers and regulatory authorities to identify those adults at-risk due to early signs of mild cognitive impairment or dementia.</p>
<p>Dr. Matthew P. Janicki, of the University of Illinois at Chicago, the other co-chair, said that "generally there is little information on this issue and much needs to be done to make people more aware of it." He noted that the Group recommended an intensified community education effort to enhance the capabilities of staff, clinicians, community providers, and administrators. Further, education is needed to raise awareness of dementia and how it affects adults with an intellectual disability among families and other caregivers.</p>
<p>The report notes that dementia has a devastating impact on all people -- including people with an intellectual disability and their friends, families and the staff who may be involved with them as advocates and caregivers. The National Task Group wants its report to contribute to the work of the federal Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services. Plans are also in place to produce educational materials, develop guidelines for care, and hold training sessions across the country.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>New Study Challenges Accepted Approaches to Research in Senile Dementia (Alzheimer's Disease)<br />
					Published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>NEWS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p>Amsterdam, NL, 7 November 2011 -- Impacting millions of families and devouring billions of dollars globally, Alzheimer's disease is the focus of exhaustive research to find a cure. Although intensely investigated over the last three decades using cutting-edge technologies, the "pathogenic cause" of Alzheimer's disease has not been found. While many research "breakthroughs" have been claimed and high-profile drugs trials carried out, why does the promised "cure" still seem to elude scientists?</p>
<p>In an effort to address this question, Ming Chen, PhD, Huey T. Nguyen, BS, and Darrell R. Sawmiller, PhD, Aging Research Laboratory, R&amp;D Service, Bay Pines VA Healthcare System and University of South Florida, undertook an independent and systematic analysis of the underlying research assumptions against the established scientific principles. This analysis led them to hypothesize that perhaps the main problem is the research community's perception of the disease.</p>
<p>In an article scheduled for publication in the December issue of the <em>Journal of Alzheimer's Disease</em> the authors suggest that when the National Institutes of Health separated out dementia from other senile conditions and redefined it as a distinct and "curable" disease -- Alzheimer's -- in the 1970s, it opened a Pandora's box and may have misdirected research for decades. It triggered the search for pathogenic factors and cures, and disregarded the role of demographic change and its diverse end results in the elderly.</p>
<p>The authors argue that senile disorders -- diseases occurring after age 60 and eventually affecting the majority of the elderly, such as tooth, hearing or memory loss -- are caused by aging, thus differ fundamentally from distinct diseases by origin, study paradigm and intervention strategy.</p>
<p>Moreover, the authors contend that a central regulator in cognition - the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling system - has been misconceived by institutional thinking that favors a "cure" for senile dementia. The dominant hypothesis, although unproven, is that Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels rise throughout the aging process, leading to cell death, and thus research has focused on calcium antagonists to lower those levels. This viewpoint has been promoted by policy makers, and the subject of a number of high profile clinical trials, but to date no positive results have emerged.</p>
<p>In contrast, the authors propose that declining functionality of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling as a result of the aging process, among a myriad of other age-related changes, leads to cognitive decline. Therefore interventions for senile dementia could activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> function by promoting energy metabolism and also by Ca<sup>2+</sup> agonists such as caffeine and nicotine. At the same time, risk factors play a key role. "Aging and Ca<sup>2</sup>+ deficits set the stage for senile dementia, but do not always lead to senile dementia in real life," explains Dr. Chen. "Lifestyles and other risk factors are the key. So we think that senile dementia may be explained by 'advanced aging plus risk factors.' This model points to a new direction for prevention. This means we must support the elderly in healthy lifestyles. And we should develop medications to extend the lifespan of old neurons, rather than looking for ways to inhibit far-fetched 'pathogenic' factors."</p>
<p>"The model implies that senile dementia is, by and large, a lifestyle disease," says Dr. Chen. "This view, in fact, has been shared by many in the medical and clinical community, but contrasts sharply with current dominant theories in the Alzheimer research field, which assume a linear and 'cause and effect' mechanism. Since they have not taken into account the fundamental roles of aging and risk factors, it is clear that these theories, though highly appealing to the public and researchers alike, are of little relevance to the scientific nature of senile dementia."</p>
<p>"The two overwhelming concepts, senile dementia as a distinct disease and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload hypothesis, have effectively blocked any meaningful progress in senile dementia research, and have inhibited the self-correcting mechanism of science," concludes Dr. Chen. "An independent scrutiny on the field may be helpful."</p>
<p>"Although incurable", Dr. Chen is optimistic. "Our research, if guided by correct theories, will produce medications to help delay dementia to a certain extent - similar to the drugs that delay or ameliorate atherosclerosis and osteoporosis today."</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>My name is Bruce Lamb and I am an Alzheimer's researcher and Staff Scientist in the Department of Neuroscience in the Lerner Research Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. I would like to provide comments and suggestions regarding the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease that was released on January 9, 2012.</p>
<p>I think this is a very welcome and important first step in devising a National Plan for combating Alzheimer's, and the goal laid out for developing a treatment/prevention for Alzheimer's disease by the year 2025 is admirable and likely achievable, provided the plan is sufficiently bold and transformative. While I appreciate that the current document is only a Framework for the National Plan, there are several significant issues that I hope you will consider as the details of the plan are developed, in particular as it relates to research investments, strategies, goals and infrastructure (Goal 1).</p>
<p><strong>1) Committing Additional Resources to Research</strong><br />
					The planned NIA sponsored conference in May 2012 will provide invaluable insight into the goals and strategies required to achieve the goal of a treatment/prevention by the year 2025. However, while a reorganization and coordination across all research domains will increase research productivity, without additional research funds, the goals of having a treatment/prevention by 2025 is likely unattainable. There is currently no effective treatment for AD and thus additional funds are necessary to promote basic research, translational research, drug development and clinical research. Currently, funding rates at NIH and most non-profits is in the single digits (5-10% of all grant being funded), thus leaving a very large number of meritorious applications (the top 20-25%) unfunded. If we are truly serious about achieving the goals set forth in the Draft Framework, additional federal, non-profit and industrial investments in Alzheimer's research have to be part of the answer. While there will likely a considerable debate about the exact amount of investment required to achieve this goal, a starting point would likely be $2 billion/year as put forward in the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2010. As clearly laid out in the attached paper by myself, Dr. Todd Golde and Dr. Doug Galasko, similar types of investments in other diseases (i.e., HIV/AIDS) have proven transformative and lead to effective therapies. While I appreciate that the current funding climate is very tight and highly political, it is only with these types of investments are we likely to transform the Alzheimer's research endeavor and achieve Goal 1 of the Framework.</p>
<p><strong>2) Strategies/Goals</strong><br />
					The conference in May of 2012 will certainly help identify the key research areas that need to be addressed to achieve Goal 1 of the Framework. As part of the detailed National Plan, it will be important to both identify these targets as well as commit funding commensurate to achieve the goals identified. Funding one research domain at the expense of another with not enable us to achieve the ultimate goal laid out in the Framework. For each target, clear goals must be identified and a infrastructure/organization (see below) put in place to regularly assess progress within these areas.</p>
<p><strong>3) Infrastructure/Organization</strong><br />
					To achieve Goal 1 of the Framework, it will be absolutely critical to have an infrastructure and organization that can coordinate federal research efforts across all funding agencies, interact with non-profits and industry, promote awareness of the disease and the role that research will play in combating the disease as well as reporting to the Advisory Council directly as outlined in the Framework. In order for this organization/infrastructure to be truly successful and transformative, it will be essential that its efforts are entirely focused on combating Alzheimer's disease. This will provide a uniquely focused organization that will have the most chance of success. A similar "disease-focused" agency was created in 1988 for HIV/AIDS entitled the "Office of AIDS Research" (OAR) within the Office of the NIH Director, that played a key role in successfully coordinating the federal response to AIDS. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 strengthened the OAR, providing it with increased authority in the planning, coordination and evaluation of AIDS research. If we are truly serious about transforming Alzheimer's research and achieving the goals laid out in the Framework, a similar type of organizational structure (perhaps an Office of Alzheimer's Research?) is required.</p>

<p>I was reading about the upcoming legislation regarding Alzheimer's. I am very happy our Government is taking steps to address this upcoming tsunami called Alzheimer's that is going to hit our country. I am not sure where to start? so i will start at the beginning my Mother was diagnosed 11 years ago with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of the journey I am on with her and this disease. She is now in the late stage of the disease she does not know me very much but that's OK. What I learned from my experience was that there was not enough help out there for caregivers and family members of Loved ones with the disease!! The statistics are that 64% of caregivers of Alzheimer's are hospitalized or Die before their loved ones!! That has to change we need to be giving some tools to these people so they can survive the caregiving process. I took three years to go and investigate and learn everything I could so I could take care of my Mom the best I could. In that process i saw the need to educate the people dealing with their loved ones on how to take care of their loved ones while keeping their stress levels down!. I can't state the importance of this. If we could help everyone understand how to do this we would save Money those same people would be healthier staying out of hospitals and keeping the Health Care costs down. I am not sure if this interests you but if it does I have alot more to say about my experiences talking to thousands of people dealing with this disease. I Lead 5 support groups a month for my Church and the Alzheimer's Association locally. I am providing a link to a local article written about me for some background. I would be happy to help in any way I can. <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/care-333943-says-home.html">http://www.ocregister.com/articles/care-333943-says-home.html</a></p>

<p>Enclosed please find the report entitled <em>The Path Ahead: A Framework for a Transformative National Plan to Defeat Alzheimer's Disease</em>. This report provides a series of recommendations developed by Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) around research, clinical care, long-term care and support services, and drug discovery and development for consideration by the Advisory Council as it develops a national strategic plan for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>LEAD was created to bring together stakeholders from all segments of the Alzheimer's-serving community - including government, business, and civic sectors -- to increase attention to and awareness of Alzheimer's disease, its care, treatment, prevention, research, and eventual cure. As you know, the increasing prevalence of this disease and the costs of caring for its victims is creating a grave and growing public health, fiscal and economic concern for our nation. With the goal of changing the trajectory of Alzheimer's disease, LEAD convened representatives from more than 40 organizations to develop strategies and recommendations focused on reducing costs, improving care and preventing Alzheimer's disease. We believe that these recommendations, if implemented, offer our best hope to save millions of American lives and trillions of taxpayer and family dollars in the coming decades otherwise lost to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>LEAD members and participants, including nationally renowned experts representing the full range of voices of the Alzheimer's-serving community, actively supported the passage of NAPA and are now willing to be a resource to the Advisory Council as it moves forward with the development and implementation of a strategic plan. We respectfully submit our recommendations in the attached report for consideration and stand ready to support the Advisory Council efforts as the national plan is developed.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this report, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Sue Peschin, Vice President of Public Policy for the Alzheimer's Foundation of America.

<p>My name is Lane Simonian. I am an historian. Seven years ago when my aunt and cousin were in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease and my mother was in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, I began searching for ways to prevent and treat the disease. As an historian, I began to collect a mass of abstracts and articles in an attempt to tell the story of Alzheimer's disease. At first with a limited background in biology, I made very slow progress in understanding Alzheimer's. Now, though, I can explain almost every new finding in regards to the disease with the attached hypothesis. What used to take me months to figure out now usually only takes a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>The critical finding in regards to Alzheimer's disease was made by Mark Smith and his colleagues in 1997: Peroxynitrite-mediated damage is widespread in Alzheimer's disease. This damage includes the oxidation (loss of electrons and hydrogen) of glucose transport systems, choline transport systems, the enzyme cholineacetyltransferase, g protein-coupled receptors (muscarinic, serotonin, dopamine, olfactory, adrenergic), the nitration of tau proteins, lipid peroxidation, and the influx of calcium. This damage results in a lack of focus and energy, impaired short-term memory due to a shortage of acetylcholine, disturbed sleep and mood, lack of awareness, impaired smell, behavioral problems (in some instances), disrupted neurotransmission, damage to cellular membranes, and neuronal cell death.</p>
<p>The factors that lead to peroxynitriteformation include (but again are not limited to) high glucose levels, high blood pressure, the APOE4 gene, presenilin gene mutations, bisphosphonate osteoporosis drugs, late estrogen replacment therapy, mercury, aluminum fluoride, and stress. Most or all of the factors that lead to peroxynitrite formation also lead to Alzheimer's disease (the connection has not been made as of yet between bisphosphonateosteoporosis drugs and Alzheimer's disease, but the fact that the numbers of cases of Alzheimer's disease has skyrocketed since the introduction of these drugs is perhaps concerning).</p>
<p>Phenolic compounds in various fruits, vegetables, spices, and essential oils and polyunsatured fats inhibit peroxynitrite formation and thus inhibit the development of Alzheimer's disease. The most direct and concentrated way to deliver phenolic compounds to the brain is through aromatherapy with essential oils high in phenoliccompounds.</p>
<p>An impressive number of animal studies, case studies, and clinical trials indicate that Alzheimer's disease can be treated effectively with peroxynitrite scavengers (compounds that are hydrogen donors convert peroxynitrites into a nitrogen dioxide anion and water). These scavengers partially reverse or prevent all of the damage done by peroxynitrites listed above (for example, they add hydrogen back to muscarinicreceptors allowing more choline to enter cells). In the reference section of the attached hypothesis you will find a partial list of peroxynitrite scavengers (most of them are phenolic compounds) which have helped correct cognitive deficits in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. These include rosmarinic acid, grape seed extract, cinnamon extract, eugenol in Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil, and thymol and carvacrolin Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil. In addition, Jimbo and colleagues in Japan were able to improve cognitive function in dementia patients after giving them rosemary and lemon to smell in the morning and lavender and orange to smell in the evening for 28 days. Akhondzadeh and his colleagues achieved similar results using tinctures of sage and lemon balm essential oils for four months. One reviewer looking at this (and perhaps other clinical trials) concluded "excellent results have been obtained with peroxynitrite scavengers, with reversals of Alzheimer's disease in human clinical trials being repeatedly demonstrated."</p>
<p>Several case studies add further validity to the findings from animal studies and clinical trials. Dramatic improvements in alertness and awareness and modest improvements in short-term memory have been noted. In my mother's case she recognizes her home again, feels comfortable around her brother who she used to think was an impostor, sleeps through the night, can recall her name and sometimes spell it, can sometimes remember the order of days and months, can complete phrases such as I scream, you scream, we all scream for...ice cream and April showers...bring May flowers, and is much more alert and aware than she was four years ago before we began aromatherapy.</p>
<p>Essential oils high in methoxyphenols (such as rosemary, sage, thyme, oregano, clove, and cinnamon leaf) and citrus based essential oils appear to work the best. The patient can smell them under each nostril for a few seconds. It takes about a month to begin seeing some improvement (perhaps because it takes time to reverse the damage that peroxynitrtes do to smell).</p>
<p>Let me highlight the critical points:</p>
<ul><li>Peroxynitrite-mediated damage is widespread in Alzheimer's disease and directly or indirectly causes all the features of the disease.</li>
<li>Most or all of the factors that lead to peroxynitrite formation can cause Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Compound which inhibit peroxynitriteformation inhibit the onset of Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>In animal studies, clinical trials, and case studies, peroxynitrite scavengers have lead to improvements in cognitive function.</li>
<li>Phenolic compounds can be used both to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease. In both cases, aromatherapy is likely the most effective way to deliver these compounds to the brain.</li>
<li>This disease can be treated effectively immediately with few side effects.</li>
</ul><p>I wish you good luck in your work. If the opportunity arises, I would like to meet each of you in person. In the meantime, please feel free to contact me. Nothing pleases me more when I receive questions from people interested in my research.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Hypothesis for Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The three factors which increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease are high levels of myo-inositol (a precursor to phosphatidylinostiol 4, 5 biphosphate), increased phospholipase C gamma activity (whose substrate is phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 biphosphate) and the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3/AKT pathway (the PI3 kinase converts phosphatidylinostiol 4,5 biphosphate into phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 triphosphate). Factors which increase myo-inositol levels are high glucose levels (due to the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate into myo-inositol), high blood pressure (due to the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter), and Down syndrome (because people with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome containing the sodium/myo-inositol transporter). Factors which reduce levels of myo-inositol are certain blood pressure medications, certain diabetes medications, estrogen, tamoxifen, lithium, and scyllo-inositol. Factors that increase phospholipase C gamma are glucose, estrogen, and angiotensin II (a cause of high blood pressure). Factors which lower phospholipase C gamma activity are fish oil (and other polyunsaturated fats) and phenols in various fruits, vegetables, spices, and essential oils. Factors that prevent or inhibit the activation of the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway are presenilin gene mutations, APOE4, and bisphosphonate osteoporosis drugs. Insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and drugs which increase high density lipids can to a limited degree stimulate this pathway. These are the main risk factors and preventative measures for Alzheimer's diseas</p>
<p>e Phospholipase C gamma increases the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (via inositol 1, 4, 5 triphosphate) which in turn stimulates Protein Kinase C. Protein Kinase C processes the amyloid precursor protein and a calcium dependent enzyme cleaves this protein to form amyloid plaques. Phospholipase C gamma exports zinc and zinc and copper are entombed in the amyloid plaques. This results in higher levels of homocysteine and a decline in the superoxidase dismutase which converts the superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide. Protein kinase C increases choline uptake (and phospholipase C beta) and phospholipase C gamma increasing the number of plaques created. Homocysteine via Protein Kinase C increases the production of the superoxide anion and inducible nitric oxide. The two combine to form peroxynitrites.</p>
<p>The effects of peroxynitrites are as follows:</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites lower levels of intracellular magnesium which allows more calcium into the cells via the now open gate of the NMDA receptor.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites cause lipid peroxidation (including the final product of lipid peroxidation--HNE)</p>
<p>The combination of peroxynitrites, HNE, and calcium influx leads to neuronal cell death. Peroxynitrites oxidize g-protein coupled receptors and nitrate tyrosine. The result is the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins. Moreover, peroxynitrites nitrate tau proteins preventing them from being reconstituted for proper neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize choline transport systems, muscarinic receptors (a g protein-coupled receptor involved in the uptake of choline), and the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, thus resulting in a critical shortage of acetylcholine which is needed for the retrieval of short-term memories.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize a series of other g-protein coupled receptors including olfactory, serotonin, and dopamine receptors. The results respectively are impaired smell, poor sleep and depression, and lethargy and apathy.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites oxidize glucose transporters resulting in a lack of energy and focus.</p>
<p>Peroxynitrites can be scavenged using phenolic compounds (one or more OH groups). Phenols in essential oils can be breathed directly into the hippocampus via aromatherapy. They accomplish the following conversion (ONOO- + 2H+ + 2 electrons--&gt;NO<sub>2</sub>- + H<sub>2</sub> 0). Essential oils add hydrogen back to g-protein coupled receptors and partially reverse the nitration of tyrosine (including tyrosine residues on tau proteins). They thus partially reverse many if not all of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>I think that the most urgent problem in Alzheimer's research is the need for a soul-searching by policymakers for a correct perception of the disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer research has been misled by hypes and illusions for too long. We believe that the ultimate strategy to delay it and ameliorate its social impact will take two basic approaches. First, motivate society as a whole to supports the elderly for better social connections and healthy lifestyles; and second, develop medications to extend the lifespan of old neurons by activating their lifeline metabolisms, rather than "inhibiting" the farfetched "causal" factors as widely believed today.</p>
<p>Please see our recent article (attached) in which the rationale for this strategy is discussed.</p>
