<p>My name is Dayne DuVall, I'm the Chief Operating Officer of the National Certification Board for Alzheimer Care (NCBAC). For over 11 years, our organization has been at the forefront of setting benchmarks in dementia care for direct care workers and the professionals who train them. We are the only organization that offers dementia care certifications based on the healthcare licensure model.</p>
<p>I want to offer my welcome to the new members of the Council, and thank ALL the members of the Council for their dedication. While much of the attention nationwide is placed on finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease, I want to ask this Council to concentrate on the CARE of people with ADRD and their families. As many of you know, my father died from Alzheimer's disease. It was a 13-year gut-wrenching and tormented journey that devastated our family.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the care of people and their families going through this fatal disease doesn't get enough attention. Compared to research dollars, resources for proper care and support of people with this disease is relatively non-existent. Ask a family what they need most to help their loved one, and their number one concern is NOT finding a cure. In fact, a recent survey conducted by the University of Buffalo found that the #1 concern was money and help to support caregiving, followed by financial aid and other help for long term care and aging in place. Research dollars ranked lower than these concerns. According to the study published by the University, in 2014, "hundreds of millions of federal dollars were spent on science and drug development," but only "$10 million to care, services, and education". The author continues, [That] "represents less than $2 per person for care-related support…Are these the priorities that people and families living with dementia want? Their voices have not been heard over the clamor for research dollars." I know that this Council has advocated for long term support and services (LTSS) in the past, but the families have told us that this is what they need most!</p>
<p>One area that needs more attention on the national and state level is training of the direct care workforce. Dementia education is greatly lacking in most states. I believe federal dollars should be devoted to making sure that everyone who provides care to people with ADRD -- whether they work in skilled nursing facilities, hospice, adult day care, assisted living and ESPECIALLY home care -- should be required to prove their competence in providing care. CMS has highlighted competency training in their proposed regulations for nursing facilities; I am told that they will provide specific guidelines for dementia care.</p>
<p>I know that we all want to see the day when we don't have to have these meetings. However, I think that day is far into the future. I believe that the work that this diverse group of individuals, along with those of us who work daily to advocate for proper care and support for people with Alzheimer's and related disorders AND their families, will help secure more resources from federal, and thereby, state governments to make the lives of these individuals more manageable.</p>
<p>Thanks, again, for your dedication to the fight for the millions of people suffering from ADRD. And, yes, I said, SUFFERING. I know that in certain circles that is not politically correct. However, if you have been through this with a loved one, that is indeed what you, your family, and more importantly, the person who you love experiences. Yes, they LIVE with Alzheimer's, but we all SUFFER the disastrous effects of this disease and we should never forget the physical, financial, and emotional toll it takes on all of us.</p>

<p>HHS 14: Develop a unified curriculum for primary care practitioners to become more knowledgeable about AD and enhance the skills necessary to deliver dementia capable care.</p>
<p>HHS 16: Form a blue ribbon panel of experts on advanced dementia to develop innovations in clinical care practice and quality, including palliative care, for people with advanced dementia.</p>
<p>HHS 18: States should assure that they have robust, dementia capable LTSS systems.</p>
<p>HHS 21: State education and health agencies and others should include key information about AD in all curricula for any profession or career track affecting LTSS.</p>
<p>HHS 22: State, local and private sector organizations should ensure that paraprofessional caregivers in every venue are adequately trained and compensated.</p>
<p>National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners NCCDP / International Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners ICCDP Recommendations:</p>
<p>NCCDP is recommending that the HHS include in the July 19th 2013 meeting of NAPA recommendations;</p>
<p>NCCDP is recommending that Alzheimer's disease and dementia education be provided by a Certified Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Trainer who has completed at minimum 12 hours of dementia education by a national training company who provides training for in-service directors and trainers, a Train the Trainer program that includes but not limited to; dementia / Alzheimer's disease overview, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, medications, behaviors, wandering, hoarding, sexuality, cultural diversity, nutrition, death and dying issues, types of dementia, depression, etc.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that the National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners and International Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners are added to the list of organizations that provide dementia education.</p>
<p>NCCDP is recommending that dementia education be required of all health care professionals and front line staff which includes but not limited to Physicians, Medical Directors, Pharmacists, Consultants, Activity Professionals, Recreation Specialists, Administrators, Assistant Administrators, Occupational Therapists, Physical Therapists, Speech Therapists, Nurses, Nursing Assistants, Personal Care Assistants, Home Health Aides, Dietitians, Social Workers, Clergy, Dietary Workers, Universal Workers, Housekeepers, Maintenance Workers, Security Guards, Bus Drivers, Mental Health Workers, MDS Coordinators, etc., All health care workers and front line staff who are currently working in Hospitals, Nursing Homes, Assisted Living, Adult Day care, CCRC, Hospitals, Home Care Agencies, , Hospice Agencies, Management Companies, Hospitals, Rehab Centers, Memory Centers, Boarding Homes, Adult Foster Homes, Senior Centers, Independent Living, HUD Housing, Shared Housing and any other geriatric setting and that the dementia education at minimum will consists of 12 hours of LIVE dementia education and an additional LIVE 8 hours that includes abuse and neglect and presented LIVE by Certified Alzheimer's disease and Dementia Trainers</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that all new staff (new hires) are required to have this education prior to beginning work or assignments.</p>
<p>NCCDP is recommending that all employees who work in any health care industry such as; associations, aging government office such as the Ombudsman, Office On Aging, State Offices who have Surveyor's, etc., are all required to have a minimum of 12 hours live dementia education at minimum and an additional LIVE 8 hours of education that includes abuse and neglect and presented LIVE by Certified Alzheimer's disease and Dementia Trainers</p>

NCCDP is recommending that the dementia education be taught live by a Certified Alzheimer's disease and Dementia Trainer.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommend mandatory 6 hours minimum of dementia education for all First Responders which includes but not limited to Law Enforcement, EMT's and Fire Fighters because they are often the first professional in the home during a crisis and they need dementia education so they are equipped to respond to a confused or disoriented individual. NCCDP recommends the education is provided by a NCCDP Certified First Responder Dementia Trainer CFRDT.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that the health care professional, front line staff and organization have the ability to select which company, college, trade school or private trainer to provide the Alzheimer's disease and dementia education and no one should be forced to select from a pared down list of a few institutions regardless of the organization private or nonprofit status. The public should make a choice based on the reputation, experience and knowledge of the organization presenting the dementia education.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that HHS put together a comprehensive list of institutions, technical colleges, organizations, consulting companies, private trainers and companies who provide Alzheimer's disease and dementia education and companies should be allowed to add their name to the list of providers with no endorsement from HHS. HHS should not recommend nor endorse one organization, trade school, university, private trainer, etc over another.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that HHS not put any kind of stipulation on a training program nor require that a training program be evidenced based. HHS should recommend what topics a comprehensive curriculum includes.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that ADEAR be expanded to include more information and resources for health care professionals to utilize rather than develop another national repository.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that ADEAR provide a list of USA and international organizations of what they provide and products, resources, learning materials, assessments currently available and includes but not limited to state organizations, institutions, organizations, companies, etc.</p>
<p>NCCDP recommends that no money be put aside for HHS to develop a national Alzheimer's disease and dementia repository when ADEAR already exists.</p>

<p>Thank you for your bold and thoughtful leadership of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. On behalf of the LEAD Coalition and our partners, I am attaching to this message a letter signed by 54 organizations in support of recommendations for your forthcoming 2013 Plan update.</p>
<p>We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the dialogue and to collaborate on implementing all elements of the Plan.</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends you and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services for the first National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease ("the Plan") and all the public and private sector stakeholders collaborating effectively to implement strategies crucial to transformative change for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. LEAD is pleased that a number of priority recommendations previously submitted by the coalition are included in the first Plan and is optimistic that the revised Plan will be even stronger.</p>
<p>LEAD is a diverse and growing coalition of 56 member organizations including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Working collaboratively with LEAD member organizations and other stakeholders across the Alzheimer's-serving continuum, we offer the recommendations below for the revised National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Equally important, we are prepared to work with the Administration, Congress, and all other interested parties to achieve the shared goals articulated in the Plan.</p>
<p>LEAD's recommendations seek to strengthen the goals, strategies, and actions within the Plan. As noted in earlier comments, LEAD believes that some actions can be pursued at no or only low cost but that the topline goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. It is imperative that both Plan work and outcomes are LEAD Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease accomplished with the utmost public transparency and that there is an effective methodology for assessing the impact that strategies within the Plan have on progress toward the timely achievement of stated goals. To that end, LEAD recommends that immediate action be taken to develop a model in 2013 that will allow HHS to assess the impact of the action steps in the Plan and identify areas for course adjustments. We, as a nation, should pursue only implementation steps that clearly are moving toward our goals. In that regard we recommend that each goal and strategy set forth in the final Plan include a budget, clear milestones and quantifiable metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Ian Kremer, LEAD's executive director. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD relied upon three workgroups -- one each in the areas of research and drug development, clinical care, and long-term care support and services -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the entire Alzheimer's-serving community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>

</ul><p><strong>Over-arching Plan Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Adopt all 2013 recommendations from the Advisory Council </em></strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan incorporate all the recommendations adopted by the Advisory Council at its January 2013 meeting.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Until such time as the statute may expand the number of seats on the Advisory Council, invite a person with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder to participate on each Advisory Council subcommittee as on outside expert</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that a mechanism be developed to have at least one person diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and one person diagnosed with a non- Alzheimer's dementing disorder begin actively participating in Advisory Council work no later than the summer of 2013. The public comment process is not an adequate substitute for comprehensive participation. The Advisory Council members and all federal officials involved in developing and implementing the Plan have stated unambiguously and with great integrity that the Plan addresses not only Alzheimer's disease but all dementing disorders; among the most important ways to give life to that commitment is to invite voices from a diverse range of dementing disorders.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 3: <em>Create a formal mechanism for additional federal government agencies to participate in the Advisory Council process</em> </strong></p>
<p>Rightly, HHS is leading the federal effort to develop and implement the Plan; HHS has encouraged and welcomed participation by other federal agencies. LEAD recommends that such participation be more formal, consistent, and robust. While expansion of statutory membership on the Advisory Council is one option worth consideration, LEAD believes that amending the statute is not a necessary prerequisite to convincing other federal agencies to participate voluntarily. At a minimum, the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education, along with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should participate in developing and implementing the Plan alongside colleagues from HHS and the Department of Veterans Affairs who already are engaged. Consider some representative examples: Labor and Education are critical to addressing health care workforce challenges; Hurricane Katrina and super storm Sandy painfully demonstrated the need for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop preparedness strategies for when natural disasters separate people with dementia from their care providers and settings; Alzheimer's disease science rapidly has become a critical issue in global economic competitiveness requiring attention by Commerce; both the Commerce Department and the State Department likely could contribute to HHS efforts to expand collaboration with foreign governments in coordinating existing national plans and potentially developing a global Plan; OPM and OMB need to be at the table to assess the impact on both the federal workforce and the federal budget.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 4: <em>Encourage participation in the Plan process by experts on non-dementing disorders that have a high rate of co-morbidity with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder</em> </strong></p>
<p>The Plan already encourages public-private partnerships (PPPs) and breaking down any tendencies to work in silos. LEAD recommends that the Advisory Council and HHS strongly encourage both formal and informal participation in the process of developing and implementing the Plan by public and private sector stakeholders with expertise in other disorders which have a high rate of comorbidity with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. For example, many people have both Alzheimer's disease and diabetes; while it is not yet clear with there is only a high correlation or a causal relationship, it is clear that it is much more financially costly and physically injurious to have both conditions together than either condition alone. The National Institute on Aging certainly could establish dialogue with other relevant NIH institutes focused on co-morbid conditions while Alzheimer's disease patient advocacy organizations on the Advisory Council could establish similar dialogue with patient advocacy organizations focused on co-morbid conditions to advance implementation of the Plan and develop recommendations for future revisions. Working collaboratively in the public and private sectors should make more effective efforts to reduce or better manage co-morbid conditions and, potentially, accelerate pursuit of scientific interventions to reduce the incidence of such conditions.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 5: <em>Identify and define a role for individuals and family members/family caregivers in each major section of the Plan</em> </strong></p>
<p>Individuals and family members/family caregivers are capable of contributing to memory loss detection, increasing participation in clinical trials, improving clinical care, reducing stigma, and raising public awareness. LEAD recommends that the Plan clearly identify and define ways in which individuals and family members (or their identified family caregivers) can support effective implementation of each major action or strategy within the Plan.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 6: <em>Incorporate throughout the Plan clear and transformative time-based metrics with projected necessary funding levels</em> </strong></p>
<p>It is abundantly clear to LEAD and others across the Alzheimer's-serving community how remarkable the work is that the Advisory Council and federal officials have done in a very compressed time frame. The depth and variety of recommendations and actions developed thus far have been impressive. Policy experts likely are able to unpack how these elements translate to changing real people's real problems. The Plan as a whole needs language that can be much more readily identified by the general public, language that will make clear how the Plan will change their lives. This is particularly needed in the Plan's clinical care and long terms supports goals. In the research goal, the Plan has that language in the form of the 2025 goal. But the complexity of the language and the sort of inside Washington nature of what is proposed in the Advisory Council recommendations and what is already embedded in the Plan's clinical care and long term supports sections, is impenetrable for average citizens who need the Plan to work but who also need to be inspired by the Plan and have their hope sustained or restored by the Plan. There should be aspirational goals across the Plan that are tangible, transformative, and clear. Take the model of the 2025 goal and frame parallel goals in the clinical care and long term supports portions of the Plan. Much of what already exists in those sections of the Plan already point in the direction of what would be aspirational goals but those aspirational goals have not been articulated. The Plan proposes to fix the systems but does not articulate why the systems need to be fixed or what would be achieved as a result of fixing the systems.</p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan adopt time-based goals -- that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other public and private sector agencies could collaborate to implement -- for:</p>
<ul><li>increasing the percentage of people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder who are diagnosed and the diagnosis properly charted in the medical record, informed of the diagnosis, and referred by the diagnosing medical practice to community resources;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of wandering and the rate of injury or death;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of family caregiver depression;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of falls by people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder in home and community based settings as well as in residential care facilities; and</li>
<li>increasing the utilization of hospice and other palliative care services.</li>
</ul><p>LEAD recognizes that most or all of the goals, strategies and action items within the Plan entail significant federal investments designed to reduce over time costs to the public and private health care systems, the economy, and the toll of human suffering. LEAD recommends that the Plan articulate the federal investments needed to achieve the established goals and value of the budgetary, economic and social benefits that are to be accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 7: <em>Commission an independent analysis of the investment value of Alzheimer's disease spending by the federal government</em> </strong></p>
<p>Members of Congress, the Administration and tens of millions of Americans recognize the strategic irrationality and inhumanity of the enormous federal expenditures on care for people with Alzheimer's compared to the relatively miniscule federal investment on research to prevent, treat or cure this devastating disease. But that imbalance persists and worsens year after year in part because the federal government scores federal research spending as a cost rather than an investment. The scoring system therefore ignores not only the future cost-savings to social safety net programs but also the future revenue gains that would accrue from development of new products with a vast global market, increases in workplace productivity, and an expanded workforce. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for an independent body to assess the investment value of the federal government's Alzheimer's disease research funding and provide policy options to correct the current imbalance between federal funding for research and care.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD supports this bold goal, with the hope that it will be achieved more rapidly with the right plan and resource commitment. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has included a number of recommendations submitted by the coalition under Goal 1, including the recommendation for a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on "the most promising pharmacological interventions" as well as accelerating efforts to "identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease." LEAD applauds the increasing emphasis on international coordination and collaboration with commercial and nonprofit partners. However, it is imperative that any goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease must include research investments in non-pharmacological treatments. Nonpharmacological approaches can improve relevant outcomes including improved behavior and delay of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds NIH/NIA for convening the first Research Summit in May of 2012 and for its plans to reconvene every other year around specific research topics of high priority to the field. LEAD recommends that each summit provide explicit strategies and milestones to be met within defined timeframes. Furthermore, LEAD recommends that each summit have a specific session to report milestones and the progress of strategies set at previous summits.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that HHS carryout and begin implementing by the end of 2013 the action plan produced by its intended convening of representatives from across the federal government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to create an action plan for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the building of registries.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions </strong></p>
<p>Strategies to expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease should reference industry's contribution in conducting clinical trials. Strategies should build on the infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new therapeutic targets and therapies--including combination therapies--for trials and their existing working relationships with regulators to ensure that safe and effective treatments get approved. The NIH/NIA 2012 Alzheimer's disease Summit included debate on examining the current conceptual models in studying the disease as well as providing a portion of federal funding for cutting-edge proposals. Non-pharmacologic interventions should also be explored, including community-based interventions and technologies that allow people with dementia to function independently for as long as possible. Strategies should include a statement of what each federal and industry partner can contribute and where the cost and time of the clinical trial process can be reduced consistent with standards of safety and efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression </strong></p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry, and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a large-scale, open-source patient registry of subjects that can be approached for recruitment in prevention trials, including specifically under-represented ethnic and other sub-populations. Consider a broader healthy aging registry, similar to the Framingham study for cardiovascular disease, to follow asymptomatic individuals and those with correlated diseases such as diabetes (the new European Medical Information Framework -- Innovative Medicines Initiative consortium has a similar aim). Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on development of quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector </strong></p>
<p>With the levels of funding now dedicated by government, academia, and industry to Alzheimer's disease research, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of all partners and resources -- and make the best use of the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. There is a need to align government, industry and academic sponsored studies to achieve consensus on defined recommendations for advancing new drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. A precedent exists in other disease areas (e.g. STAIR recommendations for stroke). Current public-private partnerships in the Alzheimer's disease arena have not yet owned this opportunity to date. Funding would catalyze such progress. Research should be a community-wide effort for public private collaboration and HHS should consider asking the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to help coordinate this effort with them.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.1: Pursue ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments </strong></p>
<p>There are many important -- albeit underfunded -- strategies being pursued to speed treatments to patients such as disease modeling, drug repurposing, better target identification, and strategies for combination therapy. However, a major issues remains with respect to the lack of a centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB). LEAD recommends that this Action include expanded public and private support for a uniform patient consent and centralized IRB to review all multi-center Alzheimer's disease trials to decrease the time for trial start-up and protocol amendments.</p>
<p>The National Biomedical Research Ethics Council (NBREC) has been incorporated as a "neutral" home to develop a National IRB for Neurodegenerative Diseases (NIRB-ND). The NIRB-ND will closely follow the Central IRB model pioneered successfully by the National Cancer Institute, and it will be managed by a Steering Committee composed of representatives from the sponsoring organizations/foundations.</p>
<p>Given the proposed changes to the "Common Rule" on the topic of centralized IRBs (cIRBs) and the National Institutes of Health's growing interest in cIRBs, this effort will provide an innovative solution to a problem shared by many constituencies interested in therapy development. The NBREC approach features the establishment of a successful public-private partnership business model. The NIRB-ND will guarantee the protection of study volunteers, reduce needless delays in large clinical trials, decrease costs and reduce risks associated with studies. The project is exploring options for expanding reviews to include Canada and eventually countries within the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings </strong></p>
<p>There is an exponential growth in the number of public and private partnerships (PPPs) in the Alzheimer's disease arena, which is simultaneous with a concern of consortia fatigue. The sense of urgency exists to address improved understanding of the scope of activities (in scope and out of scope) for the numerous PPPs, and specifically how alignment is taking place to avoid duplication of effort. Positive examples exist of synergistic alliances between ACT-AD, C-Path and CAMD, ADNIPPSB/Alzheimer's Association, and the Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease. Defining specified resources aimed at facilitating coordinating PPPs is an unmet and urgent need. Leadership from ASPE is crucial and should be made a priority.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan include a process for developing standardized informed consent to allow participants in clinical trials to authorize their deidentified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study in order to advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. LEAD recommends pooling of individual de-identified data into larger Alzheimer's disease databases -- globally available to qualified researchers -- to allow data mining and to increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, HIPPA, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Implement Alzheimer's disease specific data standards to ensure a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data</em> </strong></p>
<p>The Plan should encourage all new and ongoing federally funded and industrysponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease specific data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Using these standards will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA and EMA. Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data, including data in failed trials, data with respect to dormant drugs, and data rich in biomarker information, should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's disease CDISC data standards and any federally funded and industry sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use. Given the FDA's preference and future requirement for submission of clinical data in CDISC unified clinical data standards, it is recommended that data be collected for current and future clinical trials in CDISC format using the AD CDISC therapeutic area specific standards. Lack of action on this recommendation will slow the time for regulatory drug review of any new therapeutic candidate.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Plan includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. The Plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis, and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans requiring care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings.</p>
<p>As the Plan has evolved from the Alzheimer's Disease Study Group (ASG), to the Advisory Council and the first Plan, we have not adequately motivated the Plan with a clear vision of what clinical care should look like in the United States. The comprehensive effort to date has been laudable and has advanced the country's goals with respect to research. But research advances will not have the impact that they should unless we begin with an equally broad and forwardlooking conceptualization of clinical care.</p>
<p>ASG recommendations related to clinical care in 2009 were limited to a focus on measurements of quality, making paid caregiving available, and educating the public about the disease. There was an implicit assumption that medical care is already uniform, executed consistently and well in diverse settings, and that it encompasses the public need. In 2011, LEAD recommended that the Plan include development of a workforce to diagnose and care for people with memory disorders; improve models for reimbursement that incentivize practitioners to diagnose early and treat persistently; support pilot and demonstration projects to improve the care that is available; develop innovative new models for care; improvement of emergency care for people with dementia; and establishment of a network of geographically accessible memory disorders centers to serve as translational sites to advance the medicine around prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of AD and related conditions. The first Plan was very strong on collaborations among agencies, advancement of neuroimaging and biological markers to aid in early diagnosis and drug development, educating the workforce and disseminating existing guidelines (albeit limited and out of date), as well as educating the public. It also mentioned the need to strengthen direct care, without describing the deficiencies; the need to survey unmet needs; to develop cost-effective models of care; to improve minority care; to protect the vulnerable; and to assess the housing needs of people with dementia. These listings may be perceived as somewhat piecemeal and secondary by people at risk for and living with memory disorders, their families, and healthcare workers.</p>
<p>Clinical care should encompass detection of risk factors, management of risk factors, early diagnosis and lifelong management, regardless of social differences, medical co-morbidities, and physical location. Citizens should be able to count on comparable approaches regardless of where they live or how they fund their healthcare. New advances in research related to risk, diagnosis, and treatment should translate easily into clinical settings, so that willing patients can help to prove or disprove their utility. And clinicians who choose to promote brain health and provide care to people with memory disorders across the stages of their lives should be able to do so without bankrupting their practices. Without some effort to develop a national, clinical focus on specialized prevention and care approaches, there will be no true expertise--and the greatest advances to date are at risk of being irrelevant because there is no coherent approach to ensuring that they shape practices in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 2 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties </strong></p>
<p>The Plan recognizes both the worsening shortage in the geriatric specialty workforce and the dire consequences that the shortage causes for the growing population of people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. LEAD recommends that the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) support training projects that provide fellowships for individuals studying to be geriatric social workers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.6: Support state and local Alzheimer's strategies </strong></p>
<p>The Plan recognizes that many states and local communities have developed dementia strategies and action plans. The Advisory Council repeatedly has discussed opportunities for the national Plan and these state or local plans to share and reinforce best practices. LEAD recommends that HHS and the Department of Labor collaboratively develop best practices for direct-care workforce development, recruitment, and retention tailored to each provider setting in the Alzheimer's disease care continuum including: home health, adult day, assisted living, skilled nursing, and hospice.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Address inconsistencies across geographic areas and subspecialties, and from provider to provider</em> </strong></p>
<p>Clinical approaches to risk management, diagnosis, and treatment are inconsistent across geographical areas and subspecialties, and also vary from care provider to care provider. Existing education of physicians regarding dementia and related disorders is also quite limited, despite the fact that the Medicare Trust Fund spends over $9 billion annually to subsidize Graduate Medical Education. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for conducting a nationwide assessment of available expertise by region of the country including expert clinicians in all relevant specialties (family practice, general internal medicine, geriatrics, neurology, psychology, psychiatry, and social work), paid caregivers, day centers, overnight respite care, and long term care options. This should include examination of current practices for risk factor management, diagnosis, longitudinal outpatient management, emergency management, and long term residential care in each area. Additionally, all residency programs should be assessed for the amount of education and training focused on dementia and related disorders.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Update reimbursement formulas to encourage brain health risk management, early diagnosis of memory disorders, persistent and multi-disciplinary treatment, and uniform levels of treatment across care settings</em> </strong></p>
<p>The current reimbursement system discourages brain health related risk management, early diagnosis of memory disorders, persistent treatment, multidisciplinary treatment, and uniform levels of treatment regardless of care setting. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for an analysis (to be completed by the end of 2013) of the actual costs and reimbursements for laboratory services and patient visits for risk factor management, diagnosis, and longitudinal outpatient management, and for diagnosis and management within long term care settings. The analysis should benchmark successful programs and practices. LEAD also recommends that the Plan call for HHS to propose (by the summer of 2014) options to correct the reimbursement formulas as needed to optimize these efforts; funding for demonstration projects for models of care across the spectrum of disease; and funding for demonstration projects to assess the impact of dementia specific medical homes. For example, reimbursement levels might be tied to whether nationally certified dementia specific services were provided.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 3: <em>Address inadequate emergency and acute hospital care for people with memory disorders, especially those with dementia</em> </strong></p>
<p>Inadequate emergency and acute hospital care imposes staggering costs on the physical and emotional well being of patients, families, and medical personnel. The economic costs to patients, providers, public and private insurers are unsustainable. The horror stories are well known, more typical than anecdotal, and all too true. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for HHS to complete (by the end of 2013) a nationwide assessment of the available inpatient and outpatient emergency care for dementia patients with acute agitation or psychosis and the quality of inpatient care for people with memory disorders hospitalized for non-dementia related conditions. LEAD further recommends that the Plan call for HHS to propose (by the summer of 2014) methods to incentivize hospitals and psychiatrists to handle dementia related emergencies and standards for emergency care for people with dementia. For example, HHS could consider proposing standards for geriatric psychiatry units, which currently are not required to have a psychiatrist or even a geriatrician.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 4: <em>Establish a network of geographically dispersed and accessible memory disorders centers, linked to sites providing integrated research and patient care, to facilitate translational medicine, and to continuously develop and improve the standard of care</em> </strong></p>
<p>Access to quality care -- and the application of medical practice to transformative research -- all too frequently is compromised by geographical happenstance. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for provision of supplemental funding to the centers for infrastructure and reporting, and ensure adequate reimbursement within the centers to support clinical infrastructure. Additionally, LEAD recommends that the Plan establish a target date of 2017 for HHS to develop a comprehensive national public health strategy for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders which includes for all Americans regardless of age or care setting early assessment of risk factors, advice about risk mitigation, access to diagnosis and disease management.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds the Plan for including goals and strategies that will improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that the Plan includes recommendations from LEAD to expand proven programs that are in place at the federal, state and local levels that provide adequate care and support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families. Moving forward it is important that the Plan provide adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 3 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials </strong></p>
<p>Stigma has diverse cultural bases and forms of expression. Reducing stigma and its consequences requires culturally appropriate interventions. LEAD recommends that stigma be identified as a specific criteria when implementing Actions 3.A.1, 3.A.2, and 2.A.3.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations </strong></p>
<p>The Plan calls for HHS to "partner with private organizations to convene a meeting of leading scientists and practitioners to review the state of the art of research and translational activities related to evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations." LEAD recommends that the Plan now call for such a meeting to be an annual occurrence.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>LEAD supports this Plan action and recommends that it be expanded to include education for court personnel, financial planners, and first responders. A number of states and local communities have extensive and evidence-based experience partnering with private organizations such as the Alzheimer's Association in educating first responders and court personnel (some have worked with financial planners) to better meet the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders and of family caregivers. At a minimum, HHS and the Department of Justice could serve as a clearinghouse for best practices in educating legal, financial, and emergency services professionals.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan call for development of training standards, for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, by government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include home care, adult day care, assisted living, and nursing home. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes among providers, family caregivers, other advocates, and people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2: <em>Develop best practices to help family caregivers remain productive in the workplace</em> </strong></p>
<p>Many family caregivers want or need to remain in the workforce but face substantial challenges that could be addressed successfully with workplace policies designed for elder care and based on the accommodations begun more than a generation ago for working parents. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for development of best practices to help family caregivers remain productive in the workplace. Best practices may include flextime; work-at-home options; jobsharing; counseling; dependent care accounts; information and referral to community services; and employer-paid services of a care manager.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3: <em>Assess the impact on and develop best practices for supporting children who are family caregivers</em> </strong></p>
<p>At the local, state, and federal levels, enormous investments are committed to advancing the academic and personal success of children. Increasingly, there is widespread -- perhaps universal -- realization that the efficacy of such investments can be enhanced or diminished by students' home environment. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for HHS and the Department of Education to collaboratively examine the consequences of Alzheimer's disease family caregiving on the academic achievement, and social-emotional well being of children and develop best practices for schools to support the needs of these students.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>In reading number 6 we wanted to add our comments. We have four recommendations:</p>
<p>Our first recommendation is that the committee should be aware of which states are requiring dementia education and how many hours are required. The regulations are different in every state and for each industry, such as Adult Day Care, Hospice, Home Care, Nursing Homes, Assisted Living, Hospitals, Rehab Centers, Psychiatric Facilities and Locked Dementia Units. Some states require more dementia education such as 20 hours and other states and depending on which industry require less dementia education while others do not have a specific number of hours. Some states may require more than 10 hours of dementia education. So at minimum before your recommendation is passed, you should be aware of what each state is requiring for dementia education and for each industry. At minimum the national standard should be more than 10 hours. We are recommending at minimum 12 hours of Live dementia education for all front line staff and health care professionals.</p>
<p>We recommend live training by a certified Alzheimer's and dementia trainer. In some states the education is permitted per the state regulation via Weimar and video training. We stand against this way of initial Alzheimer's and dementia training because you can not be sure that the person attending the Webinar or video training is in fact that person. Nor can you insure when the material is presented by Webinar or video training that the employee understood the material. "Live Training" is critical in preventing abuse and neglect of our most vulnerable elders by the front line staff and health care professional.</p>
<p>In addition, we recommend ongoing training through out the year to keep the staff up to date on regulatory changes and new advances in all aspects of care. Each year for NCCDP Alzheimer's and dementia Staff Education Week February 14 to 21 and we provide free staff in-services for educators to download from our site which includes the power point, hand outs, pre tests and post tests. This is a free services and is available from November till May. We add many new topics every year. Your recommendations should let the public know of this free service.</p>
<p>Secondly, the wording you have for the education piece is "reliable source". We feel it should be spelled out to specifically state, universities, associations,nationally recognized companies and nationally recognized organizations. such as the National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioner's, National Alzheimer's Association, National Alzheimer's Foundation, Office on Aging, etc. The public should be aware by your office of all of the organizations and companies providing dementia education and not just a select few who are serving on your committee. The institution than can make a choice as to which organization to use for staff training.</p>
<p>Our third recommendation should be that the words "Paraprofessional Caregiver" come out and replace with all Health Care Professionals and Front line staff including Nursing Assistants, Home Health Aides, Personal Care Assistants, Activity and TR professionals, Nurses, Social Workers, Dietary Workers, PT, OT, Speech, Housekeeping, Bus Drivers, Administrators, Assistant Administrators, Pharmacists, Physicians and all other staff who interact with the patient. We feel this needs to be very detailed and specific and not in any way target one specific profession as all professions who interact with the geriatric patient be included in the Alzheimer's and dementia training.</p>
<p>Our fourth recommendation is that Alzheimer's and dementia education be mandated in all colleges, universities, trade schools that provide a medical profession trade or certification or license for any health care related profession regardless if they are entering the geriatric field.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Thank you for inviting the New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA), to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." As Acting Director of NYSOFA, the New York State Unit on Aging, I would like to offer for consideration our recommendations to the Draft Framework for the National Plan. These amendments would seek to enhance the role of the aging network in helping to achieve the goals and objectives of the National Plan.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) identifies the urgent need for a national plan to systematically tackle and conquer this fatal illness and scientific research, is the key to finding a cure. NYSOFA supports the efforts of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services which includes, David Hoffman from the New York State Department of Health.</p>
<p>NYSOFA is a member of the New York State Coordinating Council for Services Related to Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias, established in 2007, and actively participates in subcommittee activities. In 2011, NYSOFA was awarded a three year Systems Integration Grant from the Administration on Aging (AoA) that provided funding for developing and integrating into service systems, dementia capability - this included care transitions and evidence-based direct services to persons with dementia and their caregivers. In addition, NYSOFA was a recipient of other AoA grants, including Lifespan Respite.</p>
<p>New York State is committed to providing the best possible dementia capable services throughout our aging network. New York will continue efforts to identify best practices and evidence-based interventions that produce positive outcomes impacted by the disease and their caregivers. A recent snapshot of all of NYSOFA's programs/ and services in December 2011, revealed that a significant percentage of the 59 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) were serving persons living with cognitive impairments related to dementia.</p>
<p>Of all of NYSOFA's community-based services and supports, social adult day services programs are uniquely suited to providing care and support to individuals with dementia and their caregivers. In these programs, 65 percent of participants have some form of dementia. The average year of age is 83 of a program participant, who requires hands on assistance with at least two activities of daily living (ADLs). They can remain living in their communities by attending an adult day care center for an average of two years following enrollment in the program. This is one example of a service provided by the aging network that persons with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers rely on.</p>
<p>For the person with Alzheimer's that lives alone or who does not have a caregiver, the friendly home delivered meal volunteer may be the only daily social interaction they may experience. As noted in the Alzheimer's Association <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em> report, one in seven persons with this disease lives alone. The case manager who coordinates services for these individuals often identifies signs or symptoms of illness and communicates with health care providers when they emerge. The aging network plays a significant role in providing community-based services and caregiver supports, which routinely interact with clinicians and health care providers. Considering the demographic shift of the next 30 years, it is vital that the aging network be recognized in the plan and that the plan demonstrates an integration of the health care and aging networks.</p>
<p>Please consider NYSOFA's recommendations for inclusion in the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease:</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>The Aging Network, as noted below in the following statements, should be identified specifically in the following key provisions of the draft plan. </strong></p>
<p>This is imperative as the aging network is much more than a support system and is better described as a service system of public and private entities that provide a wide range of services targeted to older adults and their caregivers. Many of the direct services, such as Chronic Disease Self-Management Programs and Adult Day Services are "active treatments" for the participants. Please consider including references to the Aging Network in the following statements:</p>
<p>Page 5: Framework and Guiding Principles -- insert:</p>
<p>"Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers receive assistance from both the clinical healthcare system and support systems, such as long-term care, home care, legal services, aging and other social services. Both the clinical care and support environments need better tools to serve people with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers. Ongoing and future research seeks to identify evidence-based interventions to assist clinicians, persons with Alzheimer's and their caregivers."</p>
<p>Page 11: Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs --insert:</p>
<p>"Additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, the pharmaceutical industry, and public health and aging systems quickly and accurately."</p>
<p>Page 13: Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care- insert</p>
<p>"The workforce that serves people with Alzheimer's Disease is diverse and complex. It includes professionals in the aging services network and the licensed health care field - such as primary care physicians; specialists such as neurologists, geriatricians, and psychiatrists; registered nurses and advanced practice nurses; community health workers; social workers; psychologists; pharmacists; dentists; allied health professionals; and direct-care workers like home health aides and certified nursing assistants and, also those who provide consumer directed or informal supports."</p>
<p>Page 17: Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings-insert</p>
<p>"These guidelines should be tailored to the stages of the disease and cover the myriad of care settings in which care is delivered, such as in the home, congregate aging service settings, physician offices, and long-term care facilities."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The aging network relies on non-pharmaceutical evidence based research to continue generating support for service delivery models used to provide care to persons with dementia and their caregivers</strong>. The aging network needs clinical trials to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the most promising non-pharmaceutical evidence-based interventions.</p>
<p>Page 10: Action 1.B 6: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising lifestyle interventions- insert:</p>
<p>"HHS and its federal partners will continue to conduct evidence based clinical trials to test the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions and risk factor reduction in the prevention of Alzheimer's Disease."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The aging network serves as the foundation on which the Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) is being built to serve as a primary source of information and assistance to persons in need of long term care supports and services. </strong></p>
<p>Action 2.A. 1: Educate Health Care Providers: insert:</p>
<p>"Health care providers will learn how to manage the disease in the context of other health care conditions, and about the role of the ADRC in linking people to support services in the community".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In general, persons with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers prefer to receive community-based long term services and supports as compared to nursing home placements</strong>. Community-based AD care should be routinely referred to in the plan.</p>
<p>Page 15: Action 2. A. 4: Strengthening the direct-care workforce -insert:</p>
<p>"HHS will strengthen the nursing home, aging services and long-term services and supports direct-care workforce through new training focused on high-quality, person-centered care for people with Alzheimer's Disease."</p>
<p>Page 17: Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings-insert:</p>
<p>"These guidelines should be tailored to the stages of the disease and cover the myriad of care settings in which care is delivered, such as in the home, aging service settings, physicians' offices, and long-term care facilities. These guidelines should also take into account how care might be modified for diverse populations and in the context of co-occurring chronic conditions in people with Alzheimer's."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The following should be added into Strategy 2. D. on page 17 as an additional action item. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Adult Day Services implementing evidence-based interventions should be acknowledged as an active treatment for persons with Alzheimer's Disease</strong>. There is a substantial need for increased access to dementia capable day centers and in the understanding about the effectiveness of this model by primary care physicians. This undertaking can be enhanced through additional evidence based research on this mode of care. In addition, Medicare should be expanded to reimburse for adult day services for individuals with dementia.</p>
<p>Although this process is challenging, NYOSFA is confident that the final adopted National Plan will increase positive outcomes for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers, as well as, identifying promising treatments for this ailment. On behalf of NYSOFA, I want to express our appreciation for the consideration of these recommendations.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Inter-Agency Working Group of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for developing a solid first draft of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, a draft that includes goals and actions dealing with the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. LEAD is pleased that a number of priority recommendations previously submitted by the coalition are included in the draft plan.</p>
<p>Organizations from all segments of the Alzheimer's-serving community participated in developing these comments, including non-profits and for-profits, research-oriented and care-oriented, academic and advocacy, among others. LEAD believes strongly that achievement of the goals of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025 and improving the quality of care and of life of Alzheimer's victims and their families will require an National Alzheimer's Team using an 'all hands on deck' approach. LEAD and its participating organizations are prepared to step up as a full member of that Team.</p>
<p>Attached please find LEAD's comments on the first draft of the National Plan. We have organized our comments in the categories of research and drug discovery, clinical care, and long-term care support and services. We hope the Secretary will give strong consideration to including these recommendations in the final National Plan.</p>
<p>Comments provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals, strategies, and actions within the draft plan. As noted in earlier comments, LEAD believes that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private, and non-profit sectors. It is imperative that the actions within the national plan be monitored and tracked to assess the impact of the action steps as well as progress toward the Plan's goals. While we are pleased that HHS will evaluate the data and infrastructure required for implementation of the plan, it is important that there is a model for assessing the impact that strategies within the national plan have on progress toward the desired goals. To that end, LEAD recommends that immediate action be taken to develop a model this year that will allow HHS to accurately assess the impact of the action steps in the national plan and identify areas for course adjustments. We, as a nation, should not pursue implementation steps that are not clearly moving toward our goals. We cannot waste time and resources going down blind alleys. In that regard we recommend that each goal and strategy set forth in the final national plan include a budget, clear milestones and quantifiable metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>LEAD members have also identified a set of other actions within the draft plan that should be implemented immediately, without the need for a national plan. These include activities that are already being undertaken or that leverage current resources and materials. Many of these actions are critical to the success of implementing long-term goals and strategies. Specifically they include disseminating existing tools and guidelines to help healthcare professionals diagnose and care for people with Alzheimer's and their families, as well as expansion of successful interventions that are already proven to improve quality of life for people with Alzheimer's. These actions are highlighted at the end of each section of comments.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established three workgroups -- one each in the areas of research and drug development, clinical care and long-term care support and services -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the entire Alzheimer's-serving community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD fully supports this bold goal, with the hope that the goal can be achieved even more rapidly with the right plan and resource commitment. And LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has included a number of recommendations submitted by the coalition under Goal 1. Specifically we are pleased that the Advisory Council recommends a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on "the most promising pharmacological interventions" as well as accelerating efforts to "identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease." In addition, we are pleased that there is greater emphasis on international coordination and collaboration with commercial and nonprofit partners. However, it is imperative that any goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease include research investments in non-pharmacological treatments. Non-pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer's treatment can improve relevant outcomes including improved behavior and delay of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's comments and recommendations for Goal 1 of the draft National Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong><br />
					Strategies to expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease should reference the very significant contribution that will be made by industry in conducting clinical trials. Strategies should build on the infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new agents for trials and their existing working relationships with regulators to ensure that safe and effective medicines get approved. Strategies should include a statement of what each Federal and industry partner can contribute and where the cost and time of the clinical trial process can be reduced consistent with standards of safety and efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong><br />
					To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry, and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a large-scale, open-source patient registry of subjects that can be approached for recruitment in prevention trials, including specifically under-represented ethnic and other sub-populations. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong><br />
					With the levels of funding now dedicated by government, academia, and industry to Alzheimer's disease research, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of all partners and resources -- and make the best use of the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. Studies need to be adequately powered, with agents that effectively test mechanisms of action, produce clear evidence of brain target engagement, and really help to advance the state of knowledge. Private industry is ready to support the 2025 goal and should be engaged as a full and equal partner with government and the research community in its achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include consideration of a uniform patient consent and centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB) to review all multi-center Alzheimer's disease trials to decrease the time for trial start-up and protocol amendments.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong><br />
					Public-Private Partnerships provide an opportunity to overcome many of the challenges associated with taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Many Public Private Partnerships exist around Alzheimer's disease and have helped to overcome barriers to research and drug development. Such partnerships include: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Coalition Against Major Diseases, FNIH Biomarkers Consortium and the Alliance for Aging Research's ACT-AD Coalition.</p>
<p>LEAD recommends increased support for these partnerships as they seek to establish publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification. Further as additional data gaps are identified, pre-competitive partnership collaborations can accelerate the pathway toward development of Alzheimer's disease modifying therapies.</p>
<p>New models of Public-Private Partnership cooperation and funding are needed, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations, collaborative platforms, and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such Alzheimer's partnerships could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because these partnerships rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided through multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation</em></strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the final plan includes a process for developing a standardized informed consent to allow participants in clinical trials to authorize their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study in order to advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger Alzheimer's disease databases to allow data mining and to increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, HIPPA, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop data standards to ensure a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data</em>.</strong><br />
					The National Plan should encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Using these standards will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA and EMA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data, including data in failed trials, data with respect to dormant drugs, and data rich in biomarker information, should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that all findings from the May research summit be shared with the public for comment and that "strategies and milestones for an ambitious plan to slow progression, delay onset, and prevent Alzheimer's disease" be established within six months of the summit to ensure continued momentum and coordination with the National Plan. LEAD recommends that continuing research summits be conducted every other year in order to monitor progress and adjust priorities in light of funding conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.2: Solicit public and private input on Alzheimer's disease research priorities</strong><br />
					The NIA should issue an RFI within six months of the summit as noted above and information be captured and evaluated and considered as the NIA develops priorities for future years.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene representatives from across the federal government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to create an action plan for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the building of registries.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft plan includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis, and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the draft plan will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans requiring care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are comments from LEAD regarding the draft plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong><br />
					Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides, and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in public and private hospital settings. Additionally, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>In addition to educating healthcare providers, LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this action be combined with Action 2.D.1 "Explore dementia care guidelines and measures." Both recommendations require input from experts to develop dementia-specific guidelines for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong><br />
					LEAD applauds the efforts to strengthen state aging workforces that are "capable and culturally competent" through the Administration on Aging (AOA). While implementing this action, it is important that efforts to improve state strategies do not further burden states' abilities to apply for and utilize funds from AoA. States should maintain flexibility to implement strategies that address the unique needs of the state populations through their state infrastructures.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated about palliative and hospice care by healthcare professionals. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</strong><br />
					The Advisory Council should consider merging Action2.D.1 with Action 2.A.3, which calls for the dissemination of "dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum." Both Actions require the convening of an expert panel to develop dementia care guidelines for care providers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong><br />
					To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the draft Plan should consider the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such centers would also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure people with Alzheimer's disease and their families have access to new Alzheimer's therapies</em></strong><br />
					As biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented. This will be particularly important as CMS improves upon the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of Medicare. Due to the absence of any current spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, ACO's may be "penalized" for providing a new treatment to patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse those new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Primary Care Doctors, Geriatricians, Geriatric Psychiatrists and Neurologists should be adequately reimbursed for patient care and the evaluation of cognitive function including psychometrics and caregiver education and counseling</em></strong>.<br />
					Unless doctors are appropriately reimbursed, the complex needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease will not be addressed. Anticipatory care planning and comprehensive treatment management in a setting where transitions and treatable concomitants of Alzheimer's disease are understood will result in better care. Such practices may delay the onset and progression of disabling clinical symptoms, and allow meaningful function, reduce healthcare costs, and improve the quality of life for individuals with the disease and their family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Develop Quality Care Measures for People with Alzheimer's and their Family</em></strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop Alzheimer's disease specific quality care measures. Information on these measures should be captured through the use of Health IT tools to track care quality and outcomes.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a panel of experts to develop guidelines that can be provided to provider groups.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</strong><br />
					Similar to Action 2.A.3 HHS should quickly convene a panel of experts to develop consensus for appropriate assessment tools and identify strategies for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong><br />
					HHS should compile an inventory of tools to assist caregivers from federal and state agencies as well as patient advocacy organizations and make these tools readily available within the next year through the state aging networks.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong><br />
					HHS should convene stakeholders to develop guidelines for hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's and disseminate guidelines through national associations and hospital systems.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds the draft plan for including goals and strategies that will improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that the plan includes recommendations from LEAD to expand proven programs that are in place at the federal, state and local levels that provide adequate care and support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families. Moving forward it is important that the plan provide adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.3: Utilize informatics for caregivers and persons with AD</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the word "informatics" in the title of this Action be changed to "Health IT" to be consistent with the accompanying language. Identifying and capturing information about caregivers, in particular family caregivers, by health IT applications will help to better coordinate care of both the person with Alzheimer's or other dementias and the caregiver. Capturing information about the health of family caregivers on medical records has an added benefit of supplying data for metrics that can be used to track the impact of programs on both family caregivers and their care recipients. Data would allow for the comparison of patients with and without family caregivers as well as track health impacts on family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include identifying interventions that are successful in improving the health and wellness of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Many successful evidence based programs have been proven to work for both people with Alzheimer's and other dementias so it is important that the evaluation of such programs is not limited to only Alzheimer's specific interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that this Action include the evaluation of innovative interventions aimed at helping people with Alzheimer's and other dementias remain in the community rather than in long term care or other institutional settings.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Ensure adequate resources for programs and services supported by AoA's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP)</em></strong><br />
					ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve Goal 3 in the Draft Plan, funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families at the community level.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Include services for mental and behavioral health services</em></strong><br />
					Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of needed health services available to individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with these individuals, their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of effective behavioral and mental health interventions.</p>
<p><em>Actions to be implemented immediately</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.1: Identify culturally sensitive materials and training</strong><br />
					Within the year HHS should convene an expert panel to develop an inventory of culturally sensitive materials and trainings available and identify gaps that should be filled by government and patient advocacy organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong><br />
					Utilizing its current inventory of federal agency programs and materials, HHS should make these resources readily available to all caregivers through the state aging programs.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations</strong><br />
					HHS should convene a meeting of partner organizations to identify successful evidence based interventions by community based organizations and quickly work to ensure that more people with Alzheimer's and their families have access to successful programs as identified in Action 3.B.4. There are already programs exist that LEAD recommends that HHS should expand as part of this effort:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Action 3.B.6: Share lessons learned through VA caregiver support strategies with federal partners</strong><br />
					LEAD recommends that the quarterly meetings identified in this action step commence as soon as possible so that important information is gathered and shared among federal programs and with community based providers.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress </strong></p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation: <em>Establish a coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's disease care, research, and education within the federal government</em></strong><br />
					LEAD members strongly recommended that there be a permanent office or other coordinating entity specifically for Alzheimer's care, research, and education within the federal government. An office in the White House, like that established for HIV/AIDS, would be in a position to coordinate efforts across HHS, DOD and the VA as well as the Departments of Treasury and State and the Office of Management and Budget, in order to assure comprehensive coordination of a national and international effort to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's by 2025. Section 2c of the National Alzheimer's Project Act lays the groundwork for a coordinating function with HHS itself by establishing in the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services that:</p>
<ol><li>the Secretary or the Secretary's designee be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's; (and)</li>
<li>Provide information and coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies.</li>
</ol><p>Both the Act itself and those volunteering their time and expertise on the Advisory Council, its work groups, and those assembled by supporting private entities such as LEAD, have envisioned a lasting presence to drive and coordinate Federal and private efforts to defeat Alzheimer's. We recommend that a permanent role be established within the White House as well as in the Office of the Secretary of HHS at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level as National Coordinators of Alzheimer's Plan Implementation. These individuals will be responsible not only for reporting on the progress of the National Plan as provided by the National Alzheimer's Project Act, but also for driving forward aggressive coordination and rationalization of Federal resources with private and global efforts to defeat Alzheimer's by 2025.</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Project Act, with bi-partisan support from the Congress, places the responsibility for this function with the office of the Secretary of HHS. A separate person within that office reporting to the Secretary may have a "bully pulpit" but would not have the administrative apparatus to function effectively. Ideally, this role would fall to an official whose full time job is pursuing an end to Alzheimer's in as highly placed a position as possible.</p>
<p>Similarly, locating this HHS responsibility elsewhere within HHS could dilute its importance. The National Institutes of Health, for example, focus on research, not care or education. The Administration on Aging focuses on care and education, not research.</p>
<p>The office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation has begun the implementation of the Plan efficiently and in good time. The professional staff has the institutional knowledge and, all indications are, commitment to the Plan to move it forward. What remains is the appointment of an individual within that office and at the level of a deputy assistant secretary whose full time responsibility is to fulfill the aspirations of the Act, the Advisory Council, Congress, and others who support it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Data Standards</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The Problem </strong></em><br />
					One of the inefficiencies in clinical trials is that data collected by different pharmaceutical companies as well as academic research sites is highly variable. The wealth of data from research holds great potential to advance scientific and regulatory work, but the lack of standardized data creates significant challenges. Variable data can impede a FDA reviewer's ability to perform integral tasks such as rapid acquisition, analysis, storage and reporting of regulatory data. Improved data quality, accessibility and predictability will give reviewers more time to carry out complex analyses, ask in-depth questions and increase review consistency. <a href="http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf">http://www.fda.gov/.../FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM214120.pdf</a> -</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Both FDA CDER and CBER are encouraging the use of data standards by industry into an accepted format such as that created by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) or Health Level Seven International (HL7). <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm">http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm</a> <a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm">http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm209137.htm</a></p>
<p>Another potential for use of standardized data is the ability to create larger databases from smaller clinical trials and increase statistical power. Collecting AD data into large databases that can be mined will enable improved clinical trial design and patient selection for research, qualification of biomarkers for use in research, and decisions on the effects of novel therapeutics. An example of how a large database built on pooled AD data can contribute to the knowledge base is the use of modeling and simulation to provide a quantitative model of AD progression as performed by the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD). Indeed, opportunities afforded by AD data standards and data sharing have the potential to reduce costs of clinical trials and accelerate the translation of research into new therapies for the millions of patients and their loved ones affected by Alzheimer's Disease. Making data publically available allows more scientific investigators to perform AD research and provide new insights. A public database can increase collaboration and initiative from multi-disciplinary experts.</p>
<p>Medical research data on Alzheimer's patients should be collected in uniform data standards that are the same if the studies are done in San Francisco, Shanghai or Sydney.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br /><strong>AD Data Standards</strong><br />
					Require or strongly encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored AD clinical trials to use the same AD CDISC data standards to facilitate data sharing and regulatory authority (FDA and EMA) review.</p>
<p>Remap data AD clinical trial data rich in biomarker data, as ADNI and ADCS, to the same common AD CDISC data standards.</p>
<p>Develop common data standards and measurements for questionnaires that assess cognition and functional status. Engage copyright holders of AD questionnaires to allow an additional layer to capture recording of these instruments into AD CDISC data standards.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Common informed consent form for AD clinical studies</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					The final report of the Alzheimer's Study Group emphasized that patients are critical contributors to clinical development. There was a call for patients to be made aware that they can speed the search for new treatments by enrolling in clinical trials, contributing tissue samples, and allowing the use of their medical records for research. Human subjects, research funding, and time are all in limited supply. Clinical research on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) must develop methods to assure that resources are used wisely and strategically. The informed consent form is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a single study and specific purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data are essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. Even though data sharing is a requirement in NIH funded studies, misunderstandings and overly restrictive consent forms restrict access to data collected under NIH funding and industry clinical trials as well.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong><br />
					Obtaining de-identified data from AD clinical trials, multicenter and single site studies, and pooling these data to build large databases is a critical step in providing the necessary research infrastructure to gain an understanding of a disease as complex as Alzheimer's and to examine significant scientific issues such as biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendation</em></strong><br />
					We recommend a mechanism to let Alzheimer's patients allow their de-identified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study and that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. We recommend allowing pooling of individual de-identified data into larger AD databases to allow datamining and increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of AD, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p>The National Health Council has conducted surveys and issued reports such as the Electronic Health Information Exchange: A Live Strong Report describing that "87 percent of patients strongly agree that EHR should provide patients with a way to share their medical information with scientists doing research -- as long as the information cannot be linked to them personally."</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Making the case for Public Private Partnerships for NAPA</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Problem</em></strong><br />
					A crisis in medicine today is that there are increasing investments in biomedical research but decreasing numbers of new medical products, especially drugs, that obtain FDA approval and are available to patients.<sup>1, 2</sup> In order to respond to this crisis, the field of drug development is undergoing transformational changes.</p>
<p>Taking a basic scientific discovery through development and regulatory approval of a medical product that finally reaches patients faces overwhelming challenges including the long length of research, high rate of failures of potential candidates and enormous costs. This research and development process is so difficult it is called the "Valley of Death." As many as 80-95% of promising drug candidates fail.<sup>3, 4</sup> Drug companies will spend tens of thousands to perform research on millions of compounds and spend in excess of a billion dollars over a 10- to 20-year period just to have one drug reach patients.<sup>5</sup> A pressing example is Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for which diagnosis is difficult and there are only a few FDA approved treatments to temporarily slow the disease but no cure, at a time when this debilitating disease is exploding in the aging population. In fact, the pace for development and FDA approval of Central Nervous System (CNS) drugs is even longer than other drug classes.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>These challenges mean that companies have to be smarter and more efficient in managing drug discovery and development. Innovation is needed to create greater efficiencies to help move therapies through development, review and approval for patient use. John Castellani, President PhRMA, stated that "The regulatory process is a strategic priority that if done right can reduce time, cost and uncertainty in drug development."<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><strong><em>The Solution</em></strong>:<br />
					Increasingly, public private partnerships (PPP) are presenting an opportunity to meet these challenges. Partnerships between the private sector, regulatory and other government agencies, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and patient groups represent a new model offering innovation and efficiencies in drug development. Innovation comes from focusing on science that can improve the process of drug development and be applied to regulatory decisions. Efficiencies come from building collaborations and sharing.</p>
<p>The flagship success of PPPs in AD is the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (<strong>ADNI1</strong>), a $60 million, 5-year study to test whether imaging and biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments could measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Begun by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and supported by other federal agencies, private-sector companies and organizations, the ADNI1 investment would have been prohibitive for a single stakeholder. However, ADNI1 has transformed the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD. Additionally, many other PPPs are having an impact in AD, some of which are described below:</p>
<ul><li><strong>ADNI2</strong>: Approximately 1,000 people aged 55 to 90 will be followed with imaging and biomarker measures to identify who is at risk for AD, track progression, and devise tests to measure the effectiveness of potential interventions. This ~ $60 million study is funded by NIH and companies.</li>
<li><strong>FNIH Biomarkers Consortium</strong>: One project is the first part of a multi-phased effort to utilize ADNI samples to construct multiplex panels in plasma and CSF to diagnose patients with AD and monitor disease progression.</li>
<li><strong>Alliance for Aging Research</strong>: The Alliance initiated Accelerate Cure/Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease, a coalition of national organizations representing patients, providers, caregivers, consumers, older Americans, researchers, employers, and health care industries seeking to accelerate development of potential cures and treatments for AD.</li>
<li><strong>Alzheimer's Association Global Standardization</strong>: This organization is leading global efforts to standardize Alzheimer's biomarkers with the World Wide AD Neuroimaging Initiative (WW-ADNI) and the Alzheimer's Association Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Quality Control Program.</li>
<li><strong>Alzheimer's Association Research Roundtable</strong>: Members facilitate the development and implementation of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease by collectively addressing obstacles to research and development, clinical care and public health education.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Path Institute's Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD)</strong>: CAMD accelerates the development of therapies for AD by advancing drug development tools for regulatory approval. CAMD developed AD data standards with CDISC, a pooled clinical trial database with 6,000 patients, and a clinical disease progression model. CAMD obtained regulatory approval for imaging biomarkers from the EMA and is collaborating with the FDA on CSF and imaging biomarkers.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Path Institute's Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium</strong>: A workgroup is developing and evaluating a PRO instrument on MCI for use in clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new AD drugs.</li>
<li><strong>IMI PharmaCog</strong>: The five-year €20M PharmaCog project, funded under the European Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI), will provide tools to define the potential of a drug candidate, reduce the development time of new drugs and thus accelerate the approvals of promising new medicines.</li>
</ul><p>While the impact of these PPPs is extensive, there are still significant challenges and opportunities for preventing and treating AD. One challenge is in the regulatory arena. For approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company engages exclusively with the regulatory agency and all information within the drug approval process is proprietary. Lessons learned from one AD drug trial are not shared, so any insights on why drugs fail or how particular biomarkers track with disease progression are lost. However, in recognizing the need for change, the FDA established an innovative approach in the Critical Path Initiative. The FDA formalized a process for submitting tools as biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments to be "qualified" for specific uses in supporting drug development.<sup>7</sup> Tools that receive a designation of "fit for use" from the FDA's qualification process8 can then be widely shared.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recommendations</em></strong><br />
					Providing the extensive evidence needed for qualification of tools by regulatory authorities can optimally be carried out through public-private partnerships. PPPs can support publicly accessible clinical trial databases that can be mined for information on biomarkers and disease progression. Drug companies can contribute data and conduct prospective trials that may be required to provide the regulatory levels of evidence to assure qualification of new drug tools. Academics can also provide clinical data and analysis to identify optimal biomarkers for qualification.</p>
<p>The challenge then becomes funding PPPs that move products toward regulatory approval. The cost of qualification for a single biomarker is several million dollars over a time frame of up to 5 years. Such costs require significant investment by both public and private sectors and in-kind contributions in order to be successful. However, the end product is a tool that FDA can have confidence in to produce better data and be used by all drug companies in clinical trials. The result benefits all stakeholders, including patients.</p>
<p>Since not all PPPs conduct research as ADNI does, there needs to be new models of PPP funding, within or possibly outside of NIH, especially for non-profit organizations and those working toward improving the process of drug development and regulatory review. Infrastructure support for such an AD PPP could be provided through HHS or other governmental agency appropriations. Because PPPs rely upon multi-stakeholder collaborations, it is critical that oversight be provided by a multi-stakeholder board to represent the broad spectrum of the various entities (industry, regulatory agencies, government funding, non-profits, academic experts, and patients).</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>New York Memory Center comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for inviting the public to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." For over two decades New York Memory Center has been on the front-lines of Alzheimer's community-based care. As a pioneer in Social Adult Day programming and Caregiver Supportive Services we welcome the opportunity to provide recommendations for your consideration.</p>
<p>We believe that the five goals outlined in the plan which form the foundation of the National Plan are ambitious, courageous, and seek to offer a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. In comparing the National Plan to the most recent work of the three Sub-Committees, we felt the need to underscore a few key recommendations.</p>
<p>While our ultimate goal is a world without Alzheimer's, we recognize the very real possibility that even with increased financial support to drive a targeted research agenda, we may not put an end to this horrible disease by 2025. Moreover, those living with the disease today and tomorrow deserve the best possible care we can offer. We need better care now. We are concerned that the ultimate research agenda will be too narrow in scope and leave research relative to care practices as a back-burner issue, instead of integrated as a significant component.</p>
<p>In innovative Alzheimer's Adult Day Centers around the country, various non-pharmacological approaches to care such as arts-based programming; cognitive stimulation; exercise and movement training; meditation; learning methods; sensory therapy, cognitive training; tailored diets; communication techniques for managing behavioral symptoms; early stage education designed to maximize independence and efforts to reduce excess disability; and caregiver education, coaching, and counseling are practiced with evident increases in quality of life, and evident reductions in challenging behaviors; and with some interventions, short term improvements in cognition, language and learning. These interventions must be recognized as active treatment for Alzheimer's disease and reimbursed by Medicare.</p>
<p>Although these practices emerged as grassroots movements, we now have significant studies that support many of these interventions as evidence-based or evidence informed practices in the care of individuals with dementia and their caregivers. Any plan to invest in research should substantially include non-pharmacological care-based research. Much more research is needed in these areas as positive outcomes are consistently identified by care providers and clinicians as superior to other conventional approaches. We must address the clinical significance of these various approaches to treatment. The small size of most studies, and variability in quality in these areas limits generalization of the results, and discourages widespread practice changes in care settings. What is needed is funding for large, well designed, robust studies in order to influence practice changes nationally.</p>
<p>Today, approximately $30 million dollars of the $479 million dollars devoted to Alzheimer's disease research is earmarked for clinical research in Alzheimer's disease care, support and education. We recommend a substantial increase in this area relative to the overall annual research budget. Research based, non-pharmacological, active treatment needs to be implemented as standard practice. Research must seek to understand what care works, why, and to ensure that the best care is widely practiced nationwide.</p>
<p>One agency missing from the list of participating inter-agency departments and government agencies tasked to help support the development of the national plan is the National Endowment for the Arts. We strongly recommend that this agency have an opportunity to weigh in and support efforts in creating this national plan. Recently, this agency partnered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in creating a white paper framing a national research agenda for the arts, health and well-being.</p>
<p>We believe that HHS should provide federal funds to support a state lead entity in every state--- determined by each Governor for the purpose of developing a state Alzheimer's Strategic Plan. We recommend that this lead agency Chair a state inter-agency committee comprised of other departments in state government which impact the Alzheimer's community, labor, other stakeholders, community service providers, caregivers and at least one resident living in the state with capacity who is living with memory loss to serve on this committee. We believe this committee should be tasked to provide annual updates which compare results to planned goals, and made publicly available to the citizens of each state.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that the plan encourage the development of statewide plans for a full assessment of each state's current service delivery system, and outline a strategic plan for caring for individuals living with Alzheimer's and related dementias now and in the future. The national plan should weigh in on these efforts and seek to reward states for creating and implementing innovative cost savings while improving care outcomes.</p>
<p>We also believe that Administration on Aging Title IIIE Caregiver Support Service Programs can be an effective resource in meeting the needs of the Alzheimer's and related dementia community. With increased funding to the States, these programs could provide memory screenings and referrals to local diagnostic centers in order to receive a full differential diagnosis. Moreover, these programs could take a lead role in case management and care coordination, and in helping families with advanced care planning. We recommend that the plan include increased new funding to states within IIIE that stipulates services for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.</p>
<p>Medicare must provide an Adult Day Services benefit for persons with dementia. Adult Day Care Services provides active treatment for the person with dementia and support for their caregivers. This is particularly vital for the person with the disease that lives alone and/or has no caregiver. Medicaid should include Adult Day Services as a state option. Simply put, public policy discriminates individuals with a dementing disease. Medicare and Medicaid provide coverage for active treatment of medical and functional needs related to disease processes but does not include active treatment for individuals with dementia. These services allow adults with memory loss to be safe, socially connected, and therapeutically supported in order to maintain functional abilities as long as possible and avoid premature institutionalization. Moreover, this provides caregivers needed respite in order to extend their ability to care for their loved ones at home.</p>
<p>The cost savings to our long-term-care system would be tremendous relative to the over usage of home care, and nursing homes. In New York State the average cost for Adult Day Services is approximately $80 per day--- compared to $144 a day for home care, and between $253-376 a day for nursing home care. We must ask ourselves--- why are we--- over-medicalizing long term care services when they are often inappropriate. Adult Day Services provides care in the lease restrictive setting and offers a therapeutic oasis where those living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias can continue to actively participate in the life of a community.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts and recommendations.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PLAN</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan. I am, of course, very pleased that the federal government is developing plans to address the needs of people with dementia and their families, a population that will grow substantially over the next quarter century because of the elder boom and because of increased life expectancy.</p>
<p>I believe, however, that, as drafted, <strong>the plan will fail to meet the needs--and to improve the quality of life--of millions of people who currently have dementia and their families as well as millions more who will develop dementia over the next decade and more</strong>.</p>
<p>In these comments I will address two major concerns: (1) unbalanced distribution of new funding and (2) the failure to address the behavioral health dimensions of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong>: Although the draft plan does not specify future funding, it does provide information about funding that has been committed prior to the finalization of the plan. Altogether $156 million will be added over the next two years. It will be distributed as follows:</p>
<table align="center" border="1" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><th scope="col"><strong>Goals</strong></th>

<td><strong>100%</strong></td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>If this reflects how funds will be distributed going forward, it is clear that research is the only priority of the Plan; its other four goals are of very limited importance.</p>
<p>Let me be clear. I do not oppose increased spending on research seeking a cure, preventive interventions, or a way to substantially slow the growth of disability due to dementia. But expecting to achieve this by 2025 is wildly optimistic given the current state of research. And while we are waiting, 10's of millions of people with dementia and their families will not get the care and support that they need and deserve, resulting in avoidable suffering and missed opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>This plan appears to write off a generation or more of people with dementia and their families. </strong></p>
<p>I suppose those who want research to be the virtually exclusive priority of our nation's efforts regarding Alzheimer's and other dementias could argue that funding for services is available elsewhere. But this is at best a partial truth. Medicare mostly does not cover long-term care or family support; and Medicaid is supposed to be for people with very limited means. Indeed, long-term care is one of the targets for cost cutting in Medicaid, and one of the proposals to cut Medicaid that resurfaces routinely is reducing the ability of people who are not extremely poor to become eligible for coverage of long-term care services.</p>
<p><strong>I strongly urge HHS to revisit the question of how new funds should be spent and to place much greater emphasis on improving care now and for the foreseeable future than this draft plan does. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Neglect of Behavioral Health </strong></p>
<p>The summary of facts about dementia given near the beginning of the plan notes (1) that people with dementia experience "behavioral and psychiatric disorders", (2) that "personality and behavior changes may also occur", and (3) that family caregivers experience tremendous stress and "report symptoms of depression and anxiety and poorer health outcomes." But these very important facts are barely mentioned in the rest of the plan and, with the possible exception of family caregivers, are not addressed in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>This omission will result in certain failure to meet behavioral health needs that are common among people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Here are the sections of the plan that should reflect behavioral health needs.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Framework and guiding principles</strong>: This section lists service systems that are important to people with dementia and their families, mentioning health care, long-term care, home care, legal services, and social services. Mental health and substance abuse (behavioral health) systems are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.B: Expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease</strong>: This section mentions both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, but</p>
<ul><li>The clear priority is bio-medical research seeking pharmacological treatments. There is also a great need for research regarding non-pharmacological, psycho-social interventions, which hold great promise for improving the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers virtually immediately.</li>
<li>In addition, there is a great need for research regarding preventing and/or treating co-occurring mental or substance use disorders or the neuro-psychiatric symptoms that affect virtually all people with dementia.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategies 1.B. 3, 5, and 6: Expand clinical trials</strong>: These sections fail to mention clinical trials of anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications. It is true that these medications are over-used for people with dementia and can be dangerous. Fortunately, it is also true that non-pharmacological, psychosocial interventions can be enormously helpful to people with dementia and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. But it would be useful to develop medications that are safe and effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs</strong>: This section lists fields and settings where findings of research should be disseminated so as to improve practice. Behavioral health settings are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2, 3</strong>: These sections mention a number of federal agencies that need to be involved. SAMHSA, NIMH, NIDA, and NIAAA are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with skills to provide high-quality care</strong>: This section notes, "Physicians need information on how to implement the new requirement regarding "detection of any cognitive impairment." They, and other health providers, also need information about how to detect co-occurring mental or substance use disorders and to distinguish their effects from those of dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B: Ensure timely and accurate diagnosis</strong>: As noted, accurate diagnosis requires a very difficult differential diagnosis to distinguish between dementia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong>: This section notes opportunities to provide information and referral through NIA and AoA. It does not mention the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is funded by SAMHSA, and which provides a national I&amp;R network for help with any mental health issue--not just suicide. There are also local I&amp;R systems focused on mental health and/or substance abuse, which are not mentioned in the draft plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings</strong>: This section mentions "home, physician's office, and long-term care facility." It does not mention mental health settings such as clinics, day programs, inpatient units, psychiatric rehabilitation, crisis services, and case management programs. People with dementia and/or their family members are often served in these settings. And when people with AD in crisis, it is usually the mental health system that is turned to for help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.E: Explore the effectiveness of new models</strong>: This section mentions "medical homes", which are required to integrate physical and behavioral health care, but there is no mention in the plan about this fact. The plan also does not note the emphasis in the Affordable Care Act on developing "health homes", for which many people with dementia will probably be eligible because they have multiple chronic conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F: Ensure that people with AD experience safe and effective transitions between care settings and systems</strong>: Despite the fact that settings and systems officially charged with caring for people with dementia frequently turn to the mental health system when there are behavioral problems, there is no mention of how profoundly flawed transitions between the mental health and the long-term settings and systems are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F. 1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong>: Despite the fact that many people with AD--with and without psychiatric disorders-end up in psychiatric inpatient units of hospitals due to behavioral problems, there is no mention of the need to address psychiatric hospitalization specifically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.G: Advance coordinated and integrated health and long-term services</strong>: This section and its subsections do not mention the <strong>need to coordinate physical and behavioral health services</strong>, which is particularly surprising since integration of this kind is a major goal of health care reform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.H: Improve care for populations disproportionally affected by AD and for populations facing care challenges</strong>: This section appropriately identifies "people with intellectual disabilities" as disproportionately affected by AD, but it fails to mention people with psychiatric disabilities, who often develop dementia as they age, compounding causes of cognitive impairment and complicating care and treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with AD and The Families</strong>: This section does mention the mental health needs of family and other informal caregivers. They could get more attention than is in the plan, but it's there to some extent. However, this section vastly neglects the mental health needs of people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong>: This section calls for "dissemination through the Aging Network, state public health departments, and public websites." There is no mention of the mental health system, to which people with AD and their families frequently go for help.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no mention of dissemination to people with dementia, most of whom can read and process information in the early and mid-phases of dementia. They, as well as caregivers, can benefit from informational material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term care services and supports system</strong>: Again, the plan fails to recognize the frequent use of the mental health system by people with AD and their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</strong>: This section says "AoA will expand efforts to develop more AD-capable long-term services and supports [for] AD caregivers." Although the section mentions the need for interventions regarding depression, it fails to mention anxiety disorders--which are very common. In addition it fails to mention the need for "AD-capable" behavioral health services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</strong>: This section notes the importance of call centers, but does not reflect awareness of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which could be an important resource during a crisis. This section also does not reflect the fact that, it is usually the psychiatric services in local hospitals or psychiatric mobile crisis teams that are called on to deal with a behavioral crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D: Maintain the dignity, safety and rights of people with AD</strong>: This section appropriately notes the fact that people with dementia are vulnerable in many ways and that many need more protection than they get. (The inadequacy of many Adult Protective Services programs is particularly important to address.) However, there is nothing here to suggest that people with dementia need anything other than protection. Treating people still capable of some degree of self-care and of being helpful to others, solely as people in need of protection, diminishes them and deprives them of the dignity and rights that this section is supposed to address. <strong>There needs to be a strengths-based model for dementia as increasingly there is for people with psychiatric and other disabilities</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report, and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong>: This is clearly important to do, but it is also important to address the use of anti-psychotics in other formal care settings such as assisted living facilities, senior housing, adult day care, etc. It is also important to address the likely overuse of anti-psychotics for people with dementia who live in their own homes or with family caregivers.</p>
<p>In addition, it is very important to <strong>address the inappropriate use of anti-depressants</strong> because recent studies suggest that anti-depressants have high risks and virtually no benefits for people with dementia and should be used only after non-pharmacological interventions have been tried.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.E: Assess and address the housing needs of people with AD</strong>: Stable housing, as the plan says, is a critical need for people with dementia. But the plan seems to have a remarkably limited view of the kinds of stable housing that can be helpful, failing to mention assisted living, continuing care communities, senior housing, supportive housing, housing for people with developmental disabilities, and housing for people with serious mental illness.</p>
<p>The draft plan also fails to note that people with serious mental illness are frequently dumped out of housing they have had within the mental health system for many years and are sent to nursing homes when their dementia or physical disorders make them too difficult for the mental health system--as it is currently organized--to care for. It should be possible for people with serious mental illness to stay in their own homes or in the housing that has become their home rather than to be shunted off to a long-term care system that has very limited capacity to care for them.</p>
<p>In addition, even though reducing the unnecessary use of nursing homes for people with dementia is a clear goal of this plan, there is no mention of the fact that <strong>there are now more people admitted to nursing homes with mental illness other than dementia than with dementia alone</strong>. Frequently they are people with co-occurring dementia and psychiatric disorders. Housing designed for this population is needed to help them avert admission to nursing homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Public education should include information about the frequent overlap of mental disorders and dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data To Track Progress</strong>: Because this plan does not seem to reflect awareness of the important role the mental health system plays in helping people with dementia and their families, it seems likely that plans for improved data collection will overlook data related to psychiatric disorders and mental health settings. It is important to track progress regarding the behavioral health of people with dementia and their families.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>I hope that you will find these comments on specific sections of the draft plan helpful in identifying what to include in the final plan regarding the behavioral health needs of people with dementia and their families. Let me add that behavioral health services are not only important for those who are experiencing mental or substance use disorders. In addition, <strong>care informed by understanding the psychological potential of people with dementia could result in vastly improved quality of life for them</strong>.</p>
<p>We do not have to wait for a cure to make life better for people with dementia and their families, and we should not devote virtually all new resources to seeking an ultimate solution when so much could be accomplished with better care and support.</p>
<p>I would be happy to help the group developing the plan to flesh out any of the suggestions included in this letter.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PLAN</strong></p>
<p>The National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare appreciates the opportunity to comment on the draft National Alzheimer's Plan. Together, with our more than 1,900 member organizations, we serve our nation's most vulnerable citizens: more than 8 million adults and children with mental illness and substance use disorders. We are committed to providing comprehensive, quality care that affords every opportunity for recovery and inclusion in all aspects of community life.</p>
<p>The National Council is, of course, very pleased that the federal government is developing plans to address the needs of people with dementia and their families, a population that will grow substantially over the next quarter century because of the elder boom and because of increased life expectancy.</p>
<p>The National Council believes, however, that, as drafted, <strong>the plan will fail to meet the needs--and to improve the quality of life--of millions of people who currently have dementia and their families as well as millions more who will develop dementia over the next decade and more</strong>.</p>
<p>In these comments the National Council will address two major concerns: (1) unbalanced distribution of new funding and (2) the failure to address the behavioral health dimensions of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong>: Although the draft plan does not specify future funding, it does provide information about funding that has been committed prior to the finalization of the plan. Altogether $156 million will be added over the next two years. It will be distributed as follows:</p>
<table align="center" border="1" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><th scope="col"><strong>Goals</strong></th>
<th scope="col"><strong>Amount</strong></th>
<th scope="col"><strong>%</strong></th>

<td><strong>$156.0 million</strong></td>
<td><strong>100%</strong></td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>If this reflects how funds will be distributed going forward, it is clear that research is the single priority of the Plan; its other four goals are evidently of very limited importance.</p>
<p>The National Council does not oppose increased spending on research seeking a cure, preventive interventions, or a way to substantially slow the growth of disability due to dementia. But achieving any of this by 2025 is probably wildly optimistic given the current state of research. And while we are waiting, 10's of millions of people with dementia and their families will not get the care and support that they need and deserve, resulting in avoidable suffering and missed opportunities for improved quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>This plan appears to write off a generation or more of people with dementia and their families. </strong></p>
<p>The National Council understands that those who want research to be the virtually exclusive priority of our nation's efforts could argue that funding for services is available elsewhere, but this is a partial truth. Medicare mostly does not cover long-term care or family support; and Medicaid is supposed to be for people with very limited means. Indeed, long-term care is one of the targets for cost cutting in Medicaid, and one of the proposals to cut Medicaid that resurfaces routinely is reducing the ability of people who are not extremely poor to become eligible for coverage of long-term care services.</p>
<p><strong>The National Council strongly urges HHS to revisit the question of how new funds should be spent and to place much greater emphasis on improving care now and for the foreseeable future than this draft plan does. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Neglect of Behavioral Health </strong></p>
<p>The summary of facts about dementia given near the beginning of the plan notes (1) that people with dementia experience "behavioral and psychiatric disorders", (2) that "personality and behavior changes may also occur", and (3) that family caregivers experience tremendous stress and "report symptoms of depression and anxiety and poorer health outcomes." But these very important facts are barely mentioned in the rest of the plan and, with the possible exception of family caregivers, are not addressed in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>This omission will result in certain failure to meet behavioral health needs that are common among people with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Here are some sections of the plan that need to reflect behavioral health issues.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Framework and guiding principles</strong>: This section lists service systems that are important to people with dementia and their families, mentioning health care, long-term care, home care, legal services, and social services. Mental health and substance abuse (behavioral health) systems are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.B: Expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease</strong>: This section mentions both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (though it emphasizes biological research), but it does not mention the need for research regarding preventing and/or treating co-occurring mental or substance use disorders or the neuro-psychiatric symptoms that affect virtually all people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategies 1.B. 3, 5, and 6: Expand clinical trials</strong>: These sections fail to mention clinical trials of anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications, which probably are over-used currently and are dangerous. Non-pharmacological, psychosocial interventions can be enormously helpful to people with dementia and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. But it would be useful to develop medications that are safe and effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs</strong>: This section lists fields and settings where findings of research should be disseminated so as to improve practice. Behavioral health settings are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2, 3</strong>: These sections mention a number of federal agencies that need to be involved. SAMHSA, NIMH, NIDA, and NIAAA are not mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.A: Build a workforce with skills to provide high-quality care</strong>: This section notes, "Physicians need information on how to implement the new requirement regarding "detection of any cognitive impairment." They, and other health providers also need information about how to detect a co-occurring mental or substance use disorder and to distinguish their effects from those of dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B: Ensure timely and accurate diagnosis</strong>: As noted, accurate diagnosis requires a very difficult differential diagnosis to distinguish between dementia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong>: This section notes opportunities to provide information and referral through NIA and AoA. It does not mention the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is funded by SAMHSA, and which provides a national I&amp;R network for help with any mental health issue--not just suicide. There are also local I&amp;R systems focused on mental health and/or substance abuse, which are not mentioned in the draft plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.D: Identify high-quality dementia care guidelines and measures across care settings</strong>: This section mentions "home, physician's office, and long-term care facility." It does not mention mental health settings such as clinics, day programs, inpatient units, psychiatric rehabilitation, crisis services, and case management programs. It should be noted at the very least that people with AD in crisis often are referred or taken to psychiatrists or other mental health professionals, who are expected to provide treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.E: Explore the effectiveness of new models</strong>: This section mentions "medical homes", which are required to integrate physical and behavioral health care, but there is no mention in the plan about this fact. The plan also does not note the emphasis in the Affordable Care Act on developing "health homes", for which many people with dementia will probably be eligible because they have multiple chronic conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F: Ensure that people with AD experience safe and effective transitions between care settings and systems</strong>: Despite the fact that settings and systems officially charged with caring for people with dementia frequently turn to the mental health system when there are behavioral problems, there is no mention of how profoundly flawed transitions between the mental health and the long-term settings and systems are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.F. 1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</strong>: Despite the fact that many people with AD--with and without psychiatric disorders--end up in psychiatric inpatient units of hospitals due to behavioral problems, there is no mention of the need to address psychiatric hospitalization specifically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.G: Advance coordinated and integrated health and long-term services</strong>: This section and its subsections do not mention the <strong>need to coordinate physical and behavioral health services</strong>, which is particularly surprising since integration of this kind is a major goal of health care reform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 2.H: Improve care for populations disproportionally affected by AD and for populations facing care challenges</strong>: This section appropriately identifies "people with intellectual disabilities" as disproportionately affected by AD, but it fails to mention people with serious and persistent mental illnesses who do not recover over time, as is true for many people with schizophrenia and other treatment refractory mental disorders. People with serious and persistent mental illness also often develop dementia, compounding causes of cognitive impairment and complicating care and treatment tremendously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with AD and The Families</strong>: This section does mention the mental health needs of family and other informal caregivers. They could get more attention than is in the plan, but it's there to some extent. However, this section vastly neglects the mental health needs of people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</strong>: This section calls for "dissemination through the Aging Network, state public health departments, and public websites." There is no mention of the mental health system, to which people with AD and their families frequently go for help.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no mention of dissemination to people with dementia, most of whom can read and process information in the early and mid-phases of dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.2: Identify and disseminate best practices for caregiver assessment and referral through the long-term care services and supports system</strong>: Again, the plan fails to recognize the frequent use of the mental health system by people with AD and their families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</strong>: This section says "AoA will expand efforts to develop more AD-capable long-term services and supports [for] AD caregivers." Although the section mentions the need for interventions regarding depression, it fails to mention anxiety disorders--which are very common. In addition it fails to mention the need for "AD-capable" behavioral health services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</strong>: This section notes the importance of call centers, but does not reflect awareness of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which could be an important resource during a crisis. This section also does not reflect the fact that, it is usually the psychiatric services in local hospitals or psychiatric mobile crisis teams that are called on to deal with a behavioral crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D: Maintain the dignity, safety and rights of people with AD</strong>: This section appropriately notes the fact that people with dementia are vulnerable in many ways and that many need more protection than they get. (The inadequacy of many Adult Protective Services programs is particularly important to address.) However, there is nothing here to suggest that people with dementia need anything other than protection. Treating people still capable of some degree of self-care and of being helpful to others, solely as people in need of protection, diminishes them and deprives them of the dignity and rights that this section is supposed to address. <strong>There needs to be a strengths-based model for dementia as increasingly there is for people with psychiatric and other disabilities</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report, and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong>: This is clearly important to do, but it is also important to address the use of anti-psychotics in other settings such as homes, assisted living facilities, senior housing, adult day care, etc. In addition, it is very important to <strong>address the inappropriate use of anti-depressants</strong> because recent studies suggest that anti-depressants have high risks and virtually no benefits for people with dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategy 3.E: Assess and address the housing needs of people with AD</strong>: Stable housing, as the plan says, is a critical need for people with dementia. But the plan seems to have a remarkably limited view of the kinds of stable housing that can be helpful--such as assisted living, continuing care communities, senior housing, supportive housing, and housing for people with serious mental illness.</p>
<p>The draft plan fails to note that people with serious mental illness are frequently dumped out of housing they have had within the mental health system for many years and are sent to nursing homes when their dementia or physical disorders become too difficult for the mental health system--as it is currently organized--to care for. It should be possible for people with serious mental illness to stay or in their own homes or in the housing that has become their home rather than to be shunted off to a long-term care system that has very limited capacity to care for them.</p>
<p>Finally, even though reducing the unnecessary use of nursing homes for people with dementia is a clear goal of this plan, there is no mention of the fact that there are now more people admitted to nursing homes with mental illness other than dementia than with dementia alone. Frequently they are people with co-occurring dementia and psychiatric disorders. Housing designed for this population is needed to help them avert admission to nursing homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement</strong>: Public education should include information about the frequent overlap of mental disorders and dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data To Track Progress</strong>: Because this plan does not seem to reflect awareness of the important role the mental health system plays in helping people with dementia and their families, it seems likely that plans for improved data collection will overlook data related to psychiatric disorders and mental health settings. It is important to track progress regarding the behavioral health of people with dementia and their families.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The National Council hopes that you will find these comments on specific sections of the draft plan helpful in identifying what needs to be included in the final plan regarding the behavioral health needs of people with dementia and their families. The fact of the matter is that good care, care informed by understanding the psychological potential of people with dementia and the stress experienced by their family members, could result in vastly improved quality of life for them.</p>
<p>We do not have to wait for a cure to make life better, and we should not devote virtually all new resources to seeking a cure when so much could be accomplished with better care and support.</p>
<p>The National Council would be happy to help the group developing the plan to flesh out any of the suggestions included in this letter.</p>

<p>I would like to thank this committee for their efforts on this project. I am writing a very long letter and hope someone takes the time to read it and forward to all involved.</p>
<p>As this plan moves forward I can applaud the parts of the plan that involve research and drug development. I am sure it will make the researchers and drug companies very happy!! I have no problem researching earlyon set Alzhemers, but really the brain is an organ just like the heart and lungs. There is no cure for old, period! When a person shows signs of this disease at 75 years of age it is just that, the brain is getting old. The government can dump millions into drugs that they them selves will be paying for. Do you know how much Nemenda costs? Most people that take it could never afford it, so the government pays for a drug that has very little effect on the person that takes it. Financial aid and support to the families trying to care for a loved one at home is where this country will benefit.</p>
<p>I am a 52 year old daughter taking care of an 87 year old father with severe Alzheimers. We have a unique situation where I as well as 2 brothers live next door to my dad on land given to us by him. For the last 10 years I have taken care of him as well as worked and raised a family. I have 2 children who are in the health field, 1 a nurse and 1 in a Doctor Pharmacy program, that I struggle to keep in school since I have had to stop working. In the beginning my dad just required monitoring, meals delivered and laundry done, as the disease progressed we alarmed the house so he could not wander off at night. He tripped and broke his right hip in April 2010, surgery made the disease go crazy and I have been a full time caregiver since that day! My data never took a dime of government assistance, he lived and worked as a construction worker and farmed through some very difficult times. He had maybe $35,000 in an IRA when this began. My brothers help where they can and I private pay caregivers (35 hours per week) with the money he has remaining to the tune of $1400 a month. He collects $1267 social security. So after utilities, insurance, drugs and food the remainder comes from the IRA. You can see that when we pre-pay a funeral he will almost be broke. I stopped working, stay 5 nights a week with my dad. Moving someone to a skilled care only worsens this disease or any dementia. April 2011 dad broke his left hip, Hospital 5 days Nov 2011 for and infection. After every surgery or hospital stay he was sent to skilled care (I use that term very loosely) the very basics are not being met in these homes, my dad was left unattended wet and soiled on a daily basis. He developed pineal yeast infections that went unchecked until I discovered it. This is caused by neglect and poor hygiene The workers are miserable, patients are ignored, no one smiles or even pretends to hear them. Don't believe me, take off your suit and go undercover for a visit. I saw this care across the board in 3 different skilled care facilities. My dad is no longer verbal enough to get a point across, but after every trip to a skilled home I would insist on bringing him home when he looked like death. Home is where it is at!!! Love and proper care, I have him walking with a walker, I have him on a bathroom schedule (he is never wet). At night I taught myself how to use an external catheter (something I had to fight to have Medicare approve). This is an aid that is simple to use and eliminates wetness at night and helps to prevent bedsores.</p>
<p>My dad now receives some help from the area on aging, that provides 3 half days of daycare. This is income based and I am controlled if I want to remain in the program to keep his withdraws from his IRA to a minimum. I do this so he dosen't run out of money therefore forcing him onto Medicaid and forcing us to put him in a home. Where is the burden of care? on me!!! Now we are hearing budgets cut to the access public transportation he rides to and from day care. I will be forced to enroll my dad onto Medicaid this will cost the government more than $9,000 monthly.</p>
<p>We were not rich enough to hire an Elder Attorney to transfer my dads assets out of his name, nor do we feel it was our right. How many rich people are on Medicaid because they were taught to spend down their assets? Not one person in this country should be able to give their undeserving children an inheritance before they die, period! Not one person is more in need of skilled care than my dad 24/7 and I could qualify him in a heart beat if I pre-pay a funeral. However I know without a doubt that I am giving him better care than he would get in a home. He is happy in his home and everyday that he smiles and says thank you is a gift to me!</p>
<p>My recommendations give the families financial help to keep their loved ones at home. Give the care giver that quit her job a tax break, so they can continue to help send their own children to college. Allow people to hire quality private care givers, don't force an agency that charges double the hourly rate on us. Respite care that is now covered only under Medicaid, so that we can a least get a weeksbreak to refresh our minds would be nice! Stop taxing the elderly when they can prove every dime of there money is going to care for themselves. Adult Day care should be a medical expense.</p>
<p>I also see both sides of this story my in-laws were forced by 2 of their children to move to assisted living. They pay $4300 a month and my father-in-law takes care of his wife their and the home is very happy to have them. They should be, he does their job for them and they collect the pay check!!! They hate where they live!</p>
<p>There was a song written over 50 years ago the title is "The House of Shame" by Smiley Bates. My dad would call a local radio station almost every Saturday and request it, he then would call each of his children to tell them listen to it. I challenge you to listen to it, I did! Nothing has really changed in 50 years.</p>
<p>I am sorry this is so long, but unless you know the entire problem you can not fix it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, submitted to the HHS Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services</strong></p>
<p>The Pioneer Network is pleased to have this opportunity to submit comments relating to the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. The creation of this plan represents an important opportunity to outline and launch a national approach to curbing a disease that negatively impacts millions of elders as well their families and communities. We agree that this national effort is a critical step for securing a brighter and higher-quality future for those affected by the disease today, as well as those that will be affected in years to come. Pioneer Network commends the Department of Health and Human Services and the Advisory Council on their action to move this agenda forward.</p>
<p>Pioneer Network is a national non-profit that serves as the leading national voice for culture change in long-term care and the promotion of person-centered care, dignity and choice for all elders. Pioneer Network achieves this mission by convening researchers, policy makers, regulators, providers, and consumers with a nationwide network of state Culture Change Coalitions to design and deliver the highest quality, evidence-based, person-centered approaches to enhancing the lives of elders, wherever they may reside. In the context of this approach, we submit the following comments on the Draft Framework for consideration:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Appropriate Domains</strong>: Pioneer Network is fully supportive of the goals of the plan as well as its comprehensive approach. Any responsible strategy to address Alzheimer's disease in the 21st century must include the elements already represented in this draft framework, with approaches targeting: research to improve prevention and treatment, care and support for people living with the disease and their families, public awareness, and measureable milestones. We are excited to see an emphasis on each of these areas, as they are the key to addressing the disease.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritizing the Person with Alzheimer's</strong>: There is no question that the need for increased investment in research to better prevent, diagnose and treat Alzheimer's is essential. In coming decades the impact of these efforts will be the ultimate discovery of a cure, with disease-modifying treatments in the interim. However, while strongly desired, such developments do not appear to be on the immediate horizon. Well in front of the horizon, presently straining our communities and healthcare system, are the more than five million people living with Alzheimer's today. These individuals and families need to know that while research moves us toward the future, their needs today remain a top priority; that they are not placed in second position to a potential greater good. Therefore, we recommend re-arranging the plan so that care for people with the disease is the #1 goal. By doing so, the plan sends a clear message that it is a top priority to serve people with the disease, by embracing, promoting and disseminating the many effective approaches to Alzheimer's care that are known today to improve quality of life.</li>
<li><strong>Person-Centered Care</strong>: In the section entitled <em>Enhancing Care Quality and Efficiency</em>, the concept of "person-centered approaches to care" is noticeably absent. Person-centered (or person-directed) care approaches are the cornerstone of high quality care for people with Alzheimer's, as these approaches allow the individual continued autonomy to live their life in a manner consistent with their own values, preferences and desires. Alzheimer's disease is a condition that robs individuals of many aspects of independence, yet does not have to remove their ability to receive care in their manner of choice. We view the concept of person-centered care as embedded so deeply in any approach to achieving quality care, that we recommend replacing section <em>2.D. Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em>, in the current document, with "<em>Promote Effective Person-Centered Approaches to Care Across Settings</em>." First, we would note that evidence-based, consensus-approved guidelines for the care of people with dementia in many of the settings of interest already exist, including nursing homes, assisted living, and home care, with well established standards of care present in other settings as well. Thus, it is not the identification of guidelines that is the key success driver to quality care, but rather the use of the person-centered approaches that are included in the existing guidelines. Second, there are many resources and programs, developed by leading organizations in the field, currently available to guide organizations on how to provide person-centered approaches to care. Thus, stepping back to focus on guidelines is more of a regression than a progression in the field; the person-centered care paradigm already exists and is ready for dissemination. Thus, we recommend the change stated above to focus on bringing visibility to existing person-centered approaches and promoting their use as widely as possible in every care setting. Even if the Council considers this proposed change to the language of 2.D as being a step too far, in order to ensure that the document is relevant in the current care field it is important to include an emphasis on person-centered care, which should be highlighted as paramount in any approach to care outlined in this national plan.</li>
<li><strong>Care Settings</strong>: Also in the section entitled <em>Enhancing Care Quality and Efficiency</em>, there is an important recognition that people with Alzheimer's live and receive care in many different types of settings. However, it is particularly noticeable in the introduction to this section, as well as in other areas, that several key settings are omitted. "People's homes, doctor's offices, hospitals, and nursing homes" does not nearly cover the range of care settings available to meet the needs of people with Alzheimer's. Certainly the inclusion of "nursing homes" is not intended by the authors to include all forms of residential care, given that it has a particular meaning in terms of licensure that does not include: assisted living, board and care homes, independent living, continuing care communities, or even memory care homes, all of which are settings in which people with Alzheimer's live. Further, there is no recognition of the role of Alzheimer's-specific (or general) adult day care settings. We recognize it could be cumbersome to list all possible care-related settings in a document such as this proposed plan, but would minimally suggest including assisted living, memory care and adult day care, or secondarily, replacing "nursing homes" with "long-term care residences," "long-term services and supports," or "adult day programs and various shared residential settings." Any of these options would be preferable to simply neglecting these other important places where people with Alzheimer's spend their time.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Language</strong>: Anyone who has been involved in the field of Alzheimer's knows the importance of language; essentially the "PC of Alzheimer's." Language can be used to either empower people with the disease to maintain their personhood and dignity, or it can increase stigma and marginalize people with the disease. Overall, this document does a nice job with language and is respectful of those affected by the disease. However, there are a couple points we have noticed where Pioneer Network suggests simple revisions to help make the plan more empowering for those it is intended to serve.
<ul><li>Replace "Patient" with "Person with Alzheimer's" or a similar derivation, in every case. While directly receiving care in an acute care setting, people with Alzheimer's may in fact be "patients" of the healthcare providers; yet in the scope of their everyday life, this is a fairly infrequent occurrence. However, at all times, they remain the individuals they have always been, though now they are living with a disease. Referring to someone as a patient is depersonalizing and implies identification as a medical record number, rather than as an individual. On the other hand referring to someone with the disease as a person helps maintain their identity and promotes involvement in decisions about their own care and experience.</li>
<li>Replace "facility" with "home" or "care community," in every case. The word "facility" implies institutionalization, which promotes stigma in the sense of needing to remove people with Alzheimer's from the general community. Despite the fact that assisted living residences or nursing homes offer support and care, they serve primarily as the person's home. The person needs to live in this new supportive home for their own well being, not in order to remove them from interacting with the larger community.</li>

</ol><p>Thank you very much for the opportunity to comment on this Draft Plan. Pioneer Network appreciates the chance to share our widely held perspective that caring for elders in the most effective and appropriate ways will not only enhance quality of life for individuals but make us stronger as a society. Our Network and its friends believe that people deserve the opportunity to continue to thrive and live up to their full potential until the end of life, despite their limitations, including those presented by Alzheimer's disease. This plan represents an important chance to move the field and society forward in thinking about Alzheimer's both in terms of the future impact of high-quality research and in terms of the present impact of high-quality care. Please feel free to contact the Pioneer Network with any questions, or to access the many resources available to promote quality of life for all elders.</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends the Advisory Council for developing goals and strategies that address the most pressing issues facing people with Alzheimer's disease and their families within the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Also significant is the Advisory Council's action to set a timely objective for the development of effective prevention and treatment modalities in the Framework. Enclosed please find comments on the Framework developed by LEAD around research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development. We hope that the Advisory Council will consider these comments and recommendations as it advises on a national strategic plan for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The comments and recommendations provided in this document seek to strengthen the goals and supporting strategies within the Framework. However, it is important to note that these goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private and non-profit sectors and by establishing quantified metrics to track progress. LEAD strongly urges that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be allocated to each of the outlined goals and strategies included in the final national plan. Furthermore, each goal and strategy outlined in the final national plan should include a targeted budget with assigned milestones and metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Sally Sachar, Chief Operating Officer of USAgainstAlzheimer's, or Eric Sokol, Vice President of Public Policy at the Alzheimer's Foundation of America. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD established four workgroups -- one each in the areas of research, clinical care, long-term care support and services, and drug discovery and development -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the Alzheimer's community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has set an aggressive goal to develop effective prevention and treatment modalities for Alzheimer's disease by 2025. The lack of tools such as biomarkers and an understanding of the biological basis of Alzheimer's disease currently impede the ability to appropriately address the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. The strategies outlined in the Framework have the potential for accelerating the therapeutic pipeline and rapidly translating basic science into new therapies for people with Alzheimer's disease. Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1:</p>
<p><em><strong>1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones </strong></em></p>
<p>With limited resources, private and public funders of Alzheimer's research must develop methods to coordinate research funding to assure that resources are spent strategically on the most promising areas and that investments are outcome-oriented and accountable. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council will consider input from the upcoming May 2012 National Institute on Aging Conference, which will seek to identify strategies and milestones to slow progression, delay onset and prevent Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, LEAD recommends the following:</p>
<ul><li>Development of methods to more efficiently and expeditiously determine diagnosis, prognosis and response to therapies using appropriate biomarkers and genetic markers.</li>
<li>Development of methodologies and tools needed to quantify the outcomes of interventional approaches that are more sensitive--but relevant--indicators of therapeutic effectiveness. While such research should include biomarkers and genetic markers, the primary focus should be related to the identification of more relevant clinical endpoints that may ultimately be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of novel therapeutic approaches. It is essential that such research be closely aligned with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) so that any progress in the field can be rapidly adopted by regulators, thereby expediting regulatory review and patient access to successful therapeutics.</li>
<li>Development of better methods to study individuals who are non-symptomatic or have mild cognitive impairments to effect better prediction of risk factors, primary and secondary prevention, and effective delay in progression.</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>To enhance research and drug development aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, the Advisory Council should advocate for the use of large-scale patient registries to facilitate faster and less expensive clinical trial recruitment. To assist this effort, public and private sectors should work together to address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation. Currently, patients sign an informed consent form for a specific study and narrow purpose, rendering the data useless as other ideas become promising. As a result, data is essentially lost and new studies have to be conducted resulting in additional expense, delays and more patients subjected to experimental trials. LEAD recommends a mechanism be developed to let patients opt into having their de-identified data used for broader research purposes that advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The National Plan should also encourage all new and ongoing federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) which will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA. In addition, Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data rich in biomarker information should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's Disease CDISC data standards and any federally-funded and industry-sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use.</p>
<p>While Alzheimer's disease researchers have identified promising candidate biomarkers, providing the level of evidence needed for qualification by the FDA requires additional data and rigorous analysis. Such efforts are beyond the scope and resources of companies or academic researchers and are best carried out through existing public-private partnerships such as the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Also, the lack of standardization for imaging modalities and assays of CSF analytes can delay the FDA from qualifying a biomarker for use in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Standardization of analytic methods together with establishing a resource of appropriate reference samples and reference standards, therefore, should be part of any national Alzheimer's research strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, quantitative clinical disease progression models should be developed to inform the design of Alzheimer's disease clinical trials in the evaluation of new medicines. These models would offer a tool to differentiate between symptomatic and disease-modifying drug effects, as well as help determine the optimal sample sizes and sampling times. A disease model will also help to identify subpopulations with unique characteristics for trials, and assess the impact of baseline disease severity on drug response.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>The Advisory Council should consider the term "presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease treatment" to refer to those interventions that are initiated before apparent cognitive decline and are intended to reduce the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease-related symptoms. This will accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, address uncertainties surrounding the term "prevention" and be more acceptable to regulatory agencies conducting reviews of clinical trials. In addition, a cognitive assessment tool should be developed that can be used to assess therapies at earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a patient registry of subjects that can be used for prevention trials. Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on accepted quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease. Finally, biomarkers should be identified for tracking earlier cognitive decline by developing consensus on the scientific evidence.</p>
<p><em><strong>1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends the establishment of a central Alzheimer's disease research coordinating entity within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This entity should maintain the authority and ability to convene inter-agency and non-government constituencies, domestically and internationally. We propose that the entity gather and distribute data, and make recommendations to the HHS Secretary for federal policy regarding funding strategies for stopping Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In addition, an international action plan against Alzheimer's disease should be developed by nations with national Alzheimer's disease plans in place or in progress. Developing a plan is an important first step to coordinate efforts against this global challenge. The global plan should include efforts to standardize biomarkers and surrogate end-points, coordinate surveillance and enhance regulatory cooperation. Any global effort should also include funds for research, strategies for cost containment efforts and goals to improve the delivery of clinical care and long term services.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. A national plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 in the Framework will provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans that require care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings. Below are additional strategies that could, if implemented, improve care quality and efficiency for people with Alzheimer's disease:</p>
<p><em><strong>2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings </strong></em></p>
<p>To achieve quality care and a safe transition for people with Alzheimer's disease between care settings, it is imperative that healthcare professionals are more adequately reimbursed for services such as comprehensive, longitudinal evaluation and management services, acute and chronic psychiatric management, evaluation of cognitive function (including psychometrics) and caregiver education and counseling.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems </strong></em></p>
<p>Improved emergency department and inpatient hospital care can be achieved by enhanced recognition of Alzheimer's disease in acute care settings. A key element to achieving this objective is providing information and training for physicians, nurses, nursing aides and other staff to help manage patient care. This should include psychiatric care for patients with escalating levels of depression, agitation or psychosis, and hospital care for acute agitation or psychosis in both public and private hospital settings. In addition, psychosocial support services must be available to families that allow for the continued home-care of loved ones when illness or other emergency strikes the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>To improve coordination of care and to share information on Alzheimer's disease care and best practices, the Advisory Council should advocate for the creation of regional Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers that leverage existing infrastructure and resources. Memory Evaluation and Treatment Centers should focus on developing, improving and disseminating best practices in clinical care for people with Alzheimer's disease and family caregivers. The Centers are necessary to ensure the translation of clinical research into practice. There should be particular focus on advances related to identification of persons with genetic mutations and persons with genetic, biological and environmental risk factors, and to the implementation of biomarker-based risk assessments. Such Centers will also serve to mobilize assessed populations for clinical trials of new prevention and disease modifying treatments.</p>
<p><em><strong>2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease </strong></em></p>
<p>Often, even though a physician has identified cognitive impairment, the diagnosed individual and his or her family are not told of the diagnosis. Further, once a diagnosis is made and disclosed, as few as half of diagnosed individuals and families receive counseling, support or information about next steps, which would include available home care support, long-term care, and palliative care options and qualifications. This information is important, especially for individuals in the early- stage of the disease who experience positive outcomes when physicians are involved in planning and advance care counseling.</p>
<p>It is especially important that people with Alzheimer's disease and their families are educated early in the disease process about palliative and hospice care. Palliative care is specialized medical care provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers and other specialists who work collaboratively to provide the best possible quality of life for people facing the pain, symptoms and stresses of serious illness, including Alzheimer's disease. Palliative care relieves suffering while affirming life, regards dying as a normal process, and intends neither to hasten nor postpone death. The integration of the psychological aspects of patient care offers a support system to the patient and, when in need, to help the family cope during the bereavement process.</p>
<p><em><strong>New Strategy: Ensure People with Alzheimer's Disease and their Families Have Access to New Alzheimer's Therapies </strong></em></p>
<p>As new biologic therapies are approved for Alzheimer's disease over the coming years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should consider policy safeguards ensuring Medicare beneficiaries have access to these therapies as health care reform provisions are implemented through regulation. This will be particularly important as CMS continues to improve the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) program within Medicare. Under current regulations, ACOs will be allowed to share savings with the government to the extent they can achieve savings from an historic baseline trended forward for ACO patients within Parts A and B of the Medicare program. Due to the absence of spending on biologic therapies for Alzheimer's disease in an ACO's benchmark baseline, it could cause an ACO to be "penalized" for providing the new treatment to its patients. To address this problem, LEAD recommends that CMS create a process under which stakeholders would be able to identify certain high cost or high volume, break-through treatments and request that CMS make a special adjustment to ACO baselines that would remove incentives to underuse the new treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the draft Framework includes goals and strategies seeking to improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that strategies are included that would help individuals with Alzheimer's disease remain in the community by establishing infrastructure to provide resources for family caregivers and support planning for long-term care needs. It is important that the Advisory Council advocate for adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies. Below are LEAD comments on Goal 3 of the Draft Framework:</p>
<p><em><strong>3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally-Sensitive Education, Training and Support Materials by all Health and Social Service Providers who Interact with People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></em></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that both government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care providers require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include assisted living, adult day care, nursing home and home care. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes that includes providers, family caregivers, other advocates and people with dementia.</p>
<p><em><strong>3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being </strong></em></p>
<p>In order to meet the unique care requirements of this population, the Advisory Council must advance proven federal, state and local programs supporting both the diagnosed individual and family. While Federal programs are in place that provide many of the services required by people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level, additional funds should be appropriated to implement evidence-based, non-pharmacologic interventions for people with dementia and their family members.</p>
<p>LEAD members are concerned with the current and proposed cuts to the Administration on Aging's Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program (ADSSP). ADSSP's focus is to expand the availability of diagnostic and support services for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their families, and their caregivers, as well as to improve the responsiveness of the home and community-based care system to persons with dementia. The program focuses on serving hard-to-reach and underserved persons using proven and innovative models. In order to achieve goal 3 in the Framework funding for ADSSP should be increased rather than reduced so that evidence-based programs can continue to support the growing number of people with Alzheimer's disease and their families at the community level.</p>
<p>Below is a list of successful federal programs that the Advisory Council should include and expand upon under strategy 3B in the final plan:</p>
<ul><li>Older Americans Act - Reauthorization of this legislation would ensure grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging.</li>
<li>Lifespan Respite Care Act -- Reauthorization of this legislation would authorize grants to statewide respite care service providers. Grants can be used for various purposes, including training and recruiting workers and volunteers, training family caregivers and providing information about available services.</li>
<li>National Family Caregivers Support Program - At a minimum, funding levels should meet the recommended levels of the President's FY12 budget ($192 million). This program provides grants to states and territories to pay for a range of programs assisting family and informal caregivers to care for loved ones at home and for as long as possible. In addition, this program should add the family caregiver assessment to the list of services for which states can use program funds.</li>

<ul><li>I think we as a field need more research on the clinical and pathological definition of AD, its relation to microvascular diseases and to other types of neurodegenerative disorders, and its genetics vs. environmental factors. Large-scale genetics as done in the autism field would be particularly helpful.</li>
<li>It seems to me that the value of solid reproducible fundamental research should be more emphasized. At present, there are many stories coming out in the AD field in major journals almost every week, but at least some of these stories, may be the majority even, turn out to be simply wrong after closer consideration. I have the impression that we need to emphasize that at present there really are not that many 'translatable' research findings, and that obtaining a better fundamental definition of the underlying biology may be boring, but is necessary.</li>

<td>HHS and its Federal partners will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease and manage and treat its symptoms. HHS will build on recent advances and expand research to identify molecular underlying mechanisms in areas such as genetics, protein aggregation, neurovascular biology, and the cell and molecular biology of the nervous system to identify risk and protective factors as well as new candidate therapies. To achieve this strategy, new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions.</td>

<td>To me, an important part of the initiative is "Strategy 1.B Enhance Scientific Research..." The FDA really does need to "<strong>aggressively conduct clinical trials on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic ways to prevent Alzheimer's disease</strong>". Human clinical trials provide crucial information about which targets and mechanisms are most valid and currently they are a bottle neck for advancing our understanding. Basic research using transgenic models has identified a large number of potential mechanisms and targets, but we won't know which leads are most promising until they are tested in humans. There is increasing evidence that the disease process starts well before cognitive symptoms, so clinical trials designed to prevent AD could be the key to providing a therapeutic breakthrough.</td>

<td>Amy R. Borenstein, Ph.D., FAAN James A. Mortimer, Ph.D, FAAN (University of South Florida (via Alz Forum))</td>
<td>We and others have shown that given a level of pathology, people with more brain reserve can delay their symptoms of AD. What has not been done is to test interventions that increase brain reserve in population-based samples in the community. Most intervention studies of non-pharmacologic agents thus far have used volunteer subjects. We don't know which non-pharmacologic interventions work best in the population at large, and we don't know the relative ranking of such interventions, or if and how they interact with one another. Also, we feel strongly that interventions should be done on information that is personalized. In other words, someone who does not exercise and smokes should be targeted on these factors, whereas someone else who is obese and has diabetes should be targeted on those factors. Also, while biomarkers indicate that we can predict about 10 years before symptoms who is going down a malignant trajectory vs. a more normal trajectory, we know that the pathology of AD develops over decades, and that prevention must occur at a much younger age.
<p>								Therefore, what is needed in the NAPA are community-based studies of young-middle aged adults. We would need to gather careful epidemiologic data, including family history, head trauma, vascular diseases, exercise habits, diet, cognitive and social stimulation, and measures such as BMI, waist and head circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, insulin levels, DNA (APOE and others) and follow these populations over time with neuropsychologic measures and perhaps with MRI. AD is a complex disease occurring probably over the lifespan, and if we had a large enough population-based study we could design the study cleverly so that we can see what is happening at different, say, 5-year age groups over the life course (beginning perhaps as low as 20).</p>
<p>								Biomarkers are good for predicting high-risk individuals about 10 years before symptoms occur. This is occurring over a back-drop of decades of accumulating pathologies. We don't just want to predict who is at high risk - we want to take those people (and perhaps those at moderate risk) and put them into prevention programs to delay onset of the disease. If we only have the prediction part and not the prevention part, we will not be successful in Goal 1. The study does not have to be decades long, but it must have a sufficient number of people to accomplish the goal of discovering which preventions work best (by explaining the population attributable risk) and which interact.</p>
<p>								We have proposed such a study to be done in China where there is a lot of vascular brain disease and where it is easy to get thousands of people involved on a detailed research level but while we were well reviewed in study section our grant did not get funded. Dr. Mortimer and I would be happy to be involved in the design of an observational/interventional epidemiologic study in population-based subjects of primary preventions.</p></td>

<td>David Holtzman (Washington University School of Medicine)</td>
<td>Significant advances in the use of imaging and biomarkers in brain, blood, and spinal fluids have made it possible to detect the onset of Alzheimer's disease, track its progression and monitor the effects of treatment in people with the disease. Without these advances, these neurodegenerative processes could only be evaluated in non-living tissues. Accelerated research will improve and expand the application of biomarkers in research and practice. These advances have shown that the brain changes that lead to Alzheimer's disease begin up to 15 years before symptoms. Identifying imaging and other biomarkers in presymptomatic people will facilitate earlier diagnoses in clinical settings, as well as aid in the development of more efficient interventions to slow or delay progression. While additional work needs to be done on biomarkers, we have enough information now that should allow secondary prevention trials in presymptomatic people to begin immediately with the most effective therapies.</td>

<td><strong><em>Charlie Glabe</em></strong> (University of California Davis)</td>
<td>When these trials fail, they don't tell us anything useful because the rationale for testing them was that they were harmless rather than their targets were implicated in the disease. They need to be more aggressive in testing other compounds that have a strong mechanistic rationale for prevention. If the government thinks that it will just "continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials", then they are blowing smoke because what they are doing now is not aggressive. In cancer trials, the FDA has approved trials where the treatment has killed a substantial percentage of the group because it had the potential to cure some of them and they were all going to die soon anyway. The FDA just doesn't look at AD the same way. The most significant thing to accomplish is to change the way the FDA looks at clinical trials for AD. We have lots of targets and drugs that just aren't getting tried on a reasonable time frame.</td>

<td>
<ul><li>Make "third party" or "pass through" Alzheimer's organizations (such as Cure Alzheimer's Fund) eligible for federal funding. The funding should NOT be used for organizational overhead or indirect expenses, but should be used by the organization to fund breakthrough Alzheimer's research. Such organizations are excellent "aggregators" and consortia builders --- much better than the research institutions themselves which have more of an interest in funding their own institutions. Private, non-bricks-and-mortar organizations are designed to put together leading researchers for innovative research. Help from the government for these kinds of initiatives has the potential to move the field much farther much faster.</li>
<li>Similarly, there should be more opportunity for co-funding of projects from government and private entities. Matching funds from the government for private initiatives, or the other way around, could generate considerably more private capital for focused, high level science than is the case today.</li>

<td>In regard to 1E below, there is nothing wrong with what is stated but this is not the problem! We need treatments! If there is nothing to disseminate, 1E is a waste of time. Currently, promising research and interventions are published in the research literature and presented at scientific meetings. Additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, industry, and public health systems quickly and accurately.

<td>I feel there is a gap there on a larger scale although there have been some good examples as well how to breach that gap. One problem when you talk with clinicians is that many of them still view Alzheimer's disease to be a very separate category from so-called 'vascular-dementia', although vascular factors and circulatory problems in brain including blood-brain barrier problems have been frequently indentified in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In that regard the present document is not clear about whether the goal will be to cure dementias of either Alzheimer's type or so-called vascular, which to my own bias is only a different phenotypic expression of similar diseases that in some cohorts more openly shows vascular feature than in others. I feel this issue should be addressed somehow because this might impact the numbers.
<p>								Another gap is between genetic studies and the biology of disease. For example, we still do not know how mutations in some genes that have been recently associated with sporadic AD relate to the biology of disease. More specific emphasis perhaps can be placed on these studies.</p>
<p>								In general it will be great to expand Strategy 1E with some more specific examples. But, perhaps that can be done after the May summit which I understand should provide some concrete guidance on the research priorities. Are we going to be represented at the May summit?</p></td>

<ol><li><strong>Committing Additional Resources to Research</strong><br />
										The planned NIA sponsored conference in May 2012 will provide invaluable insight into the goals and strategies required to achieve the goal of a treatment/prevention by the year 2025. However, while a reorganization and coordination across all research domains will increase research productivity, without additional research funds, the goals of having a treatment/prevention by 2025 is likely unattainable. There is currently no effective treatment for AD and thus additional funds are necessary to promote basic research, translational research, drug development and clinical research. Currently, funding rates at NIH and most non-profits is in the single digits (5-10% of all grant being funded), thus leaving a very large number of meritorious applications (the top 20-25%) unfunded. If we are truly serious about achieving the goals set forth in the Draft Framework, additional federal, non-profit and industrial investments in Alzheimer's research have to be part of the answer. While there will likely a considerable debate about the exact amount of investment required to achieve this goal, a starting point would likely be $2 billion/year as put forward in the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2010. As clearly laid out in the attached paper by myself, Dr. Todd Golde and Dr. Doug Galasko, similar types of investments in other diseases (i.e., HIV/AIDS) have proven transformative and lead to effective therapies. While I appreciate that the current funding climate is very tight and highly political, it is only with these types of investments are we likely to transform the Alzheimer's research endeavor and achieve Goal 1 of the Framework.</li>
<li><strong>Strategies/Goals</strong><br />
										The conference in May of 2012 will certainly help identify the key research areas that need to be addressed to achieve Goal 1 of the Framework. As part of the detailed National Plan, it will be important to both identify these targets as well as commit funding commensurate to achieve the goals identified. Funding one research domain at the expense of another with not enable us to achieve the ultimate goal laid out in the Framework. For each target, clear goals must be identified and a infrastructure/organization (see below) put in place to regularly assess progress within these areas.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure/Organization</strong><br />
										To achieve Goal 1 of the Framework, it will be absolutely critical to have an infrastructure and organization that can coordinate federal research efforts across all funding agencies, interact with non-profits and industry, promote awareness of the disease and the role that research will play in combating the disease as well as reporting to the Advisory Council directly as outlined in the Framework. In order for this organization/infrastructure to be truly successful and transformative, it will be essential that its efforts are entirely focused on combating Alzheimer's disease. This will provide a uniquely focused organization that will have the most chance of success. A similar "disease-focused" agency was created in 1988 for HIV/AIDS entitled the "Office of AIDS Research" (OAR) within the Office of the NIH Director, that played a key role in successfully coordinating the federal response to AIDS. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 strengthened the OAR, providing it with increased authority in the planning, coordination and evaluation of AIDS research. If we are truly serious about transforming Alzheimer's research and achieving the goals laid out in the Framework, a similar type of organizational structure (perhaps an Office of Alzheimer's Research?) is required.</li>

<td>My bias is to support Goal 1 of the Draft Framework in order to raise urgency, create more awareness and focus resources on the issue.
<p>								However, for this to be an effective strategy, we need to be able to:</p>
<ol><li>Set a time limit as is being suggested.</li>
<li>Define the goal as precisely as we can. Does our goal mean: " Delay onset of Alzheimer's disease, minimize its symptoms, and delay its progression" as the text goes on to say in this Goal? If so, we need objective metrics to measure these outcomes. We also need to be clear about expectations around the nature of the therapies to be developed. Almost certainly there will not be one blockbuster drug that "cures" people, but rather different interventions used at different phases of the pathology and with different genotypes. This is not easy stuff to convey --- no bumper sticker phrasing here, but rather a need to be patient and clear about the expectations for effective therapies. To mount an all-out national effort, we need to be very clear about the endpoint, "aspirational" or not.</li>
<li>Suggest at least the order of magnitude of the resources needed to achieve the goal.</li>
</ol><p>								It has been pointed out that setting these objectives is risky business. Particularly in AD, but not unique to the field, some researchers and others have raised false hope and expectations repeatedly with promises of a "cure within the next five years" for a long time. Credibility for this effort and responsibility to patients and their families demands that we define our objectives as carefully as we can within the context of an aspirational goal.</p>
<p>								Finally, we need to emphasize that this focus on research is not at the expense of, but in support of clinical efforts to help people already affected. The language concluding this goal does this and should be retained and if anything, strengthened.</p>
<p>								HHS will prioritize and accelerate the pace of scientific research and ensure that as evidence-based solutions are identified they are quickly translated, put into practice, and brought to scale so that individuals with Alzheimer's disease can benefit from increases in scientific knowledge.</p></td>

<td>One thing that strikes me over and over is that when people go to their "regular" practioners, they often get very vague information and appropriate diagnoses. People who go to most geriatricians get the latest information.
<p>								Somehow we need to have training for the variety of family and internal medicine practioners, and even specialists to enable them to recognize the early/all signs of the various dementias and the overlaps of the various complications such as diabetes, concussions, and Parkinson's etc. Without specific education of the medical community in the form of continuing education, all the research in the world won't be disseminated and used to its potential. We need further training of all doctors to recognize the problems, and make the connections to a disease that devastates!</p>
<p>								I hope these ideas will be included as part of the national plan proposed.</p></td>

<p>Respite Care Funds for Care Givers:</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of the thousands of members of the National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners, Certified Dementia Practitioners CDP members, NCCDP Certified Alzheimer's and dementia Trainers, Certified Dementia Care Managers (Dementia Unit Managers) CDCM, NCCDP Associate Members, NCCDP Corporate Members and Certified First Responder Dementia Trainers CFRDT.</p>
<p>Respite Care funds must be made available for those people who lack private resources, funds, transportation and family support. Many caregivers provide 24 hour care in their home with no break, financial assistance or outside help. This leaves the care giver exhausted. Many of our nations care givers are elderly themselves. Caring for someone with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or dementia is a full time job. Care givers provide full time supervision, medication disbursements, ADL care (bathing, toileting and dressing), housekeeping services, meal preparation, transportation to and from appointments, etc. Many are unable to work due to the time required to care for a loved one. This depletes their funds.</p>
<p>The respite funds should be used to either place a loved one in adult day care program, hire a private duty aide/home health aide, have a senior companion volunteer come to the home, utilize nursing home and assisted living respite services or whatever community program that works for the Care Giver.</p>
<p>Currently, care givers are exhausted with no relief in sight. Many are depressed and lonely. They are cut off from their friends, church members and neighbors. They are unable to enjoy a quality of life many of us who are not full time care givers take for granted. They are unable to go to church, participate in a hobby or any other social event. Just going grocery shopping is challenging.</p>
<p>Isolation can also lead to abuse and neglect. Most care givers have the best intentions but abuse and neglect can happens when there is stress, isolation, lack of funding and lack of support.</p>
<p>Where there are respite services in a state the Care giver lacks funding and transportation. I saw first hand as a facilitator of a support group the desperate needs of the care givers. Some respite services are time consuming with lengthy paper work required. There may be waiting lists making respite services unattainable when they need it the most. Many community respite services require the care giver to transport their loved one and they are unable to provide this. Or there may be no respite community services with in their community.</p>
<p>There must be state and federal funds available for caregivers without funding to use for respite services. Each community should be looking at ways to keep the patient in the home and provide the care giver options such as home care respite services, assisted living and nursing home respite services and volunteer senior companion programs all of which provides options for the care giver.</p>

<p>It must be mandatory that all health care professionals who work in nursing homes, assisted living, CCRC, adult day care, hospice agencies, home care agencies, hospitals, senior living communities and any other setting that provides services to the geriatric population receive at minimum of 8 hours of "LIVE" Alzheimer's and dementia education by certified Alzheimer's and dementia trainers.</p>
<p>There must be continued ongoing education through out the year once they have received the initial training that deals with new advances, regulatory changes, culture change and abuse / neglect concerns. The state regulations for dementia education is different in each state and for each type of service industry. Care providers, front line staff and health care professionals must all receive a minimum of 8 hours of live Alzheimer's and dementia education and ongoing Alzheimer's and dementia education to insure competent and compassionate care. There are currently no national standards. The new federal standard being considered <strong>should not target</strong> one specific profession but must be all inclusive and include all health care professionals and front line staff who work with the geriatric population.</p>
<p>It must be mandated at the federal level so that all states are in compliance with mandatory live dementia education. Further more, all First Responders which includes Law Enforcement EMT's and Fire Fighters also receive comprehensive Alzheimer's dementia education. As they come face to face with the geriatric population in their community but are ill equipped due to lack of Alzheimer's and dementia education to deal with concerns affecting the geriatric populations such as recognizing abuse / neglect in the home, driving concerns in the elderly. aggressive behaviors and elopement.</p>
<p>Profit and not for profit companies and organizations should be included in a list of organizations and companies who offer live dementia education. There should be a national list of companies who can offer these services. The list should <strong><em>not be regulated</em></strong> nor designed for non profit training organizations but include for profit companies as well. Health Care organizations, First Responders and companies should have the option to pick and choose which organization they wish to utilize to provide live dementia education to their staff.</p>
<p>The initial live Alzheimer's Dementia education should be live training provided by live instructors who are certified Alzheimer's and dementia trainers vs utilizing video and online Alzheimer's and dementia training to insure that the health care professional and front line staff understands the material. It is critical that they be given the opportunity to interact with the instructor, ask questions and be provided the opportunity to discuss issues and concerns they may have. This can not happen with videos and online training. We respect this option for education for ongoing education through out the year but not in place of the initial live training. The National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners provides live Alzheimer's and dementia education as well as dementia certification to front line staff, health care professionals, dementia unit managers and First Responders. The National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioners also provides train the trainer and certifies trainers as Certified Alzheimer's and Dementia Trainer and Certified First Responder Dementia Trainer who in turn utilize current and most up to date NCCDP curriculum.</p>
