<p>I am Matthew Janicki. Along with my colleague, Dr. Seth M. Keller, we are the Co-Chairs of the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices -- the "NTG". The NTG is a national group affiliated with the American Academy on Developmental Medicine and Dentistry and the University of Illinois's Center on Developmental Disabilities and Health. We are a membership organization supported by a range of formal and informal organizations and are made up of more than 250 members -- representing a broad range of interests focusing on advocating for solutions to issues faced by adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia -- and their families and formal caregivers. The mission of the NTG is multifaceted:</p>
<ul><li>Promote adoption of a specialized screening instrument and process.</li>
<li>Define ways to assess 'cognitive impairment' as part of the annual wellness visit requirement under the Affordable Care Act.</li>
<li>Develop practice guidelines for health and social care practitioners.</li>
<li>Promote 'best practice' service models and systems of care that meet the unique needs of individuals with disabilities and their caregivers.</li>
<li>Aid families by providing information and aids for coping with dementia and its challenges.</li>
<li>Assist in adoptions of standards of care.</li>
<li>Institute public education and training programs.</li>
<li>Collaborate with national and regional organizations in public education, legislative and services development campaigns.</li>
</ul><p>The NTG also has been working in concert with the activities emanating from the <em>National Alzheimer's Project Act</em> (NAPA) to <strong>raise awareness within the context of NAPA of the needs of adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia, and their families and other caregivers</strong>. Over the past five years we have watched the Council address a number of issues affecting people with dementia in general, and have been pleased by the actions cited in the Plan related to intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>We appreciate the work of the Advisory Council and welcome those of you who are new members and trust you will help address the continued mission of the Council and its work as per the <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. With this in mind we would like you to know why focal consideration needs to be given to people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<ul><li>Even as most adults with intellectual disabilities are affected by forms of dementia at the same rate as other adults, adults with Down syndrome are at extreme high risk for dementia and most show early onset and compromised longevity.</li>
<li>Early identification of signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment and dementia among adults with intellectual disability is an important first step in managing the course of the disease and providing quality care -- but typical assessment and diagnostic measures are not appropriate for this population due to variability of cognitive abilities.</li>
<li>Many organizations providing community supports are still unprepared to adapt their care practices for older adults who are experiencing decline due to dementia and are in great need of technical assistance and access to creative models of community care.</li>
<li>A large number of older-aged adults with intellectual disabilities live with their families and dementia-related impairments increase the challenges for, and oftentimes overwhelm the capacities of, older caregivers.</li>
<li>An emerging model of dementia-capable' out-of-home care is the use of small community-based group homes and more technical assistance is needed to help providers adapt their care practices to make optimal use of this model.</li>
<li>Supportive education, training, and services can help caregivers minimize fatigue and prevent burnout, and help maintain affected older adults in community settings, but more coordinative and specialized education and training is needed.</li>
<li>Collaborative efforts at the local level, among disability, aging, and health providers can be effective in adapting services and supports to aid adults affected by dementia, as well as their caregivers -- and more emphasis on such collaboration is needed at the state and local level.</li>
<li>With appropriate services, adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia can continue to have quality lives in community settings and because of the presence of such settings the unnecessary institutionalization of older adults simply because dementia is present can be avoided.</li>
</ul><p>In today's remarks, on behalf of Dr. Keller, myself, and the NTG, we would like to offer our appreciation to the Council and its federal partners in their on-going efforts in recognizing the special needs of aging adults with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia and responding to the issues we have raised over the past five years. We are particularly appreciative of the results of the current series of awards by the Administration on Community Living for the Alzheimer's Disease Initiative grants and the special consideration given to intellectual disabilities, and to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for its multiple awards under the Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP) and its willingness to draw from the NTG's national education curriculum on dementia and intellectual disabilities so as to assure that issues related to intellectual disabilities will be covered in the education and training to be undertaken by the awardees. We are also very appreciative of the National Institute of Health (NIH) for its efforts to seek out solutions leading to the early identification of Alzheimer's disease in people with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities via the funding of two major multi-site studies designed to identify biomarkers among adults with Down syndrome, as well as support other dementia-related research among persons with lifelong disabilities.</p>
<p>Lastly, the NTG would like to offer its support to the pending proposal to establish a dementia-related caregiving summit among the federal partners and non-governmental organizations, and looks forward to the inclusion of issues facing caregivers of aging people with intellectual disabilities affected by early, mid-stage, and advanced dementia.</p>
<p>We thank the Chair for this opportunity to address the Council and look forward to continued fruitful collaborative endeavors designed to achieve the goals of the National Plan by 2025.</p>

<p>Hello and thank you for another opportunity to address the council. On behalf of The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration I would first like to thank the new council members for agreeing to serve as members of the advisory council and contributing their time and expertise to this important project. My name is Matthew Sharp, Program Manager for AFTD. For those who do not already know AFTD, we are the only national non-profit advocacy organization dedicated to frontotemporaldegeneration in all its various forms. AFTD's mission includes: raising public and professional awareness of FTD, supporting research to effectively treat and ultimately cure the disease and improving the quality of life for all people coping with the related dementia, FTD.</p>
<p>AFTD is sorely disappointed that none of the 5 nominees we proposed or supported to serve on the advisory council were selected. However we do appreciate that at least one new council member with expertise in a non-Alzheimer's dementia was selected and are glad Angela Taylor from LBDA has agreed to serve a term on the council. The secretary would be hard-pressed to find a more dedicated, knowledgeable and articulate advocate to represent Lewy Body and the other "related dementias" to advise and inform the National Plan.</p>
<p>Ms. Taylor's selection is an excellent step toward continued inclusion of the non-Alzheimer's dementias in the National Plan. Her perspective and expertise will continue to ensure that NAPA benefits all those affected by dementia.</p>
<p>While we congratulate the Secretary for adding such an excellent advocate to the council AFTD still recognizes the need for additional expertise and perspectives regarding the related dementias and especially FTD. As AFTD and Ms. Taylor suggested at prior council meetings adding a seat on the advisory council specifically for the related dementias is perhaps the simplest way to ensure that all relevant perspectives are brought to bear on the immense task before the council and will help accomplish the ultimate goal of the ending Alzheimer's disease and related dementias by 2025.</p>
<p>On another note, I am excited to share with Council the news that with the help of a generous donor AFTD is initiating a $5 million biomarkers initiative. Dedicated to stimulating discovery and development of biomarkers specifically for the various FTD clinical disorders and pathologies, we anticipate investing these funds October 20, 2015 over the course of the next 5 years and plan to leverage this investment to attract additional funding from various parties in the private sector.</p>
<p>I will also note that the AFTD Biomarkers Initiative is directly responsive to one of the recommendations to come out of the 2013 NAPA ADRD conference, which was--and I quote--to <em>Develop FTD biomarkers for diagnosis and disease progression. </em>In this, as in all programs we sponsor, AFTD is pleased to represent our community and cognizant that success in developing biomarkers to accurately diagnose or track progression of any of the FTD subtypes will also inform similar initiatives for Alzheimer's and all of the related neurodegenerative disorders, including Lewy body dementia, Parkinson's disease and ALS.</p>
<p>I look forward to keeping this council apprised of our progress and, as always, appreciate the opportunity to speak on behalf of our patients, their families, and the professionals who work with them.</p>

<p>Good afternoon. My name is Ian Kremer and I serve as executive director of Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (the LEAD Coalition). The LEAD Coalition is a diverse and growing national coalition of 77 member organizations [<a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/">http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/</a>] including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, home and residential care providers, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. LEAD is co-convened by the Alzheimer's Foundation of America and USAgainstAlzheimer's. The coalition works collaboratively to focus the nation's strategic attention on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and to accelerate transformational progress in: detection and diagnosis; care and support to enrich quality of life; and research leading to prevention, effective treatment and eventual cure. For more information about the LEAD Coalition, please contact me.</p>
<p>Congratulations and best wishes to the newly appointed members of the Advisory Council. We look forward to you building on the strong legacy of your predecessors, forging even more productive bonds with your colleagues, and being the catalysts for truly transformational progress in the quality of life for people facing dementia and the scientific pursuit of a world without dementia.</p>
<p>For the past several years, I have said during the public comment portion of Advisory Council meetings that the National Plan needed to match the aspirational and transformative 2025 goal for biomedical progress with similarly aspirational and transformative goals for clinical care and long term services and supports. At the Advisory Council's July 27 meeting, that conviction appeared to have sunk in with quite a few of the Council members. In particular, I want to thank Laurel Coleman and Harry Johns for their expressions not only of exasperation but of determination that this Advisory Council, this National Plan, and this country must achieve vast improvements in quality of life for those living with dementia and for their families.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I'll offer a sample of a dozen actions that might help the Advisory Council get started (I'll be happy to flesh out any of these points):</p>
<ul><li>Because the National Plan should be about person-centered progress that improves lives, not about issuing reports, holding events, and delivering units of training or service: <strong>work with public and private stakeholders to establish an ambitious national goal -- with metrics and milestones -- for lowering rates (among people with dementia and their caregivers) of isolation; neglect, abuse, and exploitation; falls; wandering; premature institutional placement; depression; pain; impoverishment; and inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in home and community-based care settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Because transformative innovation requires multi-sector collaboration, strong coordination, and a purposeful confluence of priority-setting, resource commitment, and accountability: <strong>recommend that the National Plan include creation of a dementia care a services parallel to the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (being led by NIH in the biomedical research sphere)</strong>.</li>
<li>Because people living with dementia and family caregivers should have an easier time participating in and contributing to the Advisory Council process ("Nothing About Us Without Us"): <strong>the Advisory Council should conduct regularly scheduled public listening sessions in-person around the country or at least by web-conference and social media (e.g. Google Hangouts, Twitter Chats); add a "Comments" form to its ASPE website; add to each workgroup additional members (non-voting, if statutorily necessary) who are living with dementia or are caregivers; and consult with disabilities experts about other accommodations that would facilitate greater access and participation</strong>.</li>
<li>Because there is dignity in knowing your diagnosis and because diagnosis is the door to quality care, self-determination, and advancing social and biomedical research: <strong>work with public and private stakeholders to establish an ambitious national goal -- with metrics and milestones -- for rates of accurate, timely, and actionable diagnosis</strong>.</li>
<li>Because this is a national plan -- not a federal plan -- and quality of life issues are in no small measure defined by state and local policies and practices: <strong>actively engage in the National Plan process the National Governors Association, the National Council of State Legislatures, the National Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the National League of Cities to determine their capacity, interests, and best-practices</strong>.</li>
<li>Because, by statute and by common sense, Congress is a stakeholder in the NAPA process: <strong>work with the relevant congressional committees, the House and Senate Alzheimer's Task Forces, the congressional caregiver caucus, and the congressional neuroscience caucus to more deeply engage them in the advisory council's work whether by attending meetings, appearing as guest presenters, or simply making sure they receive meeting agendas, announcements and links to materials and meeting videos</strong>.</li>
<li>Because dementia is an enormous and under-addressed workplace challenge both for employers and employees: <strong>actively engage in the National Plan process the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, the Society of Human Resource Managers, and representatives of both the business and labor communities to quantify those challenges and identify best-practices to change outcomes</strong>.</li>
<li>Because most people living with dementia and their caregivers have additional health challenges: <strong>actively engage public and private stakeholders focused on commonly co-occurring medical conditions -- such as diabetes, cardio-vascular disease, mental health disorders, hearing loss, and mobility loss -- to participate in the NAPA process of developing recommendations and action plans to improve quality of life</strong>.</li>
<li>Because dementia does note respect state borders: <strong>help states not only to share best-practices but also to form inter-state collaborations to address the needs of people living with dementia and their families who cross those state borders for services and for reasons of shared family caregiving</strong>.</li>
<li>Because dementia does not respect international borders either in its challenges or its solutions: <strong>formalize the National Plan goals and objectives with milestones and metrics about fostering international collaboration on research investments and priorities, regulatory harmonization, and translation and scaling of clinical and care practices</strong>.</li>
<li>Because living with dementia and caregiving for people with dementia is hard enough under normal circumstances but far more difficult during, or in the wake of, natural disasters: <strong>encourage the Federal Emergency Management Agency to participate in the NAPA Process to help develop recommendations and action plans to meet the ongoing and emerging needs of individuals, families, and institutions</strong>.</li>
<li>Because the Advisory Council is a bully pulpit: <strong>be vocal, candid, and relentless is pressing Congress to end sequestration and lift the budget caps that do very real harm to millions of people living with dementia today and in the future</strong>.</li>
</ul><p>In closing, I offer my apologies for topics I have failed to address and I offer my thanks to others making public comments addressing such omissions. I offer my appreciation to Advisory Council members and staff who give of their minds and hearts beyond what words can express. I offer my hope to all those living with dementia and their loved ones that they will be heard, heeded, and healed through the work we all do together.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>There is much to praise and to be grateful for in the 2015 National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Thanks to Secretary Burwell, Assistant Secretary Frank, Deputy Assistant Secretary Elam for their leadership on the plan and the impressive progress that has been made since 2011 in all areas.</p>
<p>Calls for additional investment in Alzheimer's disease research and care have been a consistent theme in the 3.5 years since the National Alzheimer's Project Act was implemented. The 25% increase in AD research funding at the NIH since 2011 is significant and appreciated.</p>
<p>A larger issue that we've been discussing around NIH funding prioritization is for NIH to consider costs to public healthcare programs (i.e. Medicare and Medicaid) as part of its prioritization for research investment in specific conditions. Economic burden on public healthcare programs is <strong>not</strong> currently considered as part of the existing strategic planning process at NIH. An April 2014 GAO [<a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/gao-14-246">http://www.gao.gov/products/gao-14-246</a>] study found that the five selected ICs--awarding the largest amount of research funding--that it reviewed did so considering similar factors and using various priority-setting approaches. In priority setting, IC officials reported taking into consideration scientific needs and opportunities, gaps in funded research, the burden of disease in a population, and public health need, such as an emerging public health threat like influenza that needs to be addressed. Those are all very valid and important considerations, but we would argue that costs to healthcare programs should also be a part of the research funding prioritization equation.</p>
<p>We encourage everyone here to take up this issue as part of the request for comment to the NIH-wide Strategic Plan by August 16, and I would ask that ASPE provide the RFI and instructions on how to submit comments at <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=46">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/rfi/rfi.cfm?ID=46</a></p>
<p>Additionally, I want to call everyone's attention to the report FDA released about a week ago called "Targeted Drug Development: Why are Many Diseases Lagging Behind?" that specifically points to the scientific challenges that are thwarting drug development in complex diseases. Alzheimer's is one disease they mentioned <a href="http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/ucm454955.htm">http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/ucm454955.htm</a>. The piece basically say FDA is doing all it can but they need more science: "Like many other diseases of the brain, Alzheimer's illustrates the obstacles to development of biomarkers and targeted drugs when scientific research has not yet uncovered the underlying causes or pathways of a disease." It is sobering report, but very much on point and we look forward to exploring these issues further with the Neurology Review division at our September 16 ACT-AD meeting.</p>
<p>I was excited to see the reference to "expansion and enhancement" of Lifespan Respite Care in the plan as well as the regulatory review of adult day services. Both respite and adult day services are incredibly important aspects of family caregiver support that may reduce or delay institutionalization among individuals with dementia. While the initial work has been promising, these programs need much wider support and coverage in order to meet the huge demand.</p>
<p>I want to say a more specific word about the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer Caregiver Health (REACH) program. Believe it or not, this program was first funded by the NIA and NINR in 1995--20 years ago. There has been a REACH I study and a sequel, REACH II. It has been a VA-wide program since 2011 and AoA has also funded REACH programs throughout the country. Findings from the REACH studies showed improvements across many areas. Caregivers reported less "burden" and depression, and improved emotional well-being overall. They also reported gains in the areas of self-care and healthy behaviors, social support, and management of problem behaviors on the part of their loved ones with Alzheimer's disease. Plus, they gained an hour a day of time that was not consumed with caregiving duties.</p>
<p>While expanding REACH to Indian Country is another great step for this awesome program, I am wondering why HHS has not yet taken the step of making this a CMMI model program, or better yet, just going for it and implementing REACH CMS-wide. How many more years do folks have to wait?</p>
<p>Last, it is terrific that HHS is refreshing the Alzheimer.gov website. Two things I noticed: 1) it takes several clicks to get to specific info on research studies. It would be great if this could be more streamlined and if folks could access it more directly from the home page with a "find out about research studies in your area" subhead.</p>
<p>And 2) the tagline for the site- "alzheimers.gov- for the people helping people with Alzheimer's" seems to unintentionally overlook individuals with the disease, as well as others who may know someone dealing with it, or just want to learn about it. I'd love to see another tagline that invites everyone in. The community needs it, and it's getting bigger and bigger every day.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>NAPA Advisory Council Public Comments for July 27th, 2015</strong></p>
<p>My name is Kennedy O'Donnell. I am a student at Christopher Newport University and I am speaking on behalf of the Dementia Action Alliance. Thank you, NAPA Advisory Council, for giving the public an opportunity to voice their opinions about dementia in the United States.</p>
<p>At almost every summit and conference on dementia in America, the main discourse revolves around cure and treatment. Leaders present the same fearful statistics about the rise of dementia diagnoses in the United States, and urge researchers to put their best foot forward. While researchers are hard at work to eradicate Alzheimer's and related dementias, it is the job of everyone else to truly care for those who currently have dementia. This is a multipronged process that (to name only a few) involves eliminating the heavy negative stigmas of living with dementia, creating support networks, and really listening to what people with dementia have to say.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize the importance of this last point with an anecdote that comes from a video conference call that was hosted by the Dementia Action Alliance just last week. As the call was about to finish, a caregiver informed the group that a man living with Alzheimer's had been listening to the discussion for the past hour, and wanted to speak. After he introduced himself and informed us of the severity of his memory loss, he began to tell us about all the wonderful times children come to his residence and simply sit down and read books with him. He told us that it is the greatest enjoyment he can receive because it makes him "feel like a grandfather again for 20 minutes." Now, I don't know this man personally, and I don't know his family, but I am almost certain he is <em>still</em> a grandfather. He didn't stop being a grandfather just because he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>This man's comments serve as a reminder that a support network for those with dementia should reach beyond their own sons and daughters. As a society, we need to make sure our kids know that they are an integral part of their grandparents' livelihood. Dementia should not change the way a child loves their grandparents, and it is our job to help them continue to feel connected to their whole family. By addressing the importance of the connections between these two generations, we will be educating children, correcting negative stigmas, and, ultimately, helping those with dementia live fully.</p>
<p>The current National Plan to Address Alzheimer's mentions nothing specifically of the disparities between our young and old generations. I am here to ask that NAPA please promote the benefits of intergenerational connectedness for both young children and our older population with dementia.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Public Comments to the NAPA Advisory Council<br />
					July 27, 2015</strong></p>
<p>My name is Karen Love and I am here representing the Dementia Action Alliance. Thank you, NAPA Advisory Council members, for the opportunity to provide comments today. The release of the <em>2015 National Alzheimer's Plan</em> is a testament to the amount of work undertaken by federal agencies since 2011 as well as the many efforts currently underway. Thank you, Dr. Elam and Dr. Petersen, for your committed and able leadership.</p>
<p>To date NAPA has not yet addressed the need for a coordinated, national plan to address societal misperceptions and stigmas about dementia, including Alzheimer's that affects how people live with this chronic condition. The internet has provided a valuable way for people who are living with dementia in the early stages to write about their lived experiences and express how stigmas impact their well-being.</p>
<p>Sandy Halperin, who you met during the April Advisory Council meeting, often has to remind people that he is still living and not dead yet, so please treat him as a living human being. Another outspoken advocate, Harry Urban, writes, "Don't stereotype me or underestimate me because I have Alzheimer's...help us regain respect and dignity so we may have a better quality of life". Imagine having a life-altering health condition AND having to advocate to be treated normally!</p>
<p>Kate Swaffer, diagnosed with young-onset dementia at the age of 49, was told by health care professionals to put her affairs in order and to begin looking into long term care options for later on. Others, including Harry Urban, are given prescriptions and told to come back in six months. Kate coined the term "prescribed disengagement" to describe this mindset. She say, "This sets us up to live a life without hope, without a sense of a future and destroys the notion of well-being." Christine Bryden, in her 2005 book "Dancing with Dementia: My Story of Living Positively with Dementia," says -- "How you relate to us has a big impact on the course of the disease. You can restore our personhood, and give us a sense of being needed and valued...Give us reassurance, hugs, support, a meaning in life. Value us for what we can still do and be."</p>
<p>Most people do not realize they have misperceptions about living with dementia let alone realize the impact the misperceptions have on the emotional and social well-being of individuals who are living with the condition. Understanding how important it is for them to be meaningfully engaged in things they find interesting in daily life, having purpose and being valued are as vital to their well-being as their physical health.</p>
<p>Additionally, many of the words that are widely used are stigmatizing. Often words such as "victim," "demented," and "sufferer" are used to describe a person who has dementia and words including "dementing illness," "tragedy," and "affliction" to define the condition. This type of language can make a tremendous impact on how people living with dementia feel about themselves, and how they are treated and considered by others. Using appropriate words is respectful, supportive, and non-discriminatory.</p>
<p>Under GOAL 4 of the National Plan -- Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement -- we ask you to please include this year in your planning the development of a coordinated public-private, national awareness campaign to educate the public about living with dementia including addressing the stigmas and misperceptions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Statement of:<br />
					Ian N. Kremer, Esq.<br />
					Executive Director<br />
					Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD Coalition)</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon. My name is Ian Kremer and I serve as executive director of Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (the LEAD Coalition). The LEAD Coalition is a diverse and growing national coalition of 76 member organizations [<a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/">http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/</a>] including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, home and residential care providers, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. LEAD is co-convened by the Alzheimer's Foundation of America and USAgainstAlzheimer's. The coalition works collaboratively to focus the nation's strategic attention on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and to accelerate transformational progress in: detection and diagnosis; care and support to enrich quality of life; and research leading to prevention, effective treatment and eventual cure. For more information about the LEAD Coalition, please contact me at: ikremer@leadcoalition.org.</p>
<p>Typically, my public comments at the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services meetings are based on what has been presented and discussed by Advisory Council members to that point in the meeting day. In light of the recent request for comments to be submitted several days in advance of the meeting, this document submitted on July 22 attempts to anticipate what I might wish to say on July 27. I hope that the Advisory Council will forgive me any extemporaneous remarks that I might offer during the public comment session on July 27.</p>
<p>I must begin by recognizing HHS staff and Secretary Burwell for the recently published <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease: 2015 Update</em> [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/NatlPlan2015.shtml">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/NatlPlan2015.shtml</a>]. The 2015 Update reflects enormous good work done to date and constructive work being planned. It is particularly valuable that the 2015 Update reminds us all that the National Alzheimer's Project Act called for a 'national' rather than 'federal' plan. While many of us outside government will continue to call for even more robust federal efforts in a number of areas (including and particularly areas in which the 2015 Update appears to come up short of the Advisory Council's recommendations), it is essential that those of us in the private sector continue to look for ways in which we can collaborate with federal partners and work to fill gaps in federal efforts. Exemplary of productive collaboration between private and federal partners is the recently announced launch of the Dementia Friendly America initiative [<a href="http://www.dfamerica.org/">http://www.dfamerica.org/</a>] to build dementia friendly communities across the country. More than 50 national organizations and several federal agencies have worked together closely to reach this starting point. Our success depends on that collaboration growing more robust, more imbedded in the organizational cultures of our public and private partners, and on us sustaining our moral and substantive commitment to be guided in our work by those who rightly measure our results: people with dementia and their loved ones whose quality of life we seek to transform. National organizations interested in learning more about the Dementia Friendly America initiative are encouraged to contact us at: partners@dfamerica.org.</p>
<p>I also want to take a moment to thank the organizers, sponsors, attendees, presenters, and journalists reporting on last week's Alzheimer's Association International Conference [<a href="https://www.alz.org/aaic/">https://www.alz.org/aaic/</a>]. It isn't enough that important science be conducted. It must be exposed to scrutiny, put in context, disseminated among colleagues, and understood by those who fund, who volunteer, who stand to benefit. Children wonder how Santa delivers all those packages in a single night; I wonder how Maria Carrillo herds 4,000 scientists for a week. Somehow -- perhaps with the help of Alzheimer's Association elves -- magic happens and we're all the better for it.</p>
<p>Today's Advisory Council meeting focus on non-Alzheimer's dementias [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/meetings.shtml#Jul2015">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/meetings.shtml#Jul2015</a>] -- while overdue -- is highly encouraging. I hope it represents a sustained commitment both to discuss and to substantively address these issues more consistently in the Advisory Council and National Plan Update processes. Certainly, the upcoming ADRD Summit organized by NINDS provides another important pivot point for the Advisory Council and Plan Update processes to engage non-Alzheimer's dementias more effectively.</p>
<p>While we all ought to be sympathetic to the limitations of time and other resources available to the Advisory Council, to make the Plan genuinely 'national' and not only 'federal,' it is essential to find creative, manageable and productive ways to add more -- and more diverse -- voices. A number of us have encouraged expansion of the Advisory Council to include both more appointees living with dementia and more representatives from non-Alzheimer's dementia communities. Those remain good, constructive, and achievable recommendations; as private sector stakeholders, we are ready to work with our federal partners to achieve the achievable. Similarly, I would encourage collaboration between private sector stakeholders and our federal partners to find new and better ways for people to participate in the Advisory Council process even if they are unable to attend the quarterly meetings in Washington or do not want to be limited to submitting written comments or watching a live-streaming video. While those options may be sufficient for some, clearly they are inadequate for many. Just to offer one example (and I have others), with support from private sector stakeholders, it ought to possible to conduct regularly scheduled public input listening sessions around the country, attended by Advisory Council members either in person or at least by video feed who then could report back to the full Advisory Council.</p>
<p>This is a time of great and deserved hope in dementia. No one could miss the depth and breadth of attention devoted to dementia throughout the White House Conference on Aging (thank you Nora Super, AARP, and everyone else who led and contributed). We all anticipate anxiously NIH's so-called "bypass budget" [<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/features/nih-estimate-total-funding-needs-alzheimers-research">https://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/features/nih-estimate-total-funding-needs-alzheimers-research</a>] recommendation for federal funding needed to reach the 2025 goal. The advocacy and research communities have been vigorous in encouraging NIH to be bold in its recommendation and take confidence in the legislation put forward by the House and Senate appropriations committees along with the 21st Century Cures legislation. Shortly after the Advisory Council's last meeting, 137 LEAD Coalition member organizations and other supporters submitted to HHS a recommendation that federal agencies and private sector stakeholders partner to organize and conduct a dementia care and services research summit [<a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/?wpfb_dl=158">http://www.leadcoalition.org/?wpfb_dl=158</a>]. HHS recently responded that Secretary Burwell will ask the Advisory Council for guidance so -- on behalf of those 137 signatories -- I'll take this opportunity to encourage the Advisory Council to advise the Secretary to be bold in collaborating with us to identify research gaps and priorities as well as opportunities to translate and scale what we know already to be effective in improving the quality of life for the most important stakeholders: people living with dementia and their care partners. And in the best interests of those most important stakeholders, we will begin now with our private sector partners to develop the resources necessary to conduct such a summit as soon as our federal partners are ready to join us.</p>
<p>The need for wide dissemination of effective care and services interventions is highlighted in part by the recently released report <em>Caregiving in the U.S. 2015</em> [<a href="http://www.caregiving.org/caregiving2015/">http://www.caregiving.org/caregiving2015/</a>]. I would encourage the Advisory Council to invite Gail Hunt from the National Alliance for Caregiving and Susan Reinhard from AARP to provide a briefing about the report at an upcoming Advisory Council meeting, with a particular focus on care involving people with dementia.</p>
<p>In closing, I offer my apologies for topics I have failed to address and my thanks to others making public comments addressing my omissions. I offer my appreciation to Advisory Council members and staff who give of their minds and hearts beyond what words can express. I offer my hope to all those living with dementia and their loved ones that they will be heard, heeded, and healed through the work we all do together.</p>

<p>We would like to thank and commend Co-chairs Laurel Coleman, M.D., and Susan Mitchell, M.D. as well as the staff of Institute of Medicine, for inviting us to the recently concluded series of meetings on advanced dementia care. Observing the discussions on research, innovative program models and policy was stimulating, and reflected a deep commitment on the part of the presenters and IOM to promoting person-centered dementia care. The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) strongly supports the resulting recommendations for the 2015 update of the National Plan to address Alzheimer's disease, developed in consultation with the experts invited to speak at the IOM meetings, and presented on January 26 by Dr. Mitchell and Laurel Coleman, M.D. Chair of the clinical care sub-committee of the NAPA advisory council.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the National Alzheimer's Plan defines "Alzheimer's disease" to include related disorders, it is important to note that existing research, policy and models of care in advanced dementia focus exclusively on an older adult and frail elderly dementia population. Persons with younger-onset dementias and their families face additional complex needs throughout the course of the disease, including in advanced stages. To be consistent with the aims of NAPA, any plan for advanced dementia care must therefore address the needs of the entire dementia population, including those affected by rarer, younger-onset disorders, such as frontotemporal degeneration (FTD).</p>
<p>FTD disorders are distinct from elderly dementia and Alzheimer's disease in two important aspects: they have an earlier age of onset; and cause impairment in executive functioning, language and movement, rather than memory. The age of onset is usually between 45 and 65 years but FTD can affect people as early as their 20's. While the aging services network is the principle provider of services needed by people with FTD, individuals and families are routinely denied services because they do not meet age eligibility, criteria and providers do not understand their needs</p>
<p>Recommendations to improve advanced dementia care including access to palliative care and hospice, preparation of a competent workforce, establishment of quality metrics, and leveraging policy and payment mechanisms to ensure high quality, person-centered care are necessary but grounded in elderly dementia and not sufficient to address the needs of younger persons with dementia and their families. For example:</p>
<ul><li>Hospice criteria for dementia must reflect an understanding of the erratic course of disease and varied end of life symptoms in a younger person with advanced frontotemporal degeneration. Predicting the last six months of life in persons with FTD can be especially challenging; and the lack of specific criteria for appropriately initiating referrals for hospice services means many medical providers and FTD families do not benefit from this important resource.</li>
<li>Research has shown that the difficulty obtaining a diagnosis of FTD, the early age of onset, and the presence of behavioral symptoms contribute to greater caregiver burden in FTD compared to Alzheimer's disease. Families facing FTD are more likely to be at the height of careers and family life; coupled with a higher burden of disease management, this can easily preempt discussions around plans for future healthcare needs and reduces the use of advanced directives or other tools to clarify vital care choices prior to medical crises.</li>
<li>Education on the distinct diagnostic, medical and psychosocial characteristics and needs of persons with FTD disorders is sorely lacking and much needed for geriatricians, palliative care physicians, neurologists, psychiatrists, primary care physicians and other healthcare providers who serve people with advanced dementia across federal and state long-term services and supports.</li>
<li>People with FTD face many difficult care transitions as the disease progresses. Poor coordination of services and the lack of access to appropriate care in the community frequently result in costly psychiatric inpatient admissions, greater use of psychotropic medications and increased utilization of high-cost care in advanced stages of the disease.</li>
</ul><p>Anecdotally, we know that the medical, behavioral and psychosocial needs of persons with younger-onset dementia differ from elderly persons with advanced dementia; yet health policy research initiatives typically focus on an elderly population and exclude data on individuals under 65. Additional mechanisms are needed to fill knowledge gaps and track the functional and cognitive trajectories of people with FTD or other forms of younger-onset dementia in order to fully inform and improve the quality of advanced dementia care.</p>
<p>As the Advisory Council considers the recommendations developed through the advanced dementia meetings at IOM and the important issues surrounding advanced dementia, AFTD implores you to not neglect the needs of people with FTD and other forms of dementia, many of whom are under age 65 and not adequately represented in current thinking about advanced dementia care focused on the elderly population. Some possible mechanisms to ensure this broader perspective are:</p>
<ul><li>Include representatives from FTD and other younger-onset dementias in the development and implementation of the goals and strategies in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease to improve care in advanced dementia</li>
<li>Promote initiatives to fund and conduct research into the health care utilization of persons under age 65 with dementia and develop innovative models of care for persons with advanced younger-onset dementia.</li>
<li>Expand and develop services under Title III of the Older Americans Act to include people with younger-onset dementia.</li>

<p>My mom fell yesterday and shattered/dislocated her shoulder, requiring surgery later today. I am working from home to be available to my mom and stepdad for updates and to help advocate as needed.</p>
<p>So, I won't be there in person to make a public comment. If possible, please read my comment, which is pasted below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comment by Sue Peschin, President and CEO, Alliance for Aging Research.</strong></p>
<p>I fully support the suggestion by Sheila Burke to move the time frame for National Plan recommendations back to October to give more time to the process. While HHS works hard to get the slides up, seeing them only two days before they are presented hardly provides enough time for thoughtful deliberation, let alone for council members to vote on recommendations that will potentially affect millions of Americans.</p>
<p><strong>On the Long-term services and supports subcommittee recommendations</strong>:<br />
					The LTSS recommendations are way too general and provide no benchmarks for which agency should specifically execute which task, what the timing of each task should be, or how much federal and/or private funding may be needed. For example, one of the recommendations states that HHS should support state initiatives for dementia-capable systems by "Providing coordinated Alzheimer's disease related activities across state agencies through an identified state lead entity with adequate funding from Congress." What activities should they coordinate? Though which agencies? What would "adequate funding from Congress" mean? The CMS recommendations in particular have tremendous potential but they are not properly mapped out. For example, what needs to happen for CMS to allow for care planning when the patients isn't there--do we need a new code for providers to have time to counsel/train family or is there an existing code that could be expanded?</p>
<p>Big kudos for #5 that calls on Congress to fund the recommendations and even mentions an amount for one of them.Please add the Lifespan Respite Program to calls for funding the ADSSP and NFCSP programs. Estimates for these can be found in the authorizing language and/or with caregiving groups.</p>
<p><strong>On the advanced dementia work</strong>:<br />
					This work is very impressive and so important. My only comment here is that this community, knowing what we know about Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, has something very important to say to policymakers about the value of giving people with serious illness the freedom to make more informed choices about their care, and the power to have those choices honored. So, whether we might support The Care Planning Act, introduced by Senators Isakson and Warner, and/or the Advanced Planning and Compassionate Care Act, introduced by Senators Collins and Rockefeller--we should include a bold step here that advanced care planning needs to start sooner, along with the patient's healthcare professionals, and it should be covered by Medicare and Medicaid. A lot of complications of care mentioned here could be avoided if more folks had a plan. So, please consider including a bigger picture policy recommendation to help support all of the other great recommendations you suggest.</p>
<p><strong>On clinical care</strong>:<br />
					A while back, Helen LaMont asked the question about whether HHS should consider creating a public education campaign about recognizing cognitive impairment and getting checked out. It would be great to see something in the 2015 Plan about engaging CMS and CDC in a campaign to encourage providers to look for it as part of the Wellness Visit, and for families to flag problems. The Wellness visit has been in existence for 4 years now and very little to nothing has been done to take advantage of it and get more folks identified. If we said 50 percent of people with CVD were missed by clinicians each year, heart groups would hit the roof.</p>
<p><strong>On research</strong>:<br />
					It's wonderful that you included a request. Policymakers want to know how much these dementia diseases cost for research, clinical care, and long-term care. The professional judgment budget happened because feds from NIH would not provide members of Congress with a straight answer about how much was needed.</p>
<p>ASK FOR WHAT YOU NEED. BE BOLD AND BE SPECIFIC. LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON YOU. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING!</p>
<p>No worries if it cannot be read. I hope all goes well with the meeting and that you all stay warm and safe today.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>NATIONAL PLAN GOALS: TIME TO MAKE THEM HAPPEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>I. NAPA Accomplishments </strong></p>
<p>Since the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease was first released,<sup>1</sup> there has been progress in establishing a cohesive and comprehensive national strategy to fight the illness. Strides have been made in federal agency interaction and coordination, increasing educational materials and outreach and promoting awareness through social and traditional media. National action has spurred movement at the state level and a vast majority of states now have their own plans to coordinate resources and services, often resulting in dynamic care delivery programs that provide better outcomes at lower costs.</p>
<p>Yet, more must - and needs - to be done. Many of the action steps taken have required little resources. While it's a start, these are merely low-hanging fruit and the heavy lifting remains. In addition to increased federal resources, we need better tools are needed to ensure early and accurate diagnosis of dementia. New, coordinated care delivery models that are more efficient and yield better outcomes must be adopted nationally. States need to be more fully engaged and the US needs to further its commitment to international efforts.</p>
<p>As the NAPA Advisory Board continues its work, we must move beyond the edges of policy. While the national Alzheimer's plan established lofty, but achievable goals, sufficient resources are needed if we are to make real progress in eradicating this devastating brain disorder and developing a cure or meaningful treatment by 2025. Further, federal health programs need to remove barriers to access and recognize the growing need for custodial and long-term care services and supports for individuals living with dementia and their family caregivers.</p>
<p>Solutions are readily available to reduce costs of care while promoting better outcomes for individuals with dementia and their family caregivers. The national Alzheimer's plan already contains a number of such recommendations, which, if implemented could save significant resources. In addition national stakeholders, including the Alzheimer's Foundation of America (AFA), have contributed constructive comments, ideas and proposals for the NAPA Advisory Board to consider when developing their annual report for HHS.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>AFA would like to build upon these past proposals and offer the following new recommendations to further the process and ensure implementation of the national Alzheimer's plan on a credible pathway toward achieving its core objectives. These new proposals, moreover, are not costly, can be quickly implemented and will have an immediate, positive impact in achieving the objectives of the national Alzheimer's plan. They include:</p>
<ul><li>Calling on CMS to develop and execute a timeline in which they will nationally adopt and broadly implement innovative care delivery models.</li>
<li>Encouraging states to develop their own Alzheimer's plans and increase states' involvement in the national Alzheimer's plan.</li>
<li>Promoting and expanding opportunities for cognitive memory screening.</li>
<li>Increasing the federal commitment to international efforts fighting Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>Increasing resources for Alzheimer's disease research and caregiver supports and services.</li>
</ul><p><strong>II. AFA Recommendations </strong></p>
<p>Adopting innovative care delivery models, expanding transitional care programs, and expanding caregiver supports can reduce hospitalizations, decrease emergency room visits and delay costly nursing home placement.</p>
<p>As outlined in AFA's "Cost of Care: Quantifying Care-Centered Provisions of the 'National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease" report,<sup>3</sup> recommendations such as medical homes and enhanced caregiver training and supports, will provide significant cost savings--more than $110 billion during a 10-year period--while promoting better health outcomes for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, and improving quality of life for their caregivers.</p>
<p>An independent study of a Minnesota dementia caregiver program found that, if fully implemented, the program would save the state nearly $1 billion over 15 years,<sup>4</sup> further underscoring the findings of AFA's "Cost of Care" report.</p>
<p>In the coming year, CMS is expected to release data from demonstration projects, including several involving dementia care delivery models. This should provide the necessary evidence for federal health programs to move ahead with alacrity to implement such programs nationwide. As demonstrated in Minnesota, small investments in supports that provide caregiver tools and strategies yields major savings and better outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>AFA, therefore, urges the NAPA Advisory Board to recommend that CMS develop and execute a timeline in which they will nationally adopt and broadly implement the innovative care models and enhanced caregiver support recommendations that are included in the national Alzheimer's plan. </strong></p>
<p>In an effort to help advance the goals of the national Alzheimer's plan at the state level, the National Alliance for Caregiving and AFA released a white paper that examines the scope of the Alzheimer's crisis, and the need for wide-scale implementation of state plans that address supportive services specific to state localities.<sup>5</sup> The report offers six key recommendations, applicable to both new and existing state plans:</p>
<ul><li>Establish and maintain a task force of Alzheimer's disease stakeholders, including government officials, community groups, individuals with dementia, and family caregivers.</li>
<li>Assess the ability of the state Alzheimer's disease community to support diagnosed individuals and their families.</li>
<li>Develop a state plan for Alzheimer's disease that includes goals specific to the state population, and outlines measures to track progress.</li>
<li>Keep stakeholders engaged in the design, implementation and evaluation of the plan.</li>
<li>Recognize that state plans are "living documents," and modify them, as appropriate, over time.</li>
<li>Learn from the successes and challenges of other states and the national plan.<sup>6</sup></li>
</ul><p>States are the often called the laboratory of democracy<sup>7</sup> and their freedom to innovate, customize and target policy can produce effective models, some of which can be replicated on both state and federal levels. Yet, there is no process or forum to share successes, discuss failures and identify gaps in policy. There needs to be greater communication, not only between states, but between states and the NAPA Advisory Board so federal officials can be keyed into valuable input from their efforts.</p>
<p><strong>AFA urges further encouragement of states to develop their own plans, increase states' involvement with the NAPA Advisory Board and establish a forum within the National Governors Association or National Council on State Legislatures for states to share best practices and successful recommendations with their peers. </strong></p>
<p>Misdiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is already rampant, leading to unnecessary costs and, most importantly, risks to individuals. Memory screening is necessary, therefore to ensure a timely and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. With early detection, individuals with dementia can receive available therapy earlier in the disease progression when most available treatments for Alzheimer's disease are most helpful. Early identification allows optimal therapy with available and emerging medications.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), moreover, is focusing more clinical research on individuals earlier in the disease process. AFA can appreciate the difficulty in developing meaningful diagnostic criteria for preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Yet, cognitive screening can help identify pre-symptomatic individuals and others with mild cognitive impairment who can populate these necessary and vital drug trials that give hope to millions with dementia.</p>
<p>Despite these advantages, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has failed to recognize cognitive screening as necessary for older adults.<sup>8</sup> While USPSTF found adequate evidence that some screening tools have sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful in identifying dementia, they found inadequate direct evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for cognitive impairment and of non-pharmacologic interventions.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Memory screening is gaining ground thanks to increased awareness about Alzheimer's disease, as well as the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, which includes a cognitive assessment.<sup>10</sup> In addition, during AFA's 2014 National Memory Screening Day this past November, more than 6,000 sites across the country provided free confidential screenings, as well as education on good brain health, to tens of thousands of participants.</p>
<p><strong>AFA urges the NAPA Advisory Board to further promote and expand opportunities for memory screening. The NAPA Advisory Board should call for more research on cognitive screening and its impact on individual care choices and identify new technologies that can test and track cognitive functioning. </strong></p>
<p>There has been considerable movement in the worldwide effort to fight Alzheimer's disease. Since the G8 Summit held in London in late 2013, there has been a more coordinated international effort in combating dementia. The G-7 has committed to identifying a cure or a disease modifying therapy by 2025 and to increase funding for dementia research.<sup>11</sup> To this end, international policy makers have met at various legacy meetings throughout 2014 (with more scheduled in 2015, including a meeting in February at NIH). In addition, Dr. Dennis Gillings, consultant to the pharmaceutical industry and founder of a drug trial, has been appointed by the UK Prime Minister as the World Dementia Envoy.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>As a leader in Alzheimer's disease research, the US needs to continue its commitment to these international organizations. The sharing of research data, best practices and study results will speed drug development and help achieve the shared 2025 goal. The NAPA Advisory Board acknowledges this need and, in the past year, has heard from international Alzheimer's advocates and has been briefed on worldwide efforts.</p>
<p><strong>It is imperative, therefore, that the 2015 NAPA Advisory Board recommendations include greater commitment to these international efforts. In addition, representatives of the State Department be invited to join the NAPA Advisory Board. </strong></p>
<p>Without adequate resources, getting to the 2025 NAPA goal will be arduous and success will be put in doubt. Investment in promising research is imperative to meet these ambitious, yet achievable goals. Despite the need, spending on Alzheimer's disease research lags far behind research resources spent on other major diseases. In FY 2013, the National Institutes for Health (NIH) spent approximately $504 million for Alzheimer's disease, while $5.2 billion went to cancer research; $2.9 billion for HIV/AIDS; $2 billion for cardiovascular disease; $1.2 billion for heart disease; and more than $1 billion for diabetes.<sup>13</sup> Without the same commitment for Alzheimer's disease, costs will continue to rise at unprecedented rates, promising research will remain unfunded, and hope will be diminished for the millions living with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>The NAPA Advisory Board needs to recommend Congress "double down" on Alzheimer's disease research to $1 billion in FY'16 and work with appropriating committees in Congress on a pathway to get Alzheimer's disease research funding at $2 billion by the end of the current decade. </strong></p>
<p><strong>III. Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>These are challenging times, and limited resources call for creative solutions. Yet, we cannot simply maintain the status quo. Investment in research and caregiving services is the only way to ensure that we, as a nation, can overcome the growing human and fiscal crisis that is Alzheimer's disease. An international, comprehensive and coordinated effort is needed to combat the growing worldwide crisis of dementia impacting individuals and families regardless of race, creed, color or national origin.</p>
<p>The recent worldwide effort against Ebola can be instructive in developing a strategy that can contain and ultimately defeat the disease. In the case of Ebola, after an initial period of unpreparedness, economically advantaged nations took action and developed an international strategy to control the outbreak and develop a vaccine. For its part, the US will spend $5.2 billion in FY'15 alone on care, prevention and development of a viable vaccine to fight Ebola. While it is far from certain whether this current Ebola outbreak can be contained; the international commitment to adequately respond to the crisis, with proper initial resources, cannot be questioned.</p>
<p>Unlike Ebola, however, we know we are facing a growing worldwide dementia crisis and its impact on society is arguably greater. The national Alzheimer's plan sets a stage and provides guideposts and impactful endpoints. Yet, the missing piece is the necessary investment that can change trajectory of this disease and transform outcomes. Progress has already been made in several areas of the plan and some modest goals have been completed, yet we are nowhere near the ultimate prize of finding a treatment or cure, and our time to meet the 2025 goal is ticking away. Now is our time to make it happen, or chances are it never will.</p>

<p>Members of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services:</p>
<p>Thank you for this opportunity to provide public comment.</p>
<p>Among the several laudable goals of the <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em> is the first one: to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's by 2025. We believe the National Institute on Aging (NIA) took a profoundly important step forward by releasing research milestones for each year between now and 2025 to guide federal efforts and allow all stakeholders to assess whether efforts are on track to meet this goal. Just as importantly, was the NIA commitment to revisit these milestones regularly, and revise them as warranted based on the progress, obstacles, opportunities and challenges that will inevitably emerge year by year. This is an extremely important commitment--one that we believe has done much to assure the Alzheimer's research community of the credibility of and commitment to this bold effort.</p>
<p>In support of this effort, the Alzheimer's Association convened a working group of 40 Alzheimer's research experts, who represented a broad range of research interests and experiences. We were among the members of this working group. The group was charged with reviewing all milestones to assess whether they, collectively, would be adequate to reach the 2025 goal. We made recommendations where existing milestones ought to be augmented and suggested additional recommendations for consideration, that would more fully support success by 2025</p>
<p>Our review found that the first iteration of the milestones is not sufficient to achieve the 2025 goal. This is not surprising--.this is to be expected in the first iteration of any such process and we appreciate that scientific progress in the last two years has also placed us in a better position to enhance the milestones in their next iteration, at the upcoming Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit in 2015. It is encouraging to the scientific community that the NIA had the foresight to commit to a process which would make milestone adjustments that they ultimately conclude are warranted.</p>
<p>Our working group's conclusions have been published in the October issue of <em>Alzheimer's &amp; Dementia</em>. This article has been made freely available on the Journal's webpage. We believe that if the milestones are updated as the working group recommends -- and, even more importantly, that the funds are requested and provided to implement them -- the likelihood of achieving the 2025 goal will improve dramatically.</p>
<p>Our understanding is that the NIA intends to draw upon input from all available scientific sources, such as the working group, together with the deliberations to be held at the upcoming Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit 2015, to update the milestones. We believe this is a sound approach, and we urge the NIA to release revised milestones as quickly as is reasonable thereafter.</p>
<p>When the summit is held, 2025 will be just 10 years away -- a brief time in light of the research challenge presented by the 2025 goal. A difficult truth is that to prove that medical interventions work, it takes several years to complete a research study. Because of the fact that, in our view, the amounts requested for Alzheimer's research by the Administration over the past several ye ars will not allow for the implementation of milestones required to achieve the 2025 goal, we further recommend that in its upcoming budget the Administration call for sufficient Alzheimer's research funding to allow for the swift and complete implementation of revised milestones. We have no time to lose to achieve the 2025 goal. If our country does not act quickly, we could lose the boomer generation to Alzheimer's. Although we recognize that the revised milestones will not yet be finalized by the time this budget is released, we are confident that the NIH's capable scientists could calculate a solid estimate of the appropriate order of magnitude of funding required.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>STATEMENT FOR THE RECORD SUBMITTED TO THE<br />
					Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services<br />
					U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center">April 29, 2014</p>
<p>AARP appreciates the opportunity to comment as the Advisory Council prepares to make 2014 recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (National Plan). AARP's mission is to enhance the quality of life for all as we age. Living independently, connected to family, friends and community is key to a high quality of life. As we age, a decline in cognitive health is not only one of people's greatest fears, but it is also one of the greatest threats to living independently and a high quality of life. As with all family caregivers and the loved ones they are helping, tangible steps can be taken to improve the quality of care, quality of outcomes, and quality of life for people living with dementia and their family caregivers. As this country moves forward with the National Plan goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025, we also need to move forward with more effective care for those already affected by dementia, including better care coordination and planning, better access to affordable care, and support for family caregivers who take care of their loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>A. Translate evidence-based, person and family-centered care into widespread practice. </strong></p>
<p>It is important to expand person and family-centered care models broadly to reach the tens of millions of people and their families who could benefit from them. We know that person and family-centered models of dementia care that emphasize continuity of care and coordinate across settings and providers can also improve outcomes. Thanks to academic researchers across the country and the support from federal agencies who are represented on the Advisory Council such as the National Institutes of Health, the Administration for Community Living, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, we have developed an evidence-base from which we can implement better care.<sup>1</sup> In some cases, in addition to improving individual outcomes, we can even deter or delay expensive, disruptive, unwanted hospitalization and institutionalization.<sup>2</sup> Both domestically and internationally, models of care exist which demonstrate interventions that preserve abilities, improve behaviors, and reduce caregiver burden. These models show that we can do more to help those with a diagnosis of dementia -- and find ways to do it in responsible, cost-effective ways.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Despite the evidence that we can improve outcomes for people with dementia, these models of care are unfortunately neither widely known nor widely adopted. All too often, people either go untreated, or even after diagnosis, think there is nothing that can be done. It is important to educate people with dementia and their family caregivers that medical, social and behavioral interventions can help even while we struggle to find a cure for the future. <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>That is why AARP urges the Council to redouble their efforts around goals 2 and 3 of the plan:<br />
					Goal 2: To enhance care quality and efficiency and<br />
					Goal 3: Expand supports for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families.</p>
<p>More broadly, individuals and their family caregivers should be made aware of interventions that can help them.</p>
<p><strong>B. Apply evidence-based quality of care across all settings -- for those living at home receiving care through primary care settings, as well as in residential and institutional settings. </strong></p>
<p>Individuals should receive quality care no matter where they live. As the Advisory Council considers how to achieve the goal of enhanced quality and efficiency of care for those with dementia, it is critical to think about the care provided for those with dementia living in different types of settings. People often live with dementia for long periods of time -- and dementia manifests itself over a continuum of time and abilities. Therefore, quality care needs to adapt over a continuum as well.</p>
<p>AARP is striving to make it easier for older people to live with independence and remain in their homes and communities for as long as they can, surrounded by family and friends. People with dementia are often happier and have more control in their own familiar home, and with the right help and support, they too can continue to live independently.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>While we want people to have the option of living in their homes as long as possible, for some people, particularly those who face advanced stages of dementia, living in a residential setting or nursing home may be the best option for them. Clearly these people still want and deserve to live life on their terms, with dignity and respect, and need high quality care that is affordable and sustainable. Our emphasis on promoting independent living applies to people living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities as well as in home or other smaller community settings.</p>
<p><strong>C. Recognize that quality of care also must include family caregiver support. </strong></p>
<p>In 2009, about 42 million family caregivers in the United States provided care to an adult with limitations in daily activities at any given point in time. They provided unpaid care valued at $450 billion that year, more than total Medicaid spending in 2009 and more than twice the total for paid services and supports, according to AARP's Public Policy Institute.<sup>6</sup> The Alzheimer's Association estimates that more than 15 million of those caregivers are providing care for someone with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>While this concept is important in family caregiving broadly, best practices of care for those with dementia recognize caregiver well-being is essential to maintaining the well-being and abilities of the individual as well.<sup>8</sup> It has been clearly established that counseling and support for spousal caregivers of those with dementia benefit the individual, family caregiver and society. Individuals whose family caregivers received the counseling and support interventions designed by the New York University Caregiver Intervention Study compared to usual care experienced a 28.3% reduction in the rate of nursing home placement.<sup>9</sup> A 2012 report released by AARP's Public Policy Institute and the United Hospital Fund also found that almost half of family caregivers perform medical/nursing tasks for care recipients, such as managing multiple medications and helping with assistive devices for mobility.<sup>10</sup> Families generally do not receive training and other assistance to help them provide care. Such training and supports also benefit the person receiving the assistance.</p>
<p>We need to help the millions of family caregivers navigate the confusing care systems to provide assistance for their loved ones and otherwise support them in their caregiving roles. Family caregivers should be given an assessment of their needs and then receive help based on the assessment, especially when a care or discharge plan depends on a family caregiver voluntarily providing services to an individual. Such assistance should include information, training, counseling, links to community resources, help locating services, respite care, or other supports. In September, a federally appointed Commission on Long-Term Care released a report with important bipartisan recommendations to help build a better system to support individuals and their family caregivers nationwide. <sup>11</sup> Importantly, the Commission called for a national strategy to address the needs of family caregivers. The Commission specifically recommended assessing family caregivers and their needs in the care planning process, including family caregivers in patients' health records and as members of care teams, ensuring family caregivers have access to relevant information technology and, importantly, encouraging family caregiver interventions, including respite, training, and other supportive services. We need to provide the support and tools to all family caregivers so that both the recipient and provider of care can sustain themselves.</p>
<p><strong>D. Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>AARP is dedicated to improving the quality of care to all individuals who need long-term services and supports (LTSS) and supporting creative, innovative mechanisms by which that care can be personalized, delivered, evaluated and financed. We know that older adults with end stage dementia are some of the most complicated and expensive individuals with LTSS needs. They often are living with multiple chronic conditions -- and if we can improve the quality of care for those with dementia, we can use those lessons to improve the care for all people with LTSS needs. Focusing on concrete steps to deliver on goals 2 and 3 of the plan could help make significant strides to assist all older adults and their families.</p>

<p>As the more than 300 residents of Villa Gardens, a Continuing Care Retirement Community in Pasadena, California, we witness every day the tragic decline of friends and family members affected by Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. We write now to strongly support and ask you to support the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) enacted in 2011.</p>
<p>Dementia in its many forms, including Alzheimer 's disease, affects more than 5.2 million people in this country. <strong>Its cost in 2013 will total an estimated $203 billion</strong>, including $142 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid. Total payments for health care, long-term care and hospice for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias are projected to increase from $203 billion in 2013 to $1.2 trillion in 2050 (in current dollars). This dramatic rise includes a 500% increase in combined Medicare and Medicaid spending: $107 Billion in Medicare, $35 Billion in Medicaid, and $61 Billion in personal and other expenses. (These figures are taken directly from the 2013 National Plan.)</p>
<p>We feel certain that you are familiar with these figures but also recognize that there are many issues, both global and national, of critical importance on your plate right now. One is certainly the fiscal health of our country. We were delighted to see President Obama and Congress take a step in addressing this humanitarian need when they passed NAPA. We also believe that it is now a Congressional Imperative to make the funds available to accomplish what NAPA promises.</p>
<p>We ask you, a highly respected and influential member of Congress, to ensure that NAPA receives the financial support it deserves. While, as a nation, we respond to the humanitarian needs of the global community we must also respond, as we have not yet adequately done, to a need of tremendous significance and magnitude on our own doorstep.</p>
<p>We would also appreciate hearing from you about what you see as the probability of NAPA funding and any other steps we can take to support NAPA.</p>

<p>Below are my comments for the public record. If you can group this with the earlier files I sent you that would be great. This being first. Thanks</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>Some comments on the earlier topic on CMS.</p>
<p>In reference to the availability of PET Amyloid scans.</p>
<p>I think it is very important to the outcome of people like me to these tools.</p>
<p>For me it took 9 years to get a diagnoses. It was not until I received the PET scan that it confirmed that something was truly wrong. Many insurance companies still do not pay for that test. I cannot begin to tell you how many times I had repeat many of the test hoping for an answer. I even had 3 Neuropsychological tests that cost over $2500.00 each during that time.</p>
<p>Because of this diagnose.</p>
<p>I was able to start my medications.</p>
<p>Start my end of life planning and make plans to live life to the fullest in the short time I had left.</p>
<p>Able to get in Clinical trials</p>
<p>Apply for disability</p>
<p>Able to now focus my effort to being an advocate for the disease which had now given me a new life's purpose.</p>
<p>When I need surgery the doctor was able to avoid anesthetics contraindicated in AD.</p>
<p><strong>The delay in my diagnose led to being fired from my job and losing the very benefits I had contributed to that would have taken care of me for the rest of my life. It would have even simplified it for my caregiver. Now we both suffer. I lost it all and must rely on social security. </strong></p>
<p>I would like to personally thank this advisory council for supporting the Department of Health and Human Services decision to include someone living with dementia on the committee. I believe people around the world will view this as a major step forward for people with dementia. Ideally this should set an example to be followed by all people, businesses and organizations. While we may have a progressive disease we still have a lot to contribute to society if we are just given the chance. It is decisions such as this that will help reduce stigma, and prove to people what we are capable of doing. I speak for myself and many others when I say thank you so much.</p>
<p>As some of you know I have been appointed to the PA State Alzheimer's Planning Committee. I was very excited by the feedback I received after the first meeting on the commitment to make the plan successful before it was even discussed or even created. I wish I could be as excited about the work being accomplished here at NAPA. While there are great ideas coming from all of you, and plans and polices are being created, there is still a distinct lack of funding. Many of you here have the power to influence those who are in a position to increase funding; I encourage you to do more. We are all aware that Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease of the century, more than heart disease and cancer, yet the leaders chose to do nothing, in effect ignoring those of us who are dying in the most horrible way possible. The funding that we have for this disease is even less today than before; we are heading the wrong way. Many people get excited by the comment on proposed budget increases; people like me only get excited on the actual budget changes. Budget proposals are even more disappointing than the failure of clinical trials.</p>
<p>For some time I have worked on putting together a vision of what people with dementia need. I believe many people have an idea of what is required, but I feel the best ideas come from those directly impacted by dementia because those of us who are living with dementia know how we feel, and what we need. My vision has been shared with the PA state, and I have sent a copy to all those on the NAPA Advisory Council. It is my hope that this document becomes shared with all the states and other parts of the world. I would also be more than happy to expand on the reasoning behind what I came up with and why I felt it would be a benefit to not only the people living with this disease but also their family and friends. I hope you take what I have written and use it as a guideline for what is needed and you create a model of best practices for others to use.</p>
<p>Below is a list of issues as I see them from my introduction statement on June 7th that I shared with the PA state committee.</p>
<p>In my opinion awareness is the biggest problem. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show that Alzheimer's is a disease that affects all ages; it is not just associated with getting older. I know of a 30-year-old, and a 29-year-old who have it.</p>
<p>Stigma of the disease must be eradicated.</p>
<p>Companies and communities must treat this like any other disability.</p>
<p>State laws need to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve immediately.</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is.</p>
<p>People should be fast-tracked for social security instead of being treated like crooks while they are getting deeper into hardship.</p>
<p>First responders need educating, and a system needs to be created that will help identify us without becoming a target for others.</p>
<p>We need a way to deal with our guns.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those who are no longer capable, and not to impact those that are still able to drive.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways if we are looking to make it better for those impacted.</p>
<p>Need to encourage dementia-friendly communities and businesses.</p>
<p>We must be able to live life to the fullest even though we have the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Having a diagnosis of dementia does not mean we lose our willingness or motivation to be contributing members of society. We need opportunities to engage in meaningful activities throughout the course of the disease.</p>
<p>We must encourage the research and provide funding.</p>
<p>Trials need to provide more flexibility by using communication technology.</p>
<p>Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia.</p>
<p>Patients should be made aware of the living wills which should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p>I hope you will now look at my vision and give it consideration.</p>
<p>I thank you for your new and improved plan, but we are far from being able to take a bow for any real credit. So much more must be done.</p>
<p><em>I'd like to thank the Alzheimer's Association for making it possible for me to be at NAPA.</em></p>

<p>Good morning, Please see attached for comments from ResearchersAgainstAlzheimer'sregarding the "Interim Milestones to Complete the First Goal of the National Alzheimer's Plan by 2025" that were included in the recommendations unanimously approved earlier this year by the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Service.</p>

<p>ResearchersAgainstAlzheimer's -- a group of over 350 scientists dedicated to stopping Alzheimer's disease -- strongly supports the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and its bold but necessary goal 1 of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. While this target will be a challenge -- similar to past national efforts to send a man to the moon and map the human genome, we firmly believe it is achievable if commensurate resources are committed and strategies deployed. To maximize our chances at success, we strongly support the "Interim Milestones to Complete the First Goal of the National Alzheimer's Plan by 2025" that were included in the recommendations unanimously approved earlier this year by the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services, and we strongly encourage that such milestones be included in the next iteration of the national plan.</p>
<p>Including a specific set of time-bound milestones would be useful to all stakeholders, particularly those in medicine and science, striving to achieve the 2025 goal, as they will establish important interim markers to measure progress and determine potential amendments in the strategy. Absent such milestones, it would be far more difficult to track and measure progress against the goal.</p>
<p>As the Administration has clearly noted, the 2025 goal and the overall plan are national rather than federal goals meaning their success is dependent upon the active participation of multiple stakeholders including government, academia, industry, and non-governmental organizations. A tangible demonstration of this commitment is the level of resources dedicated to the task. While we recognize the fiscal challenges facing the nation as well as the reality that federal discretionary funding is determined in most cases on an annual basis, we think the milestones document would be further strengthened by including funding estimates, targets or ranges necessary to achieve the milestones. Such data would make for a more complete picture and help inform federal and non-federal funding decisions, including public-private partnerships. It would also help inform the annual Congressional budget and appropriations process by providing lawmakers with expert recommendations they can use in establishing department, agency, and program funding levels and in setting priorities.</p>
<p>In addition to including funding estimates, we offer the following thoughts as to ways the milestones chart could be strengthened further:</p>
<p><strong>Research Milestones</strong></p>
<ul><li>Include throughout the document a stronger focus on basic research milestones, particularly benchmarks for discoveries of novel targets, to ensure the early-stage portion of the pipeline and process is not overlooked, as well as process reforms intended to reduce the time, the cost, and the risk of development therapies (<em>More under regulatory</em>), While we are hopeful that therapies and/or means of prevention will be available and accessible by 2025 if not sooner, achieving this goal does not negate the need for further research, particularly to develop more effective interventions and, hopefully one day, therapies to reverse the course of the disease and to cure it outright.</li>
<li>Include during the 2012-2015 timeframe a milestone focused on increasing the understanding as to potential differences treatments may have based on each individual patient's condition (e.g. Apolipoprotein E genotype, amyloid status etc).</li>
<li>Include during the 2016-2020 timeframe a milestone focused on the translation of promising therapeutic interventions into clinical testing.</li>
<li>Include throughout the research component the establishment of a government co-investment function that is modeled upon other successful programs in other sectors and that strives to bridge the "valley of death" that is so daunting in the Alzheimer's and neuroscience space. Such an entity would complement NIH and other research efforts by leveraging relatively small amounts of funding to advance targeted, goal-oriented, and milestone driven project.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Regulatory Milestones</strong></p>
<ul><li>As noted above, set specific regulatory goals aimed at compressing the time and cost of Alzheimer's therapy development. This effort should include specific action under all timeframes and set an overarching goal whereby the average development and review timeline for an Alzheimer's therapy would be reduced by a specific amount of time.</li>
<li>Include during the 2012-2015 timeframe the issuance of FDA guidance pertaining to clinical trials involving combination therapies, and modify the "FDA adaptive trial model" to "FDA adaptive trial paradigm."</li>
</ul><p>Beyond these points, we recommend that the Department continually work to add greater levels of specificity to the milestones, particularly those pertaining to validated endpoints and approved treatments. Overall, this set of milestones must be seen as a constantly evolving, living, and breathing document and should be as comprehensive as the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. To that end, while the NIH and FDA are perhaps the two most important agencies in terms of achieving the 2025 goals, we recommend broadening this solid foundation so all key departments and agencies participating in the plan and Advisory Council, are incorporated.</p>
<p>We applaud you for your leadership in striving to stop Alzheimer's disease and thank you for considering this request. If you have any questions, please contact Dave Morgan, Lead Representative of ResearchersAgainstAlzheimer's and CEO of the Byrd Alzheimer's Institute at the University of South Florida.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>I would like to comment on the efforts of the NAPA Advisory Council moving towards the release of the second version of the National Plan. My name is Bruce Lamb and I am a Staff Scientist at the Lerner Research Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, where my laboratory works to understand basic disease mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>I would first like to congratulate the Advisory Council and HHS for developing an ambitious initial plan with admirable overall goals. However, in order to achieve these goals, the plan must be supported by equally ambitious and transformative changes in the funding, organization and monitoring of progress in the fight against Alzheimer's disease as outlined below.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>Continued Research Investments</strong></p>
<p>The additional $50 million invested in Alzheimer's last year was certainly a great start in adding resources in an attempt to meet the goal to "Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025." Furthermore, the President has included an additional $100 million for Alzheimer's research in the coming year's budget. However, at present, due to extremely tight funding paylines (~7-11% for agencies that support Alzheimer's research) and the impact of the sequester (most agencies are imposing an across the board cut in the funding of existing grants), Alzheimer's researchers are finding funding more difficult to obtain and maintain than at any time in the past two to three decades. There are significant concerns that should this continue, we could lose some of the best researchers in the field. Furthermore, in coming years, it will be absolutely critical to add to these current investments, with the ultimate goal of supporting $2 billion of Alzheimer's research per year. If we are truly serious about the ambitious goal of having a prevention/treatment by 2025, this level of investment is required to get us there. Therefore, the recent investments in Alzheimer's research must represent only the initial investment in a series of increased investments over the next several years. Finally, while most neuroscience researchers are supportive of the President's Brain Mapping Initiative, this cannot come at the expense of or in the place of ongoing funding for Alzheimer's research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Research Infrastructure/Organization</strong></p>
<p>To achieve goal 1 of the National Plan, it will be absolutely critical to have an infrastructure and organization that can coordinate federal research efforts across all funding agencies, interact with non-profits and industry, promote awareness of the disease and the role that research will play in combating the disease as well as reporting to the Advisory Council directly as outlined in the plan. In order for this organization/infrastructure to be truly successful and transformative, it will be essential that its efforts are entirely focused on combating Alzheimer's disease. This will provide a uniquely focused organization that will have the most chance of success. A similar "disease-focused" agency was created in 1988 for HIV/AIDS entitled the "Office of AIDS Research" (OAR) within the Office of the NIH Director, that played a key role in successfully coordinating the federal response to AIDS. If we are truly serious about transforming Alzheimer's research and achieving the goals laid out in the plan, a similar type of organizational structure (perhaps an Office of Alzheimer's Research?) is required either within HHS, NIH or the White House.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitoring Progress</strong></p>
<p>There has been increased discussion both within NIH and on the Advisory Council about creating interim milestones for the National Plan in order to assess whether the plan is moving towards its goals in a timely manner. I highly applaud these efforts. However, most of the interim milestones for goal 1 focus on a variety of translational and clinical research milestones (i.e., accelerating drug development, performing clinical trials). While these are clearly important milestones and should definitely be included as the plan moves forward, at present, it remains completely unclear whether the current compounds in the drug pipeline will be successful in the treatment/prevention of Alzheimer's disease. Given this, it is essential that additional concrete milestones should be included to identify novel targets (thus far, pretty much only one target has been focused on), screen for compounds that will engage these targets, perform preclinical testing to examine the effectiveness of these compounds and finally moving these compounds into clinical trials in humans. It is critical to identify these additional milestones and also support the increased research funding required to meet these milestones and ultimately achieve the goals of the National Plan.</p>

You can watch the hearing, as well as access witness testimony, by clicking <a href="http://www.aging.senate.gov/hearing_detail.cfm?id=341480&amp;">here</a> circa 2:00 pm tomorrow.</em></p>
<p><strong>WASHINGTON, DC</strong> -- Aniconic figure in country music, who is slowly being robbed of his memories by Alzheimer's and forced to end touring, will head to Capitol Hill this week to advocate on behalf of the growing number of elderly who are being struck with this mind robbing disease. Country Music Hall of Famer Glenn Campbell will make an appearance with his daughter Ashley on Wednesday before the Senate Special Committee on Aging. Campbell, who received a Lifetime Achievement Award at last year's Grammy Awards, is best known for chart-topping hits such as "Rhinestone Cowboy", "Wichita Lineman", "Southern Nights" and "Galveston." The 77-year old entertainer was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2011.</p>
<p>The hearing, set for 2:00 p.m. in room 106 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, comes at a time when public health officials, researchers and advocates are scrambling to find effective treatments to combat Alzheimer's as the country's aging population increases. By one estimate, the number of people over 65 with the disease is expected to nearly triple by 2050, from five million today to 13.8 million, according to a report released in March by the Alzheimer's Association. More troubling, the report also found that deaths linked to Alzheimer's increased 68-percent from 2000 to 2010, while those attributed to other diseases such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, heart disease and HIV all declined.</p>
<p>"In many ways, Alzheimer's has become the defining disease of my generation," said Aging Committee ranking member Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who co-authored a 2011 law directing the government to develop a long-term plan to fight Alzheimer's. "An estimated 5.2 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, more than double the number in 1980. It is estimated that nearly one in two of the baby boomers reaching 85 will develop Alzheimer's. If nothing is done to slow or stop this disease, it will cost the United States $20 trillion over the next 40 years."</p>
<p>"Sadly, we've yet to find a way to prevent, cure or even slow Alzheimer's progression," said the panel's chairman Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL). "If we can put a man on the moon in less than a decade, then we should be able to eventually beat this disease."</p>
<p>The lack of effective treatments has led congress and the administration to step up efforts to combat Alzheimer's. Following Congress' passage of the National Alzheimer's Project Act in 2011, the Obama administration last May unveiled a national strategy aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. In addition to expanding research funding, the plan aims to improve the care and support Alzheimer's patients and their families receive.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the White House announced it would ask Congress for $100 million to start a brain-mapping project that could lead to better ways to treat brain disorders such as Alzheimer's.</p>

<p>Although the official comment period has closed for the NAPA draft plan, I'm writing today to urge you to go bolder with the final plan to be released by HHS later this month.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is a cruel disease. It slowly steals one's intellect, ability to communicate, independence, and dignity, even control over basic bodily functions like eating and caring for personal hygiene. It also places an overwhelming burden on caregivers -- emotionally, physically, and financially.</p>
<p>The commitment to a 2025 deadline in the draft NAPA plan represents a major step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's. I am pleased that the plan recognizes the need for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, compressing the drug development process, accelerating targeted research, and better coordinating activities with other countries.</p>
<p>However, I am one of many concerned Alzheimer's advocates who believe that this first draft fails to present a strategy aggressive enough to achieve the goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's within 13 years. It lacks specificity in terms of timelines and deadlines, provides no path to providing significantly greater resources, and does not hold a single high-level office or individual accountable for the overall plan.</p>
<p>I hope that HHS will address these issues so that the next version of the plan will be bolder.</p>
<p>With the number of Alzheimer's patients expected to triple in the coming decades, we must embrace a plan that eschews a "business-as-usual" approach and tackles Alzheimer's with the urgency and aggressiveness it requires. If not, we stand to lose millions more lives -- and trillions of dollars -- to this disease.</p>

<p>Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) commends you and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services for the first National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease ("the Plan") and all the public and private sector stakeholders collaborating effectively to implement strategies crucial to transformative change for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families. LEAD is pleased that a number of priority recommendations previously submitted by the coalition are included in the first Plan and is optimistic that the revised Plan will be even stronger.</p>
<p>LEAD is a diverse and growing coalition of 56 member organizations including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Working collaboratively with LEAD member organizations and other stakeholders across the Alzheimer's-serving continuum, we offer the recommendations below for the revised National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Equally important, we are prepared to work with the Administration, Congress, and all other interested parties to achieve the shared goals articulated in the Plan.</p>
<p>LEAD's recommendations seek to strengthen the goals, strategies, and actions within the Plan. As noted in earlier comments, LEAD believes that some actions can be pursued at no or only low cost but that the topline goals can be achieved only with a significant increase in investment from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. It is imperative that both Plan work and outcomes are LEAD Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease accomplished with the utmost public transparency and that there is an effective methodology for assessing the impact that strategies within the Plan have on progress toward the timely achievement of stated goals. To that end, LEAD recommends that immediate action be taken to develop a model in 2013 that will allow HHS to assess the impact of the action steps in the Plan and identify areas for course adjustments. We, as a nation, should pursue only implementation steps that clearly are moving toward our goals. In that regard we recommend that each goal and strategy set forth in the final Plan include a budget, clear milestones and quantifiable metrics to achieving the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Should you have questions or require additional information about this document, please contact Ian Kremer, LEAD's executive director. We look forward to working with you on this important effort.</p>
<p><em><strong>In developing these comments LEAD relied upon three workgroups -- one each in the areas of research and drug development, clinical care, and long-term care support and services -- representative of the sentiment and unique needs of the entire Alzheimer's-serving community. Participation in LEAD or in the development of these comments does not constitute an endorsement of each of the recommendations within this document by any particular organization. </strong></em></p>

</ul><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Over-arching Plan Recommendations</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Adopt all 2013 recommendations from the Advisory Council </em></strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan incorporate all the recommendations adopted by the Advisory Council at its January 2013 meeting.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Until such time as the statute may expand the number of seats on the Advisory Council, invite a person with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder to participate on each Advisory Council subcommittee as on outside expert</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that a mechanism be developed to have at least one person diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and one person diagnosed with a non- Alzheimer's dementing disorder begin actively participating in Advisory Council work no later than the summer of 2013. The public comment process is not an adequate substitute for comprehensive participation. The Advisory Council members and all federal officials involved in developing and implementing the Plan have stated unambiguously and with great integrity that the Plan addresses not only Alzheimer's disease but all dementing disorders; among the most important ways to give life to that commitment is to invite voices from a diverse range of dementing disorders.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 3: <em>Create a formal mechanism for additional federal government agencies to participate in the Advisory Council process</em> </strong></p>
<p>Rightly, HHS is leading the federal effort to develop and implement the Plan; HHS has encouraged and welcomed participation by other federal agencies. LEAD recommends that such participation be more formal, consistent, and robust. While expansion of statutory membership on the Advisory Council is one option worth consideration, LEAD believes that amending the statute is not a necessary prerequisite to convincing other federal agencies to participate voluntarily. At a minimum, the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Commerce, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education, along with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should participate in developing and implementing the Plan alongside colleagues from HHS and the Department of Veterans Affairs who already are engaged. Consider some representative examples: Labor and Education are critical to addressing health care workforce challenges; Hurricane Katrina and super storm Sandy painfully demonstrated the need for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop preparedness strategies for when natural disasters separate people with dementia from their care providers and settings; Alzheimer's disease science rapidly has become a critical issue in global economic competitiveness requiring attention by Commerce; both the Commerce Department and the State Department likely could contribute to HHS efforts to expand collaboration with foreign governments in coordinating existing national plans and potentially developing a global Plan; OPM and OMB need to be at the table to assess the impact on both the federal workforce and the federal budget.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 4: <em>Encourage participation in the Plan process by experts on non-dementing disorders that have a high rate of co-morbidity with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder</em> </strong></p>
<p>The Plan already encourages public-private partnerships (PPPs) and breaking down any tendencies to work in silos. LEAD recommends that the Advisory Council and HHS strongly encourage both formal and informal participation in the process of developing and implementing the Plan by public and private sector stakeholders with expertise in other disorders which have a high rate of comorbidity with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. For example, many people have both Alzheimer's disease and diabetes; while it is not yet clear with there is only a high correlation or a causal relationship, it is clear that it is much more financially costly and physically injurious to have both conditions together than either condition alone. The National Institute on Aging certainly could establish dialogue with other relevant NIH institutes focused on co-morbid conditions while Alzheimer's disease patient advocacy organizations on the Advisory Council could establish similar dialogue with patient advocacy organizations focused on co-morbid conditions to advance implementation of the Plan and develop recommendations for future revisions. Working collaboratively in the public and private sectors should make more effective efforts to reduce or better manage co-morbid conditions and, potentially, accelerate pursuit of scientific interventions to reduce the incidence of such conditions.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 5: <em>Identify and define a role for individuals and family members/family caregivers in each major section of the Plan</em> </strong></p>
<p>Individuals and family members/family caregivers are capable of contributing to memory loss detection, increasing participation in clinical trials, improving clinical care, reducing stigma, and raising public awareness. LEAD recommends that the Plan clearly identify and define ways in which individuals and family members (or their identified family caregivers) can support effective implementation of each major action or strategy within the Plan.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 6: <em>Incorporate throughout the Plan clear and transformative time-based metrics with projected necessary funding levels</em> </strong></p>
<p>It is abundantly clear to LEAD and others across the Alzheimer's-serving community how remarkable the work is that the Advisory Council and federal officials have done in a very compressed time frame. The depth and variety of recommendations and actions developed thus far have been impressive. Policy experts likely are able to unpack how these elements translate to changing real people's real problems. The Plan as a whole needs language that can be much more readily identified by the general public, language that will make clear how the Plan will change their lives. This is particularly needed in the Plan's clinical care and long terms supports goals. In the research goal, the Plan has that language in the form of the 2025 goal. But the complexity of the language and the sort of inside Washington nature of what is proposed in the Advisory Council recommendations and what is already embedded in the Plan's clinical care and long term supports sections, is impenetrable for average citizens who need the Plan to work but who also need to be inspired by the Plan and have their hope sustained or restored by the Plan. There should be aspirational goals across the Plan that are tangible, transformative, and clear. Take the model of the 2025 goal and frame parallel goals in the clinical care and long term supports portions of the Plan. Much of what already exists in those sections of the Plan already point in the direction of what would be aspirational goals but those aspirational goals have not been articulated. The Plan proposes to fix the systems but does not articulate why the systems need to be fixed or what would be achieved as a result of fixing the systems.</p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan adopt time-based goals -- that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other public and private sector agencies could collaborate to implement -- for:</p>
<ul><li>increasing the percentage of people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder who are diagnosed and the diagnosis properly charted in the medical record, informed of the diagnosis, and referred by the diagnosing medical practice to community resources;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of wandering and the rate of injury or death;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of family caregiver depression;</li>
<li>decreasing the incidence of falls by people with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder in home and community based settings as well as in residential care facilities; and</li>
<li>increasing the utilization of hospice and other palliative care services.</li>
</ul><p>LEAD recognizes that most or all of the goals, strategies and action items within the Plan entail significant federal investments designed to reduce over time costs to the public and private health care systems, the economy, and the toll of human suffering. LEAD recommends that the Plan articulate the federal investments needed to achieve the established goals and value of the budgetary, economic and social benefits that are to be accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 7: <em>Commission an independent analysis of the investment value of Alzheimer's disease spending by the federal government</em> </strong></p>
<p>Members of Congress, the Administration and tens of millions of Americans recognize the strategic irrationality and inhumanity of the enormous federal expenditures on care for people with Alzheimer's compared to the relatively miniscule federal investment on research to prevent, treat or cure this devastating disease. But that imbalance persists and worsens year after year in part because the federal government scores federal research spending as a cost rather than an investment. The scoring system therefore ignores not only the future cost-savings to social safety net programs but also the future revenue gains that would accrue from development of new products with a vast global market, increases in workplace productivity, and an expanded workforce. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for an independent body to assess the investment value of the federal government's Alzheimer's disease research funding and provide policy options to correct the current imbalance between federal funding for research and care.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025 </strong></p>
<p>LEAD supports this bold goal, with the hope that it will be achieved more rapidly with the right plan and resource commitment. LEAD is pleased that the Advisory Council has included a number of recommendations submitted by the coalition under Goal 1, including the recommendation for a strategic approach to focus efforts and resources on "the most promising pharmacological interventions" as well as accelerating efforts to "identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease." LEAD applauds the increasing emphasis on international coordination and collaboration with commercial and nonprofit partners. However, it is imperative that any goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease must include research investments in non-pharmacological treatments. Nonpharmacological approaches can improve relevant outcomes including improved behavior and delay of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 1 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds NIH/NIA for convening the first Research Summit in May of 2012 and for its plans to reconvene every other year around specific research topics of high priority to the field. LEAD recommends that each summit provide explicit strategies and milestones to be met within defined timeframes. Furthermore, LEAD recommends that each summit have a specific session to report milestones and the progress of strategies set at previous summits.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that HHS carryout and begin implementing by the end of 2013 the action plan produced by its intended convening of representatives from across the federal government, state and local governments, academic medical research institutions, and the private sector to create an action plan for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, including through the building of registries.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions </strong></p>
<p>Strategies to expand research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease should reference industry's contribution in conducting clinical trials. Strategies should build on the infrastructure that exists in industry for discovering promising new therapeutic targets and therapies--including combination therapies--for trials and their existing working relationships with regulators to ensure that safe and effective treatments get approved. The NIH/NIA 2012 Alzheimer's disease Summit included debate on examining the current conceptual models in studying the disease as well as providing a portion of federal funding for cutting-edge proposals. Non-pharmacologic interventions should also be explored, including community-based interventions and technologies that allow people with dementia to function independently for as long as possible. Strategies should include a statement of what each federal and industry partner can contribute and where the cost and time of the clinical trial process can be reduced consistent with standards of safety and efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression </strong></p>
<p>To further support a strategy to identify early and presymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease, government, industry, and patient advocacy organizations should work together to develop a large-scale, open-source patient registry of subjects that can be approached for recruitment in prevention trials, including specifically under-represented ethnic and other sub-populations. Consider a broader healthy aging registry, similar to the Framingham study for cardiovascular disease, to follow asymptomatic individuals and those with correlated diseases such as diabetes (the new European Medical Information Framework -- Innovative Medicines Initiative consortium has a similar aim). Trials focused on identifying early stages of Alzheimer's disease should be based on development of quantitative clinical trial models designed for studies in early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector </strong></p>
<p>With the levels of funding now dedicated by government, academia, and industry to Alzheimer's disease research, it is important to make the most efficient use possible of all partners and resources -- and make the best use of the limited number of patients available for clinical trials. There is a need to align government, industry and academic sponsored studies to achieve consensus on defined recommendations for advancing new drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. A precedent exists in other disease areas (e.g. STAIR recommendations for stroke). Current public-private partnerships in the Alzheimer's disease arena have not yet owned this opportunity to date. Funding would catalyze such progress. Research should be a community-wide effort for public private collaboration and HHS should consider asking the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to help coordinate this effort with them.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.1: Pursue ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments </strong></p>
<p>There are many important -- albeit underfunded -- strategies being pursued to speed treatments to patients such as disease modeling, drug repurposing, better target identification, and strategies for combination therapy. However, a major issues remains with respect to the lack of a centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB). LEAD recommends that this Action include expanded public and private support for a uniform patient consent and centralized IRB to review all multi-center Alzheimer's disease trials to decrease the time for trial start-up and protocol amendments.</p>
<p>The National Biomedical Research Ethics Council (NBREC) has been incorporated as a "neutral" home to develop a National IRB for Neurodegenerative Diseases (NIRB-ND). The NIRB-ND will closely follow the Central IRB model pioneered successfully by the National Cancer Institute, and it will be managed by a Steering Committee composed of representatives from the sponsoring organizations/foundations.</p>
<p>Given the proposed changes to the "Common Rule" on the topic of centralized IRBs (cIRBs) and the National Institutes of Health's growing interest in cIRBs, this effort will provide an innovative solution to a problem shared by many constituencies interested in therapy development. The NBREC approach features the establishment of a successful public-private partnership business model. The NIRB-ND will guarantee the protection of study volunteers, reduce needless delays in large clinical trials, decrease costs and reduce risks associated with studies. The project is exploring options for expanding reviews to include Canada and eventually countries within the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings </strong></p>
<p>There is an exponential growth in the number of public and private partnerships (PPPs) in the Alzheimer's disease arena, which is simultaneous with a concern of consortia fatigue. The sense of urgency exists to address improved understanding of the scope of activities (in scope and out of scope) for the numerous PPPs, and specifically how alignment is taking place to avoid duplication of effort. Positive examples exist of synergistic alliances between ACT-AD, C-Path and CAMD, ADNIPPSB/Alzheimer's Association, and the Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease. Defining specified resources aimed at facilitating coordinating PPPs is an unmet and urgent need. Leadership from ASPE is crucial and should be made a priority.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Address the unique circumstances of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their ability to provide informed consent for clinical trial participation</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan include a process for developing standardized informed consent to allow participants in clinical trials to authorize their deidentified data be used for research purposes broader than a single study in order to advance understanding, treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. LEAD recommends pooling of individual de-identified data into larger Alzheimer's disease databases -- globally available to qualified researchers -- to allow data mining and to increase statistical significance, provide information on the natural history of Alzheimer's disease, identify promising biomarkers and response or non-response to treatment. This database would need to address privacy, HIPPA, informed consent and liability issues and need a mechanism to protect proprietary and confidential data. Research activities involving human participants will continue to be conducted in a way that promotes their rights and welfare but include a feature for allowing Alzheimer's patients to opt in and contribute their de-identified data for research as in public databases or opt out for those who do not want to allow their data to be used for research purposes.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Implement Alzheimer's disease specific data standards to ensure a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data</em> </strong></p>
<p>The Plan should encourage all new and ongoing federally funded and industrysponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to use the same Alzheimer's disease specific data standards developed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data standards provide a uniform approach for collection, transfer, analysis, reporting and archiving of data. The benefits of using common data standards include improved learning and knowledge generation and a reduction in time, resources and costs. Using these standards will facilitate data sharing and review by the FDA and EMA. Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data, including data in failed trials, data with respect to dormant drugs, and data rich in biomarker information, should be remapped to the same common Alzheimer's disease CDISC data standards and any federally funded and industry sponsored Alzheimer's disease clinical trials data recorded should be shared in a common Alzheimer's disease database for qualified research use. Given the FDA's preference and future requirement for submission of clinical data in CDISC unified clinical data standards, it is recommended that data be collected for current and future clinical trials in CDISC format using the AD CDISC therapeutic area specific standards. Lack of action on this recommendation will slow the time for regulatory drug review of any new therapeutic candidate.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>LEAD is pleased that the Plan includes the goal to enhance care quality and efficiency. The Plan for Alzheimer's disease should focus on developing and continuously improving the care of our citizens in home or community settings by offering the best risk management, prevention strategies, early detection, precise diagnosis, and long-term management available. The strategies outlined for Goal 2 provide a platform for ensuring that all Americans requiring care for Alzheimer's disease are able to access quality care across various care settings.</p>
<p>As the Plan has evolved from the Alzheimer's Disease Study Group (ASG), to the Advisory Council and the first Plan, we have not adequately motivated the Plan with a clear vision of what clinical care should look like in the United States. The comprehensive effort to date has been laudable and has advanced the country's goals with respect to research. But research advances will not have the impact that they should unless we begin with an equally broad and forwardlooking conceptualization of clinical care.</p>
<p>ASG recommendations related to clinical care in 2009 were limited to a focus on measurements of quality, making paid caregiving available, and educating the public about the disease. There was an implicit assumption that medical care is already uniform, executed consistently and well in diverse settings, and that it encompasses the public need. In 2011, LEAD recommended that the Plan include development of a workforce to diagnose and care for people with memory disorders; improve models for reimbursement that incentivize practitioners to diagnose early and treat persistently; support pilot and demonstration projects to improve the care that is available; develop innovative new models for care; improvement of emergency care for people with dementia; and establishment of a network of geographically accessible memory disorders centers to serve as translational sites to advance the medicine around prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of AD and related conditions. The first Plan was very strong on collaborations among agencies, advancement of neuroimaging and biological markers to aid in early diagnosis and drug development, educating the workforce and disseminating existing guidelines (albeit limited and out of date), as well as educating the public. It also mentioned the need to strengthen direct care, without describing the deficiencies; the need to survey unmet needs; to develop cost-effective models of care; to improve minority care; to protect the vulnerable; and to assess the housing needs of people with dementia. These listings may be perceived as somewhat piecemeal and secondary by people at risk for and living with memory disorders, their families, and healthcare workers.</p>
<p>Clinical care should encompass detection of risk factors, management of risk factors, early diagnosis and lifelong management, regardless of social differences, medical co-morbidities, and physical location. Citizens should be able to count on comparable approaches regardless of where they live or how they fund their healthcare. New advances in research related to risk, diagnosis, and treatment should translate easily into clinical settings, so that willing patients can help to prove or disprove their utility. And clinicians who choose to promote brain health and provide care to people with memory disorders across the stages of their lives should be able to do so without bankrupting their practices. Without some effort to develop a national, clinical focus on specialized prevention and care approaches, there will be no true expertise--and the greatest advances to date are at risk of being irrelevant because there is no coherent approach to ensuring that they shape practices in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 2 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties </strong></p>
<p>The Plan recognizes both the worsening shortage in the geriatric specialty workforce and the dire consequences that the shortage causes for the growing population of people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. LEAD recommends that the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) support training projects that provide fellowships for individuals studying to be geriatric social workers.</p>
<p><strong>Action 2.A.6: Support state and local Alzheimer's strategies </strong></p>
<p>The Plan recognizes that many states and local communities have developed dementia strategies and action plans. The Advisory Council repeatedly has discussed opportunities for the national Plan and these state or local plans to share and reinforce best practices. LEAD recommends that HHS and the Department of Labor collaboratively develop best practices for direct-care workforce development, recruitment, and retention tailored to each provider setting in the Alzheimer's disease care continuum including: home health, adult day, assisted living, skilled nursing, and hospice.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Address inconsistencies across geographic areas and subspecialties, and from provider to provider</em> </strong></p>
<p>Clinical approaches to risk management, diagnosis, and treatment are inconsistent across geographical areas and subspecialties, and also vary from care provider to care provider. Existing education of physicians regarding dementia and related disorders is also quite limited, despite the fact that the Medicare Trust Fund spends over $9 billion annually to subsidize Graduate Medical Education. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for conducting a nationwide assessment of available expertise by region of the country including expert clinicians in all relevant specialties (family practice, general internal medicine, geriatrics, neurology, psychology, psychiatry, and social work), paid caregivers, day centers, overnight respite care, and long term care options. This should include examination of current practices for risk factor management, diagnosis, longitudinal outpatient management, emergency management, and long term residential care in each area. Additionally, all residency programs should be assessed for the amount of education and training focused on dementia and related disorders.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 2: <em>Update reimbursement formulas to encourage brain health risk management, early diagnosis of memory disorders, persistent and multi-disciplinary treatment, and uniform levels of treatment across care settings</em> </strong></p>
<p>The current reimbursement system discourages brain health related risk management, early diagnosis of memory disorders, persistent treatment, multidisciplinary treatment, and uniform levels of treatment regardless of care setting. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for an analysis (to be completed by the end of 2013) of the actual costs and reimbursements for laboratory services and patient visits for risk factor management, diagnosis, and longitudinal outpatient management, and for diagnosis and management within long term care settings. The analysis should benchmark successful programs and practices. LEAD also recommends that the Plan call for HHS to propose (by the summer of 2014) options to correct the reimbursement formulas as needed to optimize these efforts; funding for demonstration projects for models of care across the spectrum of disease; and funding for demonstration projects to assess the impact of dementia specific medical homes. For example, reimbursement levels might be tied to whether nationally certified dementia specific services were provided.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 3: <em>Address inadequate emergency and acute hospital care for people with memory disorders, especially those with dementia</em> </strong></p>
<p>Inadequate emergency and acute hospital care imposes staggering costs on the physical and emotional well being of patients, families, and medical personnel. The economic costs to patients, providers, public and private insurers are unsustainable. The horror stories are well known, more typical than anecdotal, and all too true. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for HHS to complete (by the end of 2013) a nationwide assessment of the available inpatient and outpatient emergency care for dementia patients with acute agitation or psychosis and the quality of inpatient care for people with memory disorders hospitalized for non-dementia related conditions. LEAD further recommends that the Plan call for HHS to propose (by the summer of 2014) methods to incentivize hospitals and psychiatrists to handle dementia related emergencies and standards for emergency care for people with dementia. For example, HHS could consider proposing standards for geriatric psychiatry units, which currently are not required to have a psychiatrist or even a geriatrician.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 4: <em>Establish a network of geographically dispersed and accessible memory disorders centers, linked to sites providing integrated research and patient care, to facilitate translational medicine, and to continuously develop and improve the standard of care</em> </strong></p>
<p>Access to quality care -- and the application of medical practice to transformative research -- all too frequently is compromised by geographical happenstance. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for provision of supplemental funding to the centers for infrastructure and reporting, and ensure adequate reimbursement within the centers to support clinical infrastructure. Additionally, LEAD recommends that the Plan establish a target date of 2017 for HHS to develop a comprehensive national public health strategy for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders which includes for all Americans regardless of age or care setting early assessment of risk factors, advice about risk mitigation, access to diagnosis and disease management.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and Their Families </strong></p>
<p>LEAD applauds the Plan for including goals and strategies that will improve quality care and expand support for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their families. Specifically, we are pleased that the Plan includes recommendations from LEAD to expand proven programs that are in place at the federal, state and local levels that provide adequate care and support for people with Alzheimer's and other dementias and their families. Moving forward it is important that the Plan provide adequate resources to be available to support the implementation of these strategies.</p>
<p>Below please find LEAD's recommendations for Goal 3 of the Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials </strong></p>
<p>Stigma has diverse cultural bases and forms of expression. Reducing stigma and its consequences requires culturally appropriate interventions. LEAD recommends that stigma be identified as a specific criteria when implementing Actions 3.A.1, 3.A.2, and 2.A.3.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.B.3: Review the state of the art of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations </strong></p>
<p>The Plan calls for HHS to "partner with private organizations to convene a meeting of leading scientists and practitioners to review the state of the art of research and translational activities related to evidence-based interventions that can be delivered by community-based organizations." LEAD recommends that the Plan now call for such a meeting to be an annual occurrence.</p>
<p><strong>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>LEAD supports this Plan action and recommends that it be expanded to include education for court personnel, financial planners, and first responders. A number of states and local communities have extensive and evidence-based experience partnering with private organizations such as the Alzheimer's Association in educating first responders and court personnel (some have worked with financial planners) to better meet the needs of people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders and of family caregivers. At a minimum, HHS and the Department of Justice could serve as a clearinghouse for best practices in educating legal, financial, and emergency services professionals.</p>
<p><strong>New Recommendation 1: <em>Require training for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders</em> </strong></p>
<p>LEAD recommends that the Plan call for development of training standards, for health and social service professionals caring for people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, by government and private agencies that regulate, accredit, license and certify residential care and community care. Such providers should include directors of nursing, nurse supervisors, nursing assistants and respite caregivers. The settings requiring certification should include home care, adult day care, assisted living, and nursing home. The training should be based on evidence-based guidelines that have been developed through a consensus processes among providers, family caregivers, other advocates, and people with dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 2: <em>Develop best practices to help family caregivers remain productive in the workplace</em> </strong></p>
<p>Many family caregivers want or need to remain in the workforce but face substantial challenges that could be addressed successfully with workplace policies designed for elder care and based on the accommodations begun more than a generation ago for working parents. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for development of best practices to help family caregivers remain productive in the workplace. Best practices may include flextime; work-at-home options; jobsharing; counseling; dependent care accounts; information and referral to community services; and employer-paid services of a care manager.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation 3: <em>Assess the impact on and develop best practices for supporting children who are family caregivers</em> </strong></p>
<p>At the local, state, and federal levels, enormous investments are committed to advancing the academic and personal success of children. Increasingly, there is widespread -- perhaps universal -- realization that the efficacy of such investments can be enhanced or diminished by students' home environment. LEAD recommends that the Plan call for HHS and the Department of Education to collaboratively examine the consequences of Alzheimer's disease family caregiving on the academic achievement, and social-emotional well being of children and develop best practices for schools to support the needs of these students.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's is a deadly and unforgiving disease that affects 5.4 million Americans and costs hundreds of billions of dollars to our country each year. One in seven American workers is, or has been, a caregiver for a loved one with Alzheimer's or dementia. A crisis of this magnitude merits an equally serious response. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is a bold and groundbreaking effort that will help beat Alzheimer's by 2025, but it must be strengthened if we are to reach that goal.</p>
<p>The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services met in January and made recommendations to HHS. The Council emphasized the urgent need for greater federal research funding, stronger and expanded support for families and caregivers, and a detailed road map with milestones to advance us towards the ultimate goal: the prevention and effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease by 2025. These recommendations are so critical to the effectiveness of the plan that the Council unanimously approved them.</p>
<p>As the Department updates the national plan, I urge you to ensure that these recommendations are included in the 2013 version. We can beat Alzheimer's, but we need a plan that's aggressive, that ensures we have the resources we need, and that includes a detailed road map to getting to a cure.</p>

<p>These areas listed above, and perhaps some others need to be a (rural, farmland friendly) National Conservation area (i.e. via USDA,OTR, national forests) conserving our mountain range, ridgelines, water,headwaters,groundwater, wetlands, watersheds, creeks, streams, environment, wildlife, endangered/migratory species in and around these above areas, preserving the historic roads, trails,etc., now and in the future.</p>
<p>Also, many people could probably use the Class Act, if it, or something similar is ever passed, implemented,etc.</p>
<p>These areas listed above,etc., do not need to further "chop up" and/or subdivide the lands,etc., as that causes stormwater runoff problems, and flooding.</p>
<p>These areas listed above do not need big houses, "McMansions", retirement villages, paved surfaces, etc., nor do they need to be more developed then they are. They already have too much and too many people trying to live there, as they are close to headwater areas, and recharge/discharge areas, that need open lands, spaces, forests,etc.</p>
<p>These areas listed above do not need more homes close to the headwater areas, as many of these headwaters provide drinking water for many people in other areas, and states. Also, these areas are possibly prone to dangerous sinkholes, etc., as these areas do have openings in the ground releasing water, as well as caverns and caves, much of which may not have even been reported. Many of the residents in and around these areas, still use thier well water for at least part of their water supply, even though "city water" was brought out into these areas, with people feeling that the city was just being humane in supplying water to people out here, due to an excessive drought we were in at the time, no one was really connecting it to the possiblity that they might want to use that as a possible reason to add more developments, or ex/sub/urbanize these historic rural, headwater areas, etc.</p>
<p>These areas do not need big population increases, or gas/sewer lines, or more septic tanks at all.</p>
<p>However, if someone needed a home in these rural conservation areas, it needs to be a smaller home, possibly a mobile or modular home, not a trailer park, or a development, these areas need to remain as quiet and backwoods as possible, with an increase in natural tourism in areas such as equestrian activities, clean agriculture, birding tours, ecotourism, history, and more.</p>
<p>Though we are not living in Chattanooga, hopefully the fact they just elected democrat mayor Andy Berke may help with these and other needs, in addition to whatever help your could provide. Thank you.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's is a deadly and unforgiving disease that affects 5.4 million Americans and costs hundreds of billions of dollars to our country each year. One in seven American workers is, or has been, a caregiver for a loved one with Alzheimer's or dementia. A crisis of this magnitude merits an equally serious response. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is a bold and groundbreaking effort that will help beat Alzheimer's by 2025, but it must be strengthened if we are to reach that goal.</p>
<p>The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services met in January and made recommendations to HHS. The Council emphasized the urgent need for greater federal research funding, stronger and expanded support for families and caregivers, and a detailed road map with milestones to advance us towards the ultimate goal: the prevention and effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease by 2025. These recommendations are so critical to the effectiveness of the plan that the Council unanimously approved them.</p>
<p>As the Department updates the national plan, I urge you to ensure that these recommendations are included in the 2013 version. We can beat Alzheimer's, but we need a plan that's aggressive, that ensures we have the resources we need, and that includes a detailed road map to getting to a cure.</p>
<p>My personal story is surprising for an Advance Practice RN, it was right before my eyes and I didn't recognize it for years.</p>
<p>My husband was a decorated military pilot who became an Airline Pilot and flew until September 10, 2001. He returned from Istanbul the day before 9/11 and didn't fly again since his 60th birthday was at the end of September and he was forced to retire. He completed Law School after he retired and passed the Bar Exam. It took he a couple of tries, but I attributed that to his age rather than a declining mental status. He worked as an attorney for 3 years and then it just became too much, so he retired. It was only after being evaluated for Depression, PTSD and being counseled by a wonderful VA counselor that our Primary Care Physician became worried and ordered an MRI that the diagnosis of Alzheimerscame. He now participates in a Drug Study through Summit Research and is stable on an Alzheimer's medication and he is doing as well as we can expect for early to moderate Alzheimers. He is benefiting from the Research Study because of the Medical professionals he interacts with and our lives will be disrupted again if the funding disappears. This experience gives stability to our lives and helps us cope and have hope for the future. Please employ a reasoned view and do not cut essential medical research funding, it will take us back to a place where hope is not part of so many people's lives. And hope is what keeps us going.</p>

<p>Dear Decision Maker:</p>
<p>With the Baby Boomer aging rapidly the oldest being at the age of 70 yrs old and with Alzheimersbeing a trait inherited by either parents there is likely hood of 1/2 th population being in nursing home or will be cared for at home due to the cost of nursing home care which for most americansis prohibitive in daily costs the idea of workers working tiltheir 70 leaves them no choice but nursing home or in home health care by family members not a feasible thing to do in this society where two incomes are an economic must.</p>
<p>Please include a National Plan for those that will without a doubt circum to AlzheimersDisease as they are Baby Boomers now dealing with elderly parents with not much choice available to themselves as well, Sincerely judy wisboro</p>

<p>My mother (1919-1998) had 3rd or 4th stroke with dementia complicationher last 3 yrs.Primarily, her last yr., she lost her memories of family members, events and communication skills.My mother was a vibrant wife of a USMC LtCol (Retd) husband (1919-1991).She basically was a single-parent for 24 yrs. of active assignments, raising 3 daughters and son, all with special needs, before there were medical diagnoses, education &amp; community supports.</p>
<p>We don't need to go back to what my mother fought against--the denials and accusation by providers, of whom she tried to seek help.The families today and in the future need all the hope medical research can give that Alzheimers/dementia does not have rob individuals of their most precious family memories.</p>

<p>My note: I'm a nurse and have seepatients in various stages of the disease, it's horrid. The confusion and fear on the faces of people fairly early in the disease, the exhaustion on the faces of the family member's faces as they recount the various ways that they have tried to keep their loved one safe. The agonisedlooks on the family's faces as they listen to their loved one just moan and scream. The guilty look of relief when they finally put their loved one in a home. The look of total relief mixed with grief when their loved one dies. It is a horrible disease for everyone involved, a disease that we need to find a cure for. None of us know if we'll get the disease. How many of us joke a little nervously that we must be getting Alzheimer's disease when we forget what we just were saying or why we came into that particular room? For how many of us will that joke become a reality? Please help in the fight against this disease, don't let your little joke become your reality.</p>

Over 5.4 million Americans are afflicted with Alzheimer's disease at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars to our country each year. By 2050, 11-16 million people are expected to have this form of dementia. A crisis of this financial and emotional magnitude deserves an equally serious response.

<p>My mother was his caretaker, until she ended up with Ovarian Cancer. Then my sister stepped in to care for both of them, until she ended up with cancer. I stepped in after that, and I ended up with cancer. Being a caretaker is an unbelievably stressful job, and wears people down. We are prime examples. They are all gone now, taken by their illnesses.

<p>As Nancy mentioned, attached is a letter from CSWE providing additional comment on the National Plan. Please share with the Advisory Council and however else you see fit. Let me know if you have questions.</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>From: <strong>Nancy Hooyman</strong></p>
<p>When we met in November 2011 at the CSWE Annual Program Meeting, I indicated that I would send you information about teaching materials that support social work students' attainment of competencies in working with persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their families. Since then, I have been contacting social work faculty and asking them to submit such curricular resources. After I review all the submissions to ensure their quality, these materials will be posted on the Gero-Ed Center website (<a href="http://www.Gero-EdCenter.org">http://www.Gero-EdCenter.org</a>), which will ensure their dissemination nationally.</p>
<p>These teaching resources can be categorized as case studies; in-class exercises; media; and course syllabi. Most of the case studies and in-class exercises provide opportunities for students to practice assessment skills. However, field placements or service learning experiences are the most widely used mechanism to prepare students to work with older adults with dementia. Nearly every social work program that has responded to our request for curricular resources has placements with the local Alzheimer's Association, adult day health centers that serve persons with dementia, memory care units in skilled nursing facilities and geriatric assessment clinics. There are also placements that are not in typical geriatric settings, such as students in prison settings working with inmates with dementia, advocating at their state legislatures for more funding for services for persons with Alzheimer's disease, or implementing recreational music as a way to reduce stress for social workers practicing with persons with dementia.</p>
<p>I will update you once we have all these materials categorized on our website. At that point, I hope that you will be able to inform others, including the Geriatric Education Centers, of their availability. These curricular resources could be readily adapted by other professions and disciplines for teaching purposes to ensure competence in working with persons with AD.</p>
<p>I also understand that Wendy Naus will also be sending you a letter from Darla Spence Coffey, the President of the Council on Social Work Education commenting on the National Plan. We hope that you will be able to distribute that letter to your colleagues at HHS and Advisory Council members. We are most appreciative of your support of social work as a key profession in working with persons with AD and their families.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em><strong>Public Comment on the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></em></p>
<p>On behalf of the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), I am pleased to provide this written comment to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as it works on the next iteration of the <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
<p>First, allow me to thank you for your willingness to engage with CSWE over the last several months to hear about the issues and concerns of the social work education community with respect to tackling the challenges of Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the opportunity to provide our community's perspective into this important dialogue and are hopeful that social work will continue to be recognized as a contributing participant in care for patients and families affected by Alzheimer's disease and that social work will be explicitly named alongside its partner professions in the next National Plan.</p>
<p>As discussed in our previous written comment to HHS and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services, CSWE remains primarily concerned about the preparation of the workforce to meet the needs of the Alzheimer's disease patient and caregiver community. The goal of producing a workforce that incorporates all necessary players--including social workers--equipped with the needed skills cannot be achieved without enhanced investment in recruitment, training, and retention of students in the health professions who will be working with older adults. Simply put, we will not have the capacity to meet the already overwhelming demand for services and supports if we do not invest today in the current and future workforce.</p>
<p>Therefore, CSWE wholeheartedly endorses <strong>Recommendation 7</strong> of the Council's <strong>Clinical Care Subcommittee</strong>, made in January 2013, to: "<em>Expand funding and incentives to encourage individuals to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</em>," through interprofessional education and training activities, existing funding mechanisms, such as the Title VII and Title VIII programs at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and through the creation of new loan repayment programs. While it is critically important to ensure that the current workforce receive the training it needs to provide adequate services, investment in the workforce pipeline is what will truly move the dial for Alzheimer's disease patients and caregivers. The current and projected workforce shortages across the health professions have been well-documented. With respect to social work, only an average of 5 percent of all social work graduates completed a specialization in aging in 2009-2010 (CSWE, 2011).<sup>1</sup> We, the social work education community and the federal government, must get serious and creative about incentivizing more social workers to enter careers in geriatrics. The Advisory Council made this recommendation to HHS in May 2012 as well, and CSWE urges HHS to incorporate such a goal in the next National Plan.</p>
<p>Second, as an educational organization representing 2,500 individual members and nearly 700 graduate and undergraduate programs of professional social work education, as well as the national accreditor for social work education programs in the U.S., CSWE works with programs on the development and dissemination of curriculum covering a variety of practice areas, including geriatrics. We are appreciative of efforts by HHS to include CSWE in discussions about curricular needs for health professions involved in Alzheimer's disease care and hope to continue to engage with HRSA and other parts of the Department to this end to discuss the development and dissemination of educational materials.</p>
<p>However, it is important to clarify a few limitations with respect to Recommendation 4 by the Clinical Care Subcommittee and Recommendation 4 by the Long-Term Services and Supports Subcommittee dealing with the development of required dementia-specific curriculum for practitioners. The social work accreditation standards have been designed to ensure that all social work students achieve specified skills and knowledge or competencies but do not specify content to attain these competencies. At the baccalaureate level, programs are instructed to provide a generalist curriculum to ensure that graduates are prepared to function at the beginning professional level in the variety of settings in which BSW graduates are employed, which includes services to people across the lifespan and across different delivery systems. At the master's level, programs are instructed to build on these competencies and apply them in areas of specialization appropriate to their mission and responsive to their region. Currently, there are 52 master's programs offering a certificate in aging/gerontology and 57 master's programs offering a concentration; we would fully expect that these programs either already include dementia-specific curricula or would welcome the assistance in infusing this content into the curriculum. CSWE is committed to facilitating this process of ensuring that social work graduates are prepared to work with persons with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Through initiatives such as CSWE's National Center for Gerontological Social Work Education, supported by the John A. Hartford Foundation, we are able to develop and disseminate curricular resources to our programs for their use. Though not <em>mandatory curriculum</em>, these resources can help shape program content and infuse the most up-to-date research and thinking on a given topic.</p>
<p>Therefore, with respect to the <strong>Clinical Care Subcommittee's Recommendation 4</strong>:</p>
<p><em>"Develop a unified curriculum for primary care practitioners to become more knowledgeable about Alzheimer's disease and enhance the skills necessary to deliver dementia capable care." </em></p>
<p>and the <strong>Long-Term Services and Supports Subcommittee's Recommendation 4</strong>:</p>
<p><em>"State education and health agencies and others should include key information about [Alzheimer's disease] in all curricula for any profession or career track affecting [long-term services and supports]." </em></p>
<p>while CSWE supports the development of dementia-specific curricular resources that ensure practitioners (including social workers) across the health care team are equipped with a common sense of understanding and necessary skills, and would disseminate such resources to our programs for their consideration, CSWE would not be able to <em>mandate</em> the use of a unified curriculum to our programs. I would be happy to provide additional information or clarification on the accreditation process of professional organizations like CSWE if it would be helpful to you.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your work on this important initiative and for the opportunity to express these views on behalf of the Council on Social Work Education. CSWE is hopeful the updated National Plan will address the pipeline concerns highlighted above and promote curricular and other resource development that reflects what is possible for professional organizations. I would be happy to provide additional information about CSWE and our efforts to promote geriatric competencies among social work students. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.</p>

<p>I would like to submit the following comments to be shared at the January 14, 2013 meeting on behalf of Jean Wood.</p>
<p>Dear Members of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services:</p>
<p>On behalf of my collaborators in ACT on Alzheimers, the implementation group for the Minnesota Alzheimer's Plan, the Minnesota Board on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association MN ND, we would like to express our deepest appreciation for the work of NAPA and the recommendations to dedicate $10.5 million to seed the development of state action plans, restore ADSSP funding to $13.5 million and fully fund the National Family Caregivers Act. Minnesota using its own private and public resources has not only developed a legislatively approved Alzheimer's Plan but a powerful collaboration that has moved forward to implement the plan. ADSSP funding has been key to this effort as well as enabling Minnesota to implement important evidence-based interventions such as the New York University Caregiver Intervention. Minnesota relies on a network of dementia capable caregiver consultants many funded through the National Family Caregivers program to support Alzheimer's caregivers in the community. Minnesota has dedicated significant state and private dollars to building a dementia capable medical care and community care system of the highest quality. With the national coordination and funding that is being recommended by NAPA our work and that of other states would be greatly magnified and impact many more lives.</p>

<p>First of all, I would like to thank the Alzheimer Association, for making it possible for me to be here today, and reach another milestone.</p>
<p>As many of you know, I started reaching out to this Advisory Council when it first formed.</p>
<p>Helen Lamont, was kind enough to read my emails and comments, and I was given the opportunity to speak out and have a voice.</p>
<p>I have made a lot of progress with all of your help, but I wish I could say that a cure has been found, or even that we are close to eradicating this disease once and for all, but I can't.</p>
<p>I know your challenges are not easy, but I believe, that if we make, some hard choices, we can get to our shared goal. I truly believe, that if we redirect some of the funding, budget wisely, and fairly, we could be well on our way. While all medical causes are important, I feel that Alzheimer's and other related dementias are somewhat neglected, when it comes to funding compared to Cancer and HIV for example.</p>
<p>We have no cure; we have no way to slow its progress. There is a certain amount of discrimination, when funding is awarded, and I for one, would like to see this change.</p>
<p>Would the situation be different, if we had survivors who fought for the newly afflicted?</p>
<p>Would things be different, if we had the awareness campaigns attributed to other causes?</p>
<p>Would things be better, if more people, instead of suffering in silence, stepped up and said: 'we need help'?</p>
<p>I think the answer to those questions, is a resounding YES!!!</p>
<p>Why are people afraid to step forward? Because many of us are in denial, do you think I am looking forward to my life ending in such a devastating way?</p>
<p>Do you think I relish the fact, that my wife is going to have to take complete care of me?</p>
<p>Do you think I enjoy waking up everyday thinking: "is today the day I lose my voice or my ability to feed myself?"</p>
<p>Don't look me in the eye, and tell there is no funding, or that you can't get the support from your constituents! Please, fight for the more than 5 million Americans, living with Alzheimer', fight for me.</p>
<p>Someday, someone close to you, may be impacted by this disease. We are all paying the cost for not being proactive; we will all bear the cost if something is not done soon.</p>
<p><strong>Talking Point #1 </strong></p>
<p>Recently, the government has implemented a national plan, that addresses the growing needs of more than 5 million Americans living with Alzheimer's</p>
<p>As part of the National Plan, the government is looking at enhancing public awareness, through awareness campaigns, websites, etc. But this needs to be done on a large scale, for it to be effective.</p>
<p>The National Plan, includes a commitment to prevent, and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025. The time is now, for the government, to make a commitment to provide the funding necessary to make this goal a reality.</p>
<p>It is my hope, that this advisory council, recognizes the value voices, of people living with the disease, can bring to this process, and includes our perspective, in the development of the national plan.</p>
<p><strong>Talking Point #2 </strong></p>
<p>Let us talk about the stigma, of having Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>There are many misperceptions, surrounding Alzheimer's, to the extent, that even those of us who have the disease, often have misleading ideas about it.</p>
<p>Many caregivers, go through this journey alone, because they fear the reaction of others, to their loved ones diagnosis.</p>
<p>I have chosen to be an advocate, and share my story with others, on a national platform, as an Alzheimer's Association National Early-Stage Advisor. I do this because, I feel that the louder we shout about this problem, the more people will become aware of it. And as you know me, I do a lot of shouting.</p>
<p>This council has the opportunity, to make a significant impact, on the elimination of Alzheimer's stigma, and ensure, that individuals , and families living with dementia, do not have to experience this journey alone. Through public awareness campaigns, changing policies, implementing new policies, and prioritizing funding.</p>
<p>It is imperative, that you accept members on to the council, who are themselves are living with Alzheimer's disease. This will have a number of positive outcomes:</p>
<p>One, you will be publicly declaring, that individuals living in the early stage of Alzheimer's, are still capable of making meaningful contributions to society. Two, when you are looking at changing policies on our behalf, it would be of great benefit, to consult with individuals, living in the early stage of the disease. While some may think they know what is best for us, take advantage of our ability, to provide you with a firsthand account of the physical, mental, and emotional toll, the disease is taking on our lives, and the best way to support us. I say this, because I can assure you, that from my side of the fence, the view is very different.</p>
<p><strong>Talking Point #3 </strong></p>
<p>After receiving my diagnosis, I felt a sense a relief, knowing that I had an answer, to the cause of my symptoms. I discovered, that Alzheimer's disease is the only disease, among the top ten, that has not had, the scientific input, in terms of funding, or the legislative interest, which has resulted, in the fact, that in 2013, this disease still cannot be slowed, cured or prevented.</p>
<ul><li>Currently, Alzheimer's disease receives only $450 million for research, compared to $5.8 billion for cancer, and $3.1 billion for HIV/AIDS. I was astonished, at the lack of funding dedicated to addressing this health crisis</li>
<li>With the additional $50 million given to Alzheimer's research, and the <strong><u>proposed</u></strong> $80 million, we are headed in the right direction, but more needs to be done.</li>
<li>Historically, we know, that when the U.S. government makes a commitment to research, we have been successful, in finding disease modifying drugs. This has been the case, with HIV/AIDS, and for some cancers.</li>
<li>I appeal to this council, to do everything necessary, to ensure, that Alzheimer's disease, gets the exposure, commitment, and funding necessary, to change the course of the disease, before it impacts the lives of many more millions of Americans.</li>

<p>Although the official comment period has closed for the NAPA draft plan, I'm writing today to urge you to go bolder with the final plan to be released by HHS later this month.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is a cruel disease. It slowly steals one's intellect, ability to communicate, independence, and dignity, even control over basic bodily functions like eating and caring for personal hygiene. It also places an overwhelming burden on caregivers -- emotionally, physically, and financially.</p>
<p>The commitment to a 2025 deadline in the draft NAPA plan represents a major step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's. I am pleased that the plan recognizes the need for increasing enrollment in clinical trials, compressing the drug development process, accelerating targeted research, and better coordinating activities with other countries.</p>
<p>However, I am one of many concerned Alzheimer's advocates who believe that this first draft fails to present a strategy aggressive enough to achieve the goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer's within 13 years. It lacks specificity in terms of timelines and deadlines, provides no path to providing significantly greater resources, and does not hold a single high-level office or individual accountable for the overall plan.</p>
<p>I hope that HHS will address these issues so that the next version of the plan will be bolder.</p>
<p>With the number of Alzheimer's patients expected to triple in the coming decades, we must embrace a plan that eschews a "business-as-usual" approach and tackles Alzheimer's with the urgency and aggressiveness it requires. If not, we stand to lose millions more lives -- and trillions of dollars -- to this disease.</p>

<p>Good afternoon -- On behalf of the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), I am submitting the enclosed written public comment for the October 15 Advisory Council meeting.</p>
<p>Dr. Darla Spence Coffey, CSWE President, plans to also provide oral comment during the meeting.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>On behalf of the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), thank you for the opportunity to provide written comment on the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>CSWE is a nonprofit national association representing about 2,500 individual members as well as nearly 700 graduate and undergraduate programs of professional social work education. Founded in 1952, this partnership of educational and professional institutions, social welfare agencies, and private citizens is recognized as the sole accrediting agency for social work education in the United States. Social work education focuses students on leadership and direct practice roles helping individuals, families, groups, and communities by creating new opportunities that empower people to be productive, contributing members of their communities.</p>
<p>CSWE thanks the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Advisory Council for incorporating into the National Plan goals and strategies aimed at building a workforce equipped with the necessary skills to meet the needs of those living with dementia, including <em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em>. It is critical that supports and additional training be provided to workers already in practice to ensure that they can adequately meet the needs of those they are serving. However, we remain concerned about the preparation of the future workforce. The goal of producing a workforce that incorporates all necessary players--including social workers--with the necessary skills cannot be achieved without enhanced investment in recruitment, training, and retention of students in the health professions who will be working with older adults. The workforce pipeline must be considered if real progress is to be made and sustained.</p>
<p>To this end, CSWE strongly endorses the recommendations made by the Advisory Council in May 2012 that call on Congress to appropriate additional funding for health professions workforce programs. In particular, we strongly support the <strong>Clinical Care Subcommittee's Recommendation 8</strong>, which urges the prioritization of geriatrics education and training programs, including the Title VII and Title VIII programs at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), as well as loan repayment and other incentive initiatives. While social work is recognized throughout the Plan as a contributing member of the care team, without the workforce investments recommended by the Council, the social work profession will not have the capacity to meet such demand. It is estimated that by 2050, the number of social workers needed in long term care will grow to approximately 109,000 (nearly double the current workforce in this area) (DHHS, 2006). In 2009--2010, only an average of 5 percent of all social work graduates completed a specialization in aging (CSWE, 2011).<sup>1</sup> This number of graduates cannot begin to meet the workforce demands, especially in light of the retirement of increasing numbers of geriatric social workers. The social work profession will undoubtedly reach a breaking point if new investments are not made today to nurture a social work pipeline that generates a new crop of professionals skilled to work with older adults and specifically with the competencies to work with those with dementia and their family caregivers</p>
<p>Second, as an organization guided by an educational mission, CSWE plays a central role in the development and dissemination of curriculum covering a variety of practice areas. Through our John A. Hartford-funded National Center for Gerontological Social Work Education, we have enhanced the capacity of faculty and prepared students with competencies to work effectively with older adults and their families We applaud the Council's recommendation that HHS partner with health professions programs and organizations to work toward the development and use of geriatrics-specific curricula and would be eager to help disseminate such curricula to our member programs. CSWE has begun conversations with HHS on how we may be able to contribute on behalf of the social work education community and we welcome opportunities to ensure the dementia capacity of our faculty members and their students.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to express these views on behalf of the Council on Social Work Education. CSWE is hopeful that the updated National Plan will address the pipeline concerns highlighted above. I would be happy to provide additional information about CSWE and our efforts to promote geriatric competencies among social work students. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>As co-chairs of the Bipartisan Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus, we have reviewed the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. We commend you on this historic effort to fight Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and for the inclusion of Down syndrome in this National Plan. We are pleased the Plan establishes a taskforce to address the unique care challenges faced by people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, we are pleased that the Plan includes steps to improve access to long-term services and supports for younger people, including those with Down syndrome.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease attacks adults with Down syndrome at a younger age and with increased frequency when compared to the general population. The pathological findings of Alzheimer's disease have been described in the brains of people with Down syndrome since the 1800s There are genetic factors at play that, in part, explain these pathologic and clinical observations. NIH is funding Down syndrome research using natural history studies and imaging techniques to identify early markers of cognitive decline. These studies will undoubtedly help people with Down syndrome, but they will also have a broader application to those individuals in the general population who are at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease. By recognizing the specific link between Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, the National Plan will leverage <em><strong>all</strong></em> of the most current scientific data available. More importantly, millions of American's who are at risk for Alzheimer's disease will benefit from the research that is already underway for those with Down syndrome. This is truly a win-win for the entire community.</p>
<p>Again, we thank you for your inclusion of Down syndrome in the National Plan, but are asking you to go a step farther. <strong>We respectfully request that a representative from the Down syndrome research community be added to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services</strong>.</p>

<p>I had an opportunity to see the new site. While it may be a good start, you have sugar coated to many things. People need to know it all and the truth. Especially that people die from this disease.</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Obama Administration Presents National Plan to Fight Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius today released an ambitious national plan to fight Alzheimer's disease. The plan was called for in the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/</a>], which President Obama signed into law in January 2011. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/NatlPlan.shtml">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/NatlPlan.shtml</a>] sets forth five goals, including the development of effective prevention and treatment approaches for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias by 2025.</p>
<p>In February 2012, the administration announced that it would take immediate action to implement parts of the plan, including making additional funding available in fiscal year 2012 to support research, provider education and public awareness. Today, the Secretary announced additional specific actions, including the funding of two major clinical trials, jumpstarted by the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) infusion of additional FY 2012 funds directed at Alzheimer's disease; the development of new high-quality, up-to-date training and information for our nation's clinicians; and a new public education campaign and website to help families and caregivers find the services and support they need.</p>
<p>To help accelerate this urgent work, the President's proposed FY 2013 budget provides a $100 million increase for efforts to combat Alzheimer's disease. These funds will support additional research ($80 million), improve public awareness of the disease ($4.2 million), support provider education programs ($4.0 million), invest in caregiver support ($10.5 million), and improve data collection ($1.3 million).</p>
<p>"These actions are the cornerstones of an historic effort to fight Alzheimer's disease," Secretary Sebelius said. "This is a national plan--not a federal one, because reducing the burden of Alzheimer's will require the active engagement of both the public and private sectors."</p>
<p>The plan, presented today at the Alzheimer's Research Summit 2012: <em>Path to Treatment and Prevention</em>, was developed with input from experts in aging and Alzheimer's disease issues and calls for a comprehensive, collaborative approach across federal, state, private and non-profit organizations. More than 3,600 people or organizations submitted comments on the draft plan.</p>
<p>As many as 5.1 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease and that number is likely to double in the coming years. At the same time, millions of American families struggle with the physical, emotional and financial costs of caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The initiatives announced today include:</p>
<ul><li>Research -- The funding of new research projects by the NIH will focus on key areas in which emerging technologies and new approaches in clinical testing now allow for a more comprehensive assessment of the disease. This research holds considerable promise for developing new and targeted approaches to prevention and treatment. Specifically, two major clinical trials are being funded. One is a $7.9 million effort to test an insulin nasal spray for treating Alzheimer's disease. A second study, toward which NIH is contributing $16 million, is the first prevention trial in people at the highest risk for the disease.</li>
<li>Tools for Clinicians -- The Health Resources and Services Administration has awarded $2 million in funding through its geriatric education centers to provide high-quality training for doctors, nurses, and other health care providers on recognizing the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and how to manage the disease.</li>
<li>Easier access to information to support caregivers -- HHS' new website, <a href="http://www.alzheimers.gov">www.alzheimers.gov</a>, offers resources and support to those facing Alzheimer's disease and their friends and family. The site is a gateway to reliable, comprehensive information from federal, state, and private organizations on a range of topics. Visitors to the site will find plain language information and tools to identify local resources that can help with the challenges of daily living, emotional needs, and financial issues related to dementia. Video interviews with real family caregivers explain why information is key to successful caregiving, in their own words.</li>
<li>Awareness campaign -- The first new television advertisement encouraging caregivers to seek information at the new website was debuted. This media campaign will be launched this summer, reaching family members and patients in need of information on Alzheimer's disease.</li>
</ul><p>Today's announcement demonstrates the Obama administration's continued commitment to taking action in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>In 2013, the National Family Caregiver Support Program will continue to provide essential services to family caregivers, including those helping loved ones with Alzheimer's disease. This program will enable family caregivers to receive essential respite services, providing them a short break from caregiving duties, along with other essential services, such as counseling, education and support groups.</p>
