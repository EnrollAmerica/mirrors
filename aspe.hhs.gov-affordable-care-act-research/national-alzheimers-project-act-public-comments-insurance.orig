<p>Below are my comments for the public record. If you can group this with the earlier files I sent you that would be great. This being first. Thanks</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>Some comments on the earlier topic on CMS.</p>
<p>In reference to the availability of PET Amyloid scans.</p>
<p>I think it is very important to the outcome of people like me to these tools.</p>
<p>For me it took 9 years to get a diagnoses. It was not until I received the PET scan that it confirmed that something was truly wrong. Many insurance companies still do not pay for that test. I cannot begin to tell you how many times I had repeat many of the test hoping for an answer. I even had 3 Neuropsychological tests that cost over $2500.00 each during that time.</p>
<p>Because of this diagnose.</p>
<p>I was able to start my medications.</p>
<p>Start my end of life planning and make plans to live life to the fullest in the short time I had left.</p>
<p>Able to get in Clinical trials</p>
<p>Apply for disability</p>
<p>Able to now focus my effort to being an advocate for the disease which had now given me a new life's purpose.</p>
<p>When I need surgery the doctor was able to avoid anesthetics contraindicated in AD.</p>
<p><strong>The delay in my diagnose led to being fired from my job and losing the very benefits I had contributed to that would have taken care of me for the rest of my life. It would have even simplified it for my caregiver. Now we both suffer. I lost it all and must rely on social security. </strong></p>
<p>I would like to personally thank this advisory council for supporting the Department of Health and Human Services decision to include someone living with dementia on the committee. I believe people around the world will view this as a major step forward for people with dementia. Ideally this should set an example to be followed by all people, businesses and organizations. While we may have a progressive disease we still have a lot to contribute to society if we are just given the chance. It is decisions such as this that will help reduce stigma, and prove to people what we are capable of doing. I speak for myself and many others when I say thank you so much.</p>
<p>As some of you know I have been appointed to the PA State Alzheimer's Planning Committee. I was very excited by the feedback I received after the first meeting on the commitment to make the plan successful before it was even discussed or even created. I wish I could be as excited about the work being accomplished here at NAPA. While there are great ideas coming from all of you, and plans and polices are being created, there is still a distinct lack of funding. Many of you here have the power to influence those who are in a position to increase funding; I encourage you to do more. We are all aware that Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease of the century, more than heart disease and cancer, yet the leaders chose to do nothing, in effect ignoring those of us who are dying in the most horrible way possible. The funding that we have for this disease is even less today than before; we are heading the wrong way. Many people get excited by the comment on proposed budget increases; people like me only get excited on the actual budget changes. Budget proposals are even more disappointing than the failure of clinical trials.</p>
<p>For some time I have worked on putting together a vision of what people with dementia need. I believe many people have an idea of what is required, but I feel the best ideas come from those directly impacted by dementia because those of us who are living with dementia know how we feel, and what we need. My vision has been shared with the PA state, and I have sent a copy to all those on the NAPA Advisory Council. It is my hope that this document becomes shared with all the states and other parts of the world. I would also be more than happy to expand on the reasoning behind what I came up with and why I felt it would be a benefit to not only the people living with this disease but also their family and friends. I hope you take what I have written and use it as a guideline for what is needed and you create a model of best practices for others to use.</p>
<p>Below is a list of issues as I see them from my introduction statement on June 7th that I shared with the PA state committee.</p>
<p>In my opinion awareness is the biggest problem. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show that Alzheimer's is a disease that affects all ages; it is not just associated with getting older. I know of a 30-year-old, and a 29-year-old who have it.</p>
<p>Stigma of the disease must be eradicated.</p>
<p>Companies and communities must treat this like any other disability.</p>
<p>State laws need to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve immediately.</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is.</p>
<p>People should be fast-tracked for social security instead of being treated like crooks while they are getting deeper into hardship.</p>
<p>First responders need educating, and a system needs to be created that will help identify us without becoming a target for others.</p>
<p>We need a way to deal with our guns.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those who are no longer capable, and not to impact those that are still able to drive.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways if we are looking to make it better for those impacted.</p>
<p>Need to encourage dementia-friendly communities and businesses.</p>
<p>We must be able to live life to the fullest even though we have the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Having a diagnosis of dementia does not mean we lose our willingness or motivation to be contributing members of society. We need opportunities to engage in meaningful activities throughout the course of the disease.</p>
<p>We must encourage the research and provide funding.</p>
<p>Trials need to provide more flexibility by using communication technology.</p>
<p>Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia.</p>
<p>Patients should be made aware of the living wills which should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p>I hope you will now look at my vision and give it consideration.</p>
<p>I thank you for your new and improved plan, but we are far from being able to take a bow for any real credit. So much more must be done.</p>
<p><em>I'd like to thank the Alzheimer's Association for making it possible for me to be at NAPA.</em></p>

<p>I hope you are doing well and look forward to seeing you on Friday. At my PA state Alzheimer planning committee today I shared the following documents. I am hoping this could become useful document for the NAPA Advisory Council. I would also hope you have a way to share this with all the states. This is a document that I have worked on for over five months and I have had input from many people and organizations in the dementia arena along with 15 other advocates who are dealing with dementia. If you should have any question please feel free to reach out to me. I would also be interested on your thoughts.</p>

					Dementia-Friendly Vision</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
<p>As a person living with this disease I find it a challenge these days to be able to communicate with the rest of the team. While I appear to be very normal when we have short talks, there are many issues that I struggle with. I have lost the sharpness and quick response needed to be able to interact with you all at your level. It makes it even harder when many of you have very high IQs. With time you will learn that while I may not respond immediately, answers come to me many hours later. Sometimes they never do. When I hear conversations I do not hear the entire sentence but part of it, and in my mind I fill in the blanks. It's weird to know you have many answers in your head, but cannot find a way to retrieve them.</p>
<p>Because of all this, and because we are breaking up into various teams I want to ensure I will have the opportunity to share my visions of what I would like to see. Some of these ideas come from others who have created them before me, and many are my own ideas or a combination of both ideas.</p>
<p>There is no true order and some things may even be duplicated due to my lack of recall. I did have help from others in the editing of this document. Below is my short list of issues as I see them from my introduction statement on June 7th.</p>
<p><strong>Public Awareness, Education, &amp; Engagement </strong></p>
<p>In my opinion awareness is the biggest problem. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show younger people who don't understand that Alzheimer is a disease that affects all ages; it is not just associated with getting older. I know of a 30-year-old and a 29-year-old who have it.</p>
<p>The stigma must be eradicated.</p>
<p>Companies and communities must treat this like any other disability.</p>
<p>State laws needs to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve immediately.</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is.</p>
<p>People should be fast-tracked for social security instead of being treated like crooks while they are getting deeper into hardship.</p>
<p>First responders need educating, and a system needs to be created that will help identify us without becoming a target for others.</p>
<p>We need a way to deal with our guns.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those who are no longer capable, and not to impact those that are still able to drive.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways if we are looking to make it better for those impacted.</p>
<p>Need to encourage dementia-friendly communities and business.</p>
<p>We must be able to live life to the fullest even though we have the diagnosis.</p>
<p>Create work environments in which we can still feel productive without penalty to the employer or the person living with the disease.</p>
<p>We must encourage the researcher and provide funding.</p>
<p>Trials need to provide more flexibility by using communication technology.</p>
<p>Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia.</p>
<p>Patients should be made aware of the living wills which should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Communities </strong></p>
<p>My vision of a dementia-friendly community is a bit involved, but if it's implemented it will have a huge impact in many ways. When I think of a dementia-friendly community it refers mostly to those who are in the early to mid stages of the disease. This idea was first started in the UK by my friend Norm McNamara who is living with Lewy Body Dementia.</p>
<p>This community should include first responders, health providers, local businesses, public transportation providers, airports, and the public.</p>
<p>I think the best way to achieve this is to create a system that allows individuals to register with the state, or someone of equal standing, this should include care partners as well as it's important to have emergency info on the caregiver. I would like to see something similar to MedicAlert at a state level.</p>
<p>What follows is a brief outline of the MedicAlert system.</p>
<p><strong>MedicAlert® + Alzheimer's Association Safe Return</strong>® is a 24-hour nationwide emergency response service for individuals with Alzheimer's or a related dementia who wander or have a medical emergency. We provide 24-hour assistance, no matter when or where the person is reported missing.</p>
<ul><li>If an individual with Alzheimer's or a related dementia wanders and becomes lost, caregivers can call the 24-hour emergency response line (1.800.625.3780) to report it.</li>
<li>A community support network will be activated, including local Alzheimer Association chapters and law enforcement agencies. With this service, critical medical information will be provided to emergency responders when needed.</li>
<li>If a citizen or emergency personnel finds the person with dementia, they can call the toll-free number listed on person's MedicAlert + Safe Return ID jewelry. MedicAlert + Safe Return will notify the listed contacts, making sure the person is returned home.</li>
</ul><p>Six in 10 people with dementia will wander and/or get lost. A person with Alzheimer's may not remember their name or address, and can become disoriented, even in familiar places. For people with dementia wandering is dangerous, but there are strategies and services to help prevent it.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association has developed training tools and support programs to prepare law enforcement, EMTs, fire fighters and other first responders when they encounter a person who is wandering.</p>
<p>Anyone who has memory problems and is able to walk is at risk for wandering. Even in the early stages of dementia, a person can become disoriented or confused for a period of time. It's important to plan ahead for this type of situation. Wandering and getting lost can happen during any stage of the disease.</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for the following warning signs:</p>
<ul><li>Returns from a regular walk or drive later than usual</li>
<li>Tries to fulfill former obligations, such as going to work</li>
<li>Tries or wants to "go home", even when at home</li>
<li>Is restless, paces or makes repetitive movements</li>
<li>Has difficulty locating familiar places like the bathroom, bedroom or dining room</li>
<li>Asks the whereabouts of current or past friends and family</li>
<li>Acts as if doing a hobby or chore, but nothing gets done (e.g. moves around pots and dirt without actually planting anything)</li>
<li>Appears lost in a new or changed environment</li>
</ul><p>The information on your medical alert bracelet will connect health professionals with your emergency medical information. We provide memberships and services designed to protect you and your loved ones during a medical emergency or time of need.</p>
<p>MedicAlert's medical bracelets, medical IDs, and other medical jewelry have been used to alert responders of the underlying medical conditions a patient may have - such as allergies, anaphylaxes, diabetes, and autism. First responders are trained by MedicAlert staff to recognize all forms of medical IDs, and our services ensure they get your up-to-date medical information, the moment they need it, to make informed decisions about your treatment and care. MedicAlert services and medical IDs are also used to communicate advance directives and can even help those with Alzheimer's or dementia make it home safely during wandering emergencies.</p>
<p>For more information please visit their website: <a href="http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-safety.asp">http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-safety.asp</a></p>
<p>Those who choose to register would wear a bracelet similar to the one above or some type of dog tag on a chain. By registering the people would be able to take advantage of many benefits. Family would need to register and could be set up when in the clinic for diagnosis as well as info bracelet... ordered and resources given out.</p>
<p>All those registered would be given a unique identification number that will have basic information that could be used in case of emergency. To stop the system being abused or compromised, this information should only be accessible by the relevant people, following a secure procedure and calling a special telephone number and providing the person's ID number. (This would only be accessed by calling a provided number)</p>
<p>It may include information like blood type, allergies, drug information, doctors, emergency contacts, and addresses.</p>
<p>This system needs to be linked with the 911 systems, and the yellow dot program. When a person calls the fire department the address should be flagged immediately when it comes up as a person with dementia living in the residence they are being dispatched to. This is important for many reasons.</p>
<p>A person with dementia may panic in this situation and may not know how to respond to the emergency conditions. They may be much worse than a child in some cases, and just curl up in a corner in fear and just stay there. They may not even speak out when people are calling their name. They may have even started the fire and are scared. They could be combative and the firefighters need to know how to deal with that situation. There are many other reasons why the firemen need to be aware before arriving.</p>
<p>If we ever have some kind of a natural disaster or need to evacuate for some emergency this system will be a major asset, especially for those who may be at home on their own. By being registered this will insure a much better outcome for those who may not be able to think for themselves. Many of these people would not leave with just a simple call and they may not even understand what is said in robo-call type alerts.</p>
<p>If the police are called that should also be flagged immediately. It could be the person with dementia calling in, and not able to articulate the problem. It could even be a false alarm because they are scared when there is really no threat. Sometimes people with dementia have been known to make serious accusations of being threatened by their spouse with a gun, which has led to spouses being locked up for days because the system was not aware of the person's dementia. Again, if members of the emergency services are coming to a house where a person with dementia resides, they need to treat threats in a completely different way otherwise it can escalate and even become deadly.</p>
<p><strong>Issues with Police: Weapons &amp; Driving </strong></p>
<p>While I am on the subject of issues with police there is a document which I shared with the chief of police a few years ago. While some changes are being implemented in some parts of the US, I am not sure they are being addressed in PA. I tried to reach out to my local police department and training facilities, but was just blown off. One of the biggest and most serious issues that I feel needs to be addresses is that of weapons. I came very close to taking my life, and even told a police officer on the telephone, but he refused to do anything. I just wonder how many other people pleaded for help and ended up killing themselves because nobody answered their cry for help. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Sometimes people with dementia get confused or feel threatened and may make accusations that could land someone else in jail. Be prepared to deal with cases like this. They need to be handled very differently from someone without dementia. Some would say like a mental illness. They believe what they are saying is fact.</p>
<p>We require a place to store or remove guns from a home when needed - I came up with a simple way that this could be accomplished without too much impact on the police. A gun safety device can be used to secure the guns in the person's home, and the key can be given to someone responsible. There were other suggestions made.</p>
<p>If someone with Alzheimer's is stopped for a sobriety test they may fail because they have trouble following instructions or poor gait. They may also be much slower with their responses, and may even give you a blind stare because they are confused. They may not be able to follow complex directions. Directions need to be broken down into steps.</p>
<p>I know we want to make the roads safe so we need better testing methods for Alzheimer's patients who drive.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's patients can sometimes become very aggressive and defensive during an argument, they can even become threatening. This is the wrong time to try to remove them from their home. They need to be calmed down first; otherwise it can become a disaster for that person, because many will not understand what is going on.</p>
<p>Be prepared to deal with people who may seek help when they are lost. We can get lost while driving; this does not mean we cannot drive. These two issues are often confused by many.</p>
<p>The car should also have some sort of identification mark. It could be tied-in with the yellow dot system; however, I am concerned that we may become a target because of that. We are much more gullible because of this disease and that could be a very serious issue. I was someone who always kept all those scammers at a far distance, and now I am starting to fall prey to some and think it will only get worse as time goes on and I get worse. It could be on a driver's license, like a donor or class B license. It could be a code that is not obvious to all.</p>
<p><strong>Universal Symbol: The Purple Angel </strong></p>
<p>There is a common logo that is slowly becoming the internationally known symbol for those living with dementia and I think we should use it. It is called the Purple Angel.</p>
<p><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-site-pages/163251/PurpleAngel.jpg" style="height:25px; width:27px" />To be used on all websites and dementia patients information and hospitals</p>
<p><img src="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/images-site-pages/163251/PurpleAngelStamp.jpg" style="height:28px; width:30px" />For stores and businesses to show they know and have been educated</p>
<p>This was created by Norm McNamara and is starting to get a lot of recognition. In fact it is now going to be used in some US hospitals as an indicator that the person has cognitive issues; they hang it on the door of the hospital room of the patient. I recommend that we adopt this symbol for all programs connected to dementia-friendly communities.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Hospitals </strong></p>
<p>While I am speaking about hospitals, below is a list of issues that I have been working on with a local hospital in hopes of starting the first dementia-friendly hospital in PA. I was trying to build a training program with the Alzheimer's Association along with a question and answer session with people like me who are living with the disease. Below is the list I have shared with them. Some hospitals are actually doing a quick cognitive test by asking 3 words upon registering to see if there may be a concern even if the person does not have a diagnosis. I would expect that all hospitals would educate staff on the issues, for instance we can easily get lost while trying to find a department as an outpatient.</p>
<p>At registration, identify a person that can and will be able to be involved in all decision-making, along with the patient.</p>
<p>At registration, identify a person that will be given full access to all records on behalf of the patient.</p>
<p>Patients bring in a list of current medications. If for some reason you must change the drug or dosage for any reason, the issue should be addressed with the patient and caregiver to ensure there are no issues (even if it's as simple as converting to a generic). Sometimes patients cannot take another form of the same drug-ask them.</p>
<ul><li>Example: My doctor switched me to Galantamine rather than Aricept because of side effects. In the hospital, they substituted Aricept. (My wife had Galantamine with her, but of course it is a big deal that you should not take your own meds.)</li>
</ul><p>A special ID bracelet should be placed on this type of individual so the staff is alerted that this patient has some form of dementia. This will help them if the patient is acting confused or wandering or just needs a little extra help or explanation. It may also mean that the patient isn't great at making good decisions. If you need a color, purple is perfect.</p>
<ul><li>Example: I needed a Fleet's enema pre-op. The nurse asked if she should give it to me or if I wanted to use it myself in the bathroom. Of course, I offered to do it myself. I found I had difficulty once I got in the bathroom by myself; a bad decision on my part. The nurse should have not given me the option. (We do not want to appear stupid or show our flaws so we may do something to show we are still capable when we may not be.)</li>
</ul><p>I know they always ask the patient for their full name and birthdate - that may be hard at times for us. I can become confused on a good day, in the hospital it can be worse because of pain medication or being awakened suddenly or the stress of just being out of our routine. Maybe another way can be figured out. (Before a name tag is placed on a dementia patient it may require 3 or 4 staff individuals to ask the patient for that information and each must identify the same information before the ID is placed. This will insure the wrong tag is not placed on the patient. Use the verbal ask on critical things like surgery and drugs given the first time the nurse may see the patient)</p>
<p>There are special things one needs to know about using Anesthesia. Anesthetic agents are a cause for concern in AD pathogenesis. Luckily, the field of Anesthesiology has addressed these concerns in an excellent and honest manner. I would defer to their consensus statement:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/108/5/1627.full">http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/content/108/5/1627.full</a><br /><a href="http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/">http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/</a></p>
<p>The bottom line seems to be to avoid isoflorane.</p>
<p>Do not always consider a patient being confused as a part of the dementia, but it could be much worse due to the drugs they are on. When I was on pain killers my wife could not even get a response from me that made much sense, and she knows what's normal for me.</p>
<p>A real concern exists on what type of drugs the patient may receive for Anesthesia. Pain killers will also have a much greater impact on this type of person.</p>
<p>While ordering food from a menu is simple, it is very overwhelming for me to keep track of things and what items may even go together, or are even needed. I will probably need help with this task.</p>
<p>Don't assume we can figure out how to use items in the room like TV, Phone, call button, and anything else. Please point them out and provide a simple explanation on their use.</p>
<p>Aides should not be the first point of contact. I am not always good at explaining what I need and the aide was not always good at interpreting what I was trying to say. Aides are okay for follow-up or to help with food menus. Again this is why training on all levels is so critical.</p>
<p>When asking a question, give them a minute or two to answer without going on to some other question. You could even ask them to think about it and come back in 5-10 minutes, no longer. This is very subjective depending on the person. We often need a few minutes to gather our thoughts. We might even answer a question right away and then realize a few minutes later that that wasn't what you asked.</p>
<p>Somehow you need to insure the patient response is really correctly given - they sometimes give an answer just to not appear stupid or show they did not understand. Maybe some visual aid or clues can be given along with the verbal depending on the stage the patient is in.</p>
<p>Try to keep items and things in the room in the same place once they determine the best location for them.</p>
<p>I personally feel these patients should be kept a bit longer than the average person, for observation. This would just be to make certain there are no issues at time of release.</p>
<p>Offer a pen and paper to keep in the room. Tell them to write down questions they want to remember to ask when the nurse comes in the room.</p>
<p>Keep in mind many patients with dementia can no longer spell correctly and may use the wrong context for words.</p>
<p>This is the wristband that will be implemented to all patients with dementia at Brooksville Regional Hospital, along with this square magnet to be place on the outside of the patient's room on the doorframe. Before any of these wristbands will be used, training seminars from the Alzheimer's Association will held for all of the hospital staff members. Training should start in about a month. This is a major step forward in maintaining the safety of all dementia patients during hospital stays.</p>
<p>The hospital loves the purple angel logo, We went through three different band designs before this. The problem being that purple is also the national color for DNR. What I love about it the most is that it's for "all dementias," which is what we truly need in the hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>Dementia-Friendly Businesses </strong></p>
<p>Moving on to dementia-friendly businesses; I envision that businesses take a 7 or 8 hour course provided for free by the Alzheimer's Association and others, to make them aware of the issues that people with dementia deal with, and what they may need help with. On completion of the course they will get a sticker that they can place in their place of business that says Dementia-Aware with a picture of the logo. By doing this we will be creating awareness, and educating many on how to make it easier for us to still function as members of society; something that is not always easy when you are an adult who is slowly becoming a child again.</p>
<p>Some of the issues may be</p>
<ul><li>feeling panic in a large store when becoming separated from the person they came with</li>
<li>being asked a question and not being able to respond, or even giving the wrong information</li>
<li>having trouble locating items in stores</li>
<li>no longer being able to calculate how much they have spent or can spend if they have a budget</li>
<li>getting lost, losing sense of direction, or not being able to locate the car in the parking lot</li>
<li>it would be nice to get assistance when there are similar products to choose from, because I can no longer do comparison shopping based on price, or if an item in the same category is on sale</li>
</ul><p>Not everyone will easily display, or even be willing to wear the bracelet or dog tag because of the stigma surrounding this disease. Only when this changes will people feel more comfortable about sharing their diagnosis with others.</p>
<p>Even though we are living with AD we should be encouraged to live life to the fullest. We need to keep our minds engaged. We should be able to work, and to still do high level functioning jobs, and the company not be penalized, and the person with the disease should not be impacted by SS because they are working. As volunteers I would expect that our transportation expenses be paid for, and maybe even lunch. This will have a positive impact on the people with the disease and be of great benefit to a company that can utilize the person. Some do not want jobs like pushing hospital beds around, or doing simple tasks when we have a high function skill set.</p>
<p>The state can help AD people to live life to the fullest in many ways. For those that are still driving they should be given a disabled sign for their car. It helps me in many ways such as finding my car when I park in a strange place or large lots. For those that are not driving, allow us the same opportunity as seniors. This will help us get around much easier. For suburban areas allow us access to the transportation for the disabled at the discounted rates.</p>
<p>The state can offer free access to national parks, fishing and boating for a small size water craft for the person living with the disease and a caregiver since in many cases they will need someone to take them. All of this can be centered on having the bracelet which will simplify the process and minimize any costs.</p>
<p>Keep in mind you need to make it simple for these people because they will most likely not be able to fill out many of the forms needed to qualify. I am sure there are many other things that can be made available.</p>
<p>Writing skills can be impacted hindering communicating. An idea would be to forward our unedited letters to schools to be used as a part of the English classes; the students would edit the letter and send it back so we can send it. It would also be great if we could take college courses for free with the idea that we are not getting a degree or credits.</p>
<p>When it comes to purchasing tickets for travelling on trains etc. staff need to be aware that we may need help. We may not be able to check in at the airport unaided. We should not be penalized for not being able to take advantage of online offers because we cannot use computers. We may need to be taken to a gate or to a temporary room until our flight or train is ready (this does not mean we need to be ferried about in a wheelchair!)</p>

</ul><p>I would like to see a simple pamphlet be put together for those who are living with the disease covering all the benefits available to us with AD. It must be simple to understand, short and to the point. The procedure should include all of the resources available and where one should turn. Today one has no clue and they do not know what is available. This should be handed out with a diagnosis from your doctor.</p>
<p>Laws need to change so those who are getting fired can collect the benefits they deserve. Let's stop burdening the social security system. Because there is no clear test for the diagnosis of YOAD, many diagnoses are delayed. Many people are terminated from jobs, and are unable to collect their long-term disability insurance, because of the two-year law. Most diagnoses occur much later, as in my case. I paid a lot of money into a long-term health disability plan in my company and I lost it all because of the law. I now get less than a third of what I would have been entitled to, and no medical coverage which I would also have had, all because of a law that does not work for individuals with this disease. Changes must be put in place until we have better tests available. If someone is terminated for non-performance and they have been diagnosed with dementia at a later time, they should have the right to go back at least six years to prove their case. Companies should not get a free pass because we all pay for this injustice. The two year law is a failure for people like me with dementia.</p>
<p>I was terminated from my job before I got a diagnosis which took another 6 years. Now I am forced to rely on government disability. Alzheimer's is a sickness. This is a disease, and the people who have it should be treated that way.</p>
<p>Companies need to treat AD like any other disability. The following comments were put together from a person who works in HR.</p>
<p>Tell your story to HR Management. What kind of company do they want to be? How will they protect their human resource that has dementia - and be good risk managers by taking appropriate action to minimize the risk of litigation for wrongful termination under ADA? What are the costs of unrecognized dementia in employees i.e., lost productivity, errors, quality, odd/unexplained behavior, a decline in management skills leading to more of the above? What are the State percentages? Give examples - If they are a company of 1,000 employees that equates to xx employees who will have early onset dementia - can they afford to be blind to the problems these individuals will cost the organization? Alzheimer's is not all about the needs of the caregiver. Little to no attention is given to the INDIVIDUAL WITH DEMENTIA. If the company has a PEP program (Personal Employee Program that typically provides 8 to 12 sessions of counseling when an employee suffers from personal problems (divorce, runaway kids, elderly care, etc.) why not have a Dementia Hotline/Exploration. Why not help people self-diagnose early and assist them to seek a medical diagnosis, so TOGETHER the employee and company can make a plan for them to ultimately exit from the company with dignity - example: an employee is still skilled, but may need to move from having the responsibility of being a manager to becoming an individual contributor. Why wait to FIRE someone for non-performance, when you could continue to employ the person until the day comes where there is no job which matches the employee's skills. A diagnosis of dementia IS protected under ADA. Why wait to be sued by an employee who was unfairly terminated because of his disability. Why not be proactive and humane, keep the person off unemployment; mitigate your exposure to litigation. Such a small cost to set up a program to assist and empower employees to work TOGETHER with them, give them dignity and determine together when it is time to go. Help them transition to retirement with disability; unemployment; assistance from the Alz Association.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Issues &amp; Necessary System Change </strong></p>
<p>Younger-onset Alzheimer's, also known as early-onset Alzheimer's, generally refers to those who are affected by the disease before the age of 65, usually in their 40s or 50s. Because of their younger age and healthy appearance, doctors often attribute symptoms of Alzheimer's to depression or stress, resulting in delayed diagnosis. These symptoms, such as challenges with short-term memory, impaired judgment and difficulty making decisions, eventually progress to a point where they affect workplace performance, and ultimately, jeopardize employment. Many individuals living with younger-onset Alzheimer's are in their prime earning years and supporting loved ones at home. The loss of income and access to employer-sponsored health benefits can be devastating.</p>
<p>This document reflects State and Federal issues that may not be working. My goal is that if the existing jurisdiction responsible is not able to enhance the process, the other will step in and fill in the gaps so people are not impacted. It is my hope that they can work together to fix the weaknesses in the system that may have been overlooked.</p>
<p>To help address their financial need, many individuals with younger-onset Alzheimer's rely on Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). In March 2010, the Social Security Administration (SSA) added early-onset Alzheimer's to its Compassionate Allowance Initiative, which expedites the disability determination process and serves as a trigger to begin the two-year wait for Medicare benefits for those under the age of 65. Family members (e.g. spouses and minor children) may also be eligible for benefits based on the applicant's work record. This addition by SSA has been a huge relief for individuals and families dealing with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Many are treated like they are crooks when they apply for Social Security Disability. It creates an added burden on the family and the patient. People say that the Compassionate Allowance act will help people, but it did not help me, and many keep saying that it works. The following story is from an ongoing case. This program may be better but the people who run the programs are clueless in many ways on what a person with AD can or cannot do. This person is not only struggling financially, but has no one to look out for them. I cannot even imagine the hell they must be going through because it would take me forever to complete the same forms.</p>
<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>It's so nice of you to think of me. I wanted to add that the reason I was turned down on the first application and reconsideration was because I filled out the RFC form myself (I lived alone at the time and it was a necessity) and not for lack of medical evidence. My son now lives with me but only minimally supervises me and does the driving. An examiner at Social Security took it upon himself to send out an investigative unit because he felt I must be faking Alz even though in the course of the application and reconsideration, I saw 5 doctors, 4 of whom thought I had Alz disease and 1 CE examiner who thought it was possible but hesitated because I still have average intelligence (my IQ was in the 140s when I was in graduate school and now around 100, which I think this is an alarming decline). This SAA evaluator then proceeded to imply that all the doctors I saw were fooled. He even sent out an investigative unit to actually <strong>videotape me without my knowledge</strong> (following me to one my CE appointment one day and sending undercover police officers to my home the following day). I don't remember the investigators coming to my home and didn't see them at the hospital (obviously quite good at the stealth part). At the hospital, the doctor walked me out to the lobby because he was afraid I would get lost said a few minutes later I "disappeared (I got my ride, of course)." They went back to the doctor looking for me, and he apparently was very concerned I had actually gotten lost in the hospital. At my house, they said I walked slow to answer the door but I didn't limp (???) and was polite and had my hair combed (implying I was not disabled based on my outward appearance and probably less than 30 seconds of conversation). The evaluator felt that anyone who could describe their symptoms on an application, write mostly coherently, (though always needing multiple edits, spell check, and entailing a lot of repetitiveness) answer the door, use a phone, live alone, or drive in the early stages had to be faking it regardless of MRI, neurological tests, etc., that clearly gave me a diagnosis of EOAD. Long-winded, I'm sorry. I'm still feeling kind of abused and outraged. As for now, my lawyer thinks he can get me a hearing OTR and I'm hoping for that and a favorable decision If not, it will be another 12-15 months before I have a hearing date, this because the SSA evaluator apparently does not understand that early-stage Alzheimer's is not immediately visible on the surface. In the meantime, I am now in the process of selling my home to live with my adult son as we can no longer afford the upkeep (this is a modest home - but now far above my means).</p>
<p>I'm very lucky that my son is living with me to help, but it means I do not qualify for Medicaid because his income is now considered my income and puts us just above the income limit. He can't put me on his insurance as I don't qualify as a dependent because of my small LTD policy, which in turn needs to be repaid to the insurance company if I do get SSDI. I've gone from a single, self-supporting middle class woman, to lower middle class, now to poverty level in the course of about 4 years. Without my son's help, I'm probably within 3 months of living on the street. At the same time, I'm suddenly placing a tremendous burden on him and fouling up his goals in life.</p>
<p>Another note: I find it ironic that my neurologist tells me to exercise vigorously, take care of my health, and socialize as much as possible in order to function longer whereas I sense the government is telling me that I'm not eligible for disability insurance (despite working since age 13 and paying into the system for years) unless I give up, lie in bed, and wait to die.</p>
<p>It would be great if the Alz Assoc could find a way to educate the SSA evaluators on what Alzheimer's disease looks like in younger people in the early stages so that other people don't go through what I'm going through now. It would also be great if they could lobby for earlier Medicare benefits (rather than the 2 year wait after SSDI) for all disabilities that are only going to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Awareness is the biggest problem.</p>
<p>Awareness of YOAD will change the public perception of who gets Alzheimer's - young people. People who are under 30 get it. Use commercials, billboards or posters in key places to get the word out. The face behind the disease must change if we are going to get the public engaged. We must show younger people because most don't understand that Alzheimer is a disease not just a result of aging.</p>
<p>Awareness of outcomes for AD -- Currently people who have Alzheimer's cannot be cured. There is no way to slow the progression of the disease, and most die within 4 to 8 years of diagnosis. While these two statements are strong I feel this is what it's going to take to reach younger generations and others to jump in and help. We cannot beat around the bush; the public needs to know that this is a horrific way to die. Death by Alzheimer's is slow and painful not to mention the impact it has on the family. Places like the Alzheimer's Association and others need to open with all the facts about the disease so people are prepared.</p>
<p>Remove the negative stigma associated with the disease. Too many people are ashamed to let others know that they have this disease. They act like they did something wrong to get it. Now is the time to join me, come out of the closet, hold your head up and be proud in making a difference in how we are looked upon by ourselves, and others. WE need to show that we are still capable of doing some things at our own pace.</p>
<p>Driving laws need to change to remove the licenses of those that are no longer capable, while not impacting those that are still able to drive. It should be based on the person's true driving experience and ability, and not on perceptions or fears. It should have nothing to do with getting lost; GPS tracking devices can help us if that is a concern. Many people have the misconception that if a person with AD is in an accident the insurance company will not pay for the claim, or may even sue them. While there are many tests available to test one's driving, many are not fair to a person living with AD. In fact if the average person was given the same test they may even fail. Better tests that deal the individual living with the disease are needed and all must be able to test this test. Some of the cognitive tests do not correlate to driving ability, but to failing and singling out people with AD. That is completely unfair. For example I fail the Trail-Making Test, Part B and I still drive very good. The testing should be free or paid by insurance. These tests can cost around $300 -$350, and provide annually. Every 2-3 months we should drive with a spouse or other person who understands us to see how well we drive. That should be a regular part of our future lives, and they should be the ones to tell us when they feel it is time to give up driving. I am not saying that people with AD should not eventually stop driving, but it should be done for the right reasons -- that they will become a danger to them or someone else. What we need to focus on are the real problems of driving, and not the side issues related to them. We must embrace new ways to deal with people with AD and find new opportunities and technologies to use to our advantage so we can enhance the lives of those suffering with this disease, and so they can continue to lead a normal life for as long as possible. Do not fall into the one-size-fits-all trap because all those living with AD are different from each other and we must figure out a way to make everyone feel safe including those living with the disease. We are still human beings.</p>
<p>My biggest fear is that one day I will have an accident and my license will be taken away. It may not have anything to do with my Alzheimer's, but it will be perceived that way. I have had 3 to 4 car accidents in my lifetime, some being my fault while most were others. We all have them. As a person living with AD I seem to notice much more. I see many people run through lights, not use turn signals or come to a complete stop at the stop sign. I see people cut others off or shift in to other's lanes without paying attention. All I can think is that if people saw me do any of these things they would want to take my driver's license away, yet all of these folks are normal and they just get a free pass. Why?</p>
<p>Once we have a diagnosis, we should all be entitled to the same level of benefits no matter what our age is. One should not be impacted by other laws that were not designed or intended for those living with this type of disease. There are many state and federal programs that limit us from being able to contribute to or benefits we are not entitled to because of our age. Family savings should not be wiped out just because one has dementia. A family should have a cap on what they must payout. Why should the surviving spouse be left penniless because their partner was sick? Is it enough that most of us have already had to deal with financial hardship we were not accustom to?</p>
<p>Pa. Caregiver Support Program (care recipient/household income must be @ 200% of poverty or below for max. reimbursement.</p>
<p>Below are just of a few of the ways this disease is costing me more money than ever. I once did most things around the house and now I have to rely on others and the cost is adding up very quickly. Many things are becoming neglected which will have a greater cost in the long run. I used to be good at comparison shopping and now I no longer do it because I cannot recall the price so I can compare. This has such a huge impact from food, gas, utilities and everyday items.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), individuals with a pre-existing condition receiving SSDI can join high-risk insurance pools3 and receive immediate health insurance coverage while they wait for Medicare benefits to become available. This has been particularly helpful for those who are unable to find affordable health insurance because of their Alzheimer's diagnosis. The program will end in 2014, at which time individuals can purchase health insurance through their state-based insurance exchange or qualify for Medicaid under its expanded criteria. Pennsylvania has yet to decide whether or not it wants to participate in the Medicaid expansion, which according to one estimate, will cost the state 1.4 percent more than current spend to reduce the number of uninsured adults by over 40%.</p>
<p>In addition to the cost of care, Alzheimer's imposes an immense burden on families. Last year, there were an estimated 664,384 unpaid caregivers in Pennsylvania, providing 756,600,213 hours of unpaid care valued at over $9 billion. Unfortunately, the physical toll of caring for Alzheimer's also resulted in over $427 million in additional healthcare costs to unpaid caregivers in your state. To assist those who care for people with Alzheimer's in Pennsylvania, the state offers the Pennsylvania Caregiver Support Program. Preference is given to caregivers of care recipients who are 60 years or older, but eligibility was recently expanded to include care recipients who are 18 years or older. All care recipients must demonstrate functional limitation and financial need.</p>
<p>Regrettably, age is still a barrier to other support programs for individuals with younger-onset Alzheimer's and their caregivers. All caregiver support programs that receive funding under Title III of the Older Americans Act require care recipients to be at least 60 years or older. Likewise, Pennsylvania's Medicaid 60+ waiver and aging block grants are only available to those who are at least 60 years old. Restricting eligibility by age, rather than diagnosis, forces many families affected by younger-onset Alzheimer's to exhaust their own resources and put their own health and financial security at risk.</p>
<p>Health providers and institutions must change in many ways to make it better for those impacted. Physician education -- Doctors need to be better educated, and need to commit to a more timely diagnosis so that patients can collect the benefits they deserve and are entitled. Doctors should not act like our lives are over. Once a diagnosis is made it should automatically trigger a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist so the person can learn to deal with the devastating news. Many people are in denial and waste that last few years not knowing what to do. Instead they should be living life to the fullest. Make the memories. We must be encouraged to make living wills and put our financials in order quickly since our minds are going. We have no time to delay. Encourage participation in medical trails and offer frequent checkups.</p>
<p>Living wills should be very different for those with AD. While this is a taboo subject we should have the right to end our life in a dignified way. We must talk about these issues.</p>
<p>We must encourage research and provide funding. In order to eradicate this disease we need to find more sources of funding and redistribute current government funding to bring Alzheimer's to a level comparable to other disease research. Trials need to provide more flexibility by using technology. Many are unable to participate due to lack of flexibility. Some people do not participate in clinical trials because they feel it will not help them. They need to know that it's not about them but what they do can help someone in their family should they get the disease. Since a cure may be long in coming, it would also be nice to see more funding provided to investigate treatment methods to maintain independent function longer. The drug companies have taken the stage and it's all about what increases their profit and not necessarily about what will help the patients.</p>
<p>Make government grant programs free, fair and balanced - Some researchers using government research grants are discriminating by age and minorities because of rules being set forth by both the provider and the receiving researcher. This will prevent the formation of an accurate picture of this disease. For example, black people are twice as likely to get Alzheimer's. Why?</p>
<p>Eliminate the term Caregiver - Come up with a new term for the word caregiver when used for people in the following stages Very mild decline (2), Mild decline (3) and Moderate decline(4). We find it very demeaning and do not like being treated like a child. Help us where we are weak, but don't give up on us just because we have now been labeled with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>We need away a way to break down many of the silos and built a coalition of companies and sites to work as one. Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD) is a diverse and growing national coalition of 58 member organizations including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The only sad part is the Alzheimer's National has not joined due to not being able to set politics aside.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/">http://www.leadcoalition.org/</a></p>
<p>This is all part of the problem - a lack of willingness to work together. I am not sure what the state can do here but we need to find a way to encourage others to work in harmony for the greater good of what we all seem to claim. We are doing this for dementia. Sometimes I really wonder and I think it just a business for these folks.</p>
<p>I know I have made many recommendations around the use of the Alzheimer Association as part of this document. Because of that I want to give full disclosure. I was a past ESAG member and I am currently still an ambassador for them. For those who know me they would tell you I am not influenced by others and my dedication is to those impacted by the disease. With that being said I do feel they deserve a lot of credit for what they have accomplished in the last 30 or more years. They take a lot of heat for some issue that are out of their control due to some high level expectation of the public.</p>
<p>On the other hand I do not want you to think that they have all the answers because I and many others realize that they do not do justice for many like me who are dealing with the disease. They focus on the caregiver and not us. Part of the problem in my eyes is the lack of a business mind across the board, and lack of a CEO approach to business. Because of that scenario there is much inconsistency in the organization and much time is lost in understanding our needs and minds. That all leads to very slow response or lack of response to the very services they think are great. They have this internal mindset that everything has to be done a specific way and that is always the right way, yet the people are not given the tools. The sad truth- it is not and I have worked on changing some of that and I can assure you it's not an easy task. I encourage that we continue to work with them but at the same time we need to demand change and at a much faster pace.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I am sharing this with you in hope that, as you do your planning, you take my findings in to account when making recommendations to others. We must treat all people who are suffering from dementia, regardless of stage, with the highest level of respect all the way through to the end. While this may not apply to all, it would appear that many who are even in stage seven are still able to communicate in some way.</p>
<p><strong>Living Life with Alzheimer's disease </strong></p>
<p>Below are some articles I have written in the past, you may learn how someone with AD is dealing with this disease. These are my favorite that I feel people have been able to learn and see another side that they did not know before.</p>
<p>I have worked on this for about five months, and recently I shared the email below with many sites related to AD for feedback. Most of those who had reached out to me were able to support my findings. The bottom line is that while most of us have limited thinking capacity many are able to communicate; we just have to find a way that suits the individual. I received a lot of feedback. My biggest concern is that most people are clueless, and assume that we cannot understand what they are saying about us; many say cruel things. Just try to imagine for a minute what it would be like to hear what others may say or do to you, and you are never given an opportunity to defend or express yourself. That is what is happening to most of these folks.</p>
<p>We must find a better way to educate caregivers, health professionals, and all those working with people living with this disease. The biggest problem I see is that everything is time-based because of the costs. This view will not work for people. It will also take special training, and the need to break with our normal habits of communicating. If we are going to be able to reach out to them, we need to change. We are still human beings and we deserve to be treated in a respectful and dignified manner.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen and I have been living with AD much longer than most people who have had this devastating disease. I am in need of your help to prove a point. Let me explain.</p>
<p>I have learned that as we progress with Alzheimer's/dementia, we lose our brain functioning and can no longer think. I am starting to believe that this is not true.</p>
<p>It has now happened to me on multiple occasions where I was asked a question, and I am able to formulate the answer in my mind, yet I found myself unable to verbalize it. Sometimes my mouth may move but nothing comes out. It was the weirdest thing, and I could not understand why it was happening to me. I was aware of what was going on, but could do nothing.</p>
<p>Since that time I have asked 18 other people with some type of dementia, and of them 16 had similar experiences. Two of them said they had not. This makes me think that as this disease progresses our brain may still be functioning, yet it is unable to communicate with the rest of the body, allowing it to have less control than it would normally have. I truly believe I am on to something, and was curious as to how I can try to prove this theory.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example. About three years ago I met the daughter of a man with AD. He was no longer communicating with her because, she was sure, he could no longer commutate at all. Someone suggested she ask a question, and keep totally silent for at least two minutes after. About a minute and a half later he finally responded to her question. From that time on she realized what she had to do and was thankful for that advice.</p>
<p>I don't want you to think it's going to be that easy; it will take a lot of work, patience and persistence on your part. Here is what I would like others to try for someone who is in the late stages of Alzheimer's. First of all take the person to a very quiet room; it should not have any kind of background noise even from things like an air-conditioner blowing. Those noises are real problems for me, and would assume it will be a bigger issue for them. Such noises really have an impact on my ability to process and focus. You should also do this at a time of day that they are not tired. It becomes very challenging for us to try to focus and listen to what others say. It really becomes tiring, and we get burned out quickly.</p>
<p>When you start to speak to the person use short sentences, and pause in between them so they have time to process what you are saying. That is very important. Tell them that you think you have found a way to communicate with them. Tell them you are going to look at them closely for some sort of sign. It could be an eye movement, maybe looking to the right or left or down or up. It could be a smile. It could be a finger moving or a fist being made. It may even be them sticking their tongue out. I would start by focusing on parts of the body that may still show signs of control. You must become a detective and keep looking at various body parts for some sign. It may not happen the first time or even a second time. It may never happen and I could be wrong. But if I am right just think of the benefits that will come out of this for you and your love one.</p>
<p>Reassure them that you will continue to look for a signal and they should keep trying the best they can at their speed. Ask them a simple question like "do you love me? If yes lift your finger or lower your finger". Again you will need to keep quiet, and observe for at least two minutes. Keep doing this and try this with different parts of the body. They may not have control over certain parts, and that may be an issue. If you do see something make sure you point that out to them and ask them to do it again to insure they really are responding. If this turns out to work find a way to use that same body part to get yes or no responses from the person. Keep in mind that this may not always work and you may need to be creative. Maybe just keep the finger raised longer if they mean no, or tap it twice etc., but that may be too much to ask.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind if the person has not had any real dialog with someone for a long time this would also take more time. No matter what do not become discouraged, try this at least three different times on different days. Like I said this may never work and I have it wrong.</p>
<p>If this does work please reply to this site with your contact information so I can speak to you. If this works for a few it makes me believe that we need to treat these folks completely different to the way society treats them today. This will change so much about what people really believe is happening to our minds.</p>

<p><strong>"The Realities of Alzheimer's and Overcoming Stigma"</strong></p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect more than 35 million people worldwide today. An astonishing fact that today someone in the world develops dementia every 4 seconds. By the middle of the century more than 115 million people will be affected by the disease if we do nothing.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen, and I am living with Alzheimer's and trying to make a difference. I was previously a high-level manager in the telecommunication industry. In 2008, I was diagnosed with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease (YOAD) after struggling to get a diagnosis since my first symptoms at age 39. Losing my job and not being able to work had a huge impact on my life as I was a workaholic. I am now an Alzheimer's advocate and a spokesperson for the Alzheimer's Association (U.S.) as a member of its national 2012 Early-Stage Advisory Group.</p>
<p>I am so frustrated, because no one realizes how seriously disabled I am. If I had a loss of limb or some other visual ailment, it would make people realize. I don't want them to feel sorry for me or pity me, just want to be understood. So many people say you do not seem to have Alzheimer's, and that frustrates me. Let me tell you what it's like to live with this debilitating and progressive disease.</p>
<p>Imagine for one minute that your friend, relative or family member has Alzheimer's and has to deal with the following issues. When I go shopping and look at items, most of them never really register in my mind, even though I see it clearly. I have trouble making decisions, because I question whether I am making the right one. I can no longer enjoy my favorite hobbies, because it requires processing skills that I no longer have. I went from being a gadget person, to now being threatened by technology that I no longer can use. This is what I deal with and so much more.</p>
<p>I go to a happy affair only to be tortured by the noise and surrounding conversations, because of the loudness that cannot be filtered out. If people try to speak with me in a public setting where there are many other conversations, I just don't understand what they are saying. This is because all of the people speaking come in at the same volume level. All the words run together, and it sounds like a foreign language.</p>
<p>I went from being extremely proactive to becoming much less active and motivated. I leave things around the house and don't put them away, because I don't know where they go or feel I may not know where to retrieve them again. One moment I am nice and another I may fly off the handle. I can no longer write or speak like I used to. My friends slowly become distant and usually speak to my wife. I do realize this.</p>
<p>I worry every day about the challenges ahead. Or even worse, I am losing my mind and see it happening, but I cannot do anything to change the course. People always say 'if I can do anything just let me know." If I take them up on that offer, they back out of their commitments. I have become extremely surprised by the lack of public commitment to my pleas for support of Alzheimer's disease. While some may be sympathetic in the moment, there appears to be little follow-through. This is very upsetting, because I feel as though it affects me personally as well as the millions of others living with the disease. I was always there for others when they needed it and now I feel alone.</p>
<p>While many people just coast through the day, I have to use 110% of my processing skills to do most things, which increases the stress and frustration. The worst part about this disease is knowing that I am doing all these things wrong and have no way to control or stop it, and it's only getting worse as the days go by. I used to save lots of money by doing so many things around the house. Now I lost the drive, determination and skills needed to do those things. Many times I hurt myself trying or make it worse.</p>
<p>I cannot begin to explain how it tears me up inside to see my spouse struggling to do the things that I once was capable of doing and know I cannot do a thing to help. I realize that one day I may no longer be able to drive and this devastates me. I see my wife becoming stressed, depressed and overwhelmed, but caregivers know it will only continue to get worse. Sadly, they keep telling themselves that they can do it all even when we know they will need help.</p>
<p>I, the patient, see it definitely. My wife is on the road to hell, and she does not even realize it yet, because she is so busy trying to block it all out. The worst part about all this is, I have not even reached the worst stage. That scares the hell out of me.</p>
<p>I have been so surprised by the stigma associated with this disease. It comes at you from all angles. People think they knew what Alzheimer's is, but they don't. I see this not only from people living with dementia but many media health correspondents, physicians and organizations that are geared to helping those deal with the disease. I have learned that I do not want to share my diagnosis with people I meet until they get to know me. If I was to tell them upfront, I would be treated so differently, which I have learned. I kind of see this disease like HIV use to be. The people who have it are so afraid to let others know, including family. I do not get it. We did nothing wrong to get this disease, and we need to speak up to let our voice be heard. We did nothing and no one should be ashamed of having it. I feel so much better when I share it with others than when I try to hide it.</p>
<p>Because of my frustration with existing environment for people with dementia, I realized change was need. I decided to use my few skills left to advocate. I have spent some of my last few years being on television, radio, newspapers, many blogs and working with many politicians. I also had an opportunity to speak at all of the public sessions to develop the first U.S. National Alzheimer's Plan, all this on my own. But that was not enough, because I ran into so many people who just did not want to get involved. I am now a volunteer for the national Alzheimer's Association Early-Stage Advisory Group. If there is something I want you to walk away with it's that you can make a difference, but it will take persistence. Write a letter to your public official or reach out to local support organizations to create needed programs and services. Your voice and your story are powerful tools. Please get involved.</p>
<p>The simple truth is, if you have not been touched by this devastating and debilitating disease yet, consider yourself extremely lucky. Sadly, it's just a matter of time before it touches you. It is my hope that my actions today may prevent future generations from suffering with this disease. So give yourself piece of mind and do something today. I hope that what I am doing will allow me to leave this world knowing that I did everything possible to make that next generation have a fighting chance. There are no excuses for not wanting to help. The human cost factor is too high, and we are all accountable to do something.</p>
<p>There are many organizations out there like ADI and the Alzheimer's Association that can help you. The Alzheimer's Association got me started in many ways with my new journey. It not only helped me, but it also had helped my wife as my caregiver. They have a website with many resources at www.alz.org. I encourage you to reach out today if you have not already. I would also encourage you to educate yourself.</p>
<p>Please join me and Go Purple on Friday, Sept. 21 for World Alzheimer's Month. I wear a purple Alzheimer's bracelet every day. And for those living with Alzheimer's, stop focusing on what you cannot do and join me in the battle to advocate. We still have so much to give, and we need to use our skills at our own speed. There is nothing to be ashamed of. We are counting on all of you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Over the past few years I have visited many websites that talk about Alzheimer's/dementia. The one thing that they all have in common is that not one of them encourages those of us who have the disease to continue to live and enjoy our lives. While I realize AD is a progressive and devastating disease we are still here, we are still alive, so treat us that way. Do not write us off.</p>
<p>I have always been savvy when it comes to finances and have always been a saver. One day I was speaking to a friend of mine who has AD, and I was telling her how I did not want to spend a lot of the money I had saved, because I wanted to leave it for my wife for that rainy day. My friend told me: "This is the rainy day. What are you waiting for?" She was right, and that's exactly how I started to think.</p>
<p>Just because we are living with AD, does not mean we should curl up and think our life is over before it actually is. There is so much more we can still do to enjoy life. Make wonderful memories with your loved ones before the days turn ugly.</p>
<p>One thing I had always wanted was to own a convertible, so we purchased one. I wanted to drive it down to the Keys in Florida. I have a friend out in California who also has AD. She has an RV and had planned to travel around the country before she declined and was incapable of driving anymore. One day she mentioned that she was going to the Keys and I decided to meet up with her. I also wanted to go deep-sea fishing to catch a big game fish. Don't get me wrong I am not person who goes fishing, but it was something I have always wanted to do. I had looked into it and it was very pricy, but it has always been on my bucket list. I think we all have a list if we stop and think about it.</p>
<p>I had no real plans; I just wanted to go out and drive my convertible, to feel the fresh air and admire the beautiful scenery and enjoy nice weather. I had a great time. I had a permanent smile on my face. I decided to stay with my friend in the RV for a week and visit various campgrounds along the way. That was a whole new experience, and some of the places we stayed at had fabulous views.</p>
<p>It was great to be out on our own, not having to rely on caregivers all the time. We had some difficulties, but we were able to mange on our own. It cost me a few extra dollars along the way because when I purchased something I could not remember the price in order to be able to compare, and sometimes I took the wrong road and had to take the turnpike, but these were minor issues. This road trip made me feel so much better about me. It was good for my mind; I came back stronger because of what I had achieved.</p>
<p>This disease has a way of making you feel like you are no longer cable of doing things on your own. You lose your self-esteem and your self-confidence. After this trip I felt great.</p>
<p>I did have to opportunity to go fishing. It was such a beautiful day with perfect conditions. The fish were not really biting to begin with but it didn't matter I was just happy to be on a boat again. Then I caught a fish that was about 10-12 inches long. Then I caught a barracuda that was at least 18 inches long, and then one over two feet long. Not to long after that I got the big one, a king macro that was 42 inches long! You should have seen the smile on my face. It is memories like this that we need to be making.</p>
<p>My friend in the RV has decided that she will not just use her mother's china and silverware on special occasions. Instead she took them with her in the RV. It gives her pleasure to use them every day. How many of you have a wonderful expensive hand bag or nice watch, which you only use on a special occasion?</p>
<p>Life is short; take pleasure in using those treasured items now. Start to create your own bucket list, don't just write it, DO IT! There are many wonderful memories that you can still make. Make them now before it's too late. Stop focusing on the negative. Make these last few years be the best of your life. You must do this now, before your mind no longer works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Since being diagnosed with Young Onset Alzheimer's Disease I have dedicated much of my time to its advocacy. Over the years I have worked with many people in different parts of the world, and through my experience I have come to realize that a major problem in reaching a cure is our actions. The way we treat not only those who suffer from this disease but those who care for the afflicted, the focus on funding and research and the lack of communication and collective action. Although there are many brilliant people who are involved in Alzheimer's and Dementia action and research I feel that following some simple principals and plans we could bring about real change in the world of these diseases.</p>
<p>PARTICIPATION -- Patients, caregivers, family and friends must become advocates</p>
<p>FUNDING -- Unprecedented action from government and public sector is vital</p>
<p>TEAM WORK -- Organizations dedicated to fighting the cause must work together to reach a shared goal</p>
<p>RESEARCH -- It is imperative that professional medical research personnel work hand-in-hand with patients</p>
<p>LIVE -- Those suffering from the disease must learn to live happy and fulfilling lives</p>
<p><strong>PARTICIPATION</strong> -- The government wants to hear from us! I have been doing this a long time and I am told over and over again by government officials that they need to have a clear idea of the numbers of people with Alzheimer's so they can make the appropriate changes to policy etc. In order for the government to do something they need to see people with the disease. I know people have busy lives but if we want things to change, patients, caregivers and friends need to start taking action.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? By getting involved! Write to the people who can help - government, health officials, and the press. But be mindful that you have to be persistent with these people, you have to fight. Can you imagine the impact if even a small percentage of the millions of sufferers took a little time to have their say?</p>
<p><strong>FUNDING</strong> -- We must look at other funding models for this disease. Unlike HIV and cancer, there are no survivors. Patients will continue to place a massive financial burden on the national economy; we need to be more proactive in how we fund research, care, medication and support for loved ones and caregivers.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? By writing to Congress, and the National Institute of Health. These people are responsible for prioritizing the distribution of funds to critical diseases - Alzheimer's disease is not on the list; we need it on the list.</p>
<p><strong>TEAM WORK</strong> -- There are many organizations out there hosting their individual fund raising programs, which is to be commended but the downside to this is that they still insist on operating independently on one another. These people need to see the bigger picture, they need to set aside their politics and differences, and come together as one and work together -- after all, they share the same goal don't they?</p>
<p><strong>How can you help</strong>? Well we can stop complaining about these organizations and give them solutions and guidance. Together we have the power to bring about change. Keep informed of all the latest news and action, don't listen to gossip or rumor -- check the facts; do your homework.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen. I am living with Alzheimer's disease. I spend almost every waking hour advocating for increased funding for research that will improve the treatment of this dreadful disease. In 2008, at the age of 49, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after struggling to get a diagnosis since my first symptoms began at age 39. There are more than five million Americans now suffering from this devastating disease.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds research into critical and devastating diseases such as cancer and HIV/Aids. Yet there is much neglect and discrimination regarding the allocation of funds for research into Alzheimer's and related dementias. As a person who experiences the devastating impact of Alzheimer's disease every day I hope that research will lead eventually to postponing the onset or slow the progression of this disease, if not prevention and cure.</p>
<p>Currently, Alzheimer's disease only receives about $450 million for research from NIH, compared to more than $5 billion for cancer and more than $3 billion for HIV/AIDS. I am astonished at the lack of funding dedicated to addressing the number one health epidemic. Historically, leadership from the federal government has helped lower the number of deaths from major diseases such as HIV/AIDS, heart disease, stroke and many types of cancers. This past experience provides hope that increased efforts directed at Alzheimer's disease will be met with similar success.</p>
<p>There are many more Americans living with Alzheimer's than HIV; more funding is desperately needed. If we do not act now this disease has the potential to bankrupt this country. Money allocated today will have an enormous return on investment if it leads to the kind of successes obtained for other diseases.</p>
<p>If you have not yet been touched by this devastating and debilitating disease it's just a matter of time. I hope that my advocacy will help prevent future generations having to suffer my fate and that of many others. You can help by increasing NIH funding for research on Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.</p>
<p>I appeal to members of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the respective appropriations committees: Make the hard choices; increase funding for Alzheimer's disease. Do everything necessary to ensure that Alzheimer's disease gets the exposure, commitment and funding necessary to change the course of the disease before millions more Americans are affected.</p>
<p>My work as an advocate has provided opportunities to share my story on a national platform. I have provided public comment during meetings of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services in addition to having my personal essay about overcoming the stigma of the disease featured in the Alzheimer's disease World Report 2012. I have also become a member of the Alzheimer's Association National Early-Stage Advisory Group, helping to raise awareness of the disease and provide insights on the most appropriate programs and services for individuals in the early stage of Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p>I hope that what I am doing now will allow me to leave this world knowing that I have done everything possible to make generations to come have a fighting chance. Do not forget these people or the future generations who will develop this disease. We face dying in the worst possible way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>As an Alzheimer's patient, I find it very difficult to perform tasks that I was once very capable of performing. Sometimes I am better than other times at doing the same task. People around me have accepted this fact and have tried to be very forgiving when I run into issues doing a task or when just trying to remember something. I really think that people around me should challenge me more at times.</p>
<p>For example, many of my doctors kept questioning me about whether or not I should still be driving. This of course was mentioned to my wife who also started wondering. I finally had a driving test a few years later. It was recommended that I no longer drive, even though I passed the test. I was almost borderline, but there was concern that I may not recognize when I become worse and could then become a danger. First of all, I have to tell you that the test they performed was not fair. I wonder how many regular people would be able to pass this test. The test also relied on me to learn new things in order to take the test. That is not fair since I have been driving the same vehicle all this time and nothing has changed. This constant talk about my driving has totally killed all of my self-esteem about driving. Every time I was in the car on the road with my wife, she constantly pointed out any mistakes I made, and her reaction time was much quicker than mine. I do realize I am a bit slower in my response time, but that is why I give myself more space between the other cars. Sometimes I am very far back or I just don't want to go around that slow car. There is nothing wrong with not feeling comfortable to go around that person. Let me do it at my speed.</p>
<p>I see many people on the road that I feel are so much worse than me and I wonder why they are still on the road, if I am supposedly so bad. I decided that I was going to drive to visit my daughter in South Carolina. I live in Jamison, PA in Bucks County. I was very scared to take this trip but I was trying to prove something to myself. It could have meant the end of my driving if I made a serious mistake along the way. I drove in one day, about 700 miles, with the help of a GPS in my car. The more I drove, the more I was starting to feel comfortable behind the wheel. A few other people on the road made serious mistakes along the way and I easily avoided a possible accident. This trip was the best thing I could have done for myself. I now have almost all of my self-confidence back and my wife no longer makes constant comments about my driving, unless I have a real issue. I have now had two close calls that required quick thinking and maneuvering to avoid an accident. In both cases, I was able to avoid the issues without my wife's comments. Again it may have taken me an extra second or two to react, but I was fine.</p>
<p><strong>Coping Strategies for Daily Challenges </strong></p>
<p>Because of this situation, I feel even stronger than ever that it is important to be challenged. I know it may be easier for you to do something for an Alzheimer's patient because it's much quicker for you to accomplish the task. But I really believe that if you take the time to coach us along the way, we may do better in the long run. Believe me, I know it's got to be very aggravating at times, but I really appreciate it. It takes a lot of patience on the part of the helper. Everyone is different and you need to know at what point in time you should not push. It's also hard to be patient and not raise your voice at the person you are trying to help, because it will only make it worse.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble remembering dates or things I need to do.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I use my computer and Microsoft Outlook to keep me straight by sending me reminders.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Getting email using regular places like Google or Yahoo is a challenge for me.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: My daughter had set up my Outlook to retrieve emails from all my accounts, and they arrive in the same format which makes it so much easier to read, and it allows me to use common folders.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I forget to reply back to people's emails.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I flag them with a reminder date so it will automatically send me a reminder.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Remembering passwords is a real challenge for me.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have created a personal system that works great, I also rely on the computer to store many of them; however, it is a real challenge when the system does not work. I also keep files with the password information.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble remembering the day, the month and the year.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have watch that displays all the information.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have an extremely complex TV, stereo and entertainment system, which requires many remotes and settings to be used.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I purchased a smart remote that allows me to put in all the steps at once, and press one button which takes care of sending all the commands to all the devices at once. It works great until it fails. Not sure how much longer I can maintain it. It's a bit involved</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Most of my lawn power tools are a struggle to use.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I do not think I have any coping method other then I keep trying different things until I get them to work. The problem is most are new, I find it easier to work with tools I am familiar with.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I drive I don't always feel as comfortable behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I sometimes need to take more precautions, and allow more distance between the car in front of me, and I may drive a little slower. I am also much more alert and focused during these times. It makes it hard because when I travel with my wife she wonders why all of sudden I drive slower, when normally I am flying. There is nothing wrong with going slower and being cautious.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I don't do much of anything anymore.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: The other day I was speaking with my neighbor who was waxing his car. This gave me some inspiration to want to do it. When people mention things to me it sometimes gives me what I need to take it to the next level.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I purchased a camera; however, no matter how many times I read the manual I still don't seem to be able to understand how to use it.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: Make sure you buy one that works completely automatic without needing to do anything. It is frustrating at times when you would like to do something on your own but just can't remember on how to do it. I have learned to accept it but I still try and fail.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Spelling and forming sentences has become a real challenge.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take advantage of using the computer to guide me in the correct spelling of a word. That is becoming harder because often it cannot figure out what I am trying to say. I also ask others to look things over for me, and to correct them for me. It's kind of frustrating for me because I am really concerned that I may not be able to do this much longer. I have seen a big decline in this over the years. I seem to notice this more than my other skills because I do it so often. While I am sometimes ashamed of sharing it with others, I still need to communicate so I try to not think about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Sometimes when I want to do certain things I need to stop and think.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: If I want to work on a project I will spend a lot of extra time trying to think of the best approach, this doesn't always help, but I tend to work at a slightly slower pace and am aware that things will go wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Finding past emails or letters</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: The computer is such a wonderful tool in so many ways. It allows me to search the entire computer as long as I can remember a word or two in the document I am looking for. While it may take a while I would not be able to survive without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I can no longer do many things</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I rely on my wife for many things nowadays. I am not sure if that is a coping strategy. When anything important needs to be considered, I ask her for her help. She does all the financials, and planning of most things. It is frustrating but I realize I cannot do it on my own.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I get lost or cannot figure out how to get from one place to another. Maps are not easy to follow anymore even the ones that you print out from Google.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: GPS! I cannot imagine what it was like for people like me before GPS and the computer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I fear that one day I will be lost or not be able to communicate with others due to a temporary stress or decline in my mental capacity.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I have chosen to not be concerned about that. I have a medical tag on me all the time that has my medical condition along with important contact information. I will continue to go wherever I want to go. I realize I will need to rely on others to get there. I will need to ask others for help frequently, and to ask multiple times so others don't send me down the wrong path. It will take me longer to get there, but I cannot let that stop me. Living in fear is also no way to live. I know there are good people that will help me when the time comes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Some things I do get me very frustrated</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I no longer try to do those things so I do not get frustrated</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I write notes as reminders</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I only write a few notes as if I have too many they just become overwhelming, and I would lose track of them because there are too many.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I need more time to do things</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I leave much earlier for meetings and places so I can allow for issues along the way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: If I start to get frustrated doing something.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I move on to something else and then I try to come back and do it later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I fear I may get lost when I go to new and far places.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take a cell phone with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I go shopping and lose track of the person I am with I sometimes start to worry a little bit.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to calm myself down and look for them. If I cannot find them I will try to stay by the door we came in so I can see them at that register</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I had trouble remembering which way to turn off the water in the garage for the hose.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: My wife added masking tape with a marking pointing to off. No more issues. I have the feeling that over time I will need many reminders like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I have trouble hearing people speak in loud places.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to not go to restaurants or other places where I will be put in that situation if I can help it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I can no longer use my video recorder.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I now have TiVo which makes it so much easier to do things. I still need some help, and my wife can help when I need it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I try to communicate with much smarter people.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I believe that my reaching out to and working with people who are very smart will delay the deterioration process.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: When I cut the grass, or do something that requires me to be a bit more stable on my feet.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I use a good pair of shoes, or even a low cut boot. It really helps me become more stable on my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: I could get hurt while doing yard work.</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I do not wear lose clothes or short sleeved clothes when doing yard work so I do not get hurt. Wearing shorts has already led to a broken foot because the pants leg got caught on the shifter. I also wear safety glasses. The problem I have is I don't always remember to take these precautions, or sometimes I think it's not necessary because I feel I will be careful if I am doing something that will just take a few minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: Just the other day I was thinking in my head that I had to turn a grate on my fireplace, and I was thinking it may be hot.</p>
<p><strong>No Coping Strategy</strong>: Instead of being careful and just putting one finger closely to feel for heat, I just tried to touch it with three fingers to lift -- I got burned. How do you get a copping strategy for becoming stupid? It seems that my mind is not communicating with the rest of my body.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ???</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: All the people around me know I have AD, so most of them are keeping an extra eye out on me which is nice to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to keep some type of a schedule. I get up every day at the same time and try to eat at the same time. This kind of helps to do things like taking my drugs or other things. The second I change my routine you can be sure I will forget to take my drugs or do something else.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I double and triple check myself on many things I do. Daily Challenge: ???? Coping Strategy: I try to find some humor in my issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ?????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I ask people for help and ask a lot more questions of others</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ????</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I take lots of breaks</p>
<p style="text-align:center">-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Daily Challenge: ???</p>
<p>Coping Strategy: I try to know my limits and will not start a task if I feel I cannot do it. Or I will have someone work with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>A few months ago one of my friends mentioned that I am always talking about things related to Alzheimer's. While I know I spend my days advocating for this disease I did not realize I was that bad. Especially with those I am not trying to convince or influence. Although I appreciate the person telling me, it has really bothered me.</p>
<p>I started to give it some thought and tried to understand why and what I could do to change that. Not too long after that my wife made a similar comment, and that really hit home because their comments to me were so close together.</p>
<p>I realized many things have contributed to this. The most important is I no longer work and I feel like I am locked in this house; I really have nothing else to do. I wish I could still be working and doing something meaningful, but unfortunately my skills required to perform those jobs are no longer there because of my Alzheimer's. I use to go to work, I used to talk with others about many different topics, not just work but everyday world issues.</p>
<p>I have tried to have similar conversations with people about issues in the news, and I don't always have the right information since I don't always understand it all, and only retain bits and pieces. While there was a time I was a news junkie, now I can rarely recall many of the topics or even can tie other stories together in my mind so I can speak intelligently. I have recently found myself starting discussions that go south because I start out with part of a subject, and when we delved into it deeper I was at loss for information. I felt stupid because I could no longer speak about something I once found very easy. I used to be great about talking about political issues which really requires you to know what you are talking about, but now I can barely defend my position, and I do worse for even bringing the subject up, and then I feel bad because I was not able to point out the real issues so the person could really make a true assessment.</p>
<p>Since I have no real job I have made it my mission to advocate for Alzheimer/dementia. I try to keep my mind as engaged as possible. I also try to focus on things that most don't, like the high hanging fruit which is probably not the best for some on like me. That involves dealing with many high-level people. While I do good at first I don't always have the answers they require, and sometimes may come across as not knowing what I am doing. It is very frustrating knowing that in my brain I have the answers, but I just do not know how to retrieve the information needed to help me do what I need to do. Especially when I need it the most, I may remember later on sometimes, but it's too late. There was a time that I could retrieve everything to my favor and keep track of everything one person would say to me.</p>
<p>Then I finally realized I listen to the weather report multiple times a day and I never seem to know what the weather is supposed to be like, which I always use to know. I just do not seem to retain it.</p>
<p>I use to like reading the paper and I no longer do that because I have trouble retaining what I read or I don't remember how the story relates to something I read a few paragraphs back in the same article.</p>
<p>I used to have hobbies that I can no longer do because of the disease. I use to love boating and tinkering with electronics. I can no longer do any of these things. I rarely do anything around the house because I am afraid I will make it worse.</p>
<p>When I have conversations with others I do not always remember what we have spoken about in the past. I always hated it when you spoke to certain people and they keep repeating the same information you had spoken about in the past. I do not want to become one of them. There are so many discussions I want to have but I just can't because the lack of my ability and more. I miss that so much. To have an intelligent conversation with someone that can reply with meaningful information, where we both walked away with some new and interesting facts would be wonderful.</p>
<p>I was never one to blow my own horn, but I do that today so others can see some of the steps I have made in hopes that they feel they are willing to take risks and help me expand my mission.</p>
<p>I have accomplished some great things and I think that is what I may share with my friends. Maybe I am repeating myself and I don't know it. I keep trying to figure out how I can change, but I struggle because I do not know what to do. It seems that Alzheimer's has taken over my life and not sure what or how to change.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>COMMENTS ON THE UNDATED DRAFT<br />
					NATIONAL PLAN TO ADDRESS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>March 31, 2012</strong></p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p>The comments presented in this paper are based on my experience as the primary care giver for someone with Alzheimer's dementia and on a book that I read as part of my research on Alzheimer's dementia. The book is titled <em>The Myth of Alzheimer's Disease</em> by Dr. Peter Whitehouse, a leading researcher in Alzheimer's disease for over 30 years.</p>
<p>Eight years ago at age 60, my wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Dementia (AD). She lived at home for four and a half years, and has lived in an assisted living facility for the past three years and nine months. She has had three different kinds of brain scans (CAT, MRI, and PET), been evaluated for vitamin B-12 deficiency, been evaluated for "water on the brain", been evaluated at the University of Virginia and John Hopkins University, seen four different neurologists, and has taken both of the medications typical given to people with AD all to no avail. I concluded several years ago that the only thing left was to ensure that she is taken care of. Not only to pay for the care but to participate in it, which I do on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Dr. Whitehouse's book summarizes most of the experiences that I have been through in the last eight years and confirms my conclusion about care for my wife. In my view, everyone who has a loved one diagnosed with AD should read this book. I also believe that Dr. Whitehouse should be considered for inclusion on the Advisory Council established by the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA).</p>
<p>The last part of this paper contains a brief discussion of a grant program through which funding could be provided for the care of people with AD.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL COMMENT </strong></p>
<p>I agree with the goals in the draft plan. I do not agree, however, with the distribution of funding for the goals. Of the $156 million dollars included in the draft plan, $130 million (83 percent) are allocated for research. Only $26 million are allocated for care. In my view, the funds for research and care should be reversed. At some point, everyone with either AD or another type of dementia is going to need care. That is where most of the federal funds and private funds should be spent.</p>
<p>The final plan should include more details for each of the goals. This includes the office responsible for each strategy and the tentative completion date, funds, and expected outcomes or products for each strategy. Without the details, there is no way to tract the progress on each strategy. The plan also should indicate who will provide oversight for each strategy.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIFIC COMMENTS </strong></p>
<p>1. Care</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I concluded several years ago that the only thing that I can do for my wife is to see that she is taken care of. For this reason, I believe that the first goal on Page 6 of the national plan should address care and that care should be the major theme throughout the plan.</p>
<p>I am not recommending that no research be done on AD. Certainly, research should continue on AD, but not at the funding distribution in the draft plan (i.e., 83 percent of the total amount in the draft plan). In my view, the only way to find a cure for AD is to find a cure for the aging process. This is highly unlikely.</p>
<p>2. Use of the Word "Disease"</p>
<p>In his book, Dr. Whitehouse concludes that Alzheimer's is not disease. It is aging of the brain that can be caused by a number of factors (e.g., stroke, lifestyle, injury, or environmental exposure). Because it is not a disease, there is no cure for AD.</p>
<p>I recommend that the work "disease" no longer be used to describe Alzheimer's dementia . Use of the word stigmatizes the person with AD often resulting in depression, loss of friends, and lack of understanding on what is really occurring. Even though the end result is the same (all persons with AD and other dementias need care), calling the condition what it really is (i.e., dementia) is a better approach for dealing with the condition. In his book, Dr. Whitehouse described an approach whereby the patient and the patient's family are told that the patient has dementia and then given help through a team approach. The team consists of the doctor, a dietitian who helps the patient improve their diet, a physical therapist who works with the patient to increase their physical activity, and a social worker who emphasizes the importance of staying connected both mentally and socially. Use of the team approach is more compassionate then just telling the patient they have Alzheimer's disease, and to take Aricept and come back for another doctor's visit in six months, which is what happened to my wife. Using the word "disease" to describe AD implies there is a cure for AD. This gives the patient and the patient's family false hope because, as previously mentioned, I do not believe there is a cure for AD.</p>
<p>3. Ethnic and Racial Minority Populations</p>
<p>During the eight years that I have had direct involvement with AD, I have never read anything or had any experiences that indicate ethnic and racial minority populations have higher cases of AD than the general population. Unless there is compelling evidence that those populations do experience disproportionate cases of AD, I recommend that this issue not be emphasized in the national plan. In my view, it is more important to spend funds on the care of all people with AD.</p>
<p>4. Assisted Living Facilities</p>
<p>The draft plan fails to recognize that a viable option for people with AD is care in a secure area at an assisted living facility. My wife has been cared for in such facility for three years and nine months, and I expect her to continue to be cared for in an assisted living facility for many more years (she is very healthy except for AD).</p>
<p>An issue related to caring for a person with AD in an assisted living facility is cost. Funds are not available from either Medicare or Medicaid for people who receive care in an assisted living facility. In my view, there is no difference between care of a person with AD in a nursing home and care of such a person in a secure area of an assisted living facility. This disparity needs to be addressed. An example of the cost of care in an assisted living facility is the $75,600 annual fee for my wife plus the cost of incontinence supplies and medications. At present, my long term care insurance pays for part of these costs and I pay the remaining part. When my long term care insurance expires, I will have to pay the total costs.</p>
<p>5. Strategy 2.A</p>
<p>Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and emergency room personnel should be included in the healthcare providers who receive education in AD. In my experience, general physicians also need to be educated about AD. All too often, they just want to prescribe a medication. For example, seroquel often is prescribed for people with AD. Every article that I read on seroquel said that it is not recommended for people with dementia. When I told the doctor that, he said they give it to people with AD anyway.</p>
<p>6. Action 2.A.4</p>
<p>The training discussed in this action should be made available to all direct-care workers and not just workers in nursing homes. In particular, direct-care workers in assisted living facilities and those who provide home care should receive this training.</p>
<p>7. Action 2.B.2</p>
<p>My wife was diagnosed with AD through a process of elimination. In her first visit to a neurologist, she could not pass some simple tests. At later appointments, those same tests were given to her with worst results that the results of the earlier tests. Eventually, the neurologist concluded she had AD. In my view, this process is most likely the only way to diagnose AD.</p>
<p>8. Action 2.E.2</p>
<p>In my experience, the cost of home care for a person with AD is not that much less than the cost of care in an assisted living facility. In addition, home care is much more difficulty for the primary care giver even with the help of direct-care personnel who come to the home. In too many cases, the primary care giver is the one who suffers the most when care is provided in the home.</p>
<p>9. Strategy 2.H</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I have not seen that racial and ethnic minorities are affected disproportionally by AD. All people with AD need care no matter what their race or ethic group. The available resources should be spent on improving care for all AD patients instead of focusing on any racial or ethnic group.</p>
<p>10. Action 3.D.1</p>
<p>It is extremely important that primary care givers understand the legal documents a person with AD should have. These include a general power of attorney, a medical power of attorney, a will, and, where appropriate, a trust. Also, the primary care giver should ensure their name is on the appropriate bank accounts. The importance of these documents should be stressed in the plan.</p>
<p>11. Goal 5</p>
<p>I agree that it is important to track progress on all of the strategies in the plan. As part of that effort, oversight on all strategies and actions must be provided. Without oversight, there is no way to assess progress.</p>
<p><strong>CARE PROPOSAL </strong></p>
<p>Throughout the above comments I have emphasized the importance of care for people with AD. To provide quality care, funding is required. One way to provide that funding is through a grant program.</p>
<p>To help defray the cost of care for people with AD, a grant could be provided to nursing homes, assisted living facilities, home heath care companies, and, potentially, to individuals. Such a program could be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services or funds could be provided to a state and they could administer the program. To receive a grant, specific requirements would have to be met. In addition, oversight would have to provided to ensure that the grants funds are spent properly.</p>
<ul><li>Grant funds could be used to.</li>
<li>Develop standards of the care of AD patients.</li>
<li>Develop design standards for new facilities or modifications to existing facilities where care for people with AD is provided.</li>
<li>Construct new facilities or modifications to existing facilities where care for people with AD is provided.</li>
<li>Train direct-care workers</li>
<li>Provide funds to increase the pay of direct-care workers. . " Provide funds to defray the costs that family members have to pay for care.</li>
<li>Provide funds for the oversight of the grant requirements and to ensure quality care is provided.</li>
</ul><p>To receive a grant, an entity would have to submit an application to the agency who administers the grant program. The application would have to contain detailed information about on the facility and the care they provide.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to submit the above comments. Questions on my comments should be addressed to:</p>

<p>I am very impressed by the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (and Related Dementias). It is well written and quite comprehensive from my perspective. But I do have some concerns and suggestions.</p>
<p>My wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease in February 2010. I am her primary caregiver and health advocate. Fortunately, long-term care insurance has afforded us the opportunity to have two very good caregivers thus providing me the ability to work part time as a research scientist at CNA, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). My wife and I have experienced both the classical, traditional clinical medical approach and, more recently, the alternative complementary medical approach. In addition, I am a member of two caregiver support groups: one offered by a Ministry to the Aging at my church, and the second offered by the Alzheimer's Family Day Center of Fairfax, VA.</p>
<p>From this base of experience and education, I offer my observations and suggestions:</p>
<ol><li><strong>The plan seems to lack a sense of urgency</strong>. While the goal "to prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025" is laudable, the selection of 2025 along with the general tone of the plan does not convey the urgency I believe is necessary. Selecting either 2020, because it's sooner and a nice round number, or 2022, as it comes 10-years after the release of the National Plan and is akin to President Kennedy's announcement in 1960 of manned flight to the moon by the end of that decade, would be better. Both years signal a message of boldness and ambition more so than does 2025. I believe caregivers and family members would be encouraged by such ambitious goals.</li>
<li><strong>The plan appears to display certain biases that may restrict the search for alternative solutions</strong>.
<ol><li>First, there seems to be an emphasis on searching for "pharmacological" solutions. Certainly, the plan recognizes other approaches, e.g. "While research on AD has made steady progress, there are no pharmacological or <em>other interventions</em> to definitively prevent, treat, or cure the disease" and "<em>non-pharmacological management</em> of physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms." But it does not clearly state what such "other, non-pharmacological" approaches might be. This suggests to me a bias toward pharmaceutical solutions and therefore a favoring of the pharmaceutical industry, which seems to be more motivated by profits than solutions. I encourage that these other approaches be specified. The effectiveness of public health communications necessitates clear, plain-English language.</li>
<li>There also seems to be a bias toward the time-consuming approach of clinical trials. The plan clearly recognizes the need to the pharmaceutical bias, I think.</li>
<li>The plan rightly includes "related dementias" in defining Alzheimer's Disease. But it identifies only Lewy body, frontotemporal, and vascular dementias as examples. Unless recognized but not stated by the drafters, I suggest including other neurological diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, ALS/Lew Gehrig, and MS. Such an expansion might introduce synergies and efficiencies and potentially a considerably more significant effect.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><p>Admittedly, my own personal research into AD is limited. I have only recently begun to dig more deeply into the subject. Much of my motivation comes from frustration over the silence and apparent helplessness of the traditional medical community toward my wife's disease. I have recently read two books that have strongly influenced me: "Alzheimer's Disease---What If There Was a Cure"---The Story of Ketones" by Dr. Mary Newport, and "Stop Alzheimer's Now! How to Prevent and Reverse Dementia, Parkinson's, ALS, Multiple Sclerosis and Other Neurodegenerative Disorders" by Dr. Bruce Fife.These books introduced me to the "Type 3 Diabetes" aspect of AD, which I find most intriguing and compelling. If what they say is true about insulin-deficiency and insulin-resistance in the brain and the resultant "starvation" of neurons, and that nutritional substitutes in the form of ketone bodies from medium-chain triglyceride fatty acids already exist on the shelves of health food stores in the forms of coconut oil and MCT oils, THIS IS HUGE. Considering that I might be "starving" my wife's neurons by not providing this source of fuels (already used by neonatologists, according to Dr. Newport and in pediatrics, according to my RN daughter), ignoring this evidence is morally unconscionable to me. Also if true, this nutritional approach could be a "silver bullet" of vast consequence.</p>
<p>Thank you for soliciting comments from the public in reaction to the draft plan. I apologize for missing the March 30 deadline. Such tardiness has become commonplace for me as an Alzheimer's caregiver and health advocate. And thank you for your contribution to this important work.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for signing NAPA and putting creation of our first National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease on the fast track.</p>
<p>I preface my comments with brief personal history.</p>
<p>I joined the national Alzheimer's Association early in 1980, co-founded both the Chicago and Detroit area chapters as I moved around the country, joined the National Board of Directors circa 1981 and rose to become a national Vice Chair and Chair of the Public Policy Committee. In 1984 I co-founded the Alzheimer's Disease International. I am also proud to have single-handedly suggested the idea of what became the federally funded program to states to create innovative Alzheimer's programs with special emphasis on serving minority populations. While Chair of the Public Policy Committee for the national Alzheimer's Association I was also successful in getting our board to hire full time professional public policy staff, create our annual spring "Public Policy Forum" to bring our citizen advocates to Washington DC to be educated and meet with their Congressional representatives. We also developed our first coalition efforts, e.g. with the then Long Term Care campaign, and the National Citizen's Coalition for Nursing Home Reform and helped support the nursing home reform bill that became law (OBRA 1987). We also held our first meetings with members of the CBO and Medicare/Medicaid administration officials to examine what information was needed to start developing a plan for how to meet the service and funding needs of people with dementia and their families. Later, in the 1990's while at Wellesley Centers for Women we looked at the scary prospects of the diminished numbers of people available (the baby bust era e.g. my children's birth cohort) to serve as care partners to those baby boomers who would be developing Alzheimer's and other brain/body diseases in 2040-2050. I then was asked to join Boston University's NIH funded Alzheimer's Disease Center and Department of Neurology to continue my clinical intervention studies; I currently have a small phase I trial of nutritional supplements underway, funded by the U.S. Alzheimer's Association.</p>
<p>My work over the past 30 plus years on behalf of Alzheimer's disease and now the broader field of brain health, is all inspired by my mother Frances Fink Emerson who developed Alzheimer's disease in her early 50's, lived 25 years and died in 1990 with no ability for willed action or movement of any sort, and a brain shrunk to half its original size. She received great care both at home -9 years-and in a nursing home -- 16 years- (and thus lived a long time despite her disabilities....no other health issues) in an era when we knew only a fraction of what we know now, thanks primarily to the work of the Alzheimer's Association, and research funding by NIH, Alzheimer's Association and WHO and other organizations and caring people around the world.</p>
<p>Today I am an Alzheimer's researcher connected with Boston University School of Medicine, actively serve on my local chapter board (Alz. Assn of Massachusetts and New Hampshire) as member of the Medical Scientific Advisory Committee, serve as a Board Member Emeritus of the national Alzheimer's Association (an inactive role), and actively attend and present scientific papers or posters at the Alzheimer's Disease International. I also have a small business that brings evidence-based knowledge about brain healthy lifestyles to organizations and individuals and families. My centerpiece is the evidence-based Memory Preservation Nutrition program, which I am proud to be bringing to 6 Boston area Assisted Living communities to help them improve the healthfulness of the foods their residents are served and eating. I am also a popular speaker, mainly on the topic of "Healthy Eating for a Healthy Brain and Body." And was featured as part of a Medical Journal TV news report on Boston Channel 5's Chronicle on March 20, 2012 and November 18, 2011.</p>
<p>I am excited by the breadth and content of the draft national Alzheimer's plan and want to make just a few pointed comments about moving forward. I am also attaching a couple documents that might be of interest in summarizing some of the recent work related to brain healthy lifestyles and reducing risk of Alzheimer's and other brain diseases. Here also is the direct link to the article I wrote for Sage Encyclopedia 'Alzheimer's Disease: Encyclopedia of Lifestyle Medicine and Health' See it at: <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=6kqwthjab.0.ptfnnijab.rplxpbdab.1&amp;ts=S0737&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sage-ereference.com%2Fview%2Flifestylemedicinehealth%2Fn18.xml%3Fp%3DemailAIi5pJ5vQDTvY%26d%3D%2Flifestylemedicinehealth%2Fn18.xml">http://www.sage-ereference.com/abstract/lifestylemedicinehealth/n18.xml</a></p>
<p>First, I am gratified that the draft plan calls for research and program development in the realm of healthy lifestyles, not just innovations in the realm of pharmaceutical and medical research, which of course is needed as we would all like to find the magic bullet(s) to prevent and cure this disease. But given the complexity of this mysterious disease and the delicacy and intricacy of the brain, such magic bullets may not exist. Alzheimer's may be as challenging to reduce risk as has been heart disease, stroke and diabetes, since they are all interrelated in ways we are still seeking to understand. Thus major public health initiatives based on evidence uncovered in the fields of nutrition, physical exercise, sleep, stress reduction and much more may be what works to help our society avoid the catastrophe of doubling, then quadrupling the numbers of Americans with Alzheimer's disease as the numbers of people who could serve as care partners and paid professional providers shrinks in relative numbers.</p>
<p>Second, as an active member of the international Alzheimer's research and practice communities I strongly urge that the HHS Administrative offices charged with designing, refining and implementing the plan be in close liaison with international efforts to combat Alzheimer's disease. People in the US are often very parochial and have no idea of the great strides being made elsewhere. Also, because our healthcare system is presently dominated by for-profit organizations and pharmaceutical companies, it is harder for us to see clearly public health priorities that might be the best use of resources. The international community faces graver restraints in resources but at the same time has the power of being able to find collective solutions that benefit the most people. For instance at our most recent conference of ADI, held in London, the closing debate was whether enough evidence now exists to mount a major public health initiative targeting improvements in healthy lifestyles for middle-aged adults....vs. an even broader public health initiative to improve the health and wellbeing, especially nutrition, of babies and pregnant women and through that route decrease the numbers of future adults with brain diseases. Meanwhile we are all gearing up to try to be ready to serve the millions of adults who already have Alzheimer's, who will develop it if we don't find a way to slow down the progression and delay the age of onset.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's Disease International's small but very competent staff (Mark Wortman is the CEO, based at the UK Alzheimer's offices in London) and with several groups of collaborative research groups who are keyed in on finding practical solutions to this world wide crisis we are all facing together.</p>
<p>One of these research groups is called "10-66" which receives both NIH and WHO funding to conduct important cross-cultural studies in the developing world to establish true and comparable prevalence/incidence rates of both Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, has conducted international clinical trials of caregiver interventions to determine usefulness and costs in a variety of different countries and financial settings, and is now looking at some broader public policy and public health issues. Their annual reports can be found on the ADI website:</p>
<p>In addition, there is a collaborative effort of several country based large research projects examining whether certain lifestyle interventions could help reduce the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, or delay the age of initial symptoms. Each initiative has different founding sources and different specific research objectives and methods, but by combining and collaborating they hope to increase the robustness of their findings. One of the three studies is taking place in Finland, led by Miia Kivipelto with major funding from Finland's Health Department, and some additional funding from the U.S. Alzheimer's Association and perhaps other sources as well. I touch on that study in one of the two papers I have attached to this email.</p>
<p>Another perspective that was discussed at this last London meeting was, how best to proceed in planning CARE in the depressing scenario that we can't prevent most of the cases of Alzheimer's. What public policy is best. One that is disease specific, or that is based on disabilities, across diseases and health conditions. This was very interesting to me arising among a group of people who has fought hard for over 25 years to get their home countries to give proper recognition to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and to develop national plans. But once one has raised awareness, achieved sufficient specific research dollars and developed specific care programs, then one is freer to look at the broader public policy perspectives and see what is the best use of resources for a country, and what is most likely to be politicall feasible.</p>
<p>As you could gather from my resume, I stand ready to volunteer my time and attention to helping you in your efforts should you see a way I could be helpful.</p>
<p>In the meantime I applaud all the work you are doing and say THANK YOU. You all are fulfilling a dream I've held since the 1980's of a true national effort to combat Alzheimer's disease, both through research, public health and programmatic efforts at the local, state and federal levels.</p>

<p>Readers may take away confirmation of the importance of some of the things they are already doing and gain ideas and motivation to adopt brain-healthy nutrition and lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>Prevalence </strong></p>
<p><em>The World Alzheimer Report 2010: The Global Economic Impact of Dementia</em>, published by <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Disease International, reported that around 0.5% of the world's total population live with dementia, predominantly AD, and that the total estimated worldwide costs of dementia were US$604 billion in 2010, equivalent to around 1% of the world's gross domestic product. The <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association reports that there are nearly 15 million caregivers for <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> and dementia patients in the United States. AD is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the one growing most rapidly (by 50% from 2000 to 2007). The growth rate of this epidemic is expected to further accelerate with the aging of the baby boomer generation, increasing personal costs to families, which provide the bulk of care, and rapidly escalating economic costs from $172 billion today to more than $1 trillion by 2050. The U.S. National <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Project Act was enacted into law in January 2011 to create a coordinated national strategy to address this national public health emergency with widespread social and economic consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of AD and Diagnostic Criteria </strong></p>
<p>AD is the most common form of dementia, causing multiple impairments in thinking and cognition, including planning and organization (executive function), attention, short-term episodic memory (especially the recording of events and experiences), and sometimes visual-spatial function. The pathological hallmarks of AD are extracellular plaques composed of a protein called beta-amyloid (also called "A-beta") and the intracellular accumulations of neurofibrillary tangles, the insoluble paired helical filaments of an abnormally phosphorylated tau protein, and a cytoskeletal protein critical to the brain cell structure. Studies suggest that the soluble forms of A-beta, not the more visible plaques, are the toxic form. The normal function of A-beta is to kill microbes, as part of the innate immune system. It is the large amount of A-beta present in AD that is abnormal. Moreover, plaques and tangles appear to be late-stage developments and may or may not reflect the initiating biological sequelae, which may include injury, inflammation, disruptions of cell signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and disruptions in glucose and/or lipid metabolic processes.</p>
<p><strong>New Criteria for Diagnosing and Redefining AD </strong></p>
<p>National Institutes of Health/<strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association working groups in 2010-2011 updated the criteria for diagnosing <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia, added criteria for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to underlying <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology, and set the framework for identifying and testing biomarkers that in the near future could be used to diagnose "preclinical AD." Thus, the definition of AD has expanded beyond dementia and cognitive impairment to include a presymptomatic stage of the disease.</p>
<p>Biomarkers may improve the accuracy of diagnoses of both <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia and MCI due to <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology during life and serve as clinical trial end points. Prominent among the new biomarkers are neuroimaging (e.g., of A-beta levels, glucose processing, and the size and shape of brain structures) and measuring the presence of A-beta and tau in cerebrospinal fluid. These criteria will replace those established in 1984 as the "NINCDS-ADRDA" criteria. These criteria, developed by the National Institute of Neurological Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA), were universally adopted and have been in use, without modification, for more than 25 years. One of the challenges of prevention and treatment trials, both with preclinical AD and in MCI, is the inadequacy of cognitive tests to catch early changes reliably. The emergence of other outcome markers, namely brain imaging, and other biomarkers, is revolutionizing the field.</p>
<p>Scientists participating in the work groups formulating the new guidelines note that the updates were urgently needed for establishing the next generation of clinical trials for possible pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions. In medical practice, the proposed changes represent refinements of existing criteria for the diagnosis of <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia. The guidelines suggest, for example, that physicians recognize that complaints of loss of memory may not always be the first or most prominent presenting symptom. A decline in other aspects of cognition (e.g., word finding, vision/spatial issues, and impaired reasoning, judgment, and problem solving) may be the first presenting or the most prominent symptoms. Many research scientists in the field are concerned that current biomarker criteria give too much emphasis to A-beta and tau (especially A-beta) and too little to the role that oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular pathology, white matter, and other lesions or injuries may play in cognitive decline, in clinical symptoms of dementia, and in the development of abnormal levels of A-beta and tau. Ignoring a large body of evidence could hinder identifying proper treatments and preventive interventions, particularly lifestyle interventions. It is also important to guard against reductionist AD theories because what is now called "<strong>Alzheimer's</strong> disease" may be one or more multifactorial disorders and thus may require "multitherapies."</p>
<p>The evolving understanding of AD includes the recognition that individuals with a diagnoses of AD and MCI can still learn new information and acquire new habits, using a variety of preserved functions such as other forms of memory (e.g., visual, emotional, procedural). In addition, it is important to realize that while people with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> may have lost many brain cells and synapses, they still retain many healthy brain cells, so it is important to work with them to maintain brain health in the hope of slowing progression, maintaining positive emotion, and improving quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Causes or Etiology of AD as Related to Lifestyle </strong></p>
<p>The exact causes and etiology of AD are still not fully known. As of 2011, there are still no methods of perfect diagnosis during life or ways to cure or completely prevent AD. Age remains the biggest risk factor for AD, with (lower) education levels the only other consistent risk factor across all ethnic groups. However, much has been learned in the past 30 years, lifestyles are at the heart of this new knowledge.</p>
<p>Research now recognizes AD as a complex chronic disease with many environmental and genetic factors, whose pathology may begin to accumulate 10 to 30 or more years before the appearance of noticeable clinical symptoms. With such a long prodromal stage, preventive interventions are needed that can be safely used for decades. While a few families have an autosomnal dominant form of AD, most individuals have what is called the "sporadic" form, without clear genetic patterns. The <em>APOE4</em> type of allele confers a dose-related risk for persons of European origin but not typically for those of African origin. While other risk-conferring genes have been identified, most scientists have found that environmental factors are probably at least as important as genetic ones. Recognition of the importance of lifestyle flows directly from the multiple studies that have shown that brain and cognitive health is dramatically affected by the rest of the body, especially the cardiovascular, glucose metabolism, and cell energy systems.</p>
<p>Observational and prospective studies have confirmed this logical relationship and spawned numerous animal studies to explore the relationships between particular lifestyle factors, cognition, and the mechanisms of action. For instance, physical exercise as well as many nutrients and food substances with anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory properties have proven to lower the amount of A-beta in animal models and also lower inflammation. Some nutrients also improve neuronal cell signaling, lipid metabolism, and glucose metabolism and/or decrease oxidative stress.</p>
<p>This sort of evidence, together with numerous observational studies with a variety of human populations in different countries, has established that appropriate nutrition and physical activity are good candidates for helping reduce the risk of dementia, cognitive decline, and AD in humans. In 2010, gold-standard randomized clinical trials for integrated evidence-based nutrition programs had not yet been undertaken, and those for various forms of exercise had just begun. These kinds of lifestyle interventions are very difficult to get funded and then carry out, so scientists cannot yet say with certainty that the various lifestyles indicated by an array of other studies will be sufficient to delay the onset of cognitive symptoms or slow progression. However, scientists have already proven with certainty the link between nutrition, physical exercise, and certain other lifestyle factors to prevent, slow, or even reverse other related chronic diseases such as stroke, other cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and insulin resistance. Therefore, most researchers and clinicians are ready to recommend lifestyle approaches as these offer probable additional benefits to cognitive health. Lifestyle interventions are also of keen interest since, given the multiple decades of presymptomatic development of AD-related pathology, preventive interventions need to be safe and tolerable.</p>
<p>A growing body of research suggests that a variety of nutritional factors, social engagement, mental stimulation, physical exercise, complex activities incorporating multiple domains, and management of stress and depression all help preserve brain health. Managing both emotional and physical stress is important because heightened cortisol levels have been connected to cognitive decline as well as to faster rates of decline in persons with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> dementia. Moreover, research reports an association between cortisol levels, hippocampal shrinkage, and insulin resistance. Adequate sleep is also essential for a healthy brain, neuroplasticity, and memory. Music, art, acupuncture, T'ai Chi, meditation, and certain other spiritual practices, as well as having a meaning and purpose in life, also appear to enhance brain health. Many of these lifestyle factors are related to neuronal plasticity and the generation of new brain cells as well as prevention of deterioration of existing brain cells.</p>
<p>Research indicates some common factors for both cognitive and emotional health. Intervention studies indicate the independent and synergistic efficacy of nutrition, cognitive rehabilitation, physical exercise, and various alternative medicine practices in improving cognition, mood, and quality of life of persons who already live with AD or other memory or brain disorders. The challenge is in actually making behavioral changes to adopt these protective lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>Why Lifestyle Factors Are Important to Brain Health </strong></p>
<p>Epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of AD doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 (with 13% of individuals over the age of 65 having AD and about 40% over 85 years having AD). If lifestyle interventions can delay the onset of AD by 5 years, the prevalence of the disease would be halved, along with all the attendant human and financial costs.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that healthy brain tissue is better able to withstand the ravages of age, genetic vulnerabilities, environmental stresses, accidents, toxins, and disease. Further, healthy lifestyles help enhance and strengthen neurons, dendrites, and other body and brain cells.</p>
<p>Many studies, including gold-standard clinical trials in the case of many other chronic diseases, have suggested that a healthy lifestyle, especially with regard to nutrition and exercise, may help prevent and treat most human chronic diseases. Thus, healthy lifestyles are helpful to both the person with dementia and his or her care partners, who are at extra risk of depression and illness because of caregiving.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular health and normal glucose metabolism contribute to brain health, while the rise in obesity and other chronic illnesses has a direct negative impact on brain health. Dozens of studies have established that each vascular risk factor adds to the risk for AD and severity of dementia.</p>
<p>Diabetes and prediabetes increase the risk of cognitive decline, MCI and dementia, and, according to some scientists, AD in particular. Studies using imaging techniques in adults and teenagers show that diabetes, prediabetes, or abnormally high insulin resistance as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) shrinks the hippocampus, the major site for short-term memory and spatial memory, encoding of new information and experiences, as well as some aspects of emotional function. These findings should raise serious public health concerns because study results show that the hippocampi are already shrinking in obese teenagers with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as in middle-aged nondiabetic adults with insulin resistance. Cognitive impairments in nondiabetic adults were found to be associated with the degree of insulin resistance. Related memory impairments and related white-matter changes were observed in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels were reduced in adults with insulin resistance.</p>
<p>Inflammation is believed to play a key role in the etiology of AD and has been associated with an increased risk of AD. Existing inflammation, as well as inflammatory events such as infections, surgery, or heart attacks, hastens progression in people with AD. Oxidative stress also plays a key role in AD etiology, including increasing inflammation and oxidation of brain lipids. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction is part of AD etiology and relates to the energy systems within the brain cells.</p>
<p>In summary, whatever hurts the heart and blood vessels harms the brain. Problems with glucose metabolism and insulin levels also threaten the brain. The organ and disease silos are disintegrating, with increasingly similar clinical recommendations for better nutrition and exercise and for managing stress to treat or prevent a wide range of chronic diseases affecting nearly every organ in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Lifestyle Approaches for Cognitive Health </strong></p>
<p>Many leaders in the field of brain health believe that the evidence is already sufficient to suggest that regardless of personal risk factors, and with or without pharmacologic intervention, a healthful lifestyle is likely to reduce risk, delay onset, and slow the progression of AD and vascular dementia. Some of these researchers and clinicians conclude that the evidence suggests that it is the combination of vascular lesions (e.g., microstrokes or white-matter lesions) with <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> pathology that together result in symptoms of MCI and dementia. If these hypotheses are correct, then they offer another argument in favor of practicing healthy lifestyles to reduce cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Nutrition, physical exercise, and other lifestyle interventions work on multiple pathways to improve overall health in multiple organs with minimal or no side effects, even over many decades, which is important since scientists now believe that the pathology of AD--that is, the development of excess A-beta and abnormal phosphorylated tau--begins several decades before the appearance of cognitive symptoms.</p>
<p>Multiple lifestyle factors can have synergistic or additive effects. One of the most interesting trials involved the 2-year study of aged beagle dogs conducted by Carl Cotman's group at the University of California, Irvine, which showed that an enriched diet alone improved performance on a cognitive task from 25% in the control group to 67% of the experimental animals. A third group, with increased physical activity and social play, improved performance to 80%, while combining enriched diet and exercise-play interventions resulted in 100% of a fourth group of dogs being able to perform the difficult learning task.</p>
<p>Given the well-established connection between cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and diabetes and cognitive function and cognitive decline, and the evidence-based certainty that good nutrition, physical activity, and certain other lifestyle changes help treat or prevent these diseases, more and more people in the AD field have concluded that it is good clinical practice to recommend these healthy lifestyles to persons concerned about their brain health or who already have a diagnosis of MCI or dementia, including AD.</p>
<p><strong>Multidomain Lifestyle Study Under Way in Finland </strong></p>
<p>Many people in the field agree that the preventive intervention most likely to be effective will be multifaceted to be potent enough to delay the onset of AD or slow it down. There is one such multicenter randomized clinical trial under way in Finland, called the <strong>Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability</strong> (FINGER) Trial, under the leadership of Miia Kivipelto and funded by the Finnish government, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the national <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Association (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01041989). Persons between 60 and 77 years of age who are determined to be at increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia are randomized to a control group (standard health counseling at baseline) or to a preventive intervention for 2 years. The latter receive multidisciplinary treatment that includes nutritional guidance, physical exercise, cognitive training and social activity, and intensive monitoring and management of metabolic (e.g., diabetes) and vascular risk factors. Importantly, each intervention includes a coach to guide and encourage the implementation of each lifestyle change. In addition to cognitive end points, a variety of potential biomarkers are monitored in relationship to any cognitive change, including biochemical markers of inflammation or oxidation, hormones controlling blood sugars and fats, as well as brain imaging.</p>
<p>Dr. Kivipelto's study reflects the combined wisdom of many leaders in the field, including the International Academy of Nutrition and Aging. The FINGER study builds on more than a decade of research, suggesting the importance of each domain of this combined program. The collective findings of some of these studies are summarized in the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Selected Findings of Lifestyle Studies </strong></p>
<p>Observational studies have established that each of the following lifestyle behaviors may be independently related to a lower risk of dementia: (a) nutrition, (b) physical fitness, (c) social activities and social engagement, (d) organization memberships, (e) productive (meaningful) activities, (f) mental activities (e.g., reading, word spelling/recognition, numbers, and other games), and (g) management of stress. Several researchers, using meta-analyses, have concluded that the most potent activities are complex activities that involve multiple domains, especially activities that include physical activity and social interaction as well as cognitive challenge, such as dancing and golf. Examples of activities involving 2 domains are board or card games, knitting, gardening, T'ai Chi, chi gong or yoga, and doing exercise in a group. Complex and novel activities such as learning a new language, especially sign language, traveling to new places, and playing a musical instrument, especially a new one, are also particularly recommended.</p>
<p>A 2010 Institute of Medicine Consensus conference and a Cochrane review of certain lifestyle interventions for preserving cognitive health concluded that there was insufficient evidence on which to base clinical recommendations. The Cochrane reviews and the Institute of Medicine, however, used very strict criteria for acceptable clinical trials, and for physical exercise, they reviewed only a few clinical trials of very small size or pilot in nature, which were underpowered. Both panels tended to be overly conservative and looking backward rather than forward in a brand new research field where rigorous clinical trials were just beginning to be designed, funded, and reviewed and where, logically, these interventions might have their biggest impact in the preclinical or MCI stage of AD, where outcome measures are still under development. Most reviews also do not integrate the combined weight of observational studies with clinical trials in animal models of AD, which are the first phase of testing some of the factors observed in human longitudinal studies and of researching mechanisms of action. Nutritional trials, especially those with integrated complex nutritional programs, are difficult to design and gain adherence to, and physical exercise programs to some extent suffer the same challenges. Published randomized controlled trials in the nutrition field as of 2011 were limited to single substances or small groups of vitamins.</p>
<p>Nonetheless the body of evidence is growing rapidly.</p>
<p><em><strong>Nutrition </strong></em></p>
<p>One well-structured prospective study published in 2010 found that persons with the highest levels of all 8 forms of vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols) had half the risk of AD, whereas previous studies and intervention trials, less knowledgeable about the necessity of all forms of vitamin E in the brain and body, had looked at only <em>a</em>-tocopherol. This Karolinska Institutet (Sweden) study concluded that it was the combination of the 8 vitamin E forms that was important to brain health.</p>
<p>Various nutritional studies using animal models have shown the power of various single nutrients to lower A-beta levels, reduce oxidative stress, and improve cognitive function. Clinical trials of persons with MCI or AD have been few in number and show mixed results but some limited promise. A Swedish clinical trial of fish oil capsules using a daily dose of 1.7 mg of docosahexaenoic acid and 0.6 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (2 long-chain omega-3 fatty acids abundant in the human brain) reported preliminary results suggesting a slowing of cognitive decline in persons with early-stage AD. A larger trial of just algae-derived docosahexaenoic acid had no effect across all AD patients. One study of 3 B vitamins (B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, and folate) had no effect in persons with AD, but another using lower doses of the same 3 B vitamins improved cognition in people with MCI, but only in those with high homocysteine levels. These results suggest that while combination dietary programs may produce stronger effects on cognition than current pharmacological treatments for AD, single nutrients may be insufficient, and nutritional interventions may have more effect in MCI and very early-stage AD. Continued clinical research is needed.</p>
<p>Of greater interest for clinical study is combining multiple nutrients since the most recent observational studies have suggested that it is combinations of whole foods, such as in the Mediterranean or DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets, that really make a difference. A 2006 integrative review presents evidence of how various nutrients appear to work on the multiple different pathways leading to AD and/or dementia, including inflammation, oxidative stress, glucose or insulin abnormalities, levels of A-beta and tau, cell signaling, and mitochondrial dysfunction. A recent animal study showed that a combination of whole foods-based nutrients, including vegetable, fruit, and herb and spice nutrients combined with fish oil, appears to restore mitochondrial dysfunction in triply transgenic AD mice, and a clinical trial is now under way in healthy older adults. A series of pilot studies with both mice and humans conducted by Thomas Shea and colleagues have shown preliminary success in improving short-term memory and attention in both cognitively normal adults and patients with AD, with a novel combination of vitamins and nutrients: namely, vitamin E, folic acid, vitamin B12, <em>N</em>-acetyl-l-cysteine, acetyl-l-carnitine hydrochloride, and <em>S</em>-adenosylmethionine. These preliminary studies suggest an important focus for continued studies in nutrition and brain health.</p>
<p><em><strong>Physical Activity </strong></em></p>
<p>Most of the meta-analyses of physical activity that had less strict criteria for study inclusion than the Cochrane reviews reported consistently positive results, backing up the observational studies that had linked physical activity to reduced incidence of AD and slower rates of conversion from MCI to AD dementia. An array of intervention studies in healthy older adults, people with MCI, and people with early AD, all found evidence of decrease in the rates of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Animal studies have established that physical activity increases cognitive function and identified at least 2 newer mechanisms of action beyond the known cardiovascular mechanisms: (1) decrease in levels of A-beta in the brain and (2) increased amount and rates of neurogenesis, especially in the hippocampus. Human studies have established that people who exercise more have higher levels of hippocampal BDNF, a brain chemical related to neurogenesis. Increased serum BDNF levels have been correlated with larger hippocampi and better memory performance.</p>
<p>Kirk I. Erickson's randomized controlled study using magnetic resonance imaging as an outcome measure established that aerobic exercise (specifically 1 year of walking 3 times a week for 40 minutes) can increase the size of critical brain structures. Consistent with the expected 1% to 2% annual hippocampal loss in dementia-free seniors, the control group (which spent an equal amount of time stretching) lost about 1.4% volume in this brain region by the end of the 12-month trial. In contrast, the hippocampi of the walkers grew by roughly 2%. In addition, researchers found that greater elevations in serum BDNF were linked to greater gains in hippocampal volume.</p>
<p>The benefit of walking exercise seemed specific to the anterior part of the hippocampus (including the dentate gyrus). Similar effects did not appear in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, or posterior hippocampus. The dentate gyrus is the most metabolically active part of our brain and is involved in spatial memory, short-term memory, and new learning. Neurogenesis is most prominent in this part of the adult brain; many surmise that it is so because creation of new brain cells and dendritic connections is essential to the production of new memories.</p>
<p><em><strong>Meditation and Spiritual Practices </strong></em></p>
<p>Stress management and spiritual practices may also contribute to brain health. For example, a recent study using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in live human participants reported that persons participating in an 8-week mindfulness meditation program experienced measurable increases in the hippocampus regions associated with memory, sense of self, and empathy while reducing areas of the amygdala associated with stress. Numerous studies demonstrate that other spiritual practices such as forgiveness improve emotional and mental health. By relieving stress and depression and decreasing cortisol levels, such practices may also improve cognitive health.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cognitive Training, Cognitive Rehabilitation, and Cognitive-Kinetic Interventions </strong></em></p>
<p>With regard to cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation strategies to improve and preserve cognition, the evidence is particularly strong. Observational studies suggested that "use it or lose it" applies to keeping one's mind active. The groundbreaking ACTIVE randomized clinical trial study demonstrated that even short-term cognitive skills practice interventions had persistent effects in the healthy elderly. A number of later studies suggest that the most effective interventions combine modalities--for example, cognitive training with physical exercise and support groups.</p>
<p><em><strong>Multifaceted Relationship Between Physical Activity and Cognition </strong></em></p>
<p>In population and clinical studies, physical activity and exercise have been shown to have a positive effect on cognitive function in people of all ages. Recent studies have found that physical exercise stimulates a positive increase in executive control processes, including planning, scheduling, working memory, inhibitory processes, and multitasking. The impact of physical activity on cognitive abilities also continues through the entire lifespan. Physical exercise, for example, has been found to be a key facilitator in neurogenesis, particularly in the hippocampus as well as in other areas of the brain. In general, the rate of neurogenesis and other cognitive benefits is related to the intensity, novelty, and dose of physical activity and exercise. Both endurance (aerobic) and strength (resistance training) exercise benefit both cognitively intact and cognitively impaired individuals.</p>
<p>With regard to improvement in individuals with MCI and AD, substantial clinical trial evidence suggests that various cognitive rehabilitation and training strategies may help restore lost function and slow progression of cognitive decline. Different strategies appear to have more or less potent effects in only one area or in multiple areas. For example, a cognitive training strategy targeting episodic memory benefited only episodic memory. A more holistic strategy that combined physical movements based on kinetic/cognitive theory with cognitive training benefitted areas of attention, spatial abilities, language, memory executive functions, and daily functions. Arkin's pioneering study, initially published in 1999, found a combination of simultaneous physical exercise and conversation, and language practice and word games, interspersed with volunteer activity, particularly effective.</p>
<p><strong>Barriers to Adopting Lifestyle Initiatives </strong></p>
<p>There are several barriers to adopting lifestyle changes, including cultural and psychological barriers. Cultural challenges include the overdependence of the American health care system, and therefore of most individuals, on pharmaceuticals and surgery, which have limited preventive roles for many chronic diseases or could be more potent if combined with lifestyle changes. Perhaps the biggest challenge for implementing these interventions as standard clinical practice is financial. Generally, lifestyle interventions are not covered by most current health insurance plans, although the concept of health promotion and prevention of illness is starting to develop. For instance, because research has established that having a "coach" or personal trainer helps individuals make lasting lifestyle changes, some private insurers will supply a free "health coach" even if the actual interventions are not reimbursed.</p>
<p>To promote brain health, prescribed cognitive training and physical activity may be the modalities most likely to be recognized with some incentives. Nutrition for brain health promotion is not currently covered, although individuals with diagnoses may find some limited coverage for counseling with licensed nutritionists. For families working together to provide a healthier home environment for both a patient with brain disease and his or her care partners, one possible source of funding is the National Family Caregiver Support program, which can be accessed online at <a href="http://www.aoa.gov/prof/aoaprog/caregiver/caregiver.asp">http://www.aoa.gov/prof/aoaprog/caregiver/caregiver.asp</a>. Individuals who have long-term care policies also may be able to gain coverage for these services. The future major solutions lie in the realm of public health, public education, public policy, and research envisioned with the 2011 passage of the National <strong>Alzheimer's</strong> Project Act.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>4.2.0. Memory and Cognitive Impact of Foods</strong></p>
<p>Research is proceeding rapidly on the connection between diet, including individual nutrients, on memory and other aspects of our thinking.</p>
<p>Most of the research to date has examined how foods relate to memory and cognition. This research has consisted of either animal studies of specific foods or nutrients, or of epidemiological studies of large groups of people (which can show an association, but not prove a direct cause). These studies have explored the relationship between aspects of what we eat and the likelihood or risk of developing general cognitive problems, mild cognitive impairment (including of the amnestic type i.e. involving memory problems), any kind of dementia (i.e. problems in thinking in multiple areas serious enough to cause problems in daily life or work) or specific diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The mechanisms of action (for how specific foods might help or hurt the brain) identified to date appear to vary, and in the case of many whole foods, multiple actions could be working simultaneously (See for example, Emerson Lombardo NB et al. 2006, Sun AY et al 2008. Tian J et al 2010, Howes and Perry 2011, Williams RJ, 2011). Some ways specific foods could enhance brain health include increasing the availability of the memory neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain (apple juice, sage, Melissa, saffron) (e.g. by directly increasing production, slowing its metabolic breakdown, similar to the action of the cholinesterase inhibitors currently on the market), anti-oxidant and/or anti-inflammatory action, regulating amount of various forms of Abeta peptides, slowing or preventing oligomerization or fibrilization of the Abeta molecule (Wang 2008, Frydman-Marom, A.,2011), protecting omega-3 fatty acids in brain cell membranes or fatty acids, regulating blood sugar and insulin, and/or cholesterol, estrogenic effects that can be neuro-protective, promoting creation of new brain cells or connective parts, or slowing their destruction, improving neuronal signaling and synapse activity, restoring mitochondrial function (related to energy) of brain cells, and retarding tau pathology (the "other" problem protein in AD) (Green 2007) . This list is only partial!</p>
<p>The number of human clinical trials is still small but growing.</p>
<p>The body of evidence suggests a clear connection between foods, overall diet and our brain health, including memory and other cognitive skills such as attention and executive function (ability to organize and plan), and is growing each year.</p>
<p>This website and our brain healthy newsletters will keep you informed of this growing body of evidence.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<p>Several studies using various mouse models of Alzheimer's disease demonstrated the positive effects of a wide variety of food substances chosen for their believed health benefits such as strong anti-oxidant properties. Each food type may be comprised of thousands of nutrients. Foods tested that improved cognitive behaviors and/or lowered Abeta levels in TG mice include: apple juice, blueberries, spinach, strawberries, green tea, melatonin, DHA, plum juice, Concord grape juice, resveratrol, grape seed extract and others (Chan A et al, 2006, Rogers EJ et al.2004, Joseph JA. Et al. 1999, 2009, Lee JW, et al 2009, Mandel SA et al. 2011, Calon, F et al, 2004 and Green et al, 2007, Shukitt-Hale B et al, 2009, Shukitt-Hale B et al 2006, Lagouge, M., et al, 2006, Wang et al., 2008). Both almonds and walnuts helped Alzheimer transgenic mice perform better in cognitive tests and lowered levels of A-beta (Chauhan N et al. 2004, Muthaiyah B, et al, 2011 - no published citation for almonds- see continued work by Neelima Chauhan, PhD, of the University of Illinois-Chicago, as reported in 2005 by Society for Neuroscience. <a href="http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=news_111405">http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=news_111405</a>). An unrelated Indian study in aged rats reported almond paste reversed scopolamine-induced amnesia, reduced cholinesterase activity in the brain, and also significantly reduced cholesterol and triglycerides in these aged rats (Kulkarni KS, et al. 2010).</p>
<p>Epidemiological studies have also identified a long list of brain healthy foods. More recently, innovative studies have begun to identify GROUPS of foods that appear to reduce risk of cognitive decline and onset of dementia, MCI or Alzheimer's disease, such as foods typical of the Mediterranean diet (Féart, C et al 2009, Gu Y, et al 2009, Scarmeas N et al., 2006, 2009a, 2009b, or the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet (LINK <a href="http://dashdiet.org/dash_diet_book.asp?google&amp;gclid=CMDj8qOMsq0CFUTc4Aodvz0FlQ">http://dashdiet.org/dash_diet_book.asp?google&amp;gclid=CMDj8qOMsq0CFUTc4Aodvz0FlQ</a> ) (see unpublished study led by Heidi Wengreen, RD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Nutrition at Utah State University).</p>
<p>Combination supplement studies are also gaining interest. Professor Thomas Shea, Ph.D., Director of the Cellular Neurobiology and Neurodegeneration Research Centerat U Mass Lowell (<a href="http://www.uml.edu/research_labs/Cellular_Neurobiology/Staff.html">http://www.uml.edu/research_labs/Cellular_Neurobiology/Staff.html</a> ) is examining, first in mice and now in humans with and without memory impairments, a combination of certain B vitamins, amino acids and anti-oxidants, with some encouraging results. Another study led by Jon Valla in Arizona uses a combination of fruit and vegetable powers, anti-inflammatory spices and herbs, and fish oil, yielding some positive results in TG mice. A similar combination with the addition of vitamin D is currently undergoing a pilot Phase I clinical trial with healthy older adults at Boston University. Also, Nutricia, a subsidiary of the French Danone Company, is pursuing human clinical trials in both Europe and the US, of Souvenaid® (<a href="http://souvenaid.com/">http://souvenaid.com/</a>) a combination of neuron building substrates identified (and patented) by Dr. Richard Wurtman at MIT, together with anti-oxidant isolated vitamins (Kamphuis and Scheltens, 2010), featured at a company sponsored symposium at MIT (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fighting-alzheimers.html">http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/fighting-alzheimers.html</a>). The consumer needs to be aware of the differences between medical foods such as Souvenaid, and nutritional supplements such as "Great Mind, as the rules of evidence and FDA regulations are different. The Alzheimer's Forum engaged in an excellent discussion of this topic in 2009, <a href="http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2258">http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2258</a></p>
<p>A Swedish placebo-controlled clinical trial using fish oil containing both DHA and EPA reported that fish oil appeared to slow cognitive decline only in a few persons with early stage Alzheimer's disease. In persons with mid stage disease the main positive effect was to reverse weight loss, which can be a serious problem in some people (Freund-Levi Y. et al, 2006). A larger, more recent clinical trial of just DHA derived from algae, in persons with AD, reported no significant effect on cognition; however the trial neglected to include EPA, the more highly anti-inflammatory long chain Omega 3 which, in nature, usually occurs in conjunction with DHA and which humans typically consume (and synthesize) along with DHA. Since other AD research has established that AD has an inflammatory aspect to its etiology, we believe that EPA may prove to be as important as DHA in its treatment and prevention. Also, psychiatric and attention-deficit disorders research has established that EPA rather than DHA appears to be the active long chain Omega 3 in achieving the desired treatment effect. See for example Jazayeri S, 2008 (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18247193">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18247193</a> ) and work by Andew Stoll, MD (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Omega-3-Connection-Groundbreaking-Anti-depression-Program/dp/0684871386">http://www.amazon.com/Omega-3-Connection-Groundbreaking-Anti-depression-Program/dp/0684871386</a>) and Ned Hollowell, MD. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delivered-Distraction-Getting-Attention-Disorder/dp/034544230X">http://www.amazon.com/Delivered-Distraction-Getting-Attention-Disorder/dp/034544230X</a>).</p>
<p>Cinnamon helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar, is a potent anti-oxidant (see ORAC chart...link) and is anti-inflammatory, and thus through these 4 pathways is thought to be positive for brain health. A January 2011 publication of an animal study (transgenic mice and flies) by a group of Israeli scientists suggests that cinnamon may also have a positive direct brain effect - cinnamon helps retard the development of Alzheimer's pathology by preventing the oligomerization ("clumping") of single Abeta molecules, leading to toxic forms that kill brain cells (Frydman-Marom A). To learn more, see our newsletter on the topic (Link to Cinnamon newsletter CHANGE THIS TO NEW WEBSITE POSITION <a href="http://healthcareinsights.net/home/newsletter-2011/august-2011-newsletter/">http://healthcareinsights.net/home/newsletter-2011/august-2011-newsletter/</a>). Grape seed extract also prevents or slows oligomerization and fibrilization.</p>
<p>A proof of concept RCT in 12 older adults with MCI found significant improvements in one test of memory (verbal learning) in the 6 randomized to drinking Concord Grape Juice for 12 weeks (Krikorian R et al 2010).</p>
<p>Three small pilot randomized controlled studies of three different spices/herbs in Alzheimer's patients, all led by the same medical researcher in Iran, all published in reputable peer-reviewed journals, suggested positive effects in slowing cognitive decline compared to placebo (sage and lemon balm, also known as melissa) or slowing at same rate as a current prescription drug, without the usual gastro-intestinal side effects (saffron). (See Akhondzadeh, S. et al. 2003a, 2003b, 2010)</p>
<p>Diets high in sugar and/or saturated fats appear to be harmful for the brain. A preclinical study in AD transgenic mice demonstrated that simply spiking water with 10% sugar (while offering same healthy mouse chow to two groups of identical, randomized mice) resulted in speedier cognitive decline of the mice drinking the sugared water, higher levels of Abeta in the brain, and abnormal cholesterol levels. Cao D et al. 2007, Suzanne Craft group's proof of concept randomized clinical trial in 50 older adults for just 1 month demonstrated that a high glycemic index, high saturated/high fat diet, compared to a low glycemic, low saturated fat/low fat diet, resulted in significantly worse cognitive performance (using a visual memory test), and undesirable changes in levels of Abeta in cerebral spinal fluid. (Bayer-Carter JL et al. 2011).</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association comments on the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. The Alzheimer's Association is committed to ensuring that the full potential of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) is realized, and we stand ready to support the successful implementation of the law. Founded in 1980, the Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.</p>
<p>Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and 15.2 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top 10 in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Currently, there are no survivors. Alzheimer's kills more Americans than diabetes, and more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. Individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias are high consumers of hospital, nursing home, and long-term care services. Average per person Medicare costs for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias are nearly three times higher and Medicaid spending is 19 times higher than for those without these conditions. Care for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias is estimated to cost Medicare and Medicaid $140 billion this year alone. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment. Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, Alzheimer's impact on our country will grow year by year. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the escalating cost of care will reach $1.1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). Costs to Medicare and Medicaid are estimated to increase nearly 500 percent over this period.</p>
<p>However, this does not need to be our future. If the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure through the National Alzheimer's Plan, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years (similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease) would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050.<sup>2</sup> Similarly, profound advances can be achieved through improvements to Alzheimer's care quality and effectiveness and through improved supports for individuals with Alzheimer's and their families. The challenge and the potential promise of the National Alzheimer's Plan is our opportunity to change the trajectory of this heartbreaking disease.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association is pleased the important strengths contained within the Draft Framework were preserved in this initial draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan. As was the case with the Framework, this first draft is comprehensive in scope, addressing many of the issues that are critically important to the Alzheimer's community. We do see key opportunities to further strengthen this draft plan prior to its next iteration. The Association's comments address specific areas to fortify; for instance, palliative care and transportation issues, which are particularly important for the one in seven Americans with Alzheimer's who live alone.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>In addition to the specific comments that follow, the Alzheimer's Association would like to emphasize several broader themes.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong>:<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly urges that the National Alzheimer's Plan build on the momentum of the Administration's recent, commendable action on Alzheimer's research funding by indicating in the plan the full scale and scope of research funding required to achieve the Administration's goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. To this end, we believe recent work by leading Alzheimer's researchers to be available in April 2012 will provide a very solid foundation for these projections.<sup>4</sup> As we previously noted in our comments submitted for the Draft Framework, we believe that the firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones are needed, the Department is to be commended for including a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently-needed treatment advances.</p>
<p><strong>Economic burden</strong>:<br />
					The bipartisan, unanimously passed National Alzheimer's Project Act calls for the identification of priority actions to reduce the economic impact of Alzheimer's disease on the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as on American families, while improving health outcomes. In addition to the estimated $140 billion in Medicare and Medicaid costs this year, families caring for people with this heartbreaking disease will still incur high out-of-pocket costs for care -- an estimated $33.8 billion in 2012. Given the high costs of adult day centers, assisted living facilities and nursing home care, and the duration of the disease, individuals affected by Alzheimer's will often deplete their savings and assets, and ultimately come to rely on Medicaid for assistance. Though the theme of better health outcomes is present in several places in this draft, the attention to addressing the economic burden is, in our judgment, insufficient. The distinct financial burdens of Alzheimer's disease were a pervasive theme among the more than 40,000 Americans who participated in the Alzheimer's Association public input process on the National Alzheimer's Plan last year. We urge this be directly addressed in the next draft.</p>
<p><strong>Public health</strong>:<br />
					While we applaud the draft plan's emphasis on strengthening the Aging Network to deal with the burden of Alzheimer's disease, it does little to frame Alzheimer's as a top national public health challenge and to engage the full resources of the public health community at the federal, state and local levels. In this regard, the draft can draw from an important and encouraging trend in leading states where the public health network has been actively evaluating the burden of Alzheimer's. It also can draw from important work developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assessing the public health dimensions of Alzheimer's. The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact. Complementing the strong emphasis on the Aging Network by highly engaging the CDC in the National Alzheimer's Plan will ensure Alzheimer's is addressed as a public health priority.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong>:<br />
					It would be difficult to overstate just how critical we believe Strategy 5B, "Monitor Progress on the National Plan," is to securing important outcomes in the first year of the plan's implementation. We urge this monitoring be done in a timely, transparent way to ensure accountability for both the implementation of action steps and the meaningfulness of this activity. This is important for several reasons. First, this transparency is a clear expectation of Congress as expressed in and embedded throughout the statute (P.L. 111-375). Second, this is necessary for the Advisory Council if the Council is to fulfill its obligation under the law to meaningfully report directly to Congress and to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on an annual basis. Finally, it is a fundamental expectation of the Alzheimer's community. Accountability is a precondition for the successful pursuit of all that follows throughout the plan.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments</strong><br />
					The following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and actions as outlined in the <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, research funds must increase to the Alzheimer's research community's recommendation of $2 billion in order to achieve this goal.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong></em>.<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes it is good to set and update priorities by garnering outside input. We also believe in addition to the National Institute on Aging (NIA), all Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that are funding Alzheimer's research should be an integral part of this planning process, including the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). We look forward to additional details as to how the priority setting activities will feed through to the peer review process so suitable funds are recommended for appropriate studies, and how the planning process will inform decision-making across the entire NIH and not just the NIA. We also look forward to a detailed research plan and timeline for activities soon following the May Summit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.3: Regularly update the National Plan and refine Goal 1 strategies and action items based on feedback and input</strong></em><br />
					In addition to informing the implementation of the National Alzheimer's Plan with feedback from the Alzheimer's Research Summit and the Request for Information (RFI), HHS and its federal partners should also seek input from the public and experts in the field when regularly updating the plan.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.4: Convene a scientific workshop on other dementias in 2013</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the National Alzheimer's Plan for addressing other dementias, in keeping with the intent of P.L. 111-375.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.5: Update research priorities and milestones</strong></em><br />
					The Advisory Council meeting should be held each year at a time most relevant to informing the President's annual budget for Alzheimer's research.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.1: Expand research to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, and translate this information into potential targets for intervention</strong></em><br />
					The development of effective treatments that can delay, prevent and treat Alzheimer's will require a significant investment in our basic understanding of the disease. It will be critical that basic science receive sufficient funds to ensure adequate fundamental knowledge of the disease. To make this action meaningful and effective, the plan must include additional details on how this important research will be prioritized and expanded, what networks and mechanisms will be used to expedite translation of the basic science, and what level of funding will be committed in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes that increasing enrollment in clinical trials is critical to developing new treatments and eventually overcoming Alzheimer's disease. Groundbreaking research that could have a substantial impact on individuals with the disease now and in the future is significantly slowed by a lack of volunteers for Alzheimer's clinical trials. Recruiting and retaining trial participants is now the greatest obstacle, other than funding, to developing the next generation of Alzheimer's treatments. We believe HHS can expand registries through the promotion of existing Alzheimer's disease clinical trial matching services such as the Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch service.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch is a free service that makes it easy for people with Alzheimer's, caregivers, families and physicians to locate clinical trials based on personal criteria (diagnosis, stage of disease) and location. The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch lets interested individuals search trials quickly and easily, and narrows results to those trials where there is a reasonable chance to be accepted for enrollment, saving time for both the participant and the researcher.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.4: Monitor and identify strategies to increase enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies</strong></em><br />
					Monitoring enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies should not be limited to the NIH. Tracking race and ethnicity should also be encouraged in the outreach recommended in Action 1.B.3. This tracking should also be done by the private sector.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong></em><br />
					The Association encourages greater specificity regarding the intent of this action as the norm in drug development is for clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions to be conducted by private industry. Although there is a government role in clinical development of non-proprietary interventions, we urge care be taken not to divert resources to areas already well covered by private industry at a time when research resources for Alzheimer's are stretched so thin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong></em><br />
					While there have been great strides in the use of imaging and biofluids biomarkers over the last several years, to ensure this action is successful, significant research is still needed and will require a substantial investment. This action should also require assembling and maintaining a large cohort of subjects in all stages of the disease, including preclinical.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong></em><br />
					Collaborations must include multi-disciplinary partners, including experts in clinical care, epidemiology, and public health. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be an active participant in these collaborations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.1: Inventory Alzheimer's disease research investments</strong></em><br />
					The research ontology is an important classification system that provides a framework for collective portfolio analysis and introduces opportunities for coordinated strategic planning and initiatives among partner organizations and research funders. The Association was pleased to work with the NIA on this important project and is looking forward to the possibilities of having a global view of what Alzheimer's research is being conducted.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.2: Expand international outreach to enhance collaboration</strong></em><br />
					As a global leader in Alzheimer's research, the Alzheimer's Association operates in a spirit of inclusiveness, seeking partnerships throughout the scientific community to propel the field of Alzheimer's research forward. In addition to connecting with the countries listed in the Action, connecting with established international organizations, such as Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI), would be valuable. We look forward to additional details on how the information gathered from this meeting will be turned into additional action plans and new research partnerships.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong></em><br />
					This Action should also include a review of regulatory science needs, biomarker qualification, clinical trial infrastructure barriers, new or adaptive clinical trial design and guidance on designing/approving prevention or disease-modifying trials. In addition to NIH, FDA and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), the consultation list should include private and non-profit funders of Alzheimer's research as well as the Department of Defense (DoD). A well-defined timeline for meetings and an action plan for this group should be established to ensure accountability and progress.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association encourages the Secretary of HHS, the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense to work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities. This may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.3: Educate the public about the latest research findings</strong></em><br />
					The CDC's Healthy Aging Program, specifically the Healthy Brain Initiative (HBI), is an important example of their role in educating the public about the latest research findings connected to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association appreciates the Administration's announcement that $6 million will be dedicated over two years for provider education and outreach. While the $6 million is a great first step, we urge the Administration to dedicate additional funds for this endeavor to be successful.</p>
<p>To begin work under this area, the Association recommends targeted outreach to various provider groups. We believe HHS should promote an understanding of dementia among health care providers through a variety of mechanisms including the development of guidelines and quality measures. Once these guidelines are created, the development of online training modules would be most efficient. Additionally, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so care can be evaluated. Assisted living facilities should be added to the list of settings where high-quality care should be provided.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly supports a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained to understand the complexities of dementia will help ensure individuals with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system.</p>
<p>While the Association applauds the efforts outlined in the plan, we are concerned that the education component within this strategy may be limited. Many individuals with Alzheimer's disease enter the health care system through their primary care provider. To reach this target population, we encourage the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to play a major role in educational outreach, particularly to the Medicare provider community. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed with individuals and their caregivers after a diagnosis such as managing dementia with other chronic illnesses and referrals to existing community supports and services. CMS could partner with relevant stakeholders, such as the Alzheimer's Association, to develop resources to share with providers. Providers' education should also include guidance on the appropriateness and benefits of palliative and end-of-life care services, such as hospice, for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. This effort should include how and when providers should discuss the issue with the individual and their representative.</p>
<p>We also encourage the plan to address educating physicians and other health care providers on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often providers do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing providers, a lack of training on the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delays detection of cognitive impairment and diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that state and local public health departments should be included in this action item. The public health community is very good at educating health care providers. There are a number of evidence-based interventions for educating providers in a variety of settings that can be applied to Alzheimer's disease. We encourage HHS to support the necessary infrastructure to help state and local departments offer this type of education in public health settings.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</strong></em><br />
					Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties, particularly those that care for people with dementia, should be expanded.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong></em><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the development of quality indicators. HHS should promote existing evidence-based guidelines and curricula. Where unavailable, HHS should work with relevant stakeholders who have developed evidence-based quality care guidelines, such as the <em>Alzheimer's Association's Dementia Care Practice Recommendations</em>, which incorporate the latest research and field evidence. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p>In addition, the Alzheimer's Association urges HHS to ensure that content within the proposed clearinghouse is current and easily accessible.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce</strong></em><br />
					Section 6121 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that all certified nursing aides (CNAs) that work in nursing homes receive training on care for persons with dementia. As implementation of this provision progresses, the Association urges CMS to include a mechanism that ensures any recommended education materials are fully understood and absorbed. Further, CMS should publically establish the survey guidelines that will accompany this new requirement to ensure CNAs are appropriately trained.</p>
<p>The Association would like to see the plan also recommend that all direct care workers, including those in assisted living facilities and home- and community-based settings, be required to meet a similar standard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong></em><br />
					HHS should coordinate with states to develop Alzheimer's disease coordinators and workforces in state and local public health departments that will develop and implement Alzheimer's disease strategies. Strategies may include early detection and diagnosis campaigns, provider education campaigns, surveillance work, implementation of state Alzheimer's disease plans, and other essential public health services. HHS should also work with Aging Network staff to recognize the warning signs of dementia and be trained to assist individuals and their families when they seek appropriate medical care for detection and diagnosis.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong></em><br />
					To continue connecting families and people with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease to Alzheimer's-capable resources and meet growing demand, the Administration on Aging's (AoA) National Alzheimer's Call Center will require additional funding. The National Alzheimer's Call Center provides 24-hour, 7 day a week, year-round telephone support, crisis counseling, care consultation, and information and referral services in 140 languages for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their family members and informal caregivers. Trained professional staff and master's-level mental health professionals are available at all times. Since 2003, the National Alzheimer's Call Center has served more than 2 million people in the community. Additionally, it is important to note that the Alzheimer's Disease Centers, funded by NIA, are only available to certain areas of the country. As such, we urge HHS to include a solution in the final plan to ensure areas without resources have access to assistance, such as the Call Center.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. As discussed, the ACA created the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) which includes the detection of cognitive impairment. To enhance the AWV, the Association believes the CDC should revise the model Health Risk Assessment (HRA), which is part of the AWV, to include questions about memory and other indicators of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>We also recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection in a clinical setting in addition to the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. While the draft plan refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is important to emphasize detection of cognitive impairment as the precursor to a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.C.1: Educate physicians and other healthcare providers about accessing long-term services and supports and Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes health care providers should be educated about available supports for newly-diagnosed individuals and their caregivers to provide better counsel through this difficult disease. This should include information medical and non-medical supports and services. Further, the Association believes Medicare should cover a visit in which a health care provider discusses current and future care planning, with the caregiver, with or without the beneficiary present, to ensure families receive vital information to navigate this difficult disease. The Alzheimer's Association stands ready and willing to partner with HHS to develop a list of appropriate resources to share with the provider community. In fact, our chapters are currently conducting outreach on the local level to make providers aware of the available supports in their own community.</p>
<p>As stated in the Association's <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em>, at least 800,000 individuals with Alzheimer's disease live alone and as many as half do not have an identifiable caregiver. We strongly encourage HHS to further develop assistance for this particularly vulnerable population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</em></strong><br />
					While developing dementia care guidelines and measures, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so that care can be evaluated. In addition, the guidelines should include criteria and provisions for quality palliative and end-of-life care, including hospice care.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to build on existing quality initiatives, such as the Alzheimer's Association's <em>Campaign for Quality Residential Care</em>, which takes a person-centered approach and covers the basics of good care in six areas. The Association supports the development of additional quality measures and evidence-based care guidelines, and can serve as a resource in this effort.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.E.1: Evaluate the effectiveness of medical home models for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					While the medical home model holds promise, these models of care would need to be flexible to accommodate the specific needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, as they may require additional time and services to be effective for the Alzheimer's community. Moreover, it is recommended that care coordination designed specifically for Alzheimer's disease be highlighted for evaluation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, models should focus on aspects that seem to be particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices. Due to the nature of Alzheimer's disease, coaches and telephone disease management may not be particularly effective for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					Acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners to facilitate greater safety for people with the disease.</p>
<p>While it is critical to identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's disease, there should be similar action on identifying and disseminating models of safety to be used by nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other residential care settings. Additionally, there should be similar action on this for emergency personnel and first responders.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong></em><br />
					Most notably absent from the discussion of improving care transitions is the importance of making a documented diagnosis in an individual's medical record. Further, an individual should have a list of relevant medications documented in their medical record, especially prior to any care transition. The use of electronic medical records may also facilitate the availability of this information and should be explored particularly in the context of safer care transitions for patients with dementia.</p>
<p>Some individuals have behavioral problems related to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, appropriate community mental health services should be developed to include systems that strengthen the care needs of individuals with behavioral disturbances.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.1: Review evidence on care coordination models for people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					As mentioned in Action 2.E.1, the focus of these models should include aspects of the models are particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.2: Implement and evaluate care coordination models</em></strong><br />
					Individuals with Alzheimer's disease who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid are likely to use more health care services and have less desirable outcomes without quality care coordination. For example, people with serious medical conditions and Alzheimer's or another dementia are more likely to be hospitalized than those with the same medical conditions but no Alzheimer's or dementia.</p>
<p>Initially, the evaluation of these integrated models of care should be weighted towards effective care coordination, rather than cost-savings, since individuals may have increased access to services that didn't have before. This is especially important when considering cost increases, which may occur in Medicaid services since individuals with Alzheimer's may not have had previous access to long-term care services and supports due to long waiting lists and state fiscal constraints.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.H.1: Create a taskforce to improve care for these specific populations</em></strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan must identify specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support</strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers. Often, financial barriers prevent families from accessing the support they need to provide care for their loved one. Although there are a number of strategies and actions to address support for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families, the plan does not clearly address additional funding for respite care -- whether it be in day centers or within the home.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</em></strong><br />
					As HHS considers which agencies, federal departments, and state and local networks to distribute materials, it should also consider including the CDC's Healthy Aging Program.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</em></strong><br />
					In addition to developing more services, the Alzheimer's Association believes existing services to support caregivers should be promoted, supported, and expanded. Furthermore, while this action mentions respite care, it does so only in terms of providing referrals and does not include increased funding so that families can access such services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</em></strong><br />
					HHS should look for ways to promote the National Alzheimer's Call Center and its services as a crisis resource for caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.C.1: Examine awareness of long-term care needs and barriers to planning for these needs and Action 3.C.2: Expand long-term care awareness efforts</em></strong><br />
					We encourage the plan to consider addressing all aspects of long-term care, including financial planning, driving, and safety issues. Increasing the awareness of future care planning could help individuals and their families address challenges earlier and help avoid crises later.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to examine the barriers to long-term care, which may include studying the availability and impact of long-term care insurance as people with Alzheimer's disease, particularly those with younger-onset, may face unique challenges when trying to purchase insurance.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					The education of legal professionals should be expanded to include other entities in the legal system, including law enforcement, first responders, prosecutors, and judges.</p>
<p>Broader awareness of Alzheimer's disease may help prevent or reduce arrests of individuals with Alzheimer's who are charged with crimes for which they have no intent, such as unintentional trespassing. Further, it may help legal professionals and first responders to spot abuse -- physical and non-physical -- against people with the disease. In addition, State Adult Protective Service (APS) agencies are overburdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire of circumstances. We encourage the plan to address the need for additional resources dedicated to protecting the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Finally, the plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. We hope that the plan considers guidance for legal professionals seeking to balance autonomy and individual safety.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong></em><br />
					Individuals living with dementia may experience behavioral and psychotic symptoms (BPSD) during the course of their disease due to the alterations in processing, integrating and retrieving new information that accompanies dementia. Non-pharmacologic approaches should be tried as a first-line alternative to pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of BPSD. The Association recommends training and education for both professional and family caregivers on psychosocial interventions. Further, we recommend the plan call for similar monitoring and reporting in assisted living facilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</em></strong><br />
					At least 800,000 Americans with Alzheimer's disease live alone. Compared to those with Alzheimer's who live with someone else, on average, people with Alzheimer's who live alone are more likely to live in poverty and require assistance performing tasks such as managing money, shopping, traveling, housekeeping, preparing meals and taking medications correctly. We encourage HHS to explore affordable housing models that will allow this unique population to live safely within their communities.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Action 4.A.1: Design and conduct a national education and outreach initiative</em></strong><br />
					The public awareness campaign in Action 4.A.1 must be culturally-sensitive and reach those in underserved locations.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress</strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government.</p>
<p>At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), coordinated by the CDC. Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they can adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.1: Identify major policy research needs and Action 5.A.2: Identify needed changes or additions to data</em></strong><br />
					The CDC has been a leader in incorporating measures of cognitive health into other population health monitoring efforts. The CDC Healthy Aging Program has worked on identifying databases, worked with partners to add questions on cognitive impairment and caregiving to the BRFSS and added questions on cognitive impairment to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) The CDC is currently analyzing data from these datasets as they become available. In particular, BRFSS data are unique and allow for state- and local-level data that can highlight the needs of diverse populations in the United States.</p>
<p>The CDC Healthy Aging Program developed a 10-question BRFSS module on Perceived Cognitive Impairment. Twenty-two states included the module on their state BRFSS in 2011 and an additional 16 states are including the module in 2012 for a total of 38 states, including the District of Columbia. The CDC Healthy Aging Program is working with partners, including states, to expand the module in 2013 to all 50 states. They are also producing reports and publications regarding these data to inform decision-makers about the perceived impact of cognitive impairment at the state and local levels.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.3: Make needed improvements to data</em></strong><br />
					Using data to improve and track progress is essential and we commend its inclusion in the draft plan. This critical information should be publically available, as well as to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (preclinical through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.1: Designate responsibility for action implementation</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the intent to designate responsibility for each action step. However, we urge designation of individual accountable for each action, rather than simply a "contact person."</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.2: Track plan progress</em></strong><br />
					Tracking on plan progress as described in this action step should be provided to the public on no less than a quarterly basis. In general, we urge that the reporting on progress regarding each action be paired with greater clarity and specificity regarding desired outcomes than has been provided in the draft plan.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.3: Update the National Plan annually</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association urges that updates to the plan be done with the same transparency and opportunities for comment that has characterized the formulation of this initial National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:<br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan should allow us, for the first time to answer this simple question: <em>Did we make satisfactory progress in the fight against Alzheimer's disease?</em> For too many individuals living with Alzheimer's and their families, the system has failed them, and today we are unnecessarily losing the battle against this devastating disease. A successful National Alzheimer's Plan offers us the opportunity to change that, and set a new trajectory for this rapidly expanding global epidemic through American leadership.</p>
<p>As we all know, a plan accomplishes nothing without thorough and effective implementation that is coupled with transparency and accountability for those actions. The Alzheimer's Association looks forward to a final National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, will help to build the strongest possible National Alzheimer's Plan to overcome the escalating burden of Alzheimer's disease on American families.</p>

<p>We appreciate the opportunity to offer our input on this important project.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) congratulates the Advisory Council of the National Alzheimer's Project on the creation of the draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (the draft plan). The draft plan is a major step forward in meeting the current and future challenges posed by progressive neurological diseases for the benefit of all who are affected by these devastating illnesses.</p>
<p>AFTD is honored to offer our input on behalf of the thousands of Americans living and working with frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), a group of clinical disorders resulting from a progressive loss of neurons in the frontal and/or temporal lobes of the brain. AD and FTD are related by pathological inclusions, often called neurofibrillary tangles, of the essential brain protein tau but differ in many critical ways. Memory loss, the characteristic symptom of AD, is rare in FTD and, when it does occur, is most often seen only during the later stages of FTD. The initial presentation of FTD can comprise a mix of symptoms, including: changes in behavior and personality diminished cognitive and executive functioning, language and communication problems, as well as motor impairments similar to those found in ALS or Parkinson's disease. FTD progresses unpredictably but inevitably results in complete dependence on medical care to sustain life during the final stages of the disease.</p>
<p>The average age of disease onset in FTD is in the late 50's, about a decade earlier than in AD. This difference poses special challenges shared only by the small percentage of people with the early-onset form of AD. Accessing insurance and finding appropriate health care for a debilitating neurological disease is a tremendous challenge for people under the age of retirement. Furthermore, the stigma associated with cognitive symptoms like dementia for people in their 40's-60's combined with a lack of public and professional awareness of FTD can create an overwhelming sense of isolation for people and families coping with FTD.</p>
<p>As an organization whose mission is devoted exclusively to this "related dementia", we believe that the inclusion of language in the draft plan explicitly addressing the distinct challenges posed by FTD and the related dementias will enable the proposed Actions and Strategies to better meet the needs of those affected by a non-Alzheimer's neurological disease. We strongly urge HHS to solicit input from experts and members of non-Alzheimer's disease communities and to specifically include such individuals as members of the task force detailed by Action 2.H.1 under Strategy 2.H.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevention and Treatment by 2025. </strong></p>
<p>AD and FTD are related through a shared underlying pathology. This connection offers exciting research prospects with enormous potential for AD and FTD patients alike. Therapeutic compounds that target the protein tau could have equally effective application for treating both diseases. FTD offers pharmaceutical companies opportunities for drug development not available with AD, such as a larger number of cases related to identified mutations on a small number of genes and a regulatory status to facilitate progress toward clinical drug trials. It is our sincere hope that the draft plan will stimulate aggressive efforts to exploit this point of mutual interest for the sake of both FTD and AD patients and their families.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></p>
<p>The primary obstacle to the efficient delivery of high-quality care for FTD in any professional setting is the overwhelming lack of qualified providers experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of FTD. Obtaining a diagnosis of FTD often takes several years, an amount of time equal to ¼ or more of the total life expectancy for some patients, and like AD a definitive diagnosis is still only obtainable by autopsy. Ambiguity in diagnosis during the life of the patient complicates care, clinical trial recruitment, financial planning and all other aspects of coping with a neurodegenerative disease of any kind. Reliable diagnoses that accurately differentiate AD from FTD and all other related diseases would benefit everyone. Once diagnosed, the only professional care available to those with FTD is by providers who advertise services with phrases like "Memory Care" or "Dementia Services" that are intended for people with AD. Some who have FTD, especially people in their 50's or 60's, fail to realize that such resources even apply to them since they do not have memory problems and dementia is widely perceived as a condition that affects only senior citizens. In order to measure and improve care for people affected by FTD any quality improvement tool developed through the draft plan must include data, information, and content addressing the scarcity of professional expertise and knowledge of FTD and recognize the enormous challenge patients and families face in accessing appropriate healthcare services that is not experienced by most of those with AD.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expanded Support for Patients and Caregivers </strong></p>
<p>Due to the earlier average age of disease onset relative to AD, FTD is more likely to strike people who are still employed and raising a family and inevitably deprives them of their ability to function in either a professional or private capacity. FTD robs families of a parent, and makes experienced professionals incapable of successfully concluding a career. The paucity of public awareness and scarcity of professional expertise can combine with the debilitating symptoms of FTD and throw entire families into personal, financial, and legal turmoil prior to diagnosis. Thus magnifying the impact of FTD on not only the healthcare system, but all other social and legal systems well beyond what is expected of a rare disease. Currently the main source of support for FTD patients and caregivers is extended families, close friends, and perhaps most importantly, other FTD caregivers. The need for strategies and action to expand support for patients and caregivers around the unique challenges posed by FTD is desperate.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Public awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p>AFTD respectfully submits that without language explicitly describing the differences between the etiology, demographics and symptoms of FTD and AD, and the distinct challenges these differences impose on patients, caregivers, and the health care system as a whole, the draft plan will not successfully attain this goal for stakeholders involved with FTD. When FTD is subsumed under the phrase "related disorders" critical distinctions are lost, promoting the mistaken belief that dementia is a disease synonymous with AD rather than a symptom with a variety of causes. This, in turn, leads many healthcare professionals across all settings to treat people as if they have AD regardless of their actual diagnosis and provide them with inappropriate care which may even cause harm. Furthermore, when families and patients fail to respond as expected to the inappropriate care they receive they are too often denied care entirely rather than offered alternatives, exacerbating the sense of helplessness and the stigma that is all too common in those diagnosed with FTD. Unless more explicit attention is given to how FTD, and other neurological diseases differ from AD any increase in public awareness and engagement achieved through the draft plan will fail to fully benefit patients, families and caregivers coping with FTD and other neurological disease beside AD.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improved data infrastructure. </strong></p>
<p>Any data infrastructure created as part of the draft plan needs to be designed to include fields, criteria, and values specific to the impact of FTD, and other non-Alzheimer's diseases, on patients, families, and healthcare systems, if it is to benefit those with a neurological disease besides AD.</p>

<p>Caregiver support: comment/recommendations for a caregiver "proxy" for specific recurring elements/items to obtain AZ care and/or documentation of services. For example, there is a service here in Maryland (maybe all states - but I never utilized it until I moved here). For a fee (that is well worth it) the service is automobile title/tax documentation and filing. This title service obtains the necessary information from the owner of the vehicle and then completes the necessary processes at the title/courthouse to research title, complete documents and file the title.</p>
<p>Something similar could/should be offered to caregivers. They lose many hours from their own work/family/life spending hours dealing with the mandatory documentation/filing/provider visits - Insurance, Medicare, SSI, finances.</p>
<p>Improvements could be gained through informatics and digitalization of records and bioscreen/markers. Obtain information from AZ healthcare proxy/financial proxy caregivers to write a book on a step wise process of what is required by caregivers to file Medicare, SSI, etc. and suggestions on how a business "proxy" service could do this work. And/or how to automate the procedures through functionalities through a software application and with secure/encryption.</p>
<p>Home/housing models: I hear repeatedly that it is cheaper for an AZ patient to live at home (if home is available) than in an institutional setting. That is not true in the current environment. The cost of maintaining 24h/7d care in an AZ patient home is more expensive that placing the AZ patient in an institution. For example, the cost of care in Alabama, is primarily due to in-house sitter/aide - minimum $12-15/hour, is the equivalent of $264-$360/day, equivalent to up to $10,000/month. This does not include cost of housing overhead, food, medications, transportation, clothing, toiletries, taxes. The cost of AZ/dementia care in an assisted living facility is about 50% of that cost (includes housing, utilities, and food). Either cost is excessive and any personal savings are rapidly consumed and then insurance (if coverage purchased), then Medicaid pays.</p>
<p>The only way to reduce or minimize in home care is for volunteer services and/or family live in care. Churches may be a "mission" service and should consider the care/education/services for elderly adultsequivalent to the resources they invest in children services. With improvement of technology, monitoring/tracking devices, virtual monitoring, the care in house may be drastically reduced until the AZ patient is incapable of or has severe reductions in ADLs.</p>

<p>My father is the third person I know to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. First was my uncle who passed away in 2005 and then my aunt or father's sister who, although 6 years younger has had it for over two years now.</p>
<p>The impact of this illness on the family is devastating. There is no one place to go for help or all the information you need. It takes a village to handle an aggressive, geriatric Alzheimer's family member. As a caregiver one needs to find out as much as possible as quickly as possible to get the help needed for a loved one. Nobody tells you all the challenges you will have and the financial impact it has on the family as well.</p>
<p>My father was normally an intelligent man, very good with mathematics, science and spoke English, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. Now we see him unable to handle his finances, becoming increasingly aggressive, suffering from delusions and hallucinations regarding our mother who he has been married to for 62 years.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that a mental healthcare power of attorney was not signed since the lawyers don't mention that when you go to get your will and other papers in order, we had to apply for emergency guardianship to get my father admitted to a level one psychiatric facility. After he is there for three weeks and thoroughly evaluated we are told he cannot come home due to delusions regarding our mother. Now we have to find someplace for him and try to find resources to help us. Unfortunately we end up putting him in a group home which we think is the right thing since it is similar to his home and the advice we get from social workers as well as companies such as Care Patrol, that have familiarity with this illness. Since we have no experience we follow the guidance of these "professionals." Unfortunately in our case perhaps also due to the stressfulness of the situation we did not make the right decision. The home was nice but the caregiver, although a nurse, was not there most of the time, and the other caregivers were Pilipino and did not understand English very well.</p>
<p>The situation gets worse when my brother goes to visit my father and he is in bed at 7:30 since the caregivers don't seem to want to be bothered with the patients. When he arrives my father gets up from bed and falls and the door is locked and the caregivers can't seem to figure out how to get the door opened. My brother finally does and dad is on the floor. The caregivers just leave the area and my brother and his son help my father get back into the bed. My father seems to be in a drug stupor and his eyes roll back in his head. I get a frantic call from my brother and call the hospice since he was on palliative care and ask them to send a nurse immediately since the nurse who owns the group home is not there. I also leave an urgent message for her, which is never returned. I wait and then call for the nurse at the hospice that is on call to find out that she was denied entry into the home by the caregivers who told her he was sleeping and to come back the next day. When I confront the owner of the home the following morning she insists that she called me even though there is no record on my answering machine or caller id on the home or cell phones. Then she also indicates that her mother told her that nobody came to the door from the hospice, which was an outright lie. I immediately started looking for another facility but it was difficult since they are all extremely expensive and my mother is alive and living with physical disabilities at home and all of my father's social security, pension and VA benefits (which I applied for since he was a WWII veteran) have to go in their entirety to his care and we still fall short.</p>
<p>During the time I looked for a facility I asked the group home owner not to transport my father anywhere since there was an issue when we brought him home for lunch prior to that. I had met him at a follow-up appointment with his neurologist and she said we could try to bring him home to see how it went. The first time we tried it he seemed ok but it was after an appointment for a vision test and he refused to get in the car unless we took him home. On that occasion, he managed to get his checkbook which we later found out about since we could not locate it to pay the bills.</p>
<p>The following week he had a dentist appointment due to periodontal disease which we needed to attend to. After that appointment , when we brought him home, he became very agitated and pulled a knife out of a drawer, which usually had only papers(so we can only imagine he had placed it there the week before, since we did not). He sat down and said he was not going back to the group home or as he called it, a jail. Then he said he would kill my husband if he ever saw him again since he was the one who, with my sister, brought him to the hospital. I asked him to return the knife and he took it and put it under some papers behind him. This wasn't a small knife it was a large carving knife. I asked for it back but he refused and then went out back and started cutting plants with it and ended up coming in the house without it. He had hidden it. I sent my sister out to retrieve it and she found it in a bucket outside. I took that knife and the rest that were in the house and put them in the trunk of my car. While I did that he went in the back yard and left from the gate on the side and was halfway down the block on foot. I ran to catch up with him and my sister called the police since we were very concerned and needed to get him back to the group home. When the police came he told them he would go back with us and when they left and we were a few blocks away he lunged over the back seat and grabbed my steering wheel and tried ripping the keys out of my ignition and then grabbed the gear shifter to get the car out of gear. I immediately jammed on the breaks and told my sister, who was sitting next to me, to call 911 and that is when he tried to grab the phone from her. I told him I would go back to the house and proceeded slowly to give the policemen a chance to get there. I went past the house and he became agitated and tried getting out of the car but could not since the child locks were on the doors. Unfortunately I forgot the window locks and he was able to open the window and got his body out up to his hips. I had to stop the car and get his feet back in. This is 5'8" man who weighs 158 lbs. I am only 5'3" and weigh 130. This time four police cars came and the officer ended up having to put my father in his squad car and take him back to the home.</p>
<p>Despite the incident that happened and the fact that the group home owner knew about what happened and was told not to take him out, her husband took my father to the bank a couple of weeks later and the bank rep called my mother and then me since my father was requesting his social security number to take out money.</p>
<p>When I finally found a decent place for my father that specializes in Alzheimer's and dementia care, the group home was very rude and unprofessional with the nurse who came to assess him and asked them in front of my father if they were going to take him to a psychiatric facility. So in addition to all the stress now we had to deal with a group home that was manipulating him so he would not leave. He was also writing them checks, which I got back, but we closed the account to keep anyone from taking advantage of him. He had promised money to them, wrote checks to his attorney who was appointed by the court and was promising thousands to the staff and doctors in the hospital where he was assessed.</p>
<p>On top of everything we ended up getting calls from Elder abuse since the owner of the home was apparently upset that we were taking him out and kept arguing that he wasn't ill despite the medical records from a neurologist and psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Our family has been going through hell. On top of all this there was a tremendous amount of paperwork to get VA benefits, get medications and other medical issues taken care of and the legal expenses for guardianship are bleeding my parent's dry. The emotional impact on our mother and the rest of us has been awful as well.</p>
<p>I tell you all this so you can see what it is like since none of us ever imagined how awful this would be. I don't think anyone knows what it is like until they experience it firsthand.</p>
<p>Waiting until 2025 is too late. In my visits to many facilities I have seen people in their 40's and 50's with the disease and it will only get worse as the baby boomers age. With twice as many of them as their parent's generation we are in for a healthcare meltdown if something isn't put in place soon. We need to do something now. I am sure we are not the only family going through this.</p>
<p>There should be more research into different modalities (allopathic, homeopathic, naturopathic, etc.) to address this illness. I have read that there are studies being done regarding a cancer medication that is on the market that reduces the amyloid plaque in the brain. This is the website: <a href="http://www.case.edu/think/breakingnews/breakthrough.html">http://www.case.edu/think/breakingnews/breakthrough.html</a>.</p>
<p>I have also read about a possible treatment or preventative in raw coconut oil by a doctor who used it on her spouse: <a href="http://www.coconutketones.com/whatifcure.pdf">http://www.coconutketones.com/whatifcure.pdf</a>. Perhaps the cure or prevention lies in a combination of different modalities and all should be considered.</p>
<p>Families need more financial assistance and better resources where they can find all or most of the information needed with respect to legal, medical and assisted living resources as well as support groups to help families get the assistance they need as quickly as possible. Most of what is out there now is just "you are on your own" looking though websites in the midst of a crisis trying to find the help and guidance you need or other families at support groups trying to help each other. When a family is in constant crisis they need as much assistance/guidance as quickly as possible to help them navigate the system of care so they can make the right decisions for their loved one.</p>
<p>I agree with all of the findings but it must also be noted that some co-occurring chronic conditions such as sleep apnea (<a href="http://www.newschief.com/article/20111229/news/112295021">http://www.newschief.com/article/20111229/news/112295021</a>) hearing loss (<a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hearing_loss_and_dementia_linked_in_study">http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hearing_loss_and_dementia_linked_in_study</a>) and periodontal disease (<a href="http://www.breathproblems.com/link-between-periodontal-disease-and-dementia.html">http://www.breathproblems.com/link-between-periodontal-disease-and-dementia.html</a>)should also be included in annual geriatric screenings since they can be directly linked to causing dementia and may be overlooked. In addition something should be put in place regarding hearing loss and the prohibitive cost of hearing aids. Perhaps insurance companies can increase fees by a few dollars a month on their premiums to include some coverage for hearing aids. Everyone is impacted by hearing loss of a senior citizen: family, motorists who drive on the roads along with them, and anyone who the hearing impaired interact with. Since hearing loss can be linked to dementia making hearing aids more affordable through some sort of coverage could help in part, to address this issue.</p>
<p>Anyone directly related to the care of a patient with dementia or Alzheimer's and affiliated with a medical facility, assisted living, or group home should need to be certified to care for a patient with this illness and display that certification where it is visible to family who are looking for care for their family member. There are people who claim to know how to handle patient s with this illness, yet do not, and tend to take advantage of the family as well as the person with the illness.</p>
<p>There should be clear guidelines in place as to what the group homes can and cannot do such as taking a dementia patient to the bank to take out money. I bring this up since this happened with my father.</p>
<p>Medical assessments in the home would help greatly as well since it can be impossible to get a dementia patient to the doctor or hospital unless you have a mental health care power of attorney. If a patient is hospitalized and determined to have dementia, a mental health care power of attorney should automatically be granted without the family having to dish out thousands of dollars to an attorney when the person has received a neurological and psychological evaluation by qualified physicians. This would save the families of these patients thousands of dollars which can be used for their care. A regular health care power of attorney is insufficient since we were told that Alzheimer's and dementia are considered physical illnesses with psychological manifestations. Without a mental health care power of attorney the family has to file for emergency guardianship and then permanent guardianship which can cost upwards of $20,000. This is a progressive disease with no known cure at this point. It is ridiculous to penalize an already suffering family to have to deplete their savings when their loved one is only going to progress in mental deterioration and obviously needs a guardian. Many times they feel that they are not ill and will continue to fight and deplete their funds further until they end up on ACCHHS (Medicaid), which in turn just depletes the government's funds further. If this is a necessity perhaps some cost containment should be put in place so families aren't hurt financially by exorbitant legal fees.</p>
<p>Another issue is medication. The VA indicates it can help with the cost of medication but you have to bring the patient into their facility. Once they are in a memory care facility they are not always amenable to being transported so it would be of great help to have a VA rep come to the patient facility to assess them for the medication benefits or just to have the paperwork from the doctor diagnoses serve as proof that the person needs the medication and provide it and delivery at no cost to the veteran.</p>
<p>The facility that my father is currently in provides dental care via mobile dentistry. It would also be beneficial to have the same with respect to mobile hearing units to help many of the residents in these facilities to get the hearing assessments and hearing aid cleaning, hearing aids, wax removal, etc. to ensure that they can hear effectively. Mobile vision care would also be a plus to ensure that the patients are seeing well or are not developing illnesses of the eye.</p>
<p>Finally decent memory care facilities are very expensive (the one our father is now at costs $4,338/mo.) and that it would help greatly to have some sort of coverage to help as the only thing available is long term care insurance which many people do not have and once you are diagnosed with Alzheimer's, is no longer an option.</p>
<p>I hope you will take these suggestions into consideration in your National Plan. After going through all of this first hand I can tell you that these changes are greatly needed and would help all the families out there who are going through all of these challenges.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Mr. Ellenbogen for his supportive remarks regarding my comments on the National Plan to fight Alzheimer's disease. I hope that HHS and the Secretary will consider these comments as they revise the Plan. We are truly at a unique stage in our fight against Alzheimer's that will have implications for years to come. Developing an Office that is singly focused on coordinating and organizing efforts to fight Alzheimer's disease as well as to provide feedback to HHS and the Advisory Council as well as Congress is essential as we move forward. While there is certainly the possibility that this may step on toes within HHS and/or the NIH, it is something we literally cannot afford to do if we are serious in our efforts to fight Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, developing this infrastructure at the beginning of the Plan rather than years later will likely save money and lives into the future.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>

<p>I would like to commend and thank Bruce Lamb, who is an Alzheimer's researcher and Staff Scientist at Department of Neuroscience, in the Lerner Research Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. He shared his view points on January 13, 2012, under the SUBJECT: Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, in the public forum.</p>
<p>I found his view point's very interesting and highly recommend reading if you have not already done so. He also had an attachment that was titled, Right sizing funding for Alzheimer's disease, which was written by Todd E Golde, Bruce T Lamb, and Douglas Galasko and published May 6, 2011.</p>
<p><a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/Comments/cmtach27.pdf">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/Comments/cmtach27.pdf</a></p>
<p>I really like these paragraphs, which I extracted for your reading.</p>
<p>If one assumes that funding for HIV/AIDS was right sized to enable translation of basic discoveries to successful therapies, then given the lack of effective AD therapies, one possible implication is that funding for AD has been insufficient. A quick comparison of funding levels for HIV/AIDs relative to AD in the United States suggests this may be at least one factor that has hindered the translation of AD discovery to effective therapies. Based on publicly available data, National Institute of Health funding for HIV/AIDS in the United States is currently approximately $3 billion [5]. With approximately 1 million HIV-positive subjects in the United States, this equates to $3,000 of NIH funding per person with HIV/AIDs. In contrast, current NIH funding for AD is at a level of approximately $450 million [5], with perhaps another approximately $100 million to $200 million in NIH funding that might have some relevance to the study of AD (cognitive decline in aging, related neuro degenerative conditions). With a current prevalence of approximately 5 million individuals affected with AD in the United States, this equates to a maximum of $130 of NIH funding per person affected with the disease. So, on a per affected individual basis, NIH funding for HIV/AIDs is 23 times the level of that for AD.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many different ways to evaluate proportional or relative funding. Another one that is quite germane is economic impact. For AD in the United States this is estimated at more than $170 billion per year (and worldwide at $600 billion per year) [6]. Again focusing only on the United States, the yearly funding for research by the NIH represents 0.4% of the yearly costs of the disease in the United States. In other words, for every $2 the disease costs the United States, we spend less than 1 cent on research.</p>
<p>There are many people who believe in reinventing the wheel when undertaking a new project or endeavor. I have always been a firm believer that the people before us have laid the framework need to get started so we are not wasting a lot of time on the basics. The only approach I always followed along with that is, to delete, enhance and critique to make the plan even better. I always did that by asking the previous plan makers what they realized they did wrong and what would they do different. Ninety percent of that frame work would usually come from the best of many minds. I really believe the input and suggestion made by Bruce Lamb, be discussed when building this framework.</p>
<p>One thing that keeps coming to mind is the disparity issue related to AD. Am I the only one that sees this, or do we all just not want to talk about it. For example AD was first identified and named in 1906, while AIDS was identified in 1981. I see us now in the same stages as HIV was in 1988, when a focused effort was begun towards treatment or cure, with the creation of The Office of AIDS Research. It took an additional 5 years to strengthen this OAR (The NIH Revitalization Act), which really made a huge difference. Within three years of that day and by 1996 we started to finally have an impact on AIDS.</p>
<p>Let's not make a similar mistake as we did with HIV. Let's create a diseased focused agency for AD, with all the necessary strength, as of day one. Just think you can make up for the disparity that has been created and just maybe we could have a cure in less than 5 years.</p>
<p>Let me leave you with one last thought that I have not heard or seen anywhere. I think the government should offer a large sum of money to anyone who can come up with the cure for this disease first. While I am not sure what that amount should be it can be in cash and partial tax credits. I think that will drive many more into this arena and more efforts if the pie is big enough. Just think of all the savings insurance companies can benefit, not to mention the government. They may all be willing to help in that funding. Just a though. Sometimes you have to be creative and think outside the box.</p>

<p>My name is Michael Ellenbogen and I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at age 49, after struggling to get a diagnoses from age 39. We need to better educate our doctors.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to read many of the public comments. Many referred Psychologists and Neuropsychologists that may not have been in the plan. While I think they can add a benefit to people with AD, they can also hinder diagnose, as was done to me. In my experience it delayed my diagnoses for about 10 years, not to mention the financial burden it created to our health system. Many need to be better educated on how people with AD react to the test they provide. They also need to put some merit in what their patients and caregivers may share with them. Especially if the caregiver is a RN.</p>
<p>In June 1999, I had my first full Neuropsychological Evaluation conducted by Dr. Lindsey Robinson. The summary and recommendations were: <em>Current level of overall intellectual functioning is in the average range, with verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills relatively evenly developed. Neuropsychological testing revealed moderate to severe impairments in information processing speed and sustained attention, with mild to moderate impairments in verbal learning efficiency. Short-term attention, expressive/receptive language skills, verbal and nonverbal abstract reasoning, and cognitive flexibility were within normal limits for age. There was no evidence of clinically significant depression, anxiety, or other psychological disorder which might account for the patient's cognitive deficits. The etiology of Mr. Ellenbogen's cognitive impairment is unclear as, from a neuropsychological perspective, his symptoms are nonspecific. However, the magnitude of impairment observed on objective testing, in the absence of identifiable affective disorder, does suggest the presence of some form of organic cerebral dysfunction. Further neurological evaluation recommended.</em></p>
<p>I another appointment with Dr. Lindsey Robinson on February 2001. It was frustrating dealing with these doctors because every time I had to see a new doctor or take a test, my primary doctor needed to okay it. The other frustration was that sometimes I had to wait 5 months for appointments, which was the case with this appointment. The test that I was about to retake was questionable. I was not sure my insurance would cover the procedure, so I had to jump through hoops with the doctor and my insurance company. If the test was not covered, it would cost me about $2,500.00. When you deal with these insurance companies, document the conversation for yourself and ask them to do the same. I cannot tell you how many times they tried to get out of paying, but then they checked their records and saw I had received pre-approval. They kept putting up roadblocks and I had to be in touch with them a lot, when I should have been working. It was bad enough that I had to leave work for appointments, I did not need the added aggravation from the insurance company.</p>
<p>I finally met with Dr. Lindsey Robinson. She had commented on my other doctors findings in the beginning of her report: <em>The etiology of his cognitive symptoms was felt to be multifactorial, including normal aging, alcohol consumption, and anxiety.</em></p>
<p>I have to tell you that when I saw those comments, I was very angry. She was making up her mind before even administering the test.</p>
<p>Her summary and recommendations were: <em>Current level of overall intellectual functioning is in the average range, with no significant discrepancy between verbal cognitive skills and nonverbal reasoning abilities, There is no significant change in overall intellectual ability in comparison with the evaluation in June of 1999. On neuropsychological testing, Mr. Ellenbogen displays generalized psychomotor slowing and inconsistent impairments in attention, concentration, and memory. In comparison with the previous evaluation, a variable, inconsistent pattern of change was demonstrated, with improvements on some measures and declines on others. This pattern of performance is not suggestive of focal or lateralized organic cerebral dysfunction, and is not consistent with the presence of a progressive cognitive disorder. Rather, Mr. Ellenbogen's neuropsychological test performance suggestive of fluctuating levels of attention, concentration, and performance speed. Objective psychological screening suggest the presence of mild to moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety, and an introspective, perfectionistic personality style. These psychological symptoms are most likely playing a significant role in Mr. Ellenbogen's subjective cognitive dysfunction.</em></p>
<p>She encouraged me to seek a psychiatric consultation to determine whether a trial of antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication might be helpful in ameliorating my cognitive symptoms. She got me so aggravated, and she would not listen to anything my wife or I tried to tell her. She just did not want to hear it.</p>
<p>I went back to Dr. Lindsey J. Robinson, the Clinical Neuropsychologist, in January 2006. She was going to redo the neuropsychological testing. I thought it would be best to use this doctor again because she had a baseline for me and could compare my new results with the old. It would take months for the results. The other issue was that there were not many doctors, who performed this test, that were covered under my health insurance policy.</p>
<p>In June 2006, just a few weeks after my 48th birthday, Dr. Lindsey J. Robinson finally got back with the results of my testing. Her results for neuropsychological testing were as follows: <em>Background -- Previous neuropsychological evaluation in 1999 and 2001 revealed fluctuating, inconsistent impairments in attention, concentration, and performance speed, and symptoms consistent with anxiety and depression. Summary and recommendations -- Multiple aspects of Mr. Ellenbogen's behavior and test performance suggestive of inconsistent/incomplete effort during the evaluation. Thus, this test results described are not regarded as a valid representation of his optimal cognitive functioning. Mr. Ellenbogen's clinical presentation and test are unchanged in comparison with prior neuropsychological evaluation in 1999 and 2001. There is no evidence of progression of cognitive impairments, and Mr. Ellenbogen's developmental history and current test performance are not consistent with a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any other organically-based cognitive disorder. Mr. Ellenbogen demonstrated an anxious/ obsessive personality style and some symptoms of depression. His cognitive can be most parsimoniously attributed to affective disorder and/or other motivational or psychological factors.</em></p>
<p><em>Diagnostic Impression;</em></p>
<p><em>R/O Dementia (not in evidence)<br />
					R/O Anxiety Disorder, NOS<br />
					R/O Personality Disorder, NOS</em></p>
<p>Her recommendations -- <em>Mr. Ellenbogen should be reassured that thorough medical/neurological evaluation on multiple occasions has revealed no evidence of neurological cause for his cognitive symptoms. A trial of psychotropic medication could be considered to address Mr. Ellenbogen's apparent effective symptoms. He is unlikely to benefit from psychotherapy due to his reluctance to accept a non-medical explanation for his symptoms.</em></p>
<p>I have to tell you that when I met with her and read this report, I was so upset that I had made the decision to go back to her. First of all, during my testing we were not in a quiet area. Anytime I hear noise, it just throws me off. I have difficulty processing and concentrating when that occurs. There was nothing she could do to make it better. I tried very hard to be accurate during my testing and worked as quickly as I could. I tried to inform her that she was wrong in her findings, but she did not want to hear it.</p>
<p>She was so confident in her failure to diagnose me properly, that when I had reach out to her to make her aware that other Psychologists and Neuropsychologists determined that I did have Alzheimer's. She insisted on writing a letter to tell my primary doctor, that the others were wrong and she felt that her diagnosis was correct. Since that day I tried to reach out to her and gave her the opportunity to see the conclusions that 3 other doctors cane up with, but her office refused. Doctors like this will only hurt people like me. There should be a specific testing they must go through before they can test YOAD patients.</p>
<p>Maybe someone from your office can educate her. [address removed]</p>
<p>As you can see, it requires special doctors with the right training to deal with YOAD. I hope you will insure that happens.</p>

<p>I serve on the North Carolina Healthy Aging Coalition and am excited about the proposed national plan addressing Alzheimer's Disease. I have a few comments that may already be inferred in sections of the draft, but did not specifically see the following addressed:</p>
<ul><li>On page 14 ,Action 2.A.2 talks about encouraging providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties and I would like Allied Health professionals added to this section since many of us provide direct care to individuals and their caregivers of those with Alzheimer's Disease.</li>
<li>On page 14, Action 2.A.4 talks about strengthening the direct-care workforce. I whole-heartedly agree that this is needed; but also think there needs to be a plan of action to increase the number of cost-effective sites that are designed specifically for those with Alzheimer's Disease. I know later in the Plan, there is discussion about different housing options, but feel that this could be strengthened in the Plan. From my experience, many families do not have the funds to have their loved one cared for in a "Memory Cottage." Along the same lines, perhaps some type of long term health care insurance for dementia could be provided, if it is not currently available.</li>
<li>On page 21, Goal 3 indicates $10.5 million dollars will be available in 2013 to support caregivers' needs, but does not indicate how this money will be dispersed and who can apply for the monies.</li>
<li>One area I did not seen mentioned in the Plan is research money for prevention strategies, such as fall prevention and home safety. Both of these preventative strategies are crucial in helping the person with Alzheimer's not only remain in their home longer, but also promote their functional performance and integrity.</li>
</ul><p>Thanks for the opportunity to share my thoughts and I look forward to seeing the final Plan,</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>The <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em> is available for comment until March 30. This is a very important plan with significant implications for older adults and their caregivers. I encourage you to review the draft and submit any comments to Helen Lamont (helen.lamont@hhs.gov). If there are elements you would like to discuss, given their relevance to North Carolina, please share them via the listserv.</p>
<p>Once the plan is finalized, we will want to consider what we can do to promote implementation in North Carolina. The CDC-Healthy Aging Research Network's Healthy Brain Workgroup will be very engaged, and there will be important roles for geriatric education centers, academic institutions, aging services, public health, mental health, healthcare and indeed, for all of us.</p>
<p>Best to you!</p>

</td>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>Having just recently released the <em>Dementia State Plan: Virginia's Response to the Needs of Individuals with Dementia and their Caregivers</em>, the Virginia Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Commission (Commission) welcomes the <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (Draft Plan)</em>. The emphasis on promoting research and developing new treatments that prevent and effectively treat the disease, expanding support for people with the disease and their families, and enhancing care quality and coordination are shared goals of both plans and we look forward to working together as state and federal partners in addressing the rapidly mounting Alzheimer's crisis.</p>
<p>Regarding <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 1</em>: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong>, the Commission promotes research, supports all strategies to facilitate dissemination of research findings into medical practice and public health programs, and would welcome federal funding for provider education and outreach. Under <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 2</em>: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong>, Virginia's own plan calls for coordinating quality dementia services, integrated systems of care, and development of dementia specific training. The Commission welcomes any federal support of this state plan strategy.</p>
<p>The action items in <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 3</em>: Expand Supports for People with Alzheimer's Disease and their Families</strong> mirror our own state plan recommendation, "In order to survive, families need dementia friendly solutions for their safety, services and behavioral concerns, including: assessment and diagnosis, counseling and support services, care management, respite care, assistive technologies and home modification, transportation, and payment options including long-term care insurance." Additionally, the Commission supports <em>Draft Plan</em> action items for legal services and stable housing for people with the disease. Because of Virginia's large military and veteran population, the Commission advocates for federal and state partnerships to meet the dementia care needs of this population.</p>
<p>As noted in <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 4</em>: Educate the Public About Alzheimer's Disease</strong>, some states and localities "have published plans to address AD that coverage many of the same issues as the National Plan. Leveraging the available resources and programs across these levels of government will aid in the success of these efforts" to advance Alzheimer's Disease awareness and readiness across all levels of government. Finally, both Virginia's plan and the <em>Draft Plan</em> recognize the need to improve data collection to better understand the disease's impact on people with the disease, their families, and the healthcare system and, therefore, <strong><em>Draft Plan Goal 5</em>: Improve Data to Track Progress</strong> is also imperative. Specifically, the Commission requests coordination of shared federal and state data and the removal of barriers to sharing of information and best practices.</p>
<p>The Commission looks forward to the final version of the <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em> this spring as the Commonwealth is just beginning its state plan implementation. Concerted efforts in national and state strategic planning will provide the best chance to overcoming this dreaded disease.</p>

<p>How does the National Alzheimer's Plan address long term care insurance with Alzheimer's diagnosis.</p>
<p>In MD, perhaps nationally, if a person is diagnosed with Alzheimer's, they are NOT eligible for long term care insurance policy -- the very thing they need!</p>
<p>The National Alzheimer's Plan is promoting diagnosis; however this will PREVENT those individuals from getting the type of helpful insurance they need.</p>
<p>What is the plan doing to address this?</p>

<p>I would like to thank this committee for their efforts on this project. I am writing a very long letter and hope someone takes the time to read it and forward to all involved.</p>
<p>As this plan moves forward I can applaud the parts of the plan that involve research and drug development. I am sure it will make the researchers and drug companies very happy!! I have no problem researching earlyon set Alzhemers, but really the brain is an organ just like the heart and lungs. There is no cure for old, period! When a person shows signs of this disease at 75 years of age it is just that, the brain is getting old. The government can dump millions into drugs that they them selves will be paying for. Do you know how much Nemenda costs? Most people that take it could never afford it, so the government pays for a drug that has very little effect on the person that takes it. Financial aid and support to the families trying to care for a loved one at home is where this country will benefit.</p>
<p>I am a 52 year old daughter taking care of an 87 year old father with severe Alzheimers. We have a unique situation where I as well as 2 brothers live next door to my dad on land given to us by him. For the last 10 years I have taken care of him as well as worked and raised a family. I have 2 children who are in the health field, 1 a nurse and 1 in a Doctor Pharmacy program, that I struggle to keep in school since I have had to stop working. In the beginning my dad just required monitoring, meals delivered and laundry done, as the disease progressed we alarmed the house so he could not wander off at night. He tripped and broke his right hip in April 2010, surgery made the disease go crazy and I have been a full time caregiver since that day! My data never took a dime of government assistance, he lived and worked as a construction worker and farmed through some very difficult times. He had maybe $35,000 in an IRA when this began. My brothers help where they can and I private pay caregivers (35 hours per week) with the money he has remaining to the tune of $1400 a month. He collects $1267 social security. So after utilities, insurance, drugs and food the remainder comes from the IRA. You can see that when we pre-pay a funeral he will almost be broke. I stopped working, stay 5 nights a week with my dad. Moving someone to a skilled care only worsens this disease or any dementia. April 2011 dad broke his left hip, Hospital 5 days Nov 2011 for and infection. After every surgery or hospital stay he was sent to skilled care (I use that term very loosely) the very basics are not being met in these homes, my dad was left unattended wet and soiled on a daily basis. He developed pineal yeast infections that went unchecked until I discovered it. This is caused by neglect and poor hygiene The workers are miserable, patients are ignored, no one smiles or even pretends to hear them. Don't believe me, take off your suit and go undercover for a visit. I saw this care across the board in 3 different skilled care facilities. My dad is no longer verbal enough to get a point across, but after every trip to a skilled home I would insist on bringing him home when he looked like death. Home is where it is at!!! Love and proper care, I have him walking with a walker, I have him on a bathroom schedule (he is never wet). At night I taught myself how to use an external catheter (something I had to fight to have Medicare approve). This is an aid that is simple to use and eliminates wetness at night and helps to prevent bedsores.</p>
<p>My dad now receives some help from the area on aging, that provides 3 half days of daycare. This is income based and I am controlled if I want to remain in the program to keep his withdraws from his IRA to a minimum. I do this so he dosen't run out of money therefore forcing him onto Medicaid and forcing us to put him in a home. Where is the burden of care? on me!!! Now we are hearing budgets cut to the access public transportation he rides to and from day care. I will be forced to enroll my dad onto Medicaid this will cost the government more than $9,000 monthly.</p>
<p>We were not rich enough to hire an Elder Attorney to transfer my dads assets out of his name, nor do we feel it was our right. How many rich people are on Medicaid because they were taught to spend down their assets? Not one person in this country should be able to give their undeserving children an inheritance before they die, period! Not one person is more in need of skilled care than my dad 24/7 and I could qualify him in a heart beat if I pre-pay a funeral. However I know without a doubt that I am giving him better care than he would get in a home. He is happy in his home and everyday that he smiles and says thank you is a gift to me!</p>
<p>My recommendations give the families financial help to keep their loved ones at home. Give the care giver that quit her job a tax break, so they can continue to help send their own children to college. Allow people to hire quality private care givers, don't force an agency that charges double the hourly rate on us. Respite care that is now covered only under Medicaid, so that we can a least get a weeksbreak to refresh our minds would be nice! Stop taxing the elderly when they can prove every dime of there money is going to care for themselves. Adult Day care should be a medical expense.</p>
<p>I also see both sides of this story my in-laws were forced by 2 of their children to move to assisted living. They pay $4300 a month and my father-in-law takes care of his wife their and the home is very happy to have them. They should be, he does their job for them and they collect the pay check!!! They hate where they live!</p>
<p>There was a song written over 50 years ago the title is "The House of Shame" by Smiley Bates. My dad would call a local radio station almost every Saturday and request it, he then would call each of his children to tell them listen to it. I challenge you to listen to it, I did! Nothing has really changed in 50 years.</p>
<p>I am sorry this is so long, but unless you know the entire problem you can not fix it.</p>

					TO HSS ON THE<br />
					DRAFT Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease<br />
					MARCH 5, 2012</strong></p>
<p>We are excited about the opportunity to offer our comments and recommendations regarding the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
<p>As memory care experts, our Autumn Leaves assisted living communities provide families and residents with compassionate care and innovative solutions that help our residents create a sense of well-being in a comfortable, home-like environment. While reviewing the Draft Framework, we agree with our industry partner, The Assisted Living Federation of America (ALFA) that the framework is a good start but there are more components that need to be added to the story.</p>
<p>The recommendations below offer ideas, interpretations and new measures in the draft where we think the strategy can be better fortified to help industry professionals, and residents and their families make more informed decisions while promoting the need to educate, train, detect and respond faster to this deadly disease. Thank you for the opportunity to hear our voice.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					Training and specialized programs need mandating for general practitioners, and the healthcare industry overall to recognize early signs and symptoms. Requirements need to be established for individuals 70 years of age and older. Parameters, tools, programs and interview questions that allow physicians to screen for Alzheimer's and dementia need to be implemented much like the way breast cancer checks and prostate exams are set up.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong><br />
					While guidelines for delivery of high-quality care and measures are needed, even more important is the focus on specialized cognitive care activities such as the way to evaluate an individual's ability to complete day to day activities. The goal should be to improve an individual's life by identifying their remaining abilities and offering recommendations and strategies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems</em></strong><br />
					More training and programs need to be implemented on the potential impacts of cognitively impaired individuals, and how transitions disorient and stress the individual.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					Better controls and programs need to be established to understand family systems which can oftentimes present a barrier to diagnosis and treatment. Identify the cultural dynamic of communication in order to offer support, education, awareness and help. Likewise, provide support and assistance for younger families so they can have access to the latest information: where to get help, programs designed to provide that help and community outreach services to offer support.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong><br />
					More awareness programs and information about the importance of planning for healthcare decisions and disease progress need to be available. The primary physician and social worker roles need to be better quantified so they can better help families navigate through this process. Recognition of specific dementia care and related long-term care settings must be identified by policy makers and the insurance industry. More help is needed to assist families with guardianship and how to plan ahead, understand how to deal with crisis moments and realize they need professional legal help for healthcare issues and financial.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					Programs, training and information need to be available to help educate families and individuals on recognizing abuse and exploitation. Consequently, safety programs, education and training need to be implemented to address issues like wandering and safe return/finding.</p>
<p>A series of safety programs need to be implemented to help:</p>
<ul><li>Caregivers prepare their homes for a loved one living with Alzheimer's.</li>
<li>First responders such as police, fire department, EMS and emergency room personnel understand the necessary steps to take when aiding individuals who are living with Alzheimer's or dementia.</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As the disproportionately high rate of African-Americans versus whites living with Alzheimer's continues to rise, more educational services need to be available in the African-American communities to help increase a greater awareness and knowledge-base of the warning signs of Alzheimer's and dementia. The Alzheimer's Association statistics illustrate that the age-specific prevalence of dementia has been found to be 14% to 100% higher in African-American.* The number of African-American age 65 and over will more than double by 2030, from 2.7 million in 1995 to 6.9 million.</p>
<p><strong>The Wandering Emergency</strong><br />
					Wandering is considered an Emergency. Although common, wandering can be dangerous -- even life threatening: speed is of the essence. The statistics show very poor outcomes for elderly wanderers missing beyond 24 hours, and many people cannot remember their name or address. They may become disoriented and lost even in their own neighborhood, and they may become fearful and hide. Many states do not track or report wandering and locating current, up to date statistics are difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>Wandering is an emergency situation and part of the disease process:</p>
<ul><li>6 in 10 people with Alzheimer's disease will wander.</li>
<li>18% of those with mild dementia wander.</li>
<li>50% of those with severe dementia wander.</li>
<li>Wandering has proven such a common behavior that experts predict 60% to 70% of all people with Alzheimer's will wander away from safety at least once during the course of their illness.</li>
<li>Many will wander 6 to 8 times before they are placed into a residential facility or an outside, qualified caretaker is brought into the home to help.</li>
</ul><p>At Autumn Leaves, we're exploring ways to adapt our communities into designated <em>Safe Havens</em>. We know as individuals lose more and more of their memory, they will often go in search of a particular person, place or thing.</p>
<p>We are working to provide a service where anyone in the public sector that finds an individual wandering, confused of their whereabouts or are lost, can bring that individual to an Autumn Leaves <em>Safe Haven</em> until authorities or family members are contacted. We want to be able to help the emergency responders, and give them the aid and support they need to return individuals back to their loved ones.</p>
<p>Our solution to this very serious issue is multi-faceted:</p>
<ul><li>Expansion of the Silver Alert Program needs activation standards set by federal legislation to ensure there is seamless integration nationally instead of state by state much like the Amber Alert system introduced in 1996. Approximately 29 states have a Silver Alert or similar programs -- all states need to implement and participate.</li>
<li>Education on wandering prevention needs implementation along with understanding GPS technology or emerging technologies.</li>
<li>The Safe Haven concept for 'found' wanderers needs regional awareness to inform the public where and how to find Safe Havens. Likewise, they will need to be informed of the steps in bringing Alzheimer's or dementia wanderers to safe communities.</li>

<p>I did not see anything planned for costs. Why is long term care not covered by Medicare, health insurance or Veterans Administration? Memory care is extremely expensive; it is basically round the clock care by skilled staff trained in Alzheimer care.</p>

<p>First, thanks so very much to the committee and the US government for a comprehensive thoughtful plan. It is concrete. It is clear. And it is so encouraging to read! Please accept my comments below in context of my deep gratitude for all the work and initiative that created a plan worthy of response.</p>
<p>I have been a caregiver of two parents with AD/dementia over the past 4-5 years. As I tackled the problems of one, then two parents with AD/dementia, first cross country, then moving my mom to my city after losing my dad, I've been on a steep learning curve (over four years and counting) to learn and understand what's happening, what's the best thing to do, etc. I have grown as a caregiver, after having been a high-technology marketing executive for 20+ years. I am still learning, but I am also now a strong resource, having learned a great deal as I've grown with this responsibility.</p>
<p>Again, please know these comments are in response to a terrific draft.<br /><strong>Pg. 6, Guiding principle 3: Transform the way we approach Alzheimer's disease</strong>. Completely agree. Would like to see "transformation" more aggressively articulated and delivered in Strategies for Goals 2-4.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1 &amp; Strategies, pgs. 7-12</strong>, all reflect the three guiding principles, and demonstrate vision, initiative and innovation. Goal #1 strategies are impressively aggressive and actively embrace the acceleration in scientific and medical discoveries that is happening.</p>
<p><strong>Goals 2-4 &amp; Strategies, pgs. 13-27</strong>, are thorough but not transformative, not ambitious enough, not innovative, not visionary - they seem more safe, incremental, rote. Unlike Goal 1, Goals 2-4 are not "crossing the chasm" (per Geoffrey Moore's term for technologies that break with the past). "Breaking with the past" matters because a safe plan will not drive change fast enough to retrain the medical, legal and financial communities, support families and caregivers sufficiently, or change the cultural landscape to rally NOW. Here are a few thoughts about enhancing Goals 2-4 to make them more transformative, but innovation could be pushed even farther -</p>
<ol><li><strong>Goals 2 and 3: For Caregivers, create a more transformative vision and more proactive, innovative strategies that view them not just in need of support and education, but as an active resource and collaborative partner</strong>. In the first stages of stepping up to caregiving, I yearned for direct, straightforward information. I felt too many people hesitated to teach me how to think about Alzheimer's because a) they really didn't know and 2) every patient is different. But I've learned a lot that now could be shared, and much more quickly than I was taught. Five years later, I've stepped up, and I am now a strong resource. I realize that caregivers need a lot of support, but please leverage our expertise too. I do not want to be viewed as weak, helpless, or a victim. I want to be viewed as a collaborative partner with the ability to constructively contribute to a team and care plan. I know a lot of other caregivers have the same strength. Caregivers deserve recognition not only for their ongoing contribution, but also their varied skill levels and ability to actively participate in care planning, as well as training, with health care professionals. Develop a) a scale that measures caregiver experience and b) programs that harness and leverage experience. Create web-based training modules that track a caregiver's growing capabilities. In the Draft Plan, change language that views caregivers as "helped", "supported" and "dependent" on the system. Where appropriate, decouple caregivers from those with AD, again to include them in a more active collaborative model, not just attached to their loved ones with AD.
<p>						Other suggestions to add a little more transformation into Goals 2 and 3 -</p>
<ul><li>Add an Action 2.A.7 that develops a way to connect experienced caregivers to the health care "workforce" - recognize an active role for caregivers.</li>
<li>In Strategy 3.B, add an Action for Caregiver Financial Supports, including social security credit, tax credits, and 401k waiver of fees for those who lose income when they must support family with Alzheimer's and cannot continue to work. As an experienced business person/MBA, I felt unsupported and invisible by a lack of financial support/incentive. A few changes would not only offer a financial boost, but a moral boost. It's depressing to be financially invisible/taken for granted, even as one works to do the right thing.</li>
<li>Strategy 3.C reads as though it's all about money and the pros know best. The source and the message are as much the problem as the audience. "Educating people about their potential needs" requires an honest setting of expectations that frankly I have not seen in medical professionals and certainly not financial professionals. This section needs a more transformative, "glass breaking" approach, not simply awareness building. People know a little about LTC, etc., but the costs are high and the sales pitches are muddled. (My parents had LTC insurance and it has made a tremendous difference.)</li>
<li>Strategy 3.D is very important and is very clear. Action 3.D.1- please insert "Educate legal &lt;<em>and financial</em>&gt; professionals..." because financial professionals aren't very informed either about the impact of the disease on an elder's ability to make financial decisions.</li>
<li>Action 3.D.2 is transformative. So is Strategy 3.E. Thank you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>To achieve transformation, Goal 4 needs a more aggressive, ambitious articulation with trackable results that are very high impact</strong>. The current Goal 4 does not reflect a vision or ambition for awareness building. Strategy 4.A, "Educate the public about AD" seems tame, neither aggressive nor transformative. Public awareness of AD is high, but based on bad information and stigmas. The stigma of AD prevents learning. Campaign strategy needs to aim higher than awareness building: start with the goal of erasing the stigma of AD, and replacing it with an embrace of the humanity of those with AD and the ambitions to eradicate AD.</li>
</ol><p>Again, please know how grateful I am, as a caregiver to two parents with AD/dementia, that a National Plan to attack Alzheimer's exists. I send these comments from the front line, and ask that you consider them with the respect and gratitude in which they are offered.</p>

<p>OVERALL I FIND THE DRAFT PLAN A REASONABLE AND READABLE DOCUMENT, EVEN THE HHS BOILERPLATE. I HAVE SOME COMMENTS WHICH ARE BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE, WHICH I WILL STATE BRIEFLY: MY WIFE, MARTHA, WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A/D AND COPD IN THE FALL OF 2007. I CARED FOR HER AT HOME WITH SOME RESPITE ASSISTANCE UNTIL I COULD NO LONGER DO SO IN JULY OF 2009. I MOVED HER TO AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY FOR SIX MONTHS AFTER WHICH TWO HOSPITALIZATIONS MADE IT NECESSARY TO PUT HER IN A HOSPICE FACILITY FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. IN JUNE OF 2010 I BROUGHT HER TO THE HOUSE ON HOME HOSPICE. I WILL NEVER REGRET DOING THAT. AFTER 55 DAYS, ON AUGUST 4th, 2010, SHE DIED.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>PAGE TWO OF THE PLAN LISTS FOUR GOALS. TWO OF THEM ARE: "... ENHANCE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS' KNOWLEDGE ...", AND "... SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND CAREGIVERS ...". THEY ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GOALS. I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN MORE PROMINENCE AND A GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY. WHY? BECAUSE DISCONTINUITIES IN AVAILABLE MEDICAL CARE ARE A SERIOUS AND GROWING PROBLEM - RIGHT NOW - AND ALZHEIMER'S SUFFERERS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS ARE PAYING THE PRICE - RIGHT NOW. WE ALL HOPE THAT EVENTUALLY A CURE WILL BE FOUND FOR ALZHEIMER'S. BUT AN IMMEDIATE AND MORE ACUTE PROBLEM IS COHERENT AND GRADUATED CARE FOR ALZHEIMER'S AS THE DISEASE PROGRESSES, AND RELIEF FOR THE BURDEN THIS PLACES ON CAREGIVERS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO US:</p>
<ol><li>IT WAS LIKE PULLING TEETH TO GET A DIAGNOSIS. AFTER TWO $600 SESSIONS WITH A MEDICAL "EXPERT" IN THE SPRING AND FALL OF 2007, HE STILL WOULD NOT DIAGNOSE A/D. OUR FAMILY DOCTOR, AN INTERNIST, HAD TO MAKE THE CALL AND BEGIN TREATMENT.</li>
<li>IN JULY 2009, AFTER A HELLISH TWO WEEKS IN A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINIC TO GET THE RIGHT DOSAGE OF A/D DRUGS, THE DOSAGES STILL WERE NOT RIGHT AND OUR INTERNIST HAD TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS LATER.</li>
<li>BY THE FALL OF 2009 15-MINUTE APPOINTMENTS WITH OUR INTERNIST WERE NO LONGER ENOUGH BUT THERE WAS NO AVAILABLE MEDICAL "NEXT STEP". I FOUND THAT AT LEAST IN NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI, ALL THE GERIATRICIANS HAVE BEEN COOPTED AND ABSORBED BY THE HOSPITAL-HOSPICE, NURSING HOME OR HOSPICE INDUSTRIES. THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR AND DO NOT WANT ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS. THEY PREFER PATIENTS WHO NEED MONEY-MAKING REHABILITATIVE THERAPIES.</li>
<li>MONEY IS NOT THE WHOLE ANSWER. WE HAD NURSING HOME INSURANCE, WHICH WOULD HAVE PAID UP TO $254 A DAY. NURSING HOMES COSTING $230 A DAY HAD NO OPENINGS, PREFERRING PATIENTS NEEDING THERAPIES. I OPTED FOR A $90 A DAY ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY, WHICH WAS FINE UNTIL SHE WAS BED-RIDDEN AND HER NEEDS BECAME TOO GREAT FOR ASSISTED LIVING. AS IT WAS, BECAUSE OF THE 90-DAY EXCLUSION ON OUR NURSING HOME INSURANCE, WE BARELY BROKE EVEN ON THAT POLICY.</li>
<li>THE NEXT TRANSITION, AND IT WAS ABRUPT, WAS TO A HOSPICE FACILITY. THE HOSPICE BILLED MEDICARE $1000 A DAY FOR HER CARE. HER CARE THERE WAS PERHAPS TWICE AS GOOD AS IN ASSISTED LIVING, BUT IT WAS NOT ELEVEN TIMES AS GOOD AS THE BILLING WOULD SUGGEST. THE MEDICARE HOSPICE BENEFIT IS A WONDERFUL THING, BUT THE HOSPICE INDUSTRY IS GETTING FAT ON WHAT IT CHARGES, AND IT IS COMPLETELY INADEQUATE FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S.</li>
<li>THE LAST TRANSITION WAS IN JUNE OF 2010 AND IT WAS ALSO ABRUPT. I WAS TOLD SHE HAD TIMED OUT OF IN-PATIENT HOSPICE. I FOUND THAT NURSING HOMES WERE STILL NOT INTERESTED IN HER AS A PATIENT SO I OPTED FOR HOME HOSPICE. I PERSONALLY PREFERRED THAT TO A NURSING HOME, BUT EVEN THOUGH I HIRED A CNA AND AN LPN TO SUPPLEMENT MY EFFORTS AND THE HOME HOSPICE EFFORT, WHICH WAS UNEVEN, HER CARE WAS NOT AS GOOD AS THAT IN A NURSING HOME . BUT, HOME HOSPICE STILL BILLED MEDICARE $250 A DAY, WHICH WAS MORE THAN A NURSING HOME.</li>
</ol><p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>I SAY AGAIN THAT CONTINUITY OF COHERENT AND GRADUATED MEDICAL CARE FOR THE ALZHEIMER'S PATIENT AND RELIEF FOR THE CAREGIVER IS AN ACUTE AND GROWING PROBLEM THAT NEEDS GREATER EMPHASIS IN YOUR PLAN. IT IS A - RIGHT NOW - PROBLEM, NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CHIPPED AWAY AT OVER TIME. BECAUSE OF MY WIFE'S COPD COMPLICATION, WHICH REQUIRED 24/7 OXYGEN, OUR ORDEAL WAS MERCIFULLY SHORTER, LESS THAN THREE YEARS, THAN IS TYPICAL FOR ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS. OTHERS HAVE IT HARDER THAN WE DID.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">***</p>
<p>I HAVE DETAILED RECORDS FOR EVERYTHING I HAVE SAID ABOVE. I CAN PROVIDE ANYTHING MORE THAT YOU NEED FROM ME.</p>

<p>Please address the lack of funding to provide intermediate care (Assisted Living) for those with early Dementia. This group often can no longer live at home safely, due to lack of family support or resources, but are not yet debilitated enough to meet criteria for Nursing home. Few insurance policies cover Assist living, and Medicare doesn't cover this setting either. There is a state program which with a "wavier" funding is available, but this doesn't nearly cover all who could benefit from this level of care. Thank you for considering this important issue.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Alzheimer's Association comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services "Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease." The Alzheimer's Association is the leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans with Alzheimer's disease and almost 15 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top ten in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Caring for people with this heartbreaking disease cost Medicare and Medicaid an estimated $130 billion last year.</p>
<p>Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, the future will be even bleaker. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the cost of care will surpass $1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). However, if through the National Plan the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years, similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease, would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050. This is both the challenge and promise of the National Alzheimer's Project Act and the development of a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment -- a strategic plan is within our grasp. The Draft Framework sets that plan in motion. But while this framework is extensive in scope, there are a number of items that need to be addressed. Those items are raised in this letter.</p>
<p>Having reviewed this Draft Framework, however, the leading comment of the Alzheimer's Association is that <strong>the Draft Framework should be adjusted to facilitate the Department's incorporation of the recommendations of the three Advisory Council subcommittees, as presented at the January 17, 2012 Advisory Council meeting, into the National Alzheimer's Plan</strong>. These recommendations represent a bold, transformative, and comprehensive way to address the Alzheimer's crisis -- exactly what is needed in a National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>General Comments </strong></p>
<p>We believe the firm deadline of 2025 in this initial framework is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones may be needed, the Department is to be commended for including, for the first time, a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently needed treatment advances.</p>
<p>Second, the draft includes often neglected, but important, issues such as public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection, which are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact.</p>
<p>Third, there is a strong section on expanding and strengthening the health care workforce. Without an adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained, individuals living with Alzheimer's will not have access to coordinated, quality care in all health care settings, including acute care, long-term care, and home care settings.</p>
<p>These are three leading examples of the Draft Framework's many strengths. However, before a draft plan is released, several gaps must be addressed to fulfill the promise of a comprehensive and bold National Alzheimer's Plan. The largest omissions in the Draft Framework are a clear call for adequate and sustainable funding for Alzheimer's disease research, and for the resources required to implement the national plan. A strategy without funds to implement it or resources to drive research breakthroughs will not achieve the goals laid out in the Draft Framework by 2025.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming is that there is little mention of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) beyond general references to increasing clinical trial participation and expediting the development and use of biomarkers, and there is no mention of ways to spur development of treatments or other regulatory science efforts. The draft plan must create opportunities for multi-sector partnerships to stimulate new ideas and innovations, and the FDA must play a pivotal role in the development and translation of these new treatments.</p>
<p>A final overarching weakness in the Draft Framework is the limited emphasis on educating affected individuals, their families, and their caregivers about Alzheimer's. The importance of understanding Alzheimer's disease, particularly in context of other health conditions, should be emphasized, as should educating individuals and their families about the support services available to them and the need for advance planning. Similarly, there is no mention of how to improve documentation of a diagnosis, which is crucial to enabling care coordination among health care providers. A formal and documented diagnosis allows individuals to participate in their own care planning, better manage other chronic conditions, participate in clinical trials, and ultimately alleviate the burden on themselves and their loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments </strong></p>
<p>Following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and strategies as outlined in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong></em><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, there is no mention of funding for Alzheimer's research or what will be required to implement the National Alzheimer's Plan. Without this commitment to adequate research funding, 2025 risks appearing more a hope than a goal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes that Alzheimer's research needs to be a goal of the entire National Institutes of Health (NIH), not just the National Institute on Aging (NIA). NIA is underfunded, so prioritizing funding within NIA does not hold the potential to sufficiently elevate Alzheimer's research. Making Alzheimer's research a priority of the entire NIH is also important to help ensure coordination among the 27 Institutes and Centers, 23 of which are currently funding Alzheimer's research. 3</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					The phrase "...will continue to aggressively conduct clinical trials..." should be characterized relative to the scale of the crisis and, by that measure, we strongly disagree that current levels warrant a description of "aggressive" -- aggressive is what we <em>need</em>, not what we <em>have</em>.</p>
<p>When examining how to manage and treat symptoms of Alzheimer's, research should be more closely linked to quality measures. Moreover, novel ways to conduct and encourage prevention trials and trials on agents that are not patentable should be included. This strategy must also address information protection, patents, and technology transfer in academic institutions.</p>
<p>Other than increasing clinical trial participation or expediting the development and use of biomarkers, the Draft Framework does not mention the FDA. FDA is a critical piece to the puzzle and is a necessary player in addressing ways to provide incentives that spur development of treatments or other regulatory science efforts, including biomarkers and critical scientific methods and tools.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presymptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					With regard to advances in imaging and other technologies that may enable an earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical settings, the coverage determinations and reimbursement hurdles associated with accessing these new technologies are not addressed in the Draft Framework. In addition, longitudinal trials, which were explicitly endorsed during the 2010 NIH State of the Science Conference, are not addressed but should be in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.D: Coordinate Research with International Public and Private Entities</em></strong><br />
					The Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense should work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities, which may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated individual or office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em></strong><br />
					We strongly support a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained will help ensure that people with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and will ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system. Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties should be expanded. 4</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. The Medicare Annual Wellness Visit will help on this front, but we recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection separate from the strategy for diagnosis. While the Draft Framework refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is a mistake to conflate the issues of detection and diagnosis in a single strategy. And, in fact, this strategy could be read as confusing the distinct processes of detection and diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the strategy is silent on educating health care professionals, particularly physicians, on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often, many physicians do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing physicians, their lack of training in the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delay detection of cognitive impairment and further diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support Patients and Families Upon Diagnosis</em></strong><br />
					The education component within this strategy appears limited. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed after a diagnosis, including referrals to existing community supports and services. It is also important that patient education emphasize the importance of understanding Alzheimer's disease in the context of other health conditions. Moreover, family consultation with appropriately-trained health care professionals should be provided and reimbursed under Medicare, even when the patient is not present, so families do not feel abandoned after a diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the measurement of quality indicators. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.E: Ensure that People with Alzheimer's Disease Experience Safe and Effective Transitions Between Care Settings and Systems</em></strong><br />
					There is no mention of the use of electronic medical records or the importance of making sure a diagnosis is actually included in a medical record. This is especially important for safe and effective care transitions. Prior to any care transition, an individual should have a documented diagnosis in his or her medical record, as well as a list of relevant medications. In addition, acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					Alzheimer's disease is progressive and terminal and therefore general research on care coordination may not address the unique needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or their caregivers. Additional research should be conducted specifically on care coordination for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					A National Plan must identify the specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias. However, we are looking forward to reviewing specific plans that will meaningfully address the challenges faced by these populations. 5</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</em></strong><br />
					During the course of the Alzheimer's Association's public input sessions last summer, this was a consistent theme, and we commend its inclusion in the Draft Framework. A National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong><br />
					The intent of this strategy is unclear. If the goal is to encourage the purchase of long-term care insurance -- or at least educate families about the option of long-term care insurance -- it is important to realize that the private long-term care insurance market presents particular challenges to those with Alzheimer's disease. It may not be a viable option, and families should be made aware of the potential issues.</p>
<p>In addition, while planning for long-term care is important, there are other future needs for which a diagnosed individual needs to plan -- planning regarding finances, driving and safety, advance directives, and end-of-life care. The Draft Framework should refer to the importance of advance planning education once someone receives an Alzheimer's diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As indicated in Strategy 2A, all health care practitioners should have proper dementia training, which should help mitigate abuse. In addition to health care practitioners, training efforts should include first responders.</p>
<p>The National Plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. This includes the issue of self-neglect, which is not addressed in the Draft Framework.</p>
<p>State Adult Protective Services (APS) agencies are over-burdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire circumstances. The Draft Framework does not address the need for additional resources for APS agencies so that they can adequately protect the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong><br />
					As indicated in Strategy 2G, education campaigns must be language-specific and culturally appropriate.</p>
<p><em><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 5.A: Enhance HHS' Ability to Track Progress</em></strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government. 6 At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance both on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they more adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 5.B: Monitor Progress on the National Plan</em></strong><br />
					Although sometimes overlooked, improving data to track progress is critical, and we commend its inclusion in the Draft Framework. This critical information should be publically available, or at least available to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (early stage through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>The Draft Framework provides a good foundation for a National Alzheimer's Plan. But much work needs to be done to fulfill the promise of a detailed National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, would result in just such a National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></p>
<p>The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) is pleased to submit the following comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (the "Draft Framework"), released by the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) on January 9, 2012.<sup>1</sup> BIO represents more than 1,100 biotechnology companies, academic institutions, state biotechnology centers and related organizations across the United States and in more than 30 other nations. BIO members are involved in the research and development of innovative healthcare, agricultural, industrial and environmental biotechnology products.</p>
<p>As the representative of an industry that is devoted to improving health care through the discovery of new therapies, BIO believes that any framework for improving diagnosis and care for serious, complex illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, must include measures to provide access to innovative treatment options, including new drugs and biologicals. We are pleased that the Draft Framework specifically includes strategies for enhancing scientific research aimed at preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease, coordinating research with international public and private entities, and facilitating the translation of findings into medical practice and public health programs. <sup>2</sup> We offer the following comments to make these strategies more effective.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Draft Framework Should Include a Strategy to Protect Patient Access to Innovative Therapies for Alzheimer's Disease </strong></p>
<p>The draft framework correctly recognizes that after research findings are published in the clinical literature, "additional steps are needed to highlight promising findings and to facilitate dissemination and implementation of effective interventions to the general public, medical practitioners, industry, and public health systems quickly and accurately."<sup>3</sup> In addition to being shared with patients, caregivers, and practitioners, new clinical evidence also must be adopted into health plans' coverage and payment policies in a timely manner to ensure that access and reimbursement is available for advanced treatment options and improved diagnostic tools that address the eight cognitive domains that may be impaired in Alzheimer's, as recognized in the NINCDS-ADRA Alzheimer's Criteria: memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving, and functional abilities.<sup>4</sup> This is particularly important now because there are exciting new diagnostic tools and treatments for Alzheimer's disease on the horizon, at the same time our health care delivery system is undergoing dramatic change, from the creation of Accountable Care Organizations to increased packaging.</p>
<p>There are several ways the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) can protect patient access to care. CMS should assign Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes in a timely manner for new drugs and biologicals to facilitate claims processing and payment by all health plans. CMS also should expeditiously add new cognitive tests to Medicare's Annual Wellness visit so that beneficiaries will have access to this service on a regular schedule and without out-of-pocket costs. In addition, CMS should work with stakeholders to identify new preventive services and issue national coverage determinations that add those services to Medicare's preventive benefits. Other payers, including Medicaid and private insurance plans, as well as the state agencies that regulate health plans, will need to act promptly on similar matters to protect access to innovative diagnosis and care for patients within their programs as well. CMS and other payers also may need to reconsider their current rules on coverage and payment to support adoption of new approaches to care, such as use of telehealth and increased participation in care by family members and caretakers, and to ensure that bundled payment systems do not discourage the use of novel therapies. BIO recommends that the Draft Framework be revised to explicitly acknowledge the need for prompt action by Medicare and other payers to provide comprehensive coverage, coding, and payment for new methods of preventing, diagnosing, and treating Alzheimer's disease to help meet the needs of this vulnerable patient population.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Draft Framework's Strategies Should Support the Development of Treatment by Facilitating Participation of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease in Clinical Trials </strong></p>
<p>BIO recognizes that no progress can be made without clinical research, yet we also realize that it is difficult for many older patients to participate in trials due to comorbidities and limited access to sites of care that offer trials. These obstacles are particularly significant for patients with Alzheimer's disease, who may have more difficulty deciding to participate in a trial or remaining in a trial unless they have strong support from their family members and caregivers and health care practitioners. The Draft Framework notes that "new partnerships and outreach efforts may be needed to ensure that enough people are enrolled in clinical trials to examine the effectiveness of promising interventions."<sup>5</sup> BIO believes these efforts are needed. Enhanced outreach is essential to increasing participation in clinical trials through educating patients' families and caregivers, facilitating their access to the patient's health information, and supporting their role in helping patients make treatment decisions. These efforts also need to be applied across all research efforts -- in the U.S. or other countries, public or privately funded -- to encourage optimal participation in these essential trials. BIO recommends that the Draft Framework specifically recognize the need for enhanced efforts to address the factors that frequently inhibit patients with Alzheimer's disease from participating in clinical research. To facilitate this, we recommend that the Secretary involve, consult and engage with industry to address those factors through "new partnerships and outreach efforts."</p>

<p>On behalf of the American Psychological Association, I would like to commend the Department of Health and Human Services and its federal partners, the Interagency Group on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your efforts to develop the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>The American Psychological Association (APA) is a scientific and professional organization that represents psychology in the United States. With more than 154,000 members, APA is the largest association of psychologists worldwide. The mission of the APA is to advance the creation, communication and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives.</p>
<p>APA would also like to submit the following coments for your consideration as you refine the Plan Framework.</p>
<p>We stand ready to assist by recommending content experts (including researchers, clinicians, educators, specialists in multicultural practice and neuropsychological assessment), publicizing the Advisory Council's efforts, and reviewing and disseminating its work. APA remains committed to partnering with other organizations to prevent and reduce the burdens of this devastating disease. We very much appreciate your consideration of these comments.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions, comments or concerns to Deborah DiGilio, MPH, Director of our Office on Aging.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>APA Comments on the <em>Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The science and practice of psychology are integral to efforts to prevent this disease and slow its progression, to assess, diagnose, treat, and support those with AD, and to lighten the burdens of the families and institutions that care for them.</p>
<p>Psychologists:</p>
<ul><li>conduct basic and translational research</li>
<li>develop and implement neuropsychological tests for assessment and diagnosis</li>
<li>develop evidence based behavioral interventions to address age-related cognitive decline and the known behavioral risk factors for AD, to reduce caregiver stress and burden, and to manage the challenging behaviors often associated with the disease, a</li>
<li>assess decision making capacity</li>
<li>use psychotherapeutic approaches to help individuals with AD and their caregivers cope with the illness and its associated consequences</li>
</ul><p>Independently, and as a part of interdisciplinary teams, psychologists have been at the forefront of research and treatment of AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Given the important efforts by psychologists to understand and address AD, it is surprising that there is no mention of the role of psychology in the Draft Framework: not in the sections on research or its translation into practice, nor in the list of professions that provide high quality health care, nor in the discussion of timely AD diagnosis, nor in the framework's discussion of education and support of patients and families. Most notably, neuropsychological evaluation, a component of the original and current gold standard for AD diagnosis, is not mentioned.</em></strong></p>
<p>APA offers its support to your efforts to refine and finalize the Draft Framework. Below, please find our feedback, organized in response to the strategies listed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.A: Identify Research Priorities and Milestones</em></strong></p>
<p>APA is eager to participate in the development of a strategic Alzheimer's research agenda proposed by the Framework, and in the May 2012 research summit to be convened by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). We encourage NIA to invite scientists who understand not only current gaps in AD research but who also have a broad understanding of such integral topics as normative aging, cognition, clinical care, or caregiving. We also hope there will be an opportunity for scientists who didn't participate in the meeting to comment on the research agenda before it is finalized.</p>
<p>While a focus on biomarkers is propelling the AD field forward, how biomarkers cause or relate to the dementia syndrome (with which we are ultimately concerned) is still poorly understood. Therefore, we believe the participation of scientists who are working in interdisciplinary teams and who understand biomarkers AND behavior would be especially important. We say more on this issue in 1.C.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.B: Enhance Scientific Research Aimed at Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease </em></strong></p>
<p>While the draft plan emphasizes the need to expand research on molecular and cellular mechanisms and genetic research to identify risk and protective factors, a research agenda that neglects the critical behavioral and social aspects of AD would be unsuccessful and insufficient.</p>
<p>The research agenda for the National Action Plan should prioritize research that underlies each section of the plan, e.g., research to enhance communication between caregivers and health care providers, to better tailor interactions with the health care system to the special needs of persons with AD, to enhance communication among interdisciplinary care teams to develop and disseminate 'best practices' for caregivers and to provide support for the caregivers themselves. Significant health risks to caregivers are well documented. To that end, APA would support the convening of additional summits to focus on clinical care research and caregiving.</p>
<p>In the domain of prevention, research focused on enhancing cognitive function may demonstrate pathways to prevention. Two promising areas include research on lifestyle, particularly connections between cognition and exercise (Anderson-Hanley, et al., in press; Colcombe, et al., 2003; Head, et al., in press) and research on cognitive training (Ball, et al., 2002; Basak, et al., 2008; Smith, et al., 2009).</p>
<p>More research needs to be focused on understanding how AD interacts with "other" diseases to cause dementia, and other vulnerabilities caused by normal aging (e.g. vascular changes, inflammation, and immune system changes). Most community based studies indicate that multiple pathologies play a role in the clinical syndrome and <em>all</em> autopsy series would suggest that multiple pathologies <em>must</em> be present in order for a person to have the disease clinically.</p>
<p>Because the first draft of the Framework dealt so cursorily with the issue, we want to emphasize again the importance of expanding research to understand how biomarkers relate to AD symptoms. It is perhaps the single most important area of focus for the reserach agenda, and is discussed more fully in our response to Section 1C.</p>
<p>We also request that the term "non-pharmacologic" be replaced with "behavioral." Behavioral describes a wide variety of interventions that NIA and other NIH institutes have funded and supported, and that may be extremely valuable for prevention and intervention. For example, for the management of behavioral disturbances in dementia, most reviews of this field suggest that behavioral interventions are preferred, due to their effectiveness, and because they help to avoid the serious side effects that are common with pharmacological approaches to dementia management (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Camp &amp; Nassar, 2003; Cohen-Mansfield, et al, 2007; Salzman, 2008; Sink et al., 2005).</p>
<p><em><strong>Strategy 1.C: Accelerate Efforts to Identify Early and Presumptomatic Stages of Alzheimer's Disease</strong></em></p>
<p>While the increased ability for scientists to monitor changes in biomarkers is certainly promising, psychologists and others are concerned that there is considerable heterageneity in how pathogenic factors in AD are related to the symptoms of the disease. There is strong evidence that some neuropsychological measures can more sensitively predict conversion to Alzheimer's than most biomarkers (Gomar et al, 2011; Heister, et al., 2011; Landau, et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Research to understand and chart the earliest course of the disease should support biomarker development in tandem with neuropsychological research, not to the exclusion of it. More psychological/neuropsychological research needs to be supported to understand the behavioral manifestations of the putative biology. The use of biomarkers to monitor the effects of treatment only provides information on how the treatment affects <em>that biomarker</em>, which may or may not lead to improve in the clinical syndrome associated with the disease. We need better psychological and behavioral markers that are sensitive to disease progression over shorter periods to understand whether treatments improve the symptoms of the disease rather than simply the putative biological features. Right now, treatment trials use neuropsychological outcomes that are specific to diagnosis but may not detect disease progression with high sensitivity. More sensitive neuropsychological markers for diagnosis also need to be developed given that the biology of the disease starts years before evidence of the clinical syndrome. We believe the expertise of psychology in defining relationships between the biology and behavior is critical, and is not acknowledged in this draft of the Framework.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize that the first sentence in the draft Framework's Strategy 1.C is the subject of much disagreement. It is <strong>not</strong> currently possible to track the progression of AD through tracking biomarkers. And it is only possible to monitor the effect of such treatment as may be targeted specifically to a biomarker, not to a larger clinical syndrome.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 1.E: Facilitate Translation of Findings into Medical Practice and Public Health Programs</em></strong></p>
<p>It is important for research findings to be translated into a universe much larger than medical practice. Because of the complex needs often presented by individuals with AD and their families and caregivers, the provision of care by an interdisciplinary health care team is generally needed. Thus, useful findings must be translated into the practices of <em>many</em> health care providers and in a <em>variety</em> of settings. Individuals with AD and their caregivers are found in multiple settings, not only traditional, medical settings, including long term care, community, and home care. We recommend the terms "medical" practice and "medical" practitioners be replaced by "health care" practice and "health care" providers to capture this inclusive model of care. Finally, individuals with AD and their caregivers should be explicitly mentioned as recipients of information regarding effective interventions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em></strong></p>
<p>We urge you to include psychologists among your list of specialists that care for people with AD and their families. The major initiatives to expand geriatric training opportunities at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Health Resources and Services Administration cited in this section both include psychology as one of the disciplines targeted.</p>
<p>Psychologists are integral members of the geriatric and dementia care workforce. They include highly trained professionals with unique skills in assessment, research and evaluation, behavioral health, geriatric and neuropsychological practice, evidence-based behavioral treatment and behavioral medicine practice, group dynamics, and systems that are of critical importance in addressing the health care needs of individuals with AD, their families, and caregivers.</p>
<p>Care provided by interdisciplinary health care teams ensures optimal assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning and implementation, and outcome evaluation that is responsive to the physical, behavioral, mental health, and social needs of patients and their families (APA, 2007). Caregivers of individuals with AD, and the individuals with AD themselves when possible, should be included as memebers of the team.</p>
<p>In addition, given the pressures faced by physicians, counseling efforts proven most effective in educating family members about how to handle the problems of AD are impossible to complete during the time allotted to a brief office visit.</p>
<p>Finally, Medicare reimbursement policies act as a deterrent to building the health workforce necessary to provide high quality care to individuals with AD and their caregivers. For example, Medicare will not pay for CPT codes 90846 (family psychotherapy without the patient present), or for 96155 (health and behavior intervention for the family without the patient present). Nor will Medicare pay for a physician service such as an office visit with a patient's family if the patient is not present. For patients with cognitive impairment, there must be options for reimbursement when working with families and caregivers without the patient present. In terms of integrated care teamwork, there are Medicare CPT codes (e.g., 99366 and 99368 initiated in 2008) that allow team conferences that involve interdisciplinary professionals from at least three disciplines to assess a patient's care plan and progress, however these codes are very poorly reimbursed. Reimbursement of behavioral interventions, other than psychotherapy, which would allow psychologists and other mental health professionals to intervene on behalf of people who cannot benefit from traditional therapy because of their cognitive deficits, e.g., behavior management interventions, is also critical.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.B: Ensure Timely and Accurate Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>We would like to emphasize that the current gold standard for AD diagnosis involves a neuropsychological evaluation - - the integration of objective measures of cognitive performance with historical, neurological, and other diagnostic information. Psychologists, with specific compentency in evaluation of cognition and expertise in the integration of cognitive data with other psychodiagnostic approaches, clearly need to be represented as primary practitioners involved with enhancing AD care quality and efficiency through timely and accurate diagnosis. The APA <em>Guidelines for the Assessment of Dementia and Age-Related Cognitive Change</em> (APA, 2012) note that neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing remain among the most effective differential diagnostic methods in discriminating pathophysiological dementia from age-related cognitive decline, cognitive difficulties that are depression-related, and other related disorders. Even as biomarker identification and analysis improve, neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing will still be necessary to determine the onset of dementia, the functional expression of the disease process, the rate of decline, the functional capacities of the individual, and, hopefully, response to therapies.</p>
<p>The citation for this sentence: "Research has helped identified some assessment tools that can be used to rapidly assess patients showing signs and symptoms of AD and to help health care providers make a diagnosis or refer for further evaluation" focuses almost exclusively on biological markers. However, behavioral (neuropsychological) markers remain the gold standard against which biological markers are validated (Blacker, et al., 2007; Gomar, et al., 2011; Jacobs, et al., 1995; Tabert, et al., 2006). Neuropsychological assessment tools are non-invasive, highly accessible, and reasonable for the assessment of AD either in isolation or with other markers of disease. We request that the literature documenting the usefulness of behavioral markers be included in this section of the framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.C: Educate and Support Patients and Families Upon Diagnosis</em></strong></p>
<p>Multiple health care providers, including psychologists, are involved in assessment and planning of advance care counseling for individuals with AD. Assuming that these tasks are the sole purview of the physician is incorrect. Thus the term "physician(s)" should be replaced with "health care provider(s)."</p>
<p>The APA Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (2011) state, "individuals concerned about cognitive and behavioral changes associated with aging, generally come to the evaluation process seeking information as well as emotional support. This often is a severely distressing situation for the individual, who may or may not have been the key individual in making the decision to have an assessment conducted (American Bar Association &amp; American Psychological Association, 2008; American Psychological Association, 1998). ... Providing feedback, education, and support to persons significant to the individual, with the individual's informed consent, are also important aspects of evaluations and enhance their value and applicability. Knowledge regarding levels of impairment, the expected course, and expected outcomes can help these significant other to make adequate preparations. Working with the individual's support network in this way can provide them with effective means of responding to the challenges posed by behavior changes stemming from a diagnosis of dementia. Healthy older adults who have had concerns about their cognitive functions can benefit from reassurance based on results of testing and from suggestions as to how they may enhance their everyday cognitive function."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, research on advance care planning for persons with cognitive impairment shows that even when physicians and social workers in a Memory Disorders Clinic encourage advance care planning only about 40% of clients do so (Garand, 2011). It appears that the most effective way to foster the development of advance care plans is to involve multiple face-to-face educational sessions (Bravo, 2008). Thus, support for more intensive interventions is necessary if we are to increase advance care planning.</p>
<p>We would also like to note that at this time, the evidence does not indicate that early detection will lead to improved treatment, or actually help people to plan for their future care. There is a risk to early detection (as noted in recent guidelines for cancer screening) -- large numbers of individuals being identified as patients, or at risk. This can create needless psychological distress because there are so few current treatment options, and those few options are often inappropriate. This may lead to discouragement on the part of families whose support and partnership with care providers is critical to the person with AD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.D: Identify and Implement High-Quality Dementia Care Guidelines and Measures Across Care Settings</em></strong></p>
<p>Identification and implementation of high-quality dementia care guidelines should include both those that focus on pharmacological and behavioral intervention and take the whole person into account, including behavioral and mental health considerations along with physical care. Interdisciplinary consensus development processes, such as the Consensus Statement on Improving the Quality of Mental Health Care in U.S. Nursing Homes: Management of Depression and Behavioral Symptoms Associated with Dementia (American Geriatrics Society, 2003) in which 15 health provider organizations participated is one effective model for developing high-quality dementia care guidelines. APA has developed Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-related Cognitive Change (<a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/dementia-guidelines.pdf</a>) and is interested in working with other organizations to develop additional dementia care guidelines.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.F: Advance Coordinated and Integrated Health and Long-Term Care Services and Supports for Individuals Living with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Mental and behavioral health services must be included in the wide array of health services available to individuals with AD. Psychologists and other mental and behavioral health providers should be represented on interdisciplinary health care teams that work with individuals with AD and their families and caregivers in primary care, long-term care and community and home-based settings. Cognitive impairment alone does not preclude the ability to benefit from various forms of psychotherapy. Behavioral interventions are effective in addressing dysphoria, agitation, anxiety, and apathy in persons with dementia (Teri et al., 2005). Behavioral interventions are an especially important tool as medication treatment of behavioral disturbances in dementia is of limited efficacy and should be used only after environmental and behavioral techniques have been implemented (American Geriatrics Society, 2011; Sink, et al., 2005). At more advanced stages of dementia, use of sensory stimulation often assists in addressing issues related to agitation or anxiety (Lin et al., 2009). At all stages of dementia, apathy is the most common behavioral challenge facing caregivers. Therefore, provision of optimal stimulation and ensuring positive engagement are critical features of interventions to improve the quality of life of both persons with dementia and their caregivers (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>A major challenge arising from the anticipated rapid growth in the population of those suffering from AD is provision of support, both to the individuals with AD and to their caregivers. It may not be feasible to construct the number of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) required to provide a continuum of care for individuals with dementia in the coming decades. Even if it proves possible, the cost of maintaining people in such facilities may be prohibitive without a rapid enrollment of people into long-term care insurance programs. In addition, home and community-based care is often preferred by patients and their families. Finding ways to support those with AD and other dementias in their homes is going to be critical to effective coordination of care.</p>
<p>Randomized control trials, such as REACH and REACH II, have shown that innovative health care tools, such as remote delivery of services through telemedicine with the support of integrated health care teams, can relieve caregiver burden, particularly depression, for those caring for people with AD (Eisdorfer et al., 2003; Czaja &amp; Rubert, 2002; Finkel et al., 2007). Such interventions can be structured to provide effective, culturally-sensitive support (e.g., Belle et al., 2006).</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 2.G: Improve Care for Populations Disproportionally Affected by Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>APA concurs that improved care is necessary for populations disproportionally affected by AD. Health care providers must understand and competently manage the cultural differences in these populations. In many ethnic minority groups, familial support extends beyond the immediate family system. Thus it is important that providers be as inclusive of the extended family system as possible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.A: Ensure Receipt of Culturally Sensitive Education, Training, and Support Materials</em></strong></p>
<p>We concur that ensuring the development and receipt of culturally sensitive education, training and support materials by family caregivers is crucial as there is evidence that the problems experienced by caregivers differ in occurrence and intensity across racial and ethnic lines (Dilworth-Anderson, Williams, &amp; Gibson, 2002; Janevic &amp; Connell, 2001; Pinquart &amp; Sörenson, 2005). Replication and dissemination of model interventions such as REACH II (Belle et al, 2006; Burgio, 2009; Elliott et al., 2010) that are proven to be effective with diverse populations, is encouraged.</p>
<p>The strengths and coping mechanisms of culturally diverse groups should not be overlooked. For example, in a study of caregivers of patients with AD, Morano and King (2005) found that caregivers with higher levels of religiosity reported significantly lower levels of depression. Inter-ethnic comparisons showed that, African American caregivers reported the highest level of religiosity and the lowest levels of depression.</p>
<p>When considering issues of diversity and the effective provision of culturally sensitive education, the special needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities who develop AD should be considered. In addition, culturally sensitive education should include efforts directed to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. In these communities, "familial support" includes "families of choice," a term which is often used in lieu of family of origin for many LGBT adults.</p>
<p>Psychologists have a long history of involvement in the development of culturally competent health care interventions (e.g., many of the lead investigators on the REACH and REACH II projects were psychologists) and could provide additional direction in the development of this strategy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.B: Enable Family Caregivers to Continue to Provide Care While Maintaining Their Own Health and Well-Being</em></strong></p>
<p>Rather than beginning the description of this strategy with a sentence about the eventually of nursing home placement, it would be more useful to begin with the second sentence that speaks to supports for families and caregivers. This is an area in which we <em>do</em> have evidence-based interventions to assist caregivers in maintaining their own health and well-being. Research on the effectiveness of behavioral inteventions for caregivers of individuals with dementia has been quite prolific (APA, 2011). For example, The New York University Caregiver Intervention (NYUCI) benefits the caregiver's mental and physical health and delays institutional placement of the care recipient (Mittleman et al., 2006). This intervention provides dementia caregivers with 6 sessions of individual and family counseling, support groups participation, and additional on-call telephone consultations in a flexible counseling approach that is tailored to each caregiving family. The STAR-C intervention (Teri, et al, 2005) produces benefits for both the caregiver and care recipient, improving caregiver depression, reducing burden, improving sleep, lessening subjective ratings of burden, improving caregiver reaction to behavioral problems, improving care recipient quality of life and memory-related behavioral problems. The STAR-C program has been successfully taught to community consultants, providing evidence that it can be disseminated into diverse community settings. In this intervention, caregivers are taught to monitor problems, identify possible environmental or interpersonal triggering events, and develop more effective responses in order to improve patients' environment, maximize their abilities, and minimize their impairments. Psychologists have been involved in the development and evaluation of each of these interventions and have trained masters level professionals and aging and community service workers to implement them in community settings.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that the use of the term "supports" is a bit misleading in this strategy's description. The meta analysis cited (Sorensen, 2002) shows that interventions that <em>only</em> offer supports are much less effective than interventions that offer caregivers information and skills training -- that is, psychoeducational interventions with an "active" component. Cognitive behavioral therapy was found to be the most effective intervention in decreasing caregiver depression in this meta analysis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long-Term Care Needs</em></strong></p>
<p>Assistance is critical for family members who must prepare to transition from care partners to caregivers (Aneshensel, et al., 1995). Families need not only education but skills training and the availability of counseling services as they take on multiple roles and responsibilities (Zarit, 2009). As noted elsewhere in this document, individuals with AD should also be included in planning for their future needs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the resources for planning and meeting long-term care needs are woefully inadequate. Many families and caregivers of individuals with AD perceive themselves as not 'fitting' many of the support options communities may have to offer. Often the individual with AD does not qualify for services because they do not have IADL limitations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 3.D: Maintain the Dignity, Safety, and Rights of People with Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Psychological interventions stress the importance of personhood and preserving the individuals' dignity in AD and person-centered planning during MCI and mild AD. Enabling family members to accept, support, and engage the person with dementia as he or she is now is an important challenge to address. It is also critically important that therapeutic goals be discussed directly with the individual who has dementia. This not only provides the respect and dignity that should be given any individual, but also provides highly relevant information regarding the individual's understanding and attitude about the goal, his or her motivation in achieving the goal, and his or her willingness to expend time and energy working toward the goal (APA, 2012).</p>
<p>Regarding safety, although physical neglect and abuse tend to occur most of the time during the more severe stages of the AD, it is also important to recognize that older adults during the stages of MCI and mild AD are vulnerable to neglect and abuse in other domains. This is particularly true for financial abuse as there is evidence that diminished financial capacity or decision making is one of the early signs of cognitive decline (Marson et al., 2000). Individuals who are living independently are at high risk. It is not enough to say that we have APS or the Ombudsman program in place -- we must be much more proactive to prevent abuse before it happens. Psychologists play a key role with regard to assessment of capacity (e.g., capacity for medical consent, financial capacity, testamentary capacity, capacity for independent living).</p>
<p>APA and the ABA Commission on Law and Aging have jointly published a series cost-free handbooks on the Assessment of Older Adults with Diminished Capacity for psychologists, lawyers and judges <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx">http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/programs/assessment/index.aspx</a>. The handbooks have proved useful to a variety of health and aging professionals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategy 4.A: Educate the Public about Alzheimer's Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>The public health initiative described focuses on enhancing public awareness about AD, including misconceptions about diagnosis and treatment. We believe the main focus of a public education campaign should be on modifiable risk factors for AD -- including diabetes, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, smoking, depression, cognitive inactivity or low educational attainment, and physical inactivity - and actions individuals can take now to reduce their risks. We know enough about these modifiable risk factors to institute a public health/awareness campaign, even if the risk factors are not related to the putative pathology. A recent study (Barnes, et al, 2011), notes that up to half of AD cases worldwide are attributable to seven potentially modifiable risk factors -- and that a 10-25% reduction in all seven risk factors could potentially prevent as many as 1.1-3.0 million AD cases worldwide.</p>
<p>In addition, the educational effort should not be alarmist, rather clearly state that the <em>majority</em> of older adults before the age of 80, which is currently about the average life expectancy for U.S. citizens, do not develop AD. AD is not a normal part of cognitive aging. Findings from longitudinal studies of intellectual development, such as the Seattle Longitudinal Study (Schaie, 2005), suggest that individuals who develop dementia after the age of 60 need to show multiple risk factors, including both genetic and behavioral risk factors. To be specific, estimates of the prevalence rates of dementia (i.e., most of the time estimates of dementia of the Alzheimer's type) for different age groups vary across study and range from about 5% to 13% for individuals age 65 and older to over 40% for adults age 85 and older (Hebert et al., 2003; Plassman et al., 2007). Thus, it is well established that the prevalence rate increases disproportionally with age and that individuals who are at greatest risk for showing signs of dementia are not individuals in the young-old age range, but individuals in the old-old and very-old age range (i.e., 80 years and older). This information should inform the public education campaign.</p>
<p>There are also pronounced racial differences in the prevalence rate of dementia and that this should be taken into account when raising public awareness and discussing the needs of this segment of the population. Gurland et al. (1999), for example showed that while the prevalence rate for white Americans was 2.9%, 10.9%, and 30.2% for the age groups of 65-74, 75-84, and 85+, respectively, the rates for the same age groups for African-Americans were 9.1%, 19.9%, and 58.6%, respectively. The pattern of prevalence rates for Hispanics was even higher in the age groups of 75-84 and 85+ (i.e., 27.9% and 62.9%), respectively.</p>

<p>I have read the Draft Framework document and I am encouraged that it include Strategy 3.C: Assist Families in Planning for Future Long Term Care Needs.</p>
<p>May I suggest this be expanded into a national comprehensive and coordinated public awareness campaign? The need for families to get together and talk about how and where they wish to be cared for if they ever need care is one essential element. Another is to put in place the legal documents such as Powers of Attorney and Advanced Medical Directives. And, most important, to consider purchasing long term care insurance BEFORE it is too late as correctly stated in this section.</p>
<p>Please utilize the services of insurance agents who specialize in long term care insurance. I am sure that the following organizations would be glad to assist:<br />
					The American Association of Long Term Care Insurance (<a href="http://www.aaltci.org">http://www.aaltci.org</a>)<br />
					The Center for Long Term Care Reform (<a href="http://www.centerltc.com">http://www.centerltc.com</a>)<br />
					The National Association of Health Underwriters (<a href="http://www.nahu.org">http://www.nahu.org</a>)</p>
<p>Also estate attorneys, accountants and financial planners should have valuable input into such a public awareness effort.</p>
<p>Finally, within the membership of the Alzheimer's Association there are a number of authors (including myself) who have written books about their experiences. I wrote My Million Dollar Mom. <a href="http://www.buybooksontheweb.com/product.aspx?ISBN=0-7414-6713-5">http://www.buybooksontheweb.com/product.aspx?ISBN=0-7414-6713-5</a> It chronicles my time caring for Mom with the help of a wonderful care giver named Nora. I was able to keep my Mom at home until her death two years ago because she and I planned for this years in advance and that planning, the documents we had in place for her and the insurance that I bought for her made the burden that much less.</p>
<p>I would suggest a national tour of speaking engagements (or regional conference) where we authors can talk about Alzheimer's and how real the problem is.</p>
<p>Please let me know what I can do to help.</p>

<p>Thank you for this opportunity to provide comments on the Draft Framework for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. The Minnesota Board on Aging believes the work of the N.A.P.A. Council presents a once in a lifetime opportunity to build a comprehensive national plan to address Alzheimer's disease which has such a devastating impact on individuals with the disease and their families as well as on health and community care systems throughout the country.</p>
<p>Minnesota has an extensive history of work in Alzheimer's disease ranging from the work of such notable researchers as Dr. Ronald Peterson, Director of the Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center to the Minnesota legislatively mandated Alzheimer's Disease Working Group, which recently developed a statewide plan to address Alzheimer's disease. The Minnesota legislature has provided extensive funding to explore innovative models to provide community supports and services to people with Alzheimer's disease and their family caregivers through Community Service/Service Development funding in conjunction with Alzheimer's Disease Support Services Program (A.D.S.S.P.) funding through the U.S. Administration on Aging.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Board on Aging recommends that the N.A.P.A. Council look at the accomplishments of A.D.S.S.P. for guidance in the development of the national plan. A.D.S.S.P. has provided grants to states to build core expertise in the area of Alzheimer's disease at the state and local level and within both community and health care systems. Over the last twelve years, Minnesota has gratefully used this resource to embed Alzheimer's capability within public resources such as the statewide Senior Linkage Line® and the Minnesota Long Term Care Assessment process. The development of an early identification initiative with partnering clinics and hospitals and engage in one of the first translations of the evidence-based New York University Caregiver Intervention that has a documented impact on the delay in nursing home placement by persons with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>We urge you to call for restoration of A.D.S.S.P. funding that was reduced by 65% for 2012. It does not make sense to so severely reduce a program that exemplifies so many of the objectives of N.A.P.A. until a program that can more effectively achieve these objectives is ready to go. We encourage you to call for an analysis of the lessons learned from A.D.S.S.P. to inform the design of a new program that builds upon its achievements. Finally, we urge you to call for adequate federal funding to meet the new program objectives. N.A.P.A. provides a unique opportunity to take the best of what we've learned and embed it within community and health care systems to provide the support and education needed anywhere people with Alzheimer's and their caregivers live while it also works towards the cure we all hope for.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Board on Aging (MBA) is the gateway to services for Minnesota seniors and their families. MBA administers funds from the Older Americans Act that provides a spectrum of services to seniors, including Senior LinkAge Line®, Insurance Counseling and more. Established in 1956, the MBA is one of the pioneers in the field of aging policy, information and assistance. It works closely with its Area Agencies on Aging, which are located throughout the state, to provide services that seniors need. The Minnesota Board on Aging's 25 members are appointed by the governor.</p>

<p>I heard about this Federal, national initiative with great interest. Like cancer care, there needs to be an emphasis on research; however, there also needs to be an emphasis on finding high-quality, low cost, exceptional long-term care with dignity for persons with Alzheimer's and their families.</p>
<p>I am attaching a proposal I have for such (nationwide) care. I would like it to be considered by the committee as part of the national plan. I think it addresses care-giver support, the health care and other financial expenses, and the need for persons with Alzheimer's to live the rest of their lives with dignity.</p>
<p>Please contact me if you have additional questions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>PROPOSAL FOR A NEW STATE (NATION)-WIDE MODEL FOR LONG-TERM ALZHEIMER'S CARE DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The problem</strong></em>: We know that Alzheimer's Disease is putting an ever increasing burden on persons with the disease, their care-givers, the health care system, and society at large. It presents an urgent problem for our Nation, our State and our local communities.</p>
<p><strong>One key issue is finding affordable care for persons with Alzheimer's</strong>. This presents significant challenges for spouses, children and friends of those with Alzheimer's. Adult children often have to leave the workplace to provide care for aging parents, resulting in economic hardships and increased emotional stress as well as physical illnesses for themselves and their family members. Spouses may also end up with financial struggles as well as social isolation and additional psychological and physical ailments at the end of their lives, taking care of their spouse with dementia. The toll on children, spouses, friends, businesses, the healthcare system, and governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, mark this challenge as a future crisis for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>Currently, there is a lack of affordable care options for persons with Alzheimer's</strong>. The cost of care ranges from $4,000-$5,000/month for assisted living/memory unit care to $5,000-$7,000/month for nursing home care. Daycare is around $10/hour. Long term health insurance often pays for a limited number of years of care, requiring families to assume costs after this period ends. For many persons with Alzheimer's, Medicaid may eventually pay for their care.</p>
<p><strong>Most would agree that whenever possible, care should be given at home</strong>. The benefits of optimal home care are many, and include:</p>
<ol><li>the familiarity and security of a home-like setting</li>
<li>24/7 supervised care from familiar individuals</li>
<li>constant interaction/stimulation/socialization</li>
<li>adequate diet and nutrition</li>
<li>the possibility of regular outings outside the home, such as trips to the gym, salon or dinners out with familiar companions</li>
</ol><p><strong>In a word, such care ideally enables the person with Alzheimer's to age with dignity, respect, optimal health, and have excellent, continuous care for the rest of their lives. </strong></p>
<p>But what does this require? It often means the care-giver leads two lives, theirs and that of the person with Alzheimer's. Those who have done it know this is unsustainable and will take a significant and dramatic emotional, physical, and financial toll on them and their families.</p>
<p><strong><em>The solution</em>: What is needed for persons with Alzheimer's is <em>optimal, AFFORDABLE care in a home-like setting without requiring 24/7 care from their family members or friends</em></strong>. Imagine a world in which NO ONE WITH ALZHEIMER'S WOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LONG-TERM CARE! You and your family members/friends could rest assured that you would have an optimal, affordable long-term care option if you had or were to develop Alzheimer's. Although this sounds like a dream, <strong>it can become reality if several parties who are impacted by this problem (basically, all of us!) work together. THIS REQUIRES A DIFFERENT CARE DELIVERY PARADIGM, one that is NON-FOR PROFIT, IN WHICH LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS FAMILIES AND LOCAL BUSINESSES WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN</strong>.</p>
<p>What would this look like? How could this be achieved? The following is a suggested model.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong><em>First, there would be a registry of individuals needing such care</em></strong>. This could be developed by the State for each county. Registries would include personal and financial information for each applicant. In addition, APPLICANTS WOULD NEED TO BE LOCATED IN THE SAME AREA (COUNTY) AS THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS/FRIENDS WHO WOULD BE ASSISTING IN THEIR CARE. So, for each county in Florida, a registry (waiting list) would be established showing individuals with Alzheimer's needing care as well as locations of nearby family members/friends who would need to commit to helping in their care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Local homes for sale/in foreclosure would be purchased to create home settings in which the applicants would live</em></strong>. This would be the responsibility of the State, working with local governments, possibly with Federal/agency grant support. Initial costs for setting up the home might also be covered by Federal grants, possibly coupled with local government tax breaks as well as local business and charity support. Each home would have 3-4+ residents living there (depending on the size of the home) The residents for each home would be selected on the basis of their monthly incomes, with each home including a mix of upper, middle and lower income residents to insure a sufficient income stream to take care of home costs (mortgage, utilities, food). Each person in the home would be required to pay only their monthly income (be it Social Security or other pension or income source), allowing for spousal support, if that were an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Staffing for each home would include a small number of full-time professional staff (again, supported by State funding/Federal grant support) as well as MANDATORY VOLUNTEERS comprised of family members/friends</em></strong>. A REQUIREMENT OF RESIDENCY IN THE HOME IS THAT FAMILY MEMBERS/FRIENDS <em>MUST</em> WORK A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF HOURS/WEEK IN THE HOME. The less income a person living in the home has to provide to the home for his /her care, the more hours would be required of their family/friends as "sweat equity" to support the home. Volunteers would undergo criminal background checks and mandatory drug testing at their own expense. They would also undergo possible inservice/orientation training. THEIR ATTENDANCE FOR WORK SHIFTS AT THE HOME WOULD BE MANDATORY. Not showing up for their scheduled weekly times could result in their family member/friend being expelled from the home. (Family members could substitute time shifts for each other, provided they were in-serviced/screened to work at the home.) These volunteers would take care of all home needs such as meal preparation, home maintenance (cleaning, lawn work, home repair, etc.), driving residents to appointments, socializing with residents, etc. They would also complete select activities with their own family members, such as bathing and when working their shift, dressing their family member, as possible. Their general supervision and schedules would be established by the permanent staff. Given the presence of the volunteers, at any given time, there would be a minimum of a one-to-one or greater staff-to-resident ratio. That is, there would always be optimal supervision, socialization, and attention given to each resident and their individual needs. Also, given that family members would always be working at the home, <em>everyone would have a vested interest in the success of the home</em>. This arrangement would also insure that family members/friends would have exposure to Alzheimers/senior needs and care and the aging process, resulting in a more educated, informed population with respect to these issues. Finally, family members and staff would have an available, in-house network of support, to assist with any issues or emotions they might be experiencing as family members/caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Salaries of the permanent staff, although possibly a government expense, would be small in comparison to the increased burden to the State and Federal governments of escalating healthcare costs. For example, how much would Medicare and Medicaid save in not having persons with Alzheimer's over-medicated, incorrectly medicated and/or in and out of emergency rooms/hospitals/doctor's offices for preventable problems, not to mention the costs of taking care of the health issues of their family/friend care-givers? How much would Medicaid save in not having to provide indigent care to these individuals once they've exhausted all their resources?? These cost savings could be enormous.</p>
<p>A further benefit to the healthcare system might be in the training of professionals dealing with Alzheimer's care and care of the elderly given that resident physicians and other professionals in geriatric medicine might staff the homes or be on-call for the homes, increasing their direct exposure to aging individuals and those with Alzheimer's. Such an arrangement might significantly decrease the need for emergency room visits, doctor's visits, and hospital stays for persons with Alzheimer's. This would also increase professional education/experience and, as a result, might dramatically decrease healthcare costs for this population. An alternate model might include established physicians volunteering some of their time to examining residents of the homes or consulting with the permanent staff in the homes re: health issues of the residents, again eliminating unnecessary use of the medical system.</p>
<p>Residents would stay in the home, with hospice care as needed, until the end of their lives. Transfers to nursing homes might be needed in some cases. When a resident left the home permanently, another resident on the registry (waiting list) would take that individual's place, preferably matched on the basis of financial criteria to insure the continued viability of the home.</p>
<p>If less homes are needed at some time in the future (possibly due to effective Alzheimer's treatments or a cure), homes could either be sold with the purchasing agent (State or Federal government) recouping the costs + profit OR the registry model and homes could be used for those with different, chronic health issues, such as housing for adults with Autism. THIS MODEL OF CARE WOULD <em>NOT</em> AFFECT CURRENT DELIVERY MODELS in that there will always be a need for existing assisted living facilities for persons who do not want to relocate close to family members/friends, have sufficient funds to be cared for as part of different care models or in their own homes, who prefer current facilities, and/or have significant medical needs to require nursing home care. WHAT IMPLIMENTATION OF THIS MODEL PREVENTS IS THE PROFLIFERATION OF NEW FACILITIES AND THE ESCALATING COSTS TO CONSUMERS, WHO, ALONG WITH LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, WILL BE CRUSHED BY THEM.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><strong>In conclusion, we all know that something MUST be done to care for persons with Alzheimer's. The current model of care delivery, whether done at home or in a facility, is UNSUSTAINABLE for the majority of citizens</strong>. It is crushing to care-givers, the government, the business community, and society at large. The care given to the person with Alzheimer's is often inadequate. The current model will destroy our healthcare system and economy if something isn't done soon to change it. And the human toll is most significant, for persons with Alzheimer's as well as their family members, friends, and community at large.</p>
<p><strong>What is needed is a dramatically different model of care deliver AT THE STATE LEVEL with Federal support. It must be not for profit to contain costs. It must be a model in which all levels of government (local, state, federal) work with patients, families and local businesses to provide compassionate, dignified, and quality care to persons with Alzheimer's until the end of their lives</strong>. Our country is well positioned to show the world how this can be done, and Florida, with its large elderly population, should be at the forefront of this effort. If we can put a man on the moon 40 years ago, we can solve this health care crisis and show the rest of the country and world how it can be done!</p>

<p>The following are comments left by my readers regarding the draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan. Thank you for developing this plan and soliciting feedback!</p>
<p>(1) Jim says:</p>
<p>Back in 1961 president John F. Kennedy made a commitment of going to the moon. Then in 1969 NASA accomplish that goal, so if you do the math it only took about 8 years. Why does the government feel it would take only13 years to find a cure for Alzheimers? The drug industry have tried for years.in finding a cure. Meanwhile, the skilled nursing homes are being filled with dementia/Alzheimers victims in different stages that either end up dying of malnutrition or pneumonia. The disease is rapidly growing out of control as we are living longer.I fear the time to address this problem has already passed.</p>

					(2) C. Danesi says:</p>
<p>Its up to us as the americans who are caregivers for those afflicted to get involved with the council and help drive their progress so that it wont take 13 more years.i arranged care for my mom who has severe alzheimers and traveled to Washington to be involved with the councils first meeting.im on a limited budget.We can make this happen-We must!thankyou carla danesi glorias daughter "remember gloria,gloria lives"</p>
<p>January 16, 2012 at 5:10 pm<br />
					(3) T. Litz says:</p>
<p>In an effort to help people with Alzheimer's and their families the government should help financially by adding to medicare a provision to help pay for care givers, The cost of care is outragious. In the beginning some care and then 24/7. Nursing home options are just as expensive and take the quality of life away from individuals with dementia. When there is no money left and medicaid is the only option left the government intervenes. Then the Alzheimer's person has to have all their caregiver's changed to an approved medicaid agency. This change alone is frightening for the family and changes the relationships built up over years with private caregivers. My mother has had Alzheimer's for 9 years so far. Benefits from the VA have not been forthcoming for almost a year and seem almost unreachable. More documentation, more waiting and never an answer as to when her aide and attendance benefits will start or if she will ever even receive it. My father was a VET from World War II. I call the VA every 2 weeks and get no where. More documentation -the application was filed last Febuary and now almost a year later they are asking for more information/ medical information faxed 3 weeks ago and now they want financial documentation. It seems that they are waiting for my mom to die. Advocate all the time and get no where.</p>
<p>January 16, 2012 at 6:45 pm<br />
					(4) K. Lockhart says:</p>
<p>Besides the research that needs more money for this disease, medicare and other insurance companies need to support care in the home 24/7. My 83 year old mother can not do it for my dad who is 84. We have needed in home care for that past 2.5 years. We have been fortunate to afford the care so far but it isn't going to last. I do NOT want to put my father in a nursing home that still does not know how to care for Alzheimer or any other dementia patient.</p>
<p>Changes in the healthcae system to prepare and regulate whether or not they are in fact providing best practices for these patients is important. Without government interventions, families struggle inordinately financially, emotionally, and physically. The caregiving will kill my mom before anything else. Unless I quit my job to help, I can only do the weekends. Isn't it cheaper to keep him at home than place him?? Looks that way to me. Thanks, Kathy</p>
<p>January 16, 2012 at 11:16 pm<br />
					(5) M. Brennan says:</p>
<p>To prevent Alzheimer's disease, let's consider how people in countries with little Alzheimer's disease live (differences in diet? stress? sleep? environment? other differeces from us?)</p>
<p>Let's assure funding for any reasonable research proposal that could help prevent or delay Alzheimer's. The federal deficit is no excuse for skimping on this urgent need. The deficit will be far greater if we don't prevent or delay Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>January 17, 2012 at 12:38 am<br />
					(6) M. Monfredo says:</p>
<p>I will echo what others have said in regard to the need to fund home caregiving through a medicare provision. The cost of hiring someone from outside for even one day a week is prohibitively expensive for many families. It's far less expensive to society overall for Alzheimer's patients to remain in their homes and this fact should be reflected in financial relief to their primary caregivers. Until a cure is found, this financial need will become even more acute in our aging population.</p>
<p>January 17, 2012 at 6:29 am<br />
					(7) T. Mumby says:</p>
<p>I know it fantastically difficult for all of us to STOP, turn around, see the person with dementia as OUR teacher and learn what changes we have to make in ourselves to promote well-being in our lives.</p>
<p>Seeing our loved one as a SICK PATIENT compounds the agony.</p>
<p>How many more trillions of dollars will poured into the monster money eating pharmaceutical industry? (Are you watching our financial decline?)</p>
<p>The variety of behavioural challenges is the MAJOR problem.</p>
<p>Doctors, nurses and the medical model is for SICK people, not people who are challenging us and our own mental strength 24/7.</p>
<p>It is not really surprising to explain the difficult behaviour around people where dementia is being experienced.</p>
<p>Acute fear, panic, confusion, irrational actions are telling us to LEARN the art of conducting situations in a light creative style. When the lessons are mastered, the progression of dementia is about how well YOU are developing into a wise and kindly person through using your new skills.</p>

<p>For two years I cared for my Mom with Alzheimers. In her memory and to help people understand the need for long term care planning and the relationship of sons caring for moms with the disease I wrote, "My Million Dollar Mom." Here is the the link to information about the book: <a href="http://www.buybooksontheweb.com/product.aspx?ISBN=0-7414-6713-5">http://www.buybooksontheweb.com/product.aspx?ISBN=0-7414-6713-5</a></p>
<p>Research is very important. However, I see no mention of an effort to get Americans to plan ahead for the need for long term care. This must be part of an overall approach. Care giver subsidies will NOT work as an answer. With the budget constraints where will the money came from? What about care giver burn out. Family members need PROFESSIONAL care to assist them in caring the their loved ones. ONLY long term care insurance can provide enough dollars to pay for the services of home care agencies. Without a robust long term care insurance market the number of home care agencies thriving will be diminished and the burden will get worse not better.</p>
<p>I urge you to support education and incentives to encourage Americans to plan with their families for their future needs for care. The purchase long term care insurance, putting their legal documents in order and having a well thought out plan of how, who and where they should be cared for is essential.</p>
<p>Finally, on the budget side, as a long term care insurance agent my clients (including my Mom) have received more than $2 million in benefits from their policies. That is money their families did not have to lay out. That is money that our overly strained Medicaid budget did not have to come up with.</p>
<p>Please include advanced planning as part of this program.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

<p>I read the article in the New York Times today about the upcoming committee that will tackle the job of Alzheimer's and our governmentsrole and responsibility. I am a daughter of my 82 year old mother who has been living with this disease for the past seven years. My father, who is 88 years, has been amazing through this entire journey. In February, my mother fell down and broke her hip and my father finally agreed to let me bring someone in to help them 24/7.</p>
<p>This is not an easy task nor an inexpensive one. We are able to manage to have them home right now but the financial and emotional burden that is put upon us by this disease is difficult to describe in words. It is a shame that our government and our health care system does not allow for this type of help to be covered under medical plans. Yes, you can purchase long term care, but really, how many people really ever think about this type of insurance at an early age, before any disease kicks in and you don't qualify. My hope and dream is that this task force can develop a plan that will tackle not only government's role in funding medical research to wipe out this horrific disease, but also will look at the financial burden caregiving places on individual families and our nation. If we could find a cure for Alzheimer's, our nation would flourish. I know I am one small voice in a very big, big picture. I do my part to help every day. I actively fundraise for the Alzheimer's Association and support all causes that can lead to a cure. I am scared not only for my mom, but also for myself and my children. I don't want to go through what my mom is going through now and I certainly can't imagine passing this on to my children. It truly breaks my heart.</p>
<p>But I hope you will listen to my voice and if you ever need information from a person deep in the trenches, I would be happy to share my knowledge on to the committee. As I tell my friends and love ones, I fight for my mom's present and for all of our future!</p>
