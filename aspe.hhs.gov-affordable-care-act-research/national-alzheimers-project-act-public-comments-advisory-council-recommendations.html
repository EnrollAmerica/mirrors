<p>Please know your incredible commitment to families with Down syndrome in Flirida are making an enormous difference-have a wonderful weekend</p>

<p><strong>Letter of support to: ADVISORY COUNCIL ON ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH, CARE AND SERVICE</strong></p>
<p>I am the proud mother of Mr. DavidTringo. David is at your meeting today in person representing our family. It is hard to believe that 42 years ago I had David as a 20 year old young lady and was forced immediately to make a decision the Doctor posed; "we can have Willow Brook here in ten minutes-do you want to keep the baby?" I simply asked if he can cry when he is hungry and love me? The doctor said yes; and we went home.</p>
<p><em>February 3, 2014 Federal NAPA Advisory Committee Approves Recommendation 13</em></p>
<p><strong>I am writing to thank all of you for your courageous decision on February 3, 2014 approving Recommendation 13:</strong></p>
<p><em>HHS AND STATE LEAD ENTITIES SHOULD PARTNERTO ASSURE ACCESS TO THE EULL ARRAY OE LTSS FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OE PEOPLE WITH AD INCLUDING YOUNGER PEOPLE.NON-TRADITIONAL FAMILIES.PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUALDISABILITIES. SUCH AS DOWN SYNDROME. AND RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES WHO ARE AT INCREASED RISK OE ACQUIRING AD.</em></p>
<p><em>MY LIEELONC BURDEN OE CARE</em></p>
<p>For the past 42 years, I have not taken a vacation feeling it is my responsibility to always be by David's side providing his lifelong care. The early onset of dementia is almost too much to endure after providing lifelong care with fierce advocacy and now the accelerated pace of AD with Down syndrome. Preparing for this late battle with this insidious disease in David's life is especially painful since I just buried my Mom and Dad with Alzheimer's disease. I noticed the similar symptoms with David similar to my Parents but Doctors could not confirm the symptoms.</p>
<p><em>Erin Long is simply the best</em></p>
<p>Our Lucan us Center executive director traveled to Washington D.C. on February 3, 2014 and provided public testimony with National Chair Dr. Janicki. Upon returningto Florida, we were all very excited about the promising news to prepare a high quality dementia capable system for our children that was centered on our family. Our Florida Dementia Capable Model gives the funding to dementia care coordinators that create the dementia care plan together with the family.</p>
<p>During our newly created caregiver support groups focused on the death of our child Dr. Buckley kept mentioning Ms. Erin Long and Kate Gordon guiding our specialized dementia capable system. Dr. Buckley would comment on their incredible knowledge, passion and always speaking and seeking our solutions and not simply restating the problem or their solutions within the aging world.</p>
<p>On April 30, 2015 Ms. Erin Long came to Florida and attended the NTG/Lucanus unveiling of the NTG formal curriculum. Ms. Erin Long is an incredible young lady with a heart of gold that spoke of her family member experiencing Alzheimer's disease. She listened to aging caregivers and one in particular sticks in my mind. A father told of scolding his daughter and being so frustrated after APO and her behavior specialist said she needs to control her behavior and the parents need to set stricter rules.</p>
<p>The Father then said that everything she is doing is consistent with her recent diagnosis Alzheimer's disease and now he feels so guilty listening to behavior specialist knowing his daughter had no control of the behavior symptoms. Ms. Erin Long has taken our hopes and dreams for families to create person/family specialized dementia plans and made this a reality that all families deserve. We all speak of Erin and Kate often and acknowledge with a smile they are simply the best and listened to our every wish.</p>
<p>Your support of the Lucan us Center has changed the lives for thousands. David is fully engaged in all Healthy Brain activities and both David and I just sang together as Sonny and Cher in a local talent search. I truly believe David going to Lucan us and adherence to Healthy Brain principles is the reason he is so sharp and active today.</p>
<p>Thank you for creating Alzheimer's respite and now my husband and I took our first vacation in over 42 years to Charleston, SC. David had only vacationed with my husband and I for the past 42 years. David chose to go with his other family, the Buckley's. Tom and Kathy took David to New York City for 5 days and then to Tallahassee advocatingfor families with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. David had a wonderful time with his other "Mom and Dad' and really enjoyed advocating for others in need.</p>
<p>As a Mom, I could never thank you for all you have done for David and our family facing thisinsidious disease. It is hard to believe that just a few months ago our <strong>hopes and dreams were crushed when the local Alzheimer's Disability Resource Center chose not to provide Alzheimer's supports to people with Down syndrome after repeated request. The Lucanus Center and family's partnered with Florida SenatorSobel to sponsor the Florida legislature creating the Alzheimer's pilot for Intellectual Disabilities and Down syndrome. The Florida legislature 2015 appropriated $100,000 to the Lucanus center to create the Florida Alzheimer's waiver for intellectual disabilities and specifically Down syndrome.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On behalf of all families in South Florida with a family member with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, we are grateful for your leadership and your incredible ambassador of hope Erin Long. We vow to continue working endless hours until all Americans with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's along with their aging care giver are provided with high quality person centered dementia services and supports.</strong></p>

<p>At the last meeting I was so excited waiting to hear how much money the NIH was going to recommend to Congress for research into treatment for dementia. I was then so very disappointed when they asked for just 326 million dollars be added to the budget. Why so little in comparison to what they did for cancer or HIV, and with the counsel's recommendation of 2 billion dollars? Others agreed with the 2 billion dollar figure, which is why it is so surprising. After everyone has tried so hard, and we finally get the opportunity of a lifetime, we are let down by NIH. If I understand it correctly, part of the reason seemed to be that they would not be able to deal with it if they had more money coming in. It is my hope that the council will send their own record to the congress and let them know how this recommendation is wrong and that it should be much higher.</p>
<p>On a side note, 2 billion is not even enough. What about the people here today? Why are there no advertising campaigns for dementia awareness yet? Some of you think I am too critical of you, and I have paid dearly for that, but please don't you think we should have some sort of dementia awareness campaign?</p>
<p>I have mentioned this before. I once had access to being able to call in, but the new administration has decided that it is not possible. Some of theCounsel members even recommended this should be addressed as the technology available today makes it very simple. I want to make it happen. When I reached out to the ADA they said a government agency must provide reasonable accommodations for a person like me. If I can no longer write or have problems driving, reasonable accommodations must be made. When they were all ready to help reinforce this, I was told they could not because it was HHS. They said they could help with any other government agency but not HHS. I am starting to wonder why things are different for HHS alone. HHS can take the lead here. Sending in an email is not the same as me being able to verbalize what I want to say. An email sent in advance also fails to capture what happens just before and during the meeting. Please reconsider your decision as I would like to be able to call in for our next meeting.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to be given the opportunity to be here again after having been banned from the last meeting. In life I have always tried to learn from my mistakes. While I heard you loud and clear on your expectations, I don't believe you fully understand what can be expected from people with dementia. If you are going to write policies and procedures on this issue, then you must clearly understand what this disease will do to people like me. We do lose our filters and say the wrong things at times. We also will do strange things in public that we would never have done when our brains were fully functioning. If you are going to educate the rest of the world then it is important for you to understand it first. Only then can you shed light on these issues and encourage others on how best to deal with us without trying to remove us from society. Please don't create more negative stigma, and don't make us feel worse because you don't understand how horrible this disease can be.</p>
<p>Before all this happened I was doing really great in my advocacy and knew what I needed to do each day. This action had a huge impact on me. I went from having a purpose to being completely derailed. I don't even know how to explain it, but I just cannot seem to get back on track to do what I once did best. I had reinvented myself to have a new purpose in life, which was not easy. While I cannot prove it, I do believe this incident has led to a much faster decline in the course of my disease. It is so important to realize this as your actions could have significant impact when dealing with those with dementia. I have lost my purpose and just can't seem to get back to where I was.</p>
<p>I belong to many groups, and I would like to share one post I recently read. It is called "Desperately Need to Share My Letter to God"</p>
<p>" Dear Heavenly Father,</p>
<p>I've reached my point of final desperation. I cannot go on like this much longer. I truly hate the disease that is taking my mother from me and Satan has taken hold of my leg and won't let me go making it even more difficult to handle.</p>
<p>For much of my life I never really knew my mom, but in the last 5 years that she has been living with me, I've come to learn that I love her more than anything. I am at the point where I can't bear to watch her suffer like this. It is tearing me up inside both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>While she is not in any physical pain, this disease is wreaking havoc with her brain. She is on an emotional roller coaster and is taking me along on its chaotic ride.</p>
<p>I am thankful to still have her but it is destroying me to see her struggle like this. I'm also still thankful that she can still take direction, but the unknown is for how much longer.</p>
<p>I finally accept the fact that I am fast becoming unable to care for her and in spite of how I have felt about her doctors telling me she needs to be in a nursing home, I fear they are right. I don't want to be my mother's caregiver any longer as it is just too painful. What I want is to just be her daughter again.</p>
<p>Her quality of life is just about zero. There isn't anything that she can do on her own any more . . . she needs help with everything. She has lost interest in her computer and she's bored with tv. She spends about 90% of her life sleeping. And when she is awake she's continually asking me why I hate her so much. How can I hate her so much if I keep taking her home rather than leaving her in the nursing homes, I've virtually given up living in my own home to be with her, I see that she gets to the doctor, I see that she gets dressed, that she has her 3 meals a day and her snacks and then sit here listening to her tell me that I don't love her, and again, why do I hate her so much (and each time it feels like a knife being stabbed into my already hurting heart).</p>
<p>I hear her cry out in her sleep for you to please take her in her sleep. She thinks that you too don't want her. She keeps asking me to help her because she doesn't understand what is happening to her brain and all I can say is that it's slowing down now that she is 95.</p>
<p>Please Heavenly Father, I really don't want to put her into a nursing home as I know that she will believe that I don't want her any more and that couldn't be further from the truth. I know it is your decision as to when it's time for us to enter this world and to leave it and I pray that you will soon answer her prayer and allow her to pass as she lay in my arms and not alone in a nursing home.</p>
<p>I'm sure you're aware that I have not been the best Catholic, but I am sure I don't fall into the classification of being the worst either. I beg on bended knees that you please answer her prayer and take her back home to those of her family who have already left this earth.</p>
<p>With love and reverence,</p>
<p>I remain your Daughter "</p>
<p>I see this all the time. Caregivers and patients are desperate and they have nowhere to turn. I think the answer is so simple. With the right website posing the right questions we could easily help people like this that are crying out for assistance.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Statement of:<br />
					Ian N. Kremer, Esq.<br />
					Executive Director<br />
					Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (LEAD Coalition)</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon. My name is Ian Kremer and I serve as executive director of Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (the LEAD Coalition). The LEAD Coalition is a diverse and growing national coalition of 76 member organizations [<a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/">http://www.leadcoalition.org/who-we-are/our-members/</a>] including patient advocacy and voluntary health non-profits, philanthropies and foundations, trade and professional associations, academic research and clinical institutions, home and residential care providers, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. LEAD is co-convened by the Alzheimer's Foundation of America and USAgainstAlzheimer's. The coalition works collaboratively to focus the nation's strategic attention on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and to accelerate transformational progress in: detection and diagnosis; care and support to enrich quality of life; and research leading to prevention, effective treatment and eventual cure. For more information about the LEAD Coalition, please contact me at: ikremer@leadcoalition.org.</p>
<p>Typically, my public comments at the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services meetings are based on what has been presented and discussed by Advisory Council members to that point in the meeting day. In light of the recent request for comments to be submitted several days in advance of the meeting, this document submitted on July 22 attempts to anticipate what I might wish to say on July 27. I hope that the Advisory Council will forgive me any extemporaneous remarks that I might offer during the public comment session on July 27.</p>
<p>I must begin by recognizing HHS staff and Secretary Burwell for the recently published <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease: 2015 Update</em> [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/NatlPlan2015.shtml">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/NatlPlan2015.shtml</a>]. The 2015 Update reflects enormous good work done to date and constructive work being planned. It is particularly valuable that the 2015 Update reminds us all that the National Alzheimer's Project Act called for a 'national' rather than 'federal' plan. While many of us outside government will continue to call for even more robust federal efforts in a number of areas (including and particularly areas in which the 2015 Update appears to come up short of the Advisory Council's recommendations), it is essential that those of us in the private sector continue to look for ways in which we can collaborate with federal partners and work to fill gaps in federal efforts. Exemplary of productive collaboration between private and federal partners is the recently announced launch of the Dementia Friendly America initiative [<a href="http://www.dfamerica.org/">http://www.dfamerica.org/</a>] to build dementia friendly communities across the country. More than 50 national organizations and several federal agencies have worked together closely to reach this starting point. Our success depends on that collaboration growing more robust, more imbedded in the organizational cultures of our public and private partners, and on us sustaining our moral and substantive commitment to be guided in our work by those who rightly measure our results: people with dementia and their loved ones whose quality of life we seek to transform. National organizations interested in learning more about the Dementia Friendly America initiative are encouraged to contact us at: partners@dfamerica.org.</p>
<p>I also want to take a moment to thank the organizers, sponsors, attendees, presenters, and journalists reporting on last week's Alzheimer's Association International Conference [<a href="https://www.alz.org/aaic/">https://www.alz.org/aaic/</a>]. It isn't enough that important science be conducted. It must be exposed to scrutiny, put in context, disseminated among colleagues, and understood by those who fund, who volunteer, who stand to benefit. Children wonder how Santa delivers all those packages in a single night; I wonder how Maria Carrillo herds 4,000 scientists for a week. Somehow -- perhaps with the help of Alzheimer's Association elves -- magic happens and we're all the better for it.</p>
<p>Today's Advisory Council meeting focus on non-Alzheimer's dementias [<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/meetings.shtml#Jul2015">http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/meetings.shtml#Jul2015</a>] -- while overdue -- is highly encouraging. I hope it represents a sustained commitment both to discuss and to substantively address these issues more consistently in the Advisory Council and National Plan Update processes. Certainly, the upcoming ADRD Summit organized by NINDS provides another important pivot point for the Advisory Council and Plan Update processes to engage non-Alzheimer's dementias more effectively.</p>
<p>While we all ought to be sympathetic to the limitations of time and other resources available to the Advisory Council, to make the Plan genuinely 'national' and not only 'federal,' it is essential to find creative, manageable and productive ways to add more -- and more diverse -- voices. A number of us have encouraged expansion of the Advisory Council to include both more appointees living with dementia and more representatives from non-Alzheimer's dementia communities. Those remain good, constructive, and achievable recommendations; as private sector stakeholders, we are ready to work with our federal partners to achieve the achievable. Similarly, I would encourage collaboration between private sector stakeholders and our federal partners to find new and better ways for people to participate in the Advisory Council process even if they are unable to attend the quarterly meetings in Washington or do not want to be limited to submitting written comments or watching a live-streaming video. While those options may be sufficient for some, clearly they are inadequate for many. Just to offer one example (and I have others), with support from private sector stakeholders, it ought to possible to conduct regularly scheduled public input listening sessions around the country, attended by Advisory Council members either in person or at least by video feed who then could report back to the full Advisory Council.</p>
<p>This is a time of great and deserved hope in dementia. No one could miss the depth and breadth of attention devoted to dementia throughout the White House Conference on Aging (thank you Nora Super, AARP, and everyone else who led and contributed). We all anticipate anxiously NIH's so-called "bypass budget" [<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/features/nih-estimate-total-funding-needs-alzheimers-research">https://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/features/nih-estimate-total-funding-needs-alzheimers-research</a>] recommendation for federal funding needed to reach the 2025 goal. The advocacy and research communities have been vigorous in encouraging NIH to be bold in its recommendation and take confidence in the legislation put forward by the House and Senate appropriations committees along with the 21st Century Cures legislation. Shortly after the Advisory Council's last meeting, 137 LEAD Coalition member organizations and other supporters submitted to HHS a recommendation that federal agencies and private sector stakeholders partner to organize and conduct a dementia care and services research summit [<a href="http://www.leadcoalition.org/?wpfb_dl=158">http://www.leadcoalition.org/?wpfb_dl=158</a>]. HHS recently responded that Secretary Burwell will ask the Advisory Council for guidance so -- on behalf of those 137 signatories -- I'll take this opportunity to encourage the Advisory Council to advise the Secretary to be bold in collaborating with us to identify research gaps and priorities as well as opportunities to translate and scale what we know already to be effective in improving the quality of life for the most important stakeholders: people living with dementia and their care partners. And in the best interests of those most important stakeholders, we will begin now with our private sector partners to develop the resources necessary to conduct such a summit as soon as our federal partners are ready to join us.</p>
<p>The need for wide dissemination of effective care and services interventions is highlighted in part by the recently released report <em>Caregiving in the U.S. 2015</em> [<a href="http://www.caregiving.org/caregiving2015/">http://www.caregiving.org/caregiving2015/</a>]. I would encourage the Advisory Council to invite Gail Hunt from the National Alliance for Caregiving and Susan Reinhard from AARP to provide a briefing about the report at an upcoming Advisory Council meeting, with a particular focus on care involving people with dementia.</p>
<p>In closing, I offer my apologies for topics I have failed to address and my thanks to others making public comments addressing my omissions. I offer my appreciation to Advisory Council members and staff who give of their minds and hearts beyond what words can express. I offer my hope to all those living with dementia and their loved ones that they will be heard, heeded, and healed through the work we all do together.</p>

<p>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>Again, I want to commend the Council on its recommendations to "prepare a workforce that is competent to deliver care to persons with advanced dementia and their families." This, seemingly, was included in the 2015 Plan Update under Goal 2, Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care . Specifically, I think the information presented in several sections about the positive impact of the Geriatric Education Centers (GECs) highlights the great work that these institutes have achieved. As I mentioned in previous comments to this Council, the National Certification Board for Alzheimer Care (NCBAC) was encouraged that there would be a greater focus placed on the "training and education of the direct care workforce and lay/family caregivers".</p>
<p>As many of you know, HHS and HRSA announced on Monday at the White House Conference On Aging a new program that would do away with these GECs and replace them with a new 3-year round of funding entitled "Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program" (GWEP). I want to draw attention to the fact that this newly-announced funding has excluded many of the current GECs. Two cases in point: South Florida, with its 1.5 million residents aged 65 and older, which includes approximately 215,600 residents, and their care partners, who are believed to have Alzheimer's Disease or a related dementia, will no longer have access to educational funding through GWEP. Additionally, the State of Georgia, no longer will receive funding for its residents through the new GWEP funding. There are many other areas of the country that will not have access to funding for geriatric and Alzheimer/dementia education.</p>
<p>I bring this up so that this Council is aware that although there is an increase in annual funding to $35 million for workforce training, of which around $3.3 million annually was awarded for dementia education, the inequity of how the awards were granted according to geographic locations is <strong>puzzling</strong>. Less states and regions received funding. In total 23 of the currently funded GECs did not receive funding from the GWEP funding. I hope that the numbers of healthcare professionals and consumers served that were included in the 2015 Update will continue to improve for the 2016 Update, but I'm afraid the Administration will be forced to put an asterisk after these numbers stating that not all areas of the country benefitted from the GWEP funding.</p>
<p>Thank you, again, for the dedication that each of you brings to this devastating disease, of which the numbers are growing from a national and global perspective. I hope that one day there won't be a need to have these meetings because Alzheimer's disease and related dementias will be health concerns of the past!</p>

<p>We would like to thank and commend Co-chairs Laurel Coleman, M.D., and Susan Mitchell, M.D. as well as the staff of Institute of Medicine, for inviting us to the recently concluded series of meetings on advanced dementia care. Observing the discussions on research, innovative program models and policy was stimulating, and reflected a deep commitment on the part of the presenters and IOM to promoting person-centered dementia care. The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) strongly supports the resulting recommendations for the 2015 update of the National Plan to address Alzheimer's disease, developed in consultation with the experts invited to speak at the IOM meetings, and presented on January 26 by Dr. Mitchell and Laurel Coleman, M.D. Chair of the clinical care sub-committee of the NAPA advisory council.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the National Alzheimer's Plan defines "Alzheimer's disease" to include related disorders, it is important to note that existing research, policy and models of care in advanced dementia focus exclusively on an older adult and frail elderly dementia population. Persons with younger-onset dementias and their families face additional complex needs throughout the course of the disease, including in advanced stages. To be consistent with the aims of NAPA, any plan for advanced dementia care must therefore address the needs of the entire dementia population, including those affected by rarer, younger-onset disorders, such as frontotemporal degeneration (FTD).</p>
<p>FTD disorders are distinct from elderly dementia and Alzheimer's disease in two important aspects: they have an earlier age of onset; and cause impairment in executive functioning, language and movement, rather than memory. The age of onset is usually between 45 and 65 years but FTD can affect people as early as their 20's. While the aging services network is the principle provider of services needed by people with FTD, individuals and families are routinely denied services because they do not meet age eligibility, criteria and providers do not understand their needs</p>
<p>Recommendations to improve advanced dementia care including access to palliative care and hospice, preparation of a competent workforce, establishment of quality metrics, and leveraging policy and payment mechanisms to ensure high quality, person-centered care are necessary but grounded in elderly dementia and not sufficient to address the needs of younger persons with dementia and their families. For example:</p>
<ul><li>Hospice criteria for dementia must reflect an understanding of the erratic course of disease and varied end of life symptoms in a younger person with advanced frontotemporal degeneration. Predicting the last six months of life in persons with FTD can be especially challenging; and the lack of specific criteria for appropriately initiating referrals for hospice services means many medical providers and FTD families do not benefit from this important resource.</li>
<li>Research has shown that the difficulty obtaining a diagnosis of FTD, the early age of onset, and the presence of behavioral symptoms contribute to greater caregiver burden in FTD compared to Alzheimer's disease. Families facing FTD are more likely to be at the height of careers and family life; coupled with a higher burden of disease management, this can easily preempt discussions around plans for future healthcare needs and reduces the use of advanced directives or other tools to clarify vital care choices prior to medical crises.</li>
<li>Education on the distinct diagnostic, medical and psychosocial characteristics and needs of persons with FTD disorders is sorely lacking and much needed for geriatricians, palliative care physicians, neurologists, psychiatrists, primary care physicians and other healthcare providers who serve people with advanced dementia across federal and state long-term services and supports.</li>
<li>People with FTD face many difficult care transitions as the disease progresses. Poor coordination of services and the lack of access to appropriate care in the community frequently result in costly psychiatric inpatient admissions, greater use of psychotropic medications and increased utilization of high-cost care in advanced stages of the disease.</li>
</ul><p>Anecdotally, we know that the medical, behavioral and psychosocial needs of persons with younger-onset dementia differ from elderly persons with advanced dementia; yet health policy research initiatives typically focus on an elderly population and exclude data on individuals under 65. Additional mechanisms are needed to fill knowledge gaps and track the functional and cognitive trajectories of people with FTD or other forms of younger-onset dementia in order to fully inform and improve the quality of advanced dementia care.</p>
<p>As the Advisory Council considers the recommendations developed through the advanced dementia meetings at IOM and the important issues surrounding advanced dementia, AFTD implores you to not neglect the needs of people with FTD and other forms of dementia, many of whom are under age 65 and not adequately represented in current thinking about advanced dementia care focused on the elderly population. Some possible mechanisms to ensure this broader perspective are:</p>
<ul><li>Include representatives from FTD and other younger-onset dementias in the development and implementation of the goals and strategies in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease to improve care in advanced dementia</li>
<li>Promote initiatives to fund and conduct research into the health care utilization of persons under age 65 with dementia and develop innovative models of care for persons with advanced younger-onset dementia.</li>
<li>Expand and develop services under Title III of the Older Americans Act to include people with younger-onset dementia.</li>

<p>My mom fell yesterday and shattered/dislocated her shoulder, requiring surgery later today. I am working from home to be available to my mom and stepdad for updates and to help advocate as needed.</p>
<p>So, I won't be there in person to make a public comment. If possible, please read my comment, which is pasted below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Comment by Sue Peschin, President and CEO, Alliance for Aging Research.</strong></p>
<p>I fully support the suggestion by Sheila Burke to move the time frame for National Plan recommendations back to October to give more time to the process. While HHS works hard to get the slides up, seeing them only two days before they are presented hardly provides enough time for thoughtful deliberation, let alone for council members to vote on recommendations that will potentially affect millions of Americans.</p>
<p><strong>On the Long-term services and supports subcommittee recommendations</strong>:<br />
					The LTSS recommendations are way too general and provide no benchmarks for which agency should specifically execute which task, what the timing of each task should be, or how much federal and/or private funding may be needed. For example, one of the recommendations states that HHS should support state initiatives for dementia-capable systems by "Providing coordinated Alzheimer's disease related activities across state agencies through an identified state lead entity with adequate funding from Congress." What activities should they coordinate? Though which agencies? What would "adequate funding from Congress" mean? The CMS recommendations in particular have tremendous potential but they are not properly mapped out. For example, what needs to happen for CMS to allow for care planning when the patients isn't there--do we need a new code for providers to have time to counsel/train family or is there an existing code that could be expanded?</p>
<p>Big kudos for #5 that calls on Congress to fund the recommendations and even mentions an amount for one of them.Please add the Lifespan Respite Program to calls for funding the ADSSP and NFCSP programs. Estimates for these can be found in the authorizing language and/or with caregiving groups.</p>
<p><strong>On the advanced dementia work</strong>:<br />
					This work is very impressive and so important. My only comment here is that this community, knowing what we know about Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, has something very important to say to policymakers about the value of giving people with serious illness the freedom to make more informed choices about their care, and the power to have those choices honored. So, whether we might support The Care Planning Act, introduced by Senators Isakson and Warner, and/or the Advanced Planning and Compassionate Care Act, introduced by Senators Collins and Rockefeller--we should include a bold step here that advanced care planning needs to start sooner, along with the patient's healthcare professionals, and it should be covered by Medicare and Medicaid. A lot of complications of care mentioned here could be avoided if more folks had a plan. So, please consider including a bigger picture policy recommendation to help support all of the other great recommendations you suggest.</p>
<p><strong>On clinical care</strong>:<br />
					A while back, Helen LaMont asked the question about whether HHS should consider creating a public education campaign about recognizing cognitive impairment and getting checked out. It would be great to see something in the 2015 Plan about engaging CMS and CDC in a campaign to encourage providers to look for it as part of the Wellness Visit, and for families to flag problems. The Wellness visit has been in existence for 4 years now and very little to nothing has been done to take advantage of it and get more folks identified. If we said 50 percent of people with CVD were missed by clinicians each year, heart groups would hit the roof.</p>
<p><strong>On research</strong>:<br />
					It's wonderful that you included a request. Policymakers want to know how much these dementia diseases cost for research, clinical care, and long-term care. The professional judgment budget happened because feds from NIH would not provide members of Congress with a straight answer about how much was needed.</p>
<p>ASK FOR WHAT YOU NEED. BE BOLD AND BE SPECIFIC. LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON YOU. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING!</p>
<p>No worries if it cannot be read. I hope all goes well with the meeting and that you all stay warm and safe today.</p>

<p>It was nice to see you all at the last meeting. What I am about to say should not be taken in any negative way about you, as I have the highest regard for all of you. I have four key points I would like to make. They are by no means in order of importance as they are all of the highest importance and should be treated as such:</p>
<p><strong>Urgency</strong> is a word that I believe should and must be in your plan, preferably at the top of your list. I am very unsure as to why this word was not considered given that this disease is our greatest national health and economic threat in this century. <strong>Lack of action now will have serious consequences</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Council Representation by People living with dementia</strong> -- As one who has sat through and heard many Council meetings, I am convinced that you need a few people living with early-stage dementia as Council members. They bring a unique perspective and feedback to the issues you are addressing, just as the caregiver representatives do. It is very frustrating to be a public observer at these meetings because there are issues that I am "uniquely qualified" to address; but am not allowed to do so. I believe listening to the needs and preferences of those actually living with this condition would enable the Council to "take a new view" on the importance of honoring our personhood; having community-based services to enable meaningful participation in our communities and our nation. You have heard all this before. <strong>THE TIME IS LONG OVERDUE TO ENHANCE COUNCIL REPRESENTATION</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong> - As an outsider I believe lack of full transparency is a serious issue for this Council. It should not matter whether you are from the government or the private sector. When you are on this committee you should all be equal to each other except for the chair. All information should be shared.</p>
<p>NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PROJECT ACT - PUBLIC LAW 111--375--JAN. 4, 2011</p>
<p>Based on the comments I heard at the committee meeting I was appalled by some of the possible misunderstanding of what power The Advisory Council. This group should all be on the same level playing field and titles should not matter other than for the chair of the committee. Every single person has the capability of making recommendations without any concerns of financials. All recommendations should be consider and recommended that actual benefit those with dementia. Both the Federal and Non-Federal members have the right to submit their recommendations to Congress. Below is a sentence from the law.</p>
<p><strong>ANNUAL REPORT.--The Advisory Council shall provide to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the Secretary's designee and Congress</strong></p>
<p>The legislation says that the Advisory Council will pass its findings on to Congress, and leaves it open so that the findings can go <strong>directly</strong> to Congress from the AC, or can go from the AC, to the Secretary of HHS and then on to Congress.</p>
<p>I find it sad that the government officials felt they could not share this information with their own members when in reality the recommendations could be seen by anyone in the world with Internet access as soon as they were posted to the ASPE website. While the public may not see the transmittal to Congress in its entirety, and clarity on who it was sent to, The Advisory Council should have access to this information.</p>
<p>I consider that extremely disrespectful to your colleagues. I personally saw this problem when you had removed the public comments. After many complaints I was assured it would be resolved; but a year has gone by and there is still no change.</p>
<p><strong>Expectations</strong> - I believe that some on members of the Advisory Council have the wrong idea about the expectations for their role. You have been chosen to play a very critical role. This came down from the President. He tasked all of you to identify the problems in dementia research, treatment and care and provide recommendations to advance efforts across all these areas. What an honor. You need to think differently in this role. For all of us who are living with dementia, we need the Council to examine our needs regarding better dementia care services and supports so that we can remain living in our communities as long as possible with our families. The Council needs to consider: What are the resources and funding needed to make that happen; and include them in specific recommendations. We all want a cure and understand that takes a great deal of funding. But <strong>millions of us are living with dementia right NOW and NEED community-based service recommendations NOW</strong>. You all have the opportunity to make one of the biggest impacts in your life. I and so many others are counting on you to do this. Don't be the person to kill the idea before it is presented.</p>
<p>Make the recommendations for what is needed to assist people living with dementia remain in their communities. Tell Congress what they need to spend to actually make those recommendations a reality, including research. Let the President and top government officials make the final decision. It is your mission to tell them the truth of what is needed; not to determine if it is possible or can even be funded. Yes, you may be asking for too much, but you will be doing what millions of us living with dementia need and want.</p>
<p>Today I believe many of the comments made and actions taken create short falls of reaching inspired goals. Please change that for me and the others that are truly counting on you. That would mean so much to me.</p>
<p>I truly hope I did not upset you again, but someone needs to speak up for all of us.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>STATEMENT FOR THE RECORD SUBMITTED TO THE<br />
					Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services<br />
					U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center">April 29, 2014</p>
<p>AARP appreciates the opportunity to comment as the Advisory Council prepares to make 2014 recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease (National Plan). AARP's mission is to enhance the quality of life for all as we age. Living independently, connected to family, friends and community is key to a high quality of life. As we age, a decline in cognitive health is not only one of people's greatest fears, but it is also one of the greatest threats to living independently and a high quality of life. As with all family caregivers and the loved ones they are helping, tangible steps can be taken to improve the quality of care, quality of outcomes, and quality of life for people living with dementia and their family caregivers. As this country moves forward with the National Plan goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025, we also need to move forward with more effective care for those already affected by dementia, including better care coordination and planning, better access to affordable care, and support for family caregivers who take care of their loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>A. Translate evidence-based, person and family-centered care into widespread practice. </strong></p>
<p>It is important to expand person and family-centered care models broadly to reach the tens of millions of people and their families who could benefit from them. We know that person and family-centered models of dementia care that emphasize continuity of care and coordinate across settings and providers can also improve outcomes. Thanks to academic researchers across the country and the support from federal agencies who are represented on the Advisory Council such as the National Institutes of Health, the Administration for Community Living, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, we have developed an evidence-base from which we can implement better care.<sup>1</sup> In some cases, in addition to improving individual outcomes, we can even deter or delay expensive, disruptive, unwanted hospitalization and institutionalization.<sup>2</sup> Both domestically and internationally, models of care exist which demonstrate interventions that preserve abilities, improve behaviors, and reduce caregiver burden. These models show that we can do more to help those with a diagnosis of dementia -- and find ways to do it in responsible, cost-effective ways.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Despite the evidence that we can improve outcomes for people with dementia, these models of care are unfortunately neither widely known nor widely adopted. All too often, people either go untreated, or even after diagnosis, think there is nothing that can be done. It is important to educate people with dementia and their family caregivers that medical, social and behavioral interventions can help even while we struggle to find a cure for the future. <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>That is why AARP urges the Council to redouble their efforts around goals 2 and 3 of the plan:<br />
					Goal 2: To enhance care quality and efficiency and<br />
					Goal 3: Expand supports for people with Alzheimer's disease and their families.</p>
<p>More broadly, individuals and their family caregivers should be made aware of interventions that can help them.</p>
<p><strong>B. Apply evidence-based quality of care across all settings -- for those living at home receiving care through primary care settings, as well as in residential and institutional settings. </strong></p>
<p>Individuals should receive quality care no matter where they live. As the Advisory Council considers how to achieve the goal of enhanced quality and efficiency of care for those with dementia, it is critical to think about the care provided for those with dementia living in different types of settings. People often live with dementia for long periods of time -- and dementia manifests itself over a continuum of time and abilities. Therefore, quality care needs to adapt over a continuum as well.</p>
<p>AARP is striving to make it easier for older people to live with independence and remain in their homes and communities for as long as they can, surrounded by family and friends. People with dementia are often happier and have more control in their own familiar home, and with the right help and support, they too can continue to live independently.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>While we want people to have the option of living in their homes as long as possible, for some people, particularly those who face advanced stages of dementia, living in a residential setting or nursing home may be the best option for them. Clearly these people still want and deserve to live life on their terms, with dignity and respect, and need high quality care that is affordable and sustainable. Our emphasis on promoting independent living applies to people living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities as well as in home or other smaller community settings.</p>
<p><strong>C. Recognize that quality of care also must include family caregiver support. </strong></p>
<p>In 2009, about 42 million family caregivers in the United States provided care to an adult with limitations in daily activities at any given point in time. They provided unpaid care valued at $450 billion that year, more than total Medicaid spending in 2009 and more than twice the total for paid services and supports, according to AARP's Public Policy Institute.<sup>6</sup> The Alzheimer's Association estimates that more than 15 million of those caregivers are providing care for someone with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>While this concept is important in family caregiving broadly, best practices of care for those with dementia recognize caregiver well-being is essential to maintaining the well-being and abilities of the individual as well.<sup>8</sup> It has been clearly established that counseling and support for spousal caregivers of those with dementia benefit the individual, family caregiver and society. Individuals whose family caregivers received the counseling and support interventions designed by the New York University Caregiver Intervention Study compared to usual care experienced a 28.3% reduction in the rate of nursing home placement.<sup>9</sup> A 2012 report released by AARP's Public Policy Institute and the United Hospital Fund also found that almost half of family caregivers perform medical/nursing tasks for care recipients, such as managing multiple medications and helping with assistive devices for mobility.<sup>10</sup> Families generally do not receive training and other assistance to help them provide care. Such training and supports also benefit the person receiving the assistance.</p>
<p>We need to help the millions of family caregivers navigate the confusing care systems to provide assistance for their loved ones and otherwise support them in their caregiving roles. Family caregivers should be given an assessment of their needs and then receive help based on the assessment, especially when a care or discharge plan depends on a family caregiver voluntarily providing services to an individual. Such assistance should include information, training, counseling, links to community resources, help locating services, respite care, or other supports. In September, a federally appointed Commission on Long-Term Care released a report with important bipartisan recommendations to help build a better system to support individuals and their family caregivers nationwide. <sup>11</sup> Importantly, the Commission called for a national strategy to address the needs of family caregivers. The Commission specifically recommended assessing family caregivers and their needs in the care planning process, including family caregivers in patients' health records and as members of care teams, ensuring family caregivers have access to relevant information technology and, importantly, encouraging family caregiver interventions, including respite, training, and other supportive services. We need to provide the support and tools to all family caregivers so that both the recipient and provider of care can sustain themselves.</p>
<p><strong>D. Conclusion </strong></p>
<p>AARP is dedicated to improving the quality of care to all individuals who need long-term services and supports (LTSS) and supporting creative, innovative mechanisms by which that care can be personalized, delivered, evaluated and financed. We know that older adults with end stage dementia are some of the most complicated and expensive individuals with LTSS needs. They often are living with multiple chronic conditions -- and if we can improve the quality of care for those with dementia, we can use those lessons to improve the care for all people with LTSS needs. Focusing on concrete steps to deliver on goals 2 and 3 of the plan could help make significant strides to assist all older adults and their families.</p>

<p>I am submitting the enclosed 5-page statement to be read at the April 29, 2014 meeting of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services. My statement addresses the importance of determining the cause of dementia when it is recognized in medical practice.</p>
<p>I am a geriatric and cognitive neurologist. My clinical activities primarily involve the evaluation and care of patients with cognitive deficits. I wish to provide greater insight from the perspectives of practicing clinicians, patients, and their families. I propose that the Council adopt two recommendations as outlined in my statement:</p>
<ul><li>The Council should unequivocally, firmly and explicitly recommend that when dementia is identified, its cause should be determined.</li>
<li>The Council should prioritize research that expands the evidence base evaluating the value in clinical practice of knowing the cause of dementia.</li>
</ul><p>==========</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Public Comments to the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services</strong><br />
					Tuesday April 29, 2014</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide public comments to the Advisory Council. I am unable to attend today's meeting in person so I request that this statement be read to the Council. The content and motivations for this statement are entirely my own. Citations and conflicts of interest are listed in the written version of these comments I have submitted.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide public comments to the Advisory Council. I am a board-certified geriatric neurologist, Professor of Neurology and Senior Investigator in The Brain Institute at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. I direct the Center for Alzheimer's Care, Imaging and Research and I am Chief of the Division of Cognitive Neurology. Over the past 30 years I have maintained an active clinical practice as a cognitive neurologist. My clinical activities primarily involve the evaluation and care of patients with cognitive deficits. Our Center has a unique role. We are the sole academic dementia program in the Intermountain West, and our Cognitive Disorders Clinic is the primary referral center for 10% of the geographic United States. This provides a unique perspective I hope you will find helpful in your deliberations.</p>
<p>The single most significant factor impeding the care of patients is the lack of consensus about the value of knowing the cause of dementia. <strong>The Council should unequivocally, firmly and explicitly recommend that when dementia is identified, its cause should be determined</strong>. Patients with dementia and their families deserve the dignity and respect of knowing the cause of their illness. It should no longer be acceptable to have their problems simply dismissed as "dementia".</p>
<p>I see in my practice daily the adverse consequences when the cause of dementia is not identified. Without a known cause, treatment is chaotic, fragmented, and ineffective. Without a known cause, prognosis is uncertain and there is little care planning or support. I recently saw a highly educated patient with diabetes that exemplifies this problem. Although his diabetes always had been well controlled with insulin, his doctors several years ago began to notice he wasn't paying attention to his blood sugars. No mental status was performed (after all cognitive screening isn't a recommended procedure). When his family became increasingly concerned about his memory problems, they were told he just had dementia and was put on Aricept. Perhaps because of his physician's uncertainty of this course of treatment, he provided no counseling about what to expect. His family discontinued this drug when his memory problems continued. Later, he was prescribed a scopolamine patch when he went on a cruise; treatment that would clearly be contraindicated in Alzheimer's disease. He became dramatically worse -- his family never understood why. Meanwhile he continued to manage his own insulin. Predictably and unnecessarily if his dementia had been recognized as due to a progressive disease, he developed hypoglycemic seizures requiring emergency treatment and hospital admission. Just before I saw him a Medicare annual wellness visit was completed, but without an assessment of cognition (this is very common, even though supposedly required). His family became uncomfortable with the lack of guidance they had received. By the time of his first visit with me, he had severe memory loss, hesitant speech, was unable to name simple objects, copy simple figures or draw a clock. Even though he had trouble dressing and became very anxious when his wife left the room, he continued to drive. (His physician hadn't restricted driving or indicated his abilities might change. His wife had no support in his care, his daughter accompanying him didn't know what she should do to help, and they had not contacted the Alzheimer's Association. My evaluation led to the conclusion that he has Alzheimer's disease dementia, but that 3 small previously unsuspected strokes also had likely contributed to his relatively rapid decline. Now we can begin appropriate care and help his family avoid future care crises and manage a progressive dementing disease.</p>
<p>Dementia is not a medical diagnosis; it simply describes a syndrome that can be due to any of several dozen causes. It is inconceivable that a physician today would fail to determine the cause of chest pain, stroke, shortness of breath or any symptom as serious as dementia. Yet, this is the current state of affairs with dementia. Why? It is considered axiomatic that knowing the cause of a medical problem is necessary for appropriate treatment. Why isn't doesn't this seem to apply to dementia? Physicians usually vigorously pursue an accurate and precise diagnosis.</p>
<p>My clinical colleagues, health systems and insurers are all well aware that no existing guidelines require determining the cause of dementia. The American Academy of Neurology provides guidelines for what testing should be performed in a dementia evaluation, but offers no opinion regarding whether or not such a diagnostic evaluation should be undertaken (Knopman et al., 2001). Reportedly, this is because there is no supportive evidence from clinical trials! Who would suggest a randomized trial where a diagnostic evaluation is withheld from half of patients? Is there really equipoise about this question? The American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians guidelines for treatment of dementia fail to mention evaluation and seem to assume that determining causation is unexpected and unnecessary since treatment is discussed only on in the context of dementia syndrome (Qaseem et al., 2008). The Council through its recommendations and influence can begin to change expectations so that the cause of dementia always is sought.</p>
<p>The consequences of diagnostic nihilism are everywhere manifest. The US Prevention Services Task Force has decided not to recommend screening to detect cognitive impairment in primary care (Moyer et al., 2014). Insurers often have failed to reimburse testing shown to increase the accurate and confident understanding of causation, justifying this with the belief that the effort has no value. In this environment, the Council's important recommendation of early recognition and evaluation is unlikely to be implemented. The concept of precision care, embraced in other fields, and critical for improving quality, seems nearly unattainable unless we agree that cause of dementia is important.</p>
<p>Diagnostic nihilism also breeds therapeutic nihilism. If there is a feeling of "why bother" about determining the cause of dementia, then existing treatments also become dismissed. Needed services are not offered and we hear that there is no treatment for Alzheimer's (even among some experts). This nihilism often extends to families and has huge implications for care. When causation is irrelevant dementia care becomes unlinked to medical practice. As a result doctors can feel that dementia is just a social problem not of their concern (Connell et al., 1996). They justify using drug treatments simply to "offer something" rather than treat a disease (Franz et al., 2007). Determining the cause of dementia is difficult and time consuming. As long as insurers, health systems and professional societies find it acceptable, doctors will find it easier and financially advantageous to opt out of investigating the cause of dementia. The price is paid in the quality of care patients receive. How can we expect treatment to improve when those providing care don't even know what disease they are treating? How can patients and families make difficult life-changing decisions when they are uncertain about cause of the problem and its likely course?</p>
<p>The Council also can begin to change expectations through its recommendations about research. <strong>The Council should prioritize research that expands the evidence base evaluating the value in clinical practice of knowing the cause of dementia</strong>. Research centers should be encouraged to begin generating data addressing the relevance of improved accuracy and specificity of diagnosis. Validated measures of high quality care outcomes relevant to clinical care are necessary to change existing practice expectations among insurers and providers. Our concept of treatment should be expanded beyond drug treatments and to populations reflecting clinical practice, rather than highly selected groups needed for mechanistic and proof-of-concept studies.</p>
<p>We who are most committed to improving the quality of life of patients with dementia and their families must agree on the simple proposition that determining the cause of cognitive impairment should be a fundamental expectation in clinical practice. Peer expectations are critical in clinical practice. We must help define those expectations. Otherwise, our patients will be sentenced forever to poor quality care. Caring without knowing causation is well-intentioned kindness, but it's not medicine.</p>

<p>Good morning, Please see attached for comments from ResearchersAgainstAlzheimer'sregarding the "Interim Milestones to Complete the First Goal of the National Alzheimer's Plan by 2025" that were included in the recommendations unanimously approved earlier this year by the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Service.</p>

<p>ResearchersAgainstAlzheimer's -- a group of over 350 scientists dedicated to stopping Alzheimer's disease -- strongly supports the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and its bold but necessary goal 1 of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. While this target will be a challenge -- similar to past national efforts to send a man to the moon and map the human genome, we firmly believe it is achievable if commensurate resources are committed and strategies deployed. To maximize our chances at success, we strongly support the "Interim Milestones to Complete the First Goal of the National Alzheimer's Plan by 2025" that were included in the recommendations unanimously approved earlier this year by the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services, and we strongly encourage that such milestones be included in the next iteration of the national plan.</p>
<p>Including a specific set of time-bound milestones would be useful to all stakeholders, particularly those in medicine and science, striving to achieve the 2025 goal, as they will establish important interim markers to measure progress and determine potential amendments in the strategy. Absent such milestones, it would be far more difficult to track and measure progress against the goal.</p>
<p>As the Administration has clearly noted, the 2025 goal and the overall plan are national rather than federal goals meaning their success is dependent upon the active participation of multiple stakeholders including government, academia, industry, and non-governmental organizations. A tangible demonstration of this commitment is the level of resources dedicated to the task. While we recognize the fiscal challenges facing the nation as well as the reality that federal discretionary funding is determined in most cases on an annual basis, we think the milestones document would be further strengthened by including funding estimates, targets or ranges necessary to achieve the milestones. Such data would make for a more complete picture and help inform federal and non-federal funding decisions, including public-private partnerships. It would also help inform the annual Congressional budget and appropriations process by providing lawmakers with expert recommendations they can use in establishing department, agency, and program funding levels and in setting priorities.</p>
<p>In addition to including funding estimates, we offer the following thoughts as to ways the milestones chart could be strengthened further:</p>
<p><strong>Research Milestones</strong></p>
<ul><li>Include throughout the document a stronger focus on basic research milestones, particularly benchmarks for discoveries of novel targets, to ensure the early-stage portion of the pipeline and process is not overlooked, as well as process reforms intended to reduce the time, the cost, and the risk of development therapies (<em>More under regulatory</em>), While we are hopeful that therapies and/or means of prevention will be available and accessible by 2025 if not sooner, achieving this goal does not negate the need for further research, particularly to develop more effective interventions and, hopefully one day, therapies to reverse the course of the disease and to cure it outright.</li>
<li>Include during the 2012-2015 timeframe a milestone focused on increasing the understanding as to potential differences treatments may have based on each individual patient's condition (e.g. Apolipoprotein E genotype, amyloid status etc).</li>
<li>Include during the 2016-2020 timeframe a milestone focused on the translation of promising therapeutic interventions into clinical testing.</li>
<li>Include throughout the research component the establishment of a government co-investment function that is modeled upon other successful programs in other sectors and that strives to bridge the "valley of death" that is so daunting in the Alzheimer's and neuroscience space. Such an entity would complement NIH and other research efforts by leveraging relatively small amounts of funding to advance targeted, goal-oriented, and milestone driven project.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Regulatory Milestones</strong></p>
<ul><li>As noted above, set specific regulatory goals aimed at compressing the time and cost of Alzheimer's therapy development. This effort should include specific action under all timeframes and set an overarching goal whereby the average development and review timeline for an Alzheimer's therapy would be reduced by a specific amount of time.</li>
<li>Include during the 2012-2015 timeframe the issuance of FDA guidance pertaining to clinical trials involving combination therapies, and modify the "FDA adaptive trial model" to "FDA adaptive trial paradigm."</li>
</ul><p>Beyond these points, we recommend that the Department continually work to add greater levels of specificity to the milestones, particularly those pertaining to validated endpoints and approved treatments. Overall, this set of milestones must be seen as a constantly evolving, living, and breathing document and should be as comprehensive as the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. To that end, while the NIH and FDA are perhaps the two most important agencies in terms of achieving the 2025 goals, we recommend broadening this solid foundation so all key departments and agencies participating in the plan and Advisory Council, are incorporated.</p>
<p>We applaud you for your leadership in striving to stop Alzheimer's disease and thank you for considering this request. If you have any questions, please contact Dave Morgan, Lead Representative of ResearchersAgainstAlzheimer's and CEO of the Byrd Alzheimer's Institute at the University of South Florida.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's is a deadly and unforgiving disease that affects 5.4 million Americans and costs hundreds of billions of dollars to our country each year. One in seven American workers is, or has been, a caregiver for a loved one with Alzheimer's or dementia. A crisis of this magnitude merits an equally serious response. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease is a bold and groundbreaking effort that will help beat Alzheimer's by 2025, but it must be strengthened if we are to reach that goal.</p>
<p>The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services met in January and made recommendations to HHS. The Council emphasized the urgent need for greater federal research funding, stronger and expanded support for families and caregivers, and a detailed road map with milestones to advance us towards the ultimate goal: the prevention and effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease by 2025. These recommendations are so critical to the effectiveness of the plan that the Council unanimously approved them.</p>
<p>As the Department updates the national plan, I urge you to ensure that these recommendations are included in the 2013 version. We can beat Alzheimer's, but we need a plan that's aggressive, that ensures we have the resources we need, and that includes a detailed road map to getting to a cure.</p>

And While It Is HEARTBREAKING To ALL of Us, It Makes It Even Worse For Her Since She Worked With Alzheimer's Patients About 10 Years or So Ago, So She Knows What She's Starting To Go Through. And The Way I See It, That Makes It That Much Harder For Her As Well As The Rest of Her Children! It's So Hard To Imagine Just What She's Going Through As She Had ALWAYS Been The Rock of Our Family &amp; Such An Incredible One At That!

<p>SE TN needs help with improving its hospitals, and other health care facilities in all areas. We do not need more sprawl, developments, industry, big business, big(ger)roads,interstates,highways, or metro annexation, ex/sub/urbanization in and around the Apison, E. Brainerd, E. hamilton, Summit/Collegedale, Harrison Bay State park and its area, Ooltewah, McDonald, Lebanon, Flint Springs, Black Fox, Blue Springs, Red Clay State historic park area,SACREDCOUNCIL GROUNDS of INtertribal Native Americans, and into Cohutta, Cherokee Valley GA, etc.</p>
<p>The whole metro charter needs to be revoked, suspended, and prevented from a big landgrab happening to these areas above and/or the whole region.</p>
<p>These areas listed above, and perhaps some others need to be a (rural, farmland friendly) National Conservation area (i.e. via USDA,OTR, national forests) conserving our mountain range, ridgelines, water,headwaters,groundwater, wetlands, watersheds, creeks, streams, environment, wildlife, endangered/migratory species in and around these above areas, preserving the historic roads, trails,etc., now and in the future.</p>
<p>Also, many people could probably use the Class Act, if it, or something similar is ever passed, implemented,etc.</p>
<p>These areas listed above,etc., do not need to further "chop up" and/or subdivide the lands,etc., as that causes stormwater runoff problems, and flooding.</p>
<p>These areas listed above do not need big houses, "McMansions", retirement villages, paved surfaces, etc., nor do they need to be more developed then they are. They already have too much and too many people trying to live there, as they are close to headwater areas, and recharge/discharge areas, that need open lands, spaces, forests,etc.</p>
<p>These areas listed above do not need more homes close to the headwater areas, as many of these headwaters provide drinking water for many people in other areas, and states. Also, these areas are possibly prone to dangerous sinkholes, etc., as these areas do have openings in the ground releasing water, as well as caverns and caves, much of which may not have even been reported. Many of the residents in and around these areas, still use thier well water for at least part of their water supply, even though "city water" was brought out into these areas, with people feeling that the city was just being humane in supplying water to people out here, due to an excessive drought we were in at the time, no one was really connecting it to the possiblity that they might want to use that as a possible reason to add more developments, or ex/sub/urbanize these historic rural, headwater areas, etc.</p>
<p>These areas do not need big population increases, or gas/sewer lines, or more septic tanks at all.</p>
<p>However, if someone needed a home in these rural conservation areas, it needs to be a smaller home, possibly a mobile or modular home, not a trailer park, or a development, these areas need to remain as quiet and backwoods as possible, with an increase in natural tourism in areas such as equestrian activities, clean agriculture, birding tours, ecotourism, history, and more.</p>
<p>Though we are not living in Chattanooga, hopefully the fact they just elected democrat mayor Andy Berke may help with these and other needs, in addition to whatever help your could provide. Thank you.</p>

<p>My personal story is surprising for an Advance Practice RN, it was right before my eyes and I didn't recognize it for years.</p>
<p>My husband was a decorated military pilot who became an Airline Pilot and flew until September 10, 2001. He returned from Istanbul the day before 9/11 and didn't fly again since his 60th birthday was at the end of September and he was forced to retire. He completed Law School after he retired and passed the Bar Exam. It took he a couple of tries, but I attributed that to his age rather than a declining mental status. He worked as an attorney for 3 years and then it just became too much, so he retired. It was only after being evaluated for Depression, PTSD and being counseled by a wonderful VA counselor that our Primary Care Physician became worried and ordered an MRI that the diagnosis of Alzheimerscame. He now participates in a Drug Study through Summit Research and is stable on an Alzheimer's medication and he is doing as well as we can expect for early to moderate Alzheimers. He is benefiting from the Research Study because of the Medical professionals he interacts with and our lives will be disrupted again if the funding disappears. This experience gives stability to our lives and helps us cope and have hope for the future. Please employ a reasoned view and do not cut essential medical research funding, it will take us back to a place where hope is not part of so many people's lives. And hope is what keeps us going.</p>

<p>Dear Decision Maker:</p>
<p>With the Baby Boomer aging rapidly the oldest being at the age of 70 yrs old and with Alzheimersbeing a trait inherited by either parents there is likely hood of 1/2 th population being in nursing home or will be cared for at home due to the cost of nursing home care which for most americansis prohibitive in daily costs the idea of workers working tiltheir 70 leaves them no choice but nursing home or in home health care by family members not a feasible thing to do in this society where two incomes are an economic must.</p>
<p>Please include a National Plan for those that will without a doubt circum to AlzheimersDisease as they are Baby Boomers now dealing with elderly parents with not much choice available to themselves as well, Sincerely judy wisboro</p>

<p>My mother (1919-1998) had 3rd or 4th stroke with dementia complicationher last 3 yrs.Primarily, her last yr., she lost her memories of family members, events and communication skills.My mother was a vibrant wife of a USMC LtCol (Retd) husband (1919-1991).She basically was a single-parent for 24 yrs. of active assignments, raising 3 daughters and son, all with special needs, before there were medical diagnoses, education &amp; community supports.</p>
<p>We don't need to go back to what my mother fought against--the denials and accusation by providers, of whom she tried to seek help.The families today and in the future need all the hope medical research can give that Alzheimers/dementia does not have rob individuals of their most precious family memories.</p>

<p>My note: I'm a nurse and have seepatients in various stages of the disease, it's horrid. The confusion and fear on the faces of people fairly early in the disease, the exhaustion on the faces of the family member's faces as they recount the various ways that they have tried to keep their loved one safe. The agonisedlooks on the family's faces as they listen to their loved one just moan and scream. The guilty look of relief when they finally put their loved one in a home. The look of total relief mixed with grief when their loved one dies. It is a horrible disease for everyone involved, a disease that we need to find a cure for. None of us know if we'll get the disease. How many of us joke a little nervously that we must be getting Alzheimer's disease when we forget what we just were saying or why we came into that particular room? For how many of us will that joke become a reality? Please help in the fight against this disease, don't let your little joke become your reality.</p>

<p>As a researcher of Alzheimer's disease for 11 years, I have seen the tragic and unforgiving consequences of this form of dementia on both its victims and their caregivers. Over 5.4 million Americans are afflicted with Alzheimer's disease at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars to our country each year. By 2050, 11-16 million people are expected to have this form of dementia. A crisis of this financial and emotional magnitude deserves an equally serious response.

<p>My mother was his caretaker, until she ended up with Ovarian Cancer. Then my sister stepped in to care for both of them, until she ended up with cancer. I stepped in after that, and I ended up with cancer. Being a caretaker is an unbelievably stressful job, and wears people down. We are prime examples. They are all gone now, taken by their illnesses.

<p>As Nancy mentioned, attached is a letter from CSWE providing additional comment on the National Plan. Please share with the Advisory Council and however else you see fit. Let me know if you have questions.</p>
<p>==========</p>
<p>From: <strong>Nancy Hooyman</strong></p>
<p>When we met in November 2011 at the CSWE Annual Program Meeting, I indicated that I would send you information about teaching materials that support social work students' attainment of competencies in working with persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their families. Since then, I have been contacting social work faculty and asking them to submit such curricular resources. After I review all the submissions to ensure their quality, these materials will be posted on the Gero-Ed Center website (<a href="http://www.Gero-EdCenter.org">http://www.Gero-EdCenter.org</a>), which will ensure their dissemination nationally.</p>
<p>These teaching resources can be categorized as case studies; in-class exercises; media; and course syllabi. Most of the case studies and in-class exercises provide opportunities for students to practice assessment skills. However, field placements or service learning experiences are the most widely used mechanism to prepare students to work with older adults with dementia. Nearly every social work program that has responded to our request for curricular resources has placements with the local Alzheimer's Association, adult day health centers that serve persons with dementia, memory care units in skilled nursing facilities and geriatric assessment clinics. There are also placements that are not in typical geriatric settings, such as students in prison settings working with inmates with dementia, advocating at their state legislatures for more funding for services for persons with Alzheimer's disease, or implementing recreational music as a way to reduce stress for social workers practicing with persons with dementia.</p>
<p>I will update you once we have all these materials categorized on our website. At that point, I hope that you will be able to inform others, including the Geriatric Education Centers, of their availability. These curricular resources could be readily adapted by other professions and disciplines for teaching purposes to ensure competence in working with persons with AD.</p>
<p>I also understand that Wendy Naus will also be sending you a letter from Darla Spence Coffey, the President of the Council on Social Work Education commenting on the National Plan. We hope that you will be able to distribute that letter to your colleagues at HHS and Advisory Council members. We are most appreciative of your support of social work as a key profession in working with persons with AD and their families.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em><strong>Public Comment on the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</strong></em></p>
<p>On behalf of the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), I am pleased to provide this written comment to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as it works on the next iteration of the <em>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
<p>First, allow me to thank you for your willingness to engage with CSWE over the last several months to hear about the issues and concerns of the social work education community with respect to tackling the challenges of Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the opportunity to provide our community's perspective into this important dialogue and are hopeful that social work will continue to be recognized as a contributing participant in care for patients and families affected by Alzheimer's disease and that social work will be explicitly named alongside its partner professions in the next National Plan.</p>
<p>As discussed in our previous written comment to HHS and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services, CSWE remains primarily concerned about the preparation of the workforce to meet the needs of the Alzheimer's disease patient and caregiver community. The goal of producing a workforce that incorporates all necessary players--including social workers--equipped with the needed skills cannot be achieved without enhanced investment in recruitment, training, and retention of students in the health professions who will be working with older adults. Simply put, we will not have the capacity to meet the already overwhelming demand for services and supports if we do not invest today in the current and future workforce.</p>
<p>Therefore, CSWE wholeheartedly endorses <strong>Recommendation 7</strong> of the Council's <strong>Clinical Care Subcommittee</strong>, made in January 2013, to: "<em>Expand funding and incentives to encourage individuals to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</em>," through interprofessional education and training activities, existing funding mechanisms, such as the Title VII and Title VIII programs at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and through the creation of new loan repayment programs. While it is critically important to ensure that the current workforce receive the training it needs to provide adequate services, investment in the workforce pipeline is what will truly move the dial for Alzheimer's disease patients and caregivers. The current and projected workforce shortages across the health professions have been well-documented. With respect to social work, only an average of 5 percent of all social work graduates completed a specialization in aging in 2009-2010 (CSWE, 2011).<sup>1</sup> We, the social work education community and the federal government, must get serious and creative about incentivizing more social workers to enter careers in geriatrics. The Advisory Council made this recommendation to HHS in May 2012 as well, and CSWE urges HHS to incorporate such a goal in the next National Plan.</p>
<p>Second, as an educational organization representing 2,500 individual members and nearly 700 graduate and undergraduate programs of professional social work education, as well as the national accreditor for social work education programs in the U.S., CSWE works with programs on the development and dissemination of curriculum covering a variety of practice areas, including geriatrics. We are appreciative of efforts by HHS to include CSWE in discussions about curricular needs for health professions involved in Alzheimer's disease care and hope to continue to engage with HRSA and other parts of the Department to this end to discuss the development and dissemination of educational materials.</p>
<p>However, it is important to clarify a few limitations with respect to Recommendation 4 by the Clinical Care Subcommittee and Recommendation 4 by the Long-Term Services and Supports Subcommittee dealing with the development of required dementia-specific curriculum for practitioners. The social work accreditation standards have been designed to ensure that all social work students achieve specified skills and knowledge or competencies but do not specify content to attain these competencies. At the baccalaureate level, programs are instructed to provide a generalist curriculum to ensure that graduates are prepared to function at the beginning professional level in the variety of settings in which BSW graduates are employed, which includes services to people across the lifespan and across different delivery systems. At the master's level, programs are instructed to build on these competencies and apply them in areas of specialization appropriate to their mission and responsive to their region. Currently, there are 52 master's programs offering a certificate in aging/gerontology and 57 master's programs offering a concentration; we would fully expect that these programs either already include dementia-specific curricula or would welcome the assistance in infusing this content into the curriculum. CSWE is committed to facilitating this process of ensuring that social work graduates are prepared to work with persons with dementia and their families.</p>
<p>Through initiatives such as CSWE's National Center for Gerontological Social Work Education, supported by the John A. Hartford Foundation, we are able to develop and disseminate curricular resources to our programs for their use. Though not <em>mandatory curriculum</em>, these resources can help shape program content and infuse the most up-to-date research and thinking on a given topic.</p>
<p>Therefore, with respect to the <strong>Clinical Care Subcommittee's Recommendation 4</strong>:</p>
<p><em>"Develop a unified curriculum for primary care practitioners to become more knowledgeable about Alzheimer's disease and enhance the skills necessary to deliver dementia capable care." </em></p>
<p>and the <strong>Long-Term Services and Supports Subcommittee's Recommendation 4</strong>:</p>
<p><em>"State education and health agencies and others should include key information about [Alzheimer's disease] in all curricula for any profession or career track affecting [long-term services and supports]." </em></p>
<p>while CSWE supports the development of dementia-specific curricular resources that ensure practitioners (including social workers) across the health care team are equipped with a common sense of understanding and necessary skills, and would disseminate such resources to our programs for their consideration, CSWE would not be able to <em>mandate</em> the use of a unified curriculum to our programs. I would be happy to provide additional information or clarification on the accreditation process of professional organizations like CSWE if it would be helpful to you.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your work on this important initiative and for the opportunity to express these views on behalf of the Council on Social Work Education. CSWE is hopeful the updated National Plan will address the pipeline concerns highlighted above and promote curricular and other resource development that reflects what is possible for professional organizations. I would be happy to provide additional information about CSWE and our efforts to promote geriatric competencies among social work students. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.</p>

<p>I would like to submit the following comments to be shared at the January 14, 2013 meeting on behalf of Jean Wood.</p>
<p>Dear Members of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services:</p>
<p>On behalf of my collaborators in ACT on Alzheimers, the implementation group for the Minnesota Alzheimer's Plan, the Minnesota Board on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association MN ND, we would like to express our deepest appreciation for the work of NAPA and the recommendations to dedicate $10.5 million to seed the development of state action plans, restore ADSSP funding to $13.5 million and fully fund the National Family Caregivers Act. Minnesota using its own private and public resources has not only developed a legislatively approved Alzheimer's Plan but a powerful collaboration that has moved forward to implement the plan. ADSSP funding has been key to this effort as well as enabling Minnesota to implement important evidence-based interventions such as the New York University Caregiver Intervention. Minnesota relies on a network of dementia capable caregiver consultants many funded through the National Family Caregivers program to support Alzheimer's caregivers in the community. Minnesota has dedicated significant state and private dollars to building a dementia capable medical care and community care system of the highest quality. With the national coordination and funding that is being recommended by NAPA our work and that of other states would be greatly magnified and impact many more lives.</p>

<p>While I thank you and appreciate all that you are doing, I find it shocking and appalling that no person with the actual disease that you are discussing is on your council.</p>
<p>I cannot think of another disease where this might happen.</p>
<p>From my extensive experience working with people with dementia who are advocates for themselves and other people with the disease, I know firsthand that the best people from whom to learn about the disease are the people with it.</p>
<p>People in the early and mid stages of the disease are able to communicate in a language that the rest of us can understand (I believe that it's up to the rest of us to learn how to communicate with people who lose the ability to communicate in a way that we understand), and they already appreciate much of the difficulties and challenges faced by people in all stages of the disease. In addition, people with early onset Alzheimer's can report firsthand the unique challenges that they face by losing their jobs, taking on new expenses, and yet in many cases still putting children through college and saving for retirement.</p>
<p>In addition, people with dementia must be given the opportunity to advocate for themselves, as the plans that you are recommending will be impacting them directly. It is their future that you are deciding, and yet they have no direct input into these plans.</p>
<p>While there are many many people with dementia across the USA who are active advocates, standing up and speaking out about dementia, you need look no further than Michael Ellenbogen as a passionate, knowledgeable, and outspoken individual, whose hard work and perseverance is already changing the way Alzheimer's disease is viewed by society in general. Michael would make an excellent addition to the Advisory Council.</p>

<p>As a former caregiver and an ardent advocate in the fight against Alzheimer's, I want to thank you for the excellent work that has been done thus far regarding NAPA. I'm hopeful that this year we will see adequate support and funding to implement your recommendations and turn our shared dream of NAPA and a world without dementia into a reality.</p>
<p>I understand that the Advisory Council consists of at least 22 members and meets quarterly to discuss the efficacy of government programs targeting the needs of individuals and caregivers coping with the consequences of Alzheimer's and related disorders. My request and hope is that the Advisory Council can be expanded to add/include individuals who have been diagnosed with dementia.</p>
<p>We know that stigma is a tremendous obstacle for individuals and families living with this disease. I personally experienced the very painful and isolating results of this in caring for both my father and my husband from 1984 to 2012. It is my personal belief that, if we truly hope to reduce stigma, improve care, and help the public fight against ADRD, we must have someone who is living with the disease on the Advisory Council.</p>
<p>I trust that you will act upon this recommendation and set an example for all that those with dementia continue to contribute and have capabilities, not just disabilities.</p>

I want to extend sincere appreciation and congratulations regarding your efforts to date with NAPA, particularly as they relate to your work on recommended screening tools recently adopted by CMS that specifically provide options for physicians and other healthcare providers who wish to incorporate cognitive screening as part of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. These recommendations mark a significant step forward as many physicians were unsure how to implement formal cognitive screening in an efficacious and time efficient manner in the absence of any best practice guidelines or recommended tools.</p>
<p>Now that several tools for dementia detection have been clearly identified by NAPA and CMS, there is much work to be done to further assist providers in understanding the next steps that follow a positive screening result. Although many of us in the field recognize how straight-forward a dementia work-up can be, this understanding is, of course, not shared by the medical community at large. Like the recommendations for specific screening tools, we need very clear, structured, and straight-forward best practice recommendations for doctors concerning the work-up, diagnosis, and management of individuals with memory loss and dementing illnesses. Many physicians are still extremely reluctant to embrace screening because the "how" of working up and managing these patients remains unclear, too complex, and burdensome from their perspective.</p>
<p>To address these and related issues, the Minnesota State Legislature put forth a bill several years ago to establish a working group to make recommendations to help the state become more dementia competent. That work resulted in a formal report to the legislature and, subsequently, a new body was formed called ACT on Alzheimer's to take those recommendations and implement needed changes at the state, provider, and community levels. We were charged with tackling many of the same problems you are now trying to address at the national level, and our work has resulted in several tools and guidelines used locally that I believe could serve as a very useful "jumping off point" for the council's discussions concerning the next set of recommendations for physicians that focus on the necessary follow-up after screening.</p>
<p>Specifically, we have created what is called a "practice parameter" (please see attached document; <a href="http://www.alz.org/documents/mndak/toolkitsingle.pdf">http://www.alz.org/documents/mndak/toolkitsingle.pdf</a>) which provides doctors with a streamlined, 1 page guideline on each of 3 topics: cognitive screening, dementia work-up/diagnosis, and disease management. The guidelines incorporate existing best practice recommendations in the field and are presented in a manner that allows one to fully appreciate the steps involved in efficient and appropriate dementia care. Moreover, they are easily adaptable to different settings and diverse practice groups. Importantly, this work involved many months of extensive small group discussions, focus groups, and meaningful exchanges with practicing physicians in an effort to identify common barriers to dementia detection and to then offer practical solutions to these barriers that are feasible in the current landscape of healthcare. We have also created brief educational modules and presentations that accompany the practice parameter document which have been of great use locally in teaching physicians about dementia care and demystifying dementia.</p>
<p>I and other representatives of Minnesota's ACT on Alzheimer's would be happy to share more information and materials with the council if deemed appropriate in the future. Again, my sincere congratulations to each of you for all of your hard work with NAPA to date.</p>

<p>Good afternoon -- On behalf of the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), I am submitting the enclosed written public comment for the October 15 Advisory Council meeting.</p>
<p>Dr. Darla Spence Coffey, CSWE President, plans to also provide oral comment during the meeting.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>On behalf of the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), thank you for the opportunity to provide written comment on the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>CSWE is a nonprofit national association representing about 2,500 individual members as well as nearly 700 graduate and undergraduate programs of professional social work education. Founded in 1952, this partnership of educational and professional institutions, social welfare agencies, and private citizens is recognized as the sole accrediting agency for social work education in the United States. Social work education focuses students on leadership and direct practice roles helping individuals, families, groups, and communities by creating new opportunities that empower people to be productive, contributing members of their communities.</p>
<p>CSWE thanks the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Advisory Council for incorporating into the National Plan goals and strategies aimed at building a workforce equipped with the necessary skills to meet the needs of those living with dementia, including <em>Strategy 2.A: Build a Workforce with the Skills to Provide High-Quality Care</em>. It is critical that supports and additional training be provided to workers already in practice to ensure that they can adequately meet the needs of those they are serving. However, we remain concerned about the preparation of the future workforce. The goal of producing a workforce that incorporates all necessary players--including social workers--with the necessary skills cannot be achieved without enhanced investment in recruitment, training, and retention of students in the health professions who will be working with older adults. The workforce pipeline must be considered if real progress is to be made and sustained.</p>
<p>To this end, CSWE strongly endorses the recommendations made by the Advisory Council in May 2012 that call on Congress to appropriate additional funding for health professions workforce programs. In particular, we strongly support the <strong>Clinical Care Subcommittee's Recommendation 8</strong>, which urges the prioritization of geriatrics education and training programs, including the Title VII and Title VIII programs at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), as well as loan repayment and other incentive initiatives. While social work is recognized throughout the Plan as a contributing member of the care team, without the workforce investments recommended by the Council, the social work profession will not have the capacity to meet such demand. It is estimated that by 2050, the number of social workers needed in long term care will grow to approximately 109,000 (nearly double the current workforce in this area) (DHHS, 2006). In 2009--2010, only an average of 5 percent of all social work graduates completed a specialization in aging (CSWE, 2011).<sup>1</sup> This number of graduates cannot begin to meet the workforce demands, especially in light of the retirement of increasing numbers of geriatric social workers. The social work profession will undoubtedly reach a breaking point if new investments are not made today to nurture a social work pipeline that generates a new crop of professionals skilled to work with older adults and specifically with the competencies to work with those with dementia and their family caregivers</p>
<p>Second, as an organization guided by an educational mission, CSWE plays a central role in the development and dissemination of curriculum covering a variety of practice areas. Through our John A. Hartford-funded National Center for Gerontological Social Work Education, we have enhanced the capacity of faculty and prepared students with competencies to work effectively with older adults and their families We applaud the Council's recommendation that HHS partner with health professions programs and organizations to work toward the development and use of geriatrics-specific curricula and would be eager to help disseminate such curricula to our member programs. CSWE has begun conversations with HHS on how we may be able to contribute on behalf of the social work education community and we welcome opportunities to ensure the dementia capacity of our faculty members and their students.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to express these views on behalf of the Council on Social Work Education. CSWE is hopeful that the updated National Plan will address the pipeline concerns highlighted above. I would be happy to provide additional information about CSWE and our efforts to promote geriatric competencies among social work students. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Of Alzheimer's, the scientific method &amp; educated guesses</strong></p>
<p>My name is Caroline Rodgers. Some of you may recall that in January, I presented my hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease is caused by dental X-rays shortening the lifespan of the brain cells that keep sustain neurons, fatally stranding them (1). The article it was based on was reviewed by scientists specializing in Alzheimer's, neurology or radiology during manuscript development and in the course of peer review before it was published in Medical Hypothesis last July (2).</p>
<p>But that's not what I am here to talk about.</p>
<p>I am here to talk about the scientific method versus expediting answers. Thomas Edison was a great one for applying scientific method. He exemplified how persistence can conquer multiple failures when he had his lab test 10,000 different filament substances before finding tungsten. That was a great feat, but he was only looking for a way to light up the world that was already aglow with candles.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's is different. Darkness is descending on the minds of the elderly and the not-so-elderly with savage rapidity. Every day we fail to discover what is causing Alzheimer's and how to treat it, countless more individuals are doomed to losing their minds and ultimately, their lives in a manner that does not go gently into the night. We don't have the time to test 10,000 possibilities -- we need ask new questions and to make educated guesses that will vault us into new territory.</p>
<p>Clinical trials are the "gold standard" of evidence-based medicine. But when a treatment does not pass a clinical trial, it is not gold, it is lead. Recently one scientist involved with clinical trials of Alzheimer's drugs said that some 100 treatments were in the works, most of which targeted brain plaques. Since more than one clinical trial of a plaques-clearing treatment has been halted for doing more harm than good, it is time to consider that clearing plaques is not the answer and no alchemy can turn it into gold.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we can't afford the time and money to be as systematic as Edison -- we need educated guesses that, like leaps of faith, close the gap quickly. The answer is probably a simple one; the very speed with which Alzheimer's has become a killer argues against a complex etiology, since the more factors required for an outcome, the more difficult it is to meet all of the conditions necessary to cause it. Plus, simple answers are easily overlooked, which is why it took nearly 300 years for scientists to discover that rickets was caused by a lack of sunshine.</p>
<p>Are dental X-rays causing Alzheimer's? I can't answer that question because my hypothesis has yet to be tested. But I'm told it would take only about $20,000 to launch a pilot study that could bring us closer to the truth. We need to investigate this and other out-of-the-box ideas. While the Research Subcommittee's draft recommendations call for timelines, strict metrics and cooperation among what it terms "industry players," we need to go beyond these business models and find ways to attract and fund fresh avenues of Alzheimer's research. While scientific method is important, if it is not used to explore creative educated guesses it may be a long time before we strike gold.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I AM A DAUTHER,AN AMERICAN , A VOTER AND A CAREPARTNER FOR A PARENT WITH ALZHEIMERS DISEASE AND THESE ARE MY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NATIONAL ALZHEIMERS PLAN:</p>
<p>Goal One is of vital important-To accomplish this goal, it is imperative that a subgroup is formed to accelerate and streamline efforts to isolate and identify potentially viable drugs that can effectively cross the Blood Brain Barrier and stop and preferably regress the Alzheimersdisease process. This group should consist of a representative from all of the top federal and non-federal agencies that are involved in bringing a drug through the development process into human testing and beyond to becoming FDA approved. This subgroup should consists primarily of a representative from HHS,NIH,NIA,WHO,FDA, Doctors and Researchers , as well as Biotech and Pharmaceutical companies. Similar to the Therapeutics For Rare And Neglected Diseases (TRND) Program-this subgroup should stimulate drug development and research by providing an opportunity to partner with one another in a collaborative environment with the goal of moving promising drugs into human trials in a timely, efficient and highly effective manner. This subgroup should use an application and evaluation process to select collaborators. Selected investigators should provide each separate drug candidates starting points and ongoing biological disease expertise throughout the total project. Each drug composition should be studied individually and separately so that the best possible ones can be accurately identified and focused upon. Therefore each potentially valid treatment and or cure for the alzheimersdisease process is regarded as a separate project or entity ,within the main project; the main project's goal being to create a new and better medicine for the alzheimers disease process and or a cure.</p>
<p>The Alzheimers Disease Summit in May 2012 should be looked upon as a breeding group for potentially valid drug candidates. All and any information gathered and disseminated at the summit should be thoroughly analyzed for the absolute best possible viable candidates to be studied by the subgroup, in a supreme effort to accomplish goal one. A representative from each agency involved in the subgroup should be in attendance at the summit so that they can absorb information and use it accordingly.</p>
<p>To increase public awareness of the disease and its various components a public service announcement should be broadcast across the country on every public tv station. This announcement should show a person with the disease, throughout the various progressive stages and explain to America that alzheimersis much more than a loss of memory but instead a progressive degenerative brain disease that is fatal and desperate for public support and a new and better medicine and or a cure.</p>

<p>In reading number 6 we wanted to add our comments. We have four recommendations:</p>
<p>Our first recommendation is that the committee should be aware of which states are requiring dementia education and how many hours are required. The regulations are different in every state and for each industry, such as Adult Day Care, Hospice, Home Care, Nursing Homes, Assisted Living, Hospitals, Rehab Centers, Psychiatric Facilities and Locked Dementia Units. Some states require more dementia education such as 20 hours and other states and depending on which industry require less dementia education while others do not have a specific number of hours. Some states may require more than 10 hours of dementia education. So at minimum before your recommendation is passed, you should be aware of what each state is requiring for dementia education and for each industry. At minimum the national standard should be more than 10 hours. We are recommending at minimum 12 hours of Live dementia education for all front line staff and health care professionals.</p>
<p>We recommend live training by a certified Alzheimer's and dementia trainer. In some states the education is permitted per the state regulation via Weimar and video training. We stand against this way of initial Alzheimer's and dementia training because you can not be sure that the person attending the Webinar or video training is in fact that person. Nor can you insure when the material is presented by Webinar or video training that the employee understood the material. "Live Training" is critical in preventing abuse and neglect of our most vulnerable elders by the front line staff and health care professional.</p>
<p>In addition, we recommend ongoing training through out the year to keep the staff up to date on regulatory changes and new advances in all aspects of care. Each year for NCCDP Alzheimer's and dementia Staff Education Week February 14 to 21 and we provide free staff in-services for educators to download from our site which includes the power point, hand outs, pre tests and post tests. This is a free services and is available from November till May. We add many new topics every year. Your recommendations should let the public know of this free service.</p>
<p>Secondly, the wording you have for the education piece is "reliable source". We feel it should be spelled out to specifically state, universities, associations,nationally recognized companies and nationally recognized organizations. such as the National Council of Certified Dementia Practitioner's, National Alzheimer's Association, National Alzheimer's Foundation, Office on Aging, etc. The public should be aware by your office of all of the organizations and companies providing dementia education and not just a select few who are serving on your committee. The institution than can make a choice as to which organization to use for staff training.</p>
<p>Our third recommendation should be that the words "Paraprofessional Caregiver" come out and replace with all Health Care Professionals and Front line staff including Nursing Assistants, Home Health Aides, Personal Care Assistants, Activity and TR professionals, Nurses, Social Workers, Dietary Workers, PT, OT, Speech, Housekeeping, Bus Drivers, Administrators, Assistant Administrators, Pharmacists, Physicians and all other staff who interact with the patient. We feel this needs to be very detailed and specific and not in any way target one specific profession as all professions who interact with the geriatric patient be included in the Alzheimer's and dementia training.</p>
<p>Our fourth recommendation is that Alzheimer's and dementia education be mandated in all colleges, universities, trade schools that provide a medical profession trade or certification or license for any health care related profession regardless if they are entering the geriatric field.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Eldercare Workforce Alliance, a coalition of 29 national organizations committed to addressing the immediate and future workforce crisis in caring for an aging America, we thank you and the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services for your work to forumulate the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>We commend the Council for its recognition of the vital importance of a strong workforce for realizing the goals of the Plan, as demonstrated in strategies 2.A and 2.C, which call for the building of a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care, as well as the strategies under Goal 3, in support of family caregivers.</p>
<p>While the action items located under Strategy 2.A are significant, we remain concerned that the essential workforce goals identified by the Council cannot be realized without the investment of additional resources. Specifically, the action items calls for additional and enhanced activities within Geriatric Education Centers (GEC), the Comprehensive Geriatric Education Program (CGEP), the Geriatric Academic Career Awards Program (GACA), the Geriatric Training for Physicians, Dentists, and Behavioral and mental Health Providers (GTPD) program, and the Direct-Care Workforce training program. These programs, which are administered through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) under the Title VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act, are in constant danger of defunding and have experienced stagnant funding that has not kept up with the pace of inflation, even as the need for preparation to care for older adults has skyrocketed. To implement these additional and enhanced activities in order to realize the goal of enhancing care quality and efficiency for the growing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and other multiple chronic conditions additional funding must be invested.</p>
<p>We believe that access to quality health care for older adults with cognitive impairment is vital to healthy aging and we commend you for your efforts. As the work of the committee continues, we welcome opportunities to work with you.</p>

					The Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services<br />
					April 17, 2012</strong></p>
<p>On behalf of the Eldercare Workforce Alliance, a coalition of 29 national organizations committed to addressing the immediate and future workforce crisis in caring for an aging America, thank you for your work to formulate recommendations for operationalizing the Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>We commend the Council for its recognition of the vital importance of a strong workforce for realizing the goals of the Draft Plan, outlined in strategy 2.A, which calls for the building of a workforce with the skills to provide high-quality care, as well as the strategies under Goal 3, in support of family caregivers.</p>
<p>While the action items outlined in the Draft Plan and the recommendations you have voted on here today are significant, EWA strongly urges the Council to consider the following comments in order to achieve the essential workforce goals identified in the Draft Plan: -</p>
<ul><li>EWA strongly supports the Clinical Care Subcommittee's Recommendation #8 to invest additional funding in multidisciplinary geriatrics education and training programs under Title VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act. Action items under Strategy 2.A of the Draft Plan call for additional and enhanced activities within these programs; however, they have experienced stagnant funding and constant threats of defunding, even as the need for preparation to care for older adults has skyrocketed. Some of the programs authorized in the Affordable Care Act have yet to receive appropriations. To implement the additional activities called for in the Draft Plan to enhance care quality and efficiency for the growing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and other multiple chronic conditions, additional funding must be invested.</li>
<li>EWA strongly supports the Clinical Care Subcommittee's recommendation to increase funding for loan repayments and other incentives for those who study geriatrics and gerontology. We recommend that geriatrics and gerontology be made permanently eligible via statute for federal loan forgiveness and other efforts to boost enrollment in these medical disciplines.</li>
<li>EWA strongly supports the Council's recommendations with regard to promotion of geriatric education offerings and the dissemination of information about Alzheimer's disease, dementia care, and support systems. EWA believes that geriatric competencies and dementia training should be included in training for all primary care clinicians and staff to improve detection, treatment and care for people with Alzheimer's disease.</li>
<li>EWA strongly supports the Long-Term Services and Supports Subcommittee's recommendations for health care provider training and for adequate training and compensation for paraprofessional caregivers. More specifically, we recommend that certified nursing aides and home care aides and their supervisors be required to take at least 120 of training, including explicit geriatric care and gerontological content; and that minimum training standards/competencies for non-clinical direct-care workers should be created and that they should be adequately compensated.</li>
<li>EWA urges the Council to consider more specific recommendations on improving access to Medicare and Medicaid funded home- and community-based care services to allow individuals with Alzheimer's disease to stay in their homes as long as possible.</li>
<li>EWA strongly supports the Council's recommendations to expand and increase funding for AoA programs such family planning and social services, research and development projects, and training in the field of aging; respite care; support services for family caregivers that can help reduce their burden.</li>
</ul><p>We believe that access to quality health care for older adults with cognitive impairment is vital to healthy aging and we commend you for your efforts. As the work of the Council continues, we welcome opportunities to work with you to achieve the goals of the National Plan.</p>

<p>Family Caregiver Alliance would like to submit the attached comments into the official record for today.</p>

<table align="RIGHT"><tbody><tr><td>
<p>I am writing on behalf of family caregivers throughout the United States who are struggling to provide care for their loved ones with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The National Center on Caregiving at Family Caregiver Alliance supports many of the recommendations contained in the presentation handout and would like this letter submitted for the formal record.</p>
<p><strong>Long-Term Services and Supports Subcommittee Recommendations </strong></p>
<p><em>1) HHS should provide Federal Funds to support a state lead entity in every state and territory. This entity would coordinate available public and private LTSS, conduct service gap analysis, identify opportunities for efficiency, and enable ongoing stakeholder input to address needs across all sectors and systems. Bullet point #7: HHS should fully fund the costs of cognitive impairment and caregiver surveillance through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in every state. </em></p>
<p><strong>FCA</strong>: We support using the caregiver module in BRFSS in every state. However, in our communication with states that have included the caregiver module in their BRFSS, not all states had the funding or infrastructure to properly analyze the data after it was collected. Therefore, HHS should also include funding for the analysis of the data after it has been collected.</p>
<p><em>4) Fully fund Caregiver Supports under AoA. AoA currently has a Caregiver Support Program, a component of which can be expanded to better meet the needs of caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. </em></p>
<p><strong>FCA</strong>: An article in <em>American Family Physician</em>, released in 2011, ("Caregiver Care") focused on the importance of caregiver assessment. In it, the authors noted that the National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) received $154 million in federal funding in FY 2009, "approximately one-twentieth of 1 percent of the value of caregiver contributions." Family Caregiver Alliance strongly supports fully funding this program that helps families navigate the many complexities of long-term care for a loved one.</p>
<p><em>5) Assure a robust, dementia capable system of Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS) is available in every state. Bullet Point #6: CMS should provide guidance to all states on adding adult day services as a state optional service under Medicaid. </em></p>
<p><strong>FCA</strong>: Caregivers in California were faced with the elimination of the Adult Day Health Care program (stopped only by a lawsuit) in 2011 because it is an "optional" benefit in Medi-Cal. Given the nature of caregiving for a person with dementia, especially in its advanced stages, services like adult day programs are not "optional" for caregivers. They are vital sources of respite for families who may also be balancing jobs and raising children. Therefore, we believe that the conversation should focus on how to ensure that every family has access to adult day services. When a service like Adult Day Health Care is considered "optional," it often lands on the chopping block during economic downturns, (as California caregivers experienced in 2011) and families are left to try and piece together alternatives.</p>
<p><em>12) HHS and State Lead Entities should assure that caregiver physical health/ behavioral health risk is assessed and addressed regularly. Caregiver illness and mortality contribute to the enormous personal and financial cost of Alzheimer's disease. The health and well-being of a caregiver has a direct impact on the health and quality of life of a person with Alzheimer's disease. </em></p>
<p><strong>FCA</strong>: While we support assessing caregivers and connecting them with services, we also advocate for a person <em>and</em> family-centered approach to care. While the health of the caregiver does have an impact on the health and quality of life of a person with Alzheimer's disease, the opposite is also true. People who become caregivers face increased risks of depression, stress, exhaustion, cognitive decline, and higher mortality rates. Instead of viewing the caregiver's needs merely in relation to how this will support their caregiving role, it is also important to recognize caregivers and their health (psychological, emotional, physical, and financial) as a separate priority in addition to the care receiver.</p>
<p>Family Caregiver Alliance is grateful for the opportunity to provide our input on ehalf of the over 15 million Americans currently caring for a loved one with lzheimer's and related dementias. b A Sincerely, Kathleen Kelly, MPA, Executive Director</p>

<p>I would like to include the following comments for discussion at the <strong>Research Subcommittee Recommendations</strong>, Points 7 and 12.</p>
<p>I'm very concern about <strong>point 7</strong>, specifically sub-points (A &amp; B), recommending HHS use existing authority to reduce drug development and taking immediate steps by HHS to go after patents and intellectual property. If the goal of this committee is to spur innovation and drug development then why attack businesses incentive to invest in the disease? If this point is passed, it may have a chilling effect for small pharmaceutical and private research organizations who's members demand a "return on investment".</p>
<p>And again for <strong>Point 12</strong>, the aspect of industry being made to share intellectual property because this committee votes on a process or mechanism to side step inventors patent rights or industries trade secrets will again send a chilling signal to the investment community by making investors think twice about investing in Alzheimer's Disease research and thereby creating the opposite effect this committee is trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>Overall, this committee needs to be pragmatic in the understanding that a cure will be discovered when a group of factors is satisfied not because of a lofty marketing idea of a cure by 2020. These factorsinclude, advancement in medical technology, better understanding of human genetics, and overall better medical training.</p>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. The Alzheimer's Association is committed to ensuring that the full potential of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) is realized, and we stand ready to support the successful implementation of the law. Founded in 1980, the Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.</p>
<p>Today, there are an estimated 5.4 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and 15.2 million unpaid caregivers. Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of death and the only cause of death among the top 10 in America without a way to prevent, cure, or even slow its progression. Currently, there are no survivors. Alzheimer's kills more Americans than diabetes, and more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. Individuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias are high consumers of hospital, nursing home, and long-term care services. Average per person Medicare costs for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias are nearly three times higher and Medicaid spending is 19 times higher than for those without these conditions. Care for those living with Alzheimer's and other dementias is estimated to cost Medicare and Medicaid $140 billion this year alone. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Alzheimer's cannot wait. Individuals living with this devastating disease and their families cannot wait. Strengthening the financial underpinnings of Medicare and Medicaid cannot wait. We are at a critical moment. Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or treat the disease, Alzheimer's impact on our country will grow year by year. By 2050, as many as 16 million Americans will have the disease, and the escalating cost of care will reach $1.1 trillion annually (in today's dollars). Costs to Medicare and Medicaid are estimated to increase nearly 500 percent over this period.</p>
<p>However, this does not need to be our future. If the federal government makes a meaningful commitment to finding a treatment and cure through the National Alzheimer's Plan, the long-term payoff will be substantial. For example, a treatment that delayed onset of the disease by five years (similar to the effect of anti-cholesterol drugs on preventing heart disease) would cut government spending on caring for those with Alzheimer's by nearly half in 2050.<sup>2</sup> Similarly, profound advances can be achieved through improvements to Alzheimer's care quality and effectiveness and through improved supports for individuals with Alzheimer's and their families. The challenge and the potential promise of the National Alzheimer's Plan is our opportunity to change the trajectory of this heartbreaking disease.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association is pleased the important strengths contained within the Draft Framework were preserved in this initial draft of the National Alzheimer's Plan. As was the case with the Framework, this first draft is comprehensive in scope, addressing many of the issues that are critically important to the Alzheimer's community. We do see key opportunities to further strengthen this draft plan prior to its next iteration. The Association's comments address specific areas to fortify; for instance, palliative care and transportation issues, which are particularly important for the one in seven Americans with Alzheimer's who live alone.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>In addition to the specific comments that follow, the Alzheimer's Association would like to emphasize several broader themes.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong>:<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly urges that the National Alzheimer's Plan build on the momentum of the Administration's recent, commendable action on Alzheimer's research funding by indicating in the plan the full scale and scope of research funding required to achieve the Administration's goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. To this end, we believe recent work by leading Alzheimer's researchers to be available in April 2012 will provide a very solid foundation for these projections.<sup>4</sup> As we previously noted in our comments submitted for the Draft Framework, we believe that the firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. While intermediary milestones are needed, the Department is to be commended for including a clear, accountable goal for the availability of urgently-needed treatment advances.</p>
<p><strong>Economic burden</strong>:<br />
					The bipartisan, unanimously passed National Alzheimer's Project Act calls for the identification of priority actions to reduce the economic impact of Alzheimer's disease on the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as on American families, while improving health outcomes. In addition to the estimated $140 billion in Medicare and Medicaid costs this year, families caring for people with this heartbreaking disease will still incur high out-of-pocket costs for care -- an estimated $33.8 billion in 2012. Given the high costs of adult day centers, assisted living facilities and nursing home care, and the duration of the disease, individuals affected by Alzheimer's will often deplete their savings and assets, and ultimately come to rely on Medicaid for assistance. Though the theme of better health outcomes is present in several places in this draft, the attention to addressing the economic burden is, in our judgment, insufficient. The distinct financial burdens of Alzheimer's disease were a pervasive theme among the more than 40,000 Americans who participated in the Alzheimer's Association public input process on the National Alzheimer's Plan last year. We urge this be directly addressed in the next draft.</p>
<p><strong>Public health</strong>:<br />
					While we applaud the draft plan's emphasis on strengthening the Aging Network to deal with the burden of Alzheimer's disease, it does little to frame Alzheimer's as a top national public health challenge and to engage the full resources of the public health community at the federal, state and local levels. In this regard, the draft can draw from an important and encouraging trend in leading states where the public health network has been actively evaluating the burden of Alzheimer's. It also can draw from important work developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assessing the public health dimensions of Alzheimer's. The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection are crucial to understanding the burden of the disease and assessing ways to reduce its impact. Complementing the strong emphasis on the Aging Network by highly engaging the CDC in the National Alzheimer's Plan will ensure Alzheimer's is addressed as a public health priority.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong>:<br />
					It would be difficult to overstate just how critical we believe Strategy 5B, "Monitor Progress on the National Plan," is to securing important outcomes in the first year of the plan's implementation. We urge this monitoring be done in a timely, transparent way to ensure accountability for both the implementation of action steps and the meaningfulness of this activity. This is important for several reasons. First, this transparency is a clear expectation of Congress as expressed in and embedded throughout the statute (P.L. 111-375). Second, this is necessary for the Advisory Council if the Council is to fulfill its obligation under the law to meaningfully report directly to Congress and to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on an annual basis. Finally, it is a fundamental expectation of the Alzheimer's community. Accountability is a precondition for the successful pursuit of all that follows throughout the plan.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Comments</strong><br />
					The following are specific comments on the various proposed goals and actions as outlined in the <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 1: Prevent and Effectively Treat Alzheimer's Disease by 2025</strong><br />
					As previously stated, establishing a firm deadline of 2025 is bold and transformative. However, research funds must increase to the Alzheimer's research community's recommendation of $2 billion in order to achieve this goal.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.1: Convene an Alzheimer's disease research summit with national and international scientists to identify priorities, milestones, and a timeline</strong></em>.<br />
					The Alzheimer's Association believes it is good to set and update priorities by garnering outside input. We also believe in addition to the National Institute on Aging (NIA), all Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that are funding Alzheimer's research should be an integral part of this planning process, including the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). We look forward to additional details as to how the priority setting activities will feed through to the peer review process so suitable funds are recommended for appropriate studies, and how the planning process will inform decision-making across the entire NIH and not just the NIA. We also look forward to a detailed research plan and timeline for activities soon following the May Summit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.3: Regularly update the National Plan and refine Goal 1 strategies and action items based on feedback and input</strong></em><br />
					In addition to informing the implementation of the National Alzheimer's Plan with feedback from the Alzheimer's Research Summit and the Request for Information (RFI), HHS and its federal partners should also seek input from the public and experts in the field when regularly updating the plan.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.4: Convene a scientific workshop on other dementias in 2013</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the National Alzheimer's Plan for addressing other dementias, in keeping with the intent of P.L. 111-375.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.A.5: Update research priorities and milestones</strong></em><br />
					The Advisory Council meeting should be held each year at a time most relevant to informing the President's annual budget for Alzheimer's research.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.1: Expand research to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease, and translate this information into potential targets for intervention</strong></em><br />
					The development of effective treatments that can delay, prevent and treat Alzheimer's will require a significant investment in our basic understanding of the disease. It will be critical that basic science receive sufficient funds to ensure adequate fundamental knowledge of the disease. To make this action meaningful and effective, the plan must include additional details on how this important research will be prioritized and expanded, what networks and mechanisms will be used to expedite translation of the basic science, and what level of funding will be committed in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.3: Increase enrollment in clinical trials and other clinical research through community, national, and international outreach</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes that increasing enrollment in clinical trials is critical to developing new treatments and eventually overcoming Alzheimer's disease. Groundbreaking research that could have a substantial impact on individuals with the disease now and in the future is significantly slowed by a lack of volunteers for Alzheimer's clinical trials. Recruiting and retaining trial participants is now the greatest obstacle, other than funding, to developing the next generation of Alzheimer's treatments. We believe HHS can expand registries through the promotion of existing Alzheimer's disease clinical trial matching services such as the Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch service.</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch is a free service that makes it easy for people with Alzheimer's, caregivers, families and physicians to locate clinical trials based on personal criteria (diagnosis, stage of disease) and location. The Alzheimer's Association TrialMatch lets interested individuals search trials quickly and easily, and narrows results to those trials where there is a reasonable chance to be accepted for enrollment, saving time for both the participant and the researcher.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.4: Monitor and identify strategies to increase enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies</strong></em><br />
					Monitoring enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in Alzheimer's disease studies should not be limited to the NIH. Tracking race and ethnicity should also be encouraged in the outreach recommended in Action 1.B.3. This tracking should also be done by the private sector.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.B.5: Conduct clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions</strong></em><br />
					The Association encourages greater specificity regarding the intent of this action as the norm in drug development is for clinical trials on the most promising pharmacologic interventions to be conducted by private industry. Although there is a government role in clinical development of non-proprietary interventions, we urge care be taken not to divert resources to areas already well covered by private industry at a time when research resources for Alzheimer's are stretched so thin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.1: Identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression</strong></em><br />
					While there have been great strides in the use of imaging and biofluids biomarkers over the last several years, to ensure this action is successful, significant research is still needed and will require a substantial investment. This action should also require assembling and maintaining a large cohort of subjects in all stages of the disease, including preclinical.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.C.2: Maximize collaboration among federal agencies and with the private sector</strong></em><br />
					Collaborations must include multi-disciplinary partners, including experts in clinical care, epidemiology, and public health. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be an active participant in these collaborations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.1: Inventory Alzheimer's disease research investments</strong></em><br />
					The research ontology is an important classification system that provides a framework for collective portfolio analysis and introduces opportunities for coordinated strategic planning and initiatives among partner organizations and research funders. The Association was pleased to work with the NIA on this important project and is looking forward to the possibilities of having a global view of what Alzheimer's research is being conducted.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.D.2: Expand international outreach to enhance collaboration</strong></em><br />
					As a global leader in Alzheimer's research, the Alzheimer's Association operates in a spirit of inclusiveness, seeking partnerships throughout the scientific community to propel the field of Alzheimer's research forward. In addition to connecting with the countries listed in the Action, connecting with established international organizations, such as Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI), would be valuable. We look forward to additional details on how the information gathered from this meeting will be turned into additional action plans and new research partnerships.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.1: Identify ways to compress the time between target identification and release of pharmacological treatments</strong></em><br />
					This Action should also include a review of regulatory science needs, biomarker qualification, clinical trial infrastructure barriers, new or adaptive clinical trial design and guidance on designing/approving prevention or disease-modifying trials. In addition to NIH, FDA and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), the consultation list should include private and non-profit funders of Alzheimer's research as well as the Department of Defense (DoD). A well-defined timeline for meetings and an action plan for this group should be established to ensure accountability and progress.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.2: Leverage public and private collaborations to facilitate dissemination, translation, and implementation of research findings</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association encourages the Secretary of HHS, the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, and the Secretary of Defense to work together to reduce barriers to working with private entities on agreed upon national strategic goals in Alzheimer's research. The federal government must increase its engagement with the private sector to move science forward as quickly as possible. Public-private partnerships present a key opportunity to leverage both public and private resources in this scarce fiscal environment. Government funders of Alzheimer's science should make available contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to facilitate new and innovative partnerships between public and private entities. This may include private or public research institutions, institutions of higher education, medical centers, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, disease advocacy organizations, patient advocacy organizations, or academic research institutions.</p>
<p>We believe that effectively achieving this strategy requires a single, dedicated office to oversee and manage this coordination, particularly internationally. This office could also be charged with coordinating all Alzheimer's-related efforts across the federal government, including care and support, thereby fulfilling the charge of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (P.L. 111-375) to ensure "coordination of Alzheimer's research and services across all Federal agencies."</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 1.E.3: Educate the public about the latest research findings</strong></em><br />
					The CDC's Healthy Aging Program, specifically the Healthy Brain Initiative (HBI), is an important example of their role in educating the public about the latest research findings connected to Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: Enhance Care Quality and Efficiency</strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association appreciates the Administration's announcement that $6 million will be dedicated over two years for provider education and outreach. While the $6 million is a great first step, we urge the Administration to dedicate additional funds for this endeavor to be successful.</p>
<p>To begin work under this area, the Association recommends targeted outreach to various provider groups. We believe HHS should promote an understanding of dementia among health care providers through a variety of mechanisms including the development of guidelines and quality measures. Once these guidelines are created, the development of online training modules would be most efficient. Additionally, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so care can be evaluated. Assisted living facilities should be added to the list of settings where high-quality care should be provided.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.1: Educate Healthcare Providers</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly supports a robust and well-educated workforce as an essential component to providing high-quality care to those with Alzheimer's disease. An adequate number of health care providers who are properly trained to understand the complexities of dementia will help ensure individuals with Alzheimer's disease have access to coordinated, quality care and ultimately drive us toward a dementia-capable health care system.</p>
<p>While the Association applauds the efforts outlined in the plan, we are concerned that the education component within this strategy may be limited. Many individuals with Alzheimer's disease enter the health care system through their primary care provider. To reach this target population, we encourage the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to play a major role in educational outreach, particularly to the Medicare provider community. CMS should issue guidance to providers outlining information that should be discussed with individuals and their caregivers after a diagnosis such as managing dementia with other chronic illnesses and referrals to existing community supports and services. CMS could partner with relevant stakeholders, such as the Alzheimer's Association, to develop resources to share with providers. Providers' education should also include guidance on the appropriateness and benefits of palliative and end-of-life care services, such as hospice, for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. This effort should include how and when providers should discuss the issue with the individual and their representative.</p>
<p>We also encourage the plan to address educating physicians and other health care providers on the value of an early diagnosis. Too often providers do not see or understand the value of an early diagnosis and therefore fail to diagnose and/or document Alzheimer's disease. Even among willing providers, a lack of training on the use of assessment tools and methods to encourage follow-up often delays detection of cognitive impairment and diagnostic evaluations.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that state and local public health departments should be included in this action item. The public health community is very good at educating health care providers. There are a number of evidence-based interventions for educating providers in a variety of settings that can be applied to Alzheimer's disease. We encourage HHS to support the necessary infrastructure to help state and local departments offer this type of education in public health settings.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.2: Encourage providers to pursue careers in geriatric specialties</strong></em><br />
					Funding and incentives for individuals interested in pursuing careers in geriatric specialties, particularly those that care for people with dementia, should be expanded.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.3: Collect and disseminate dementia-specific guidelines and curricula for all provider groups across the care spectrum</strong></em><br />
					We believe this strategy is vitally important, particularly with regard to the development of quality indicators. HHS should promote existing evidence-based guidelines and curricula. Where unavailable, HHS should work with relevant stakeholders who have developed evidence-based quality care guidelines, such as the <em>Alzheimer's Association's Dementia Care Practice Recommendations</em>, which incorporate the latest research and field evidence. Once appropriate quality indicators are identified and validated, efforts should be undertaken to integrate them into the health care system.</p>
<p>In addition, the Alzheimer's Association urges HHS to ensure that content within the proposed clearinghouse is current and easily accessible.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.4: Strengthen the direct-care workforce</strong></em><br />
					Section 6121 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that all certified nursing aides (CNAs) that work in nursing homes receive training on care for persons with dementia. As implementation of this provision progresses, the Association urges CMS to include a mechanism that ensures any recommended education materials are fully understood and absorbed. Further, CMS should publically establish the survey guidelines that will accompany this new requirement to ensure CNAs are appropriately trained.</p>
<p>The Association would like to see the plan also recommend that all direct care workers, including those in assisted living facilities and home- and community-based settings, be required to meet a similar standard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.A.5: Strengthen state aging workforces</strong></em><br />
					HHS should coordinate with states to develop Alzheimer's disease coordinators and workforces in state and local public health departments that will develop and implement Alzheimer's disease strategies. Strategies may include early detection and diagnosis campaigns, provider education campaigns, surveillance work, implementation of state Alzheimer's disease plans, and other essential public health services. HHS should also work with Aging Network staff to recognize the warning signs of dementia and be trained to assist individuals and their families when they seek appropriate medical care for detection and diagnosis.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.B.1: Link the public to diagnostic and treatment services</strong></em><br />
					To continue connecting families and people with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease to Alzheimer's-capable resources and meet growing demand, the Administration on Aging's (AoA) National Alzheimer's Call Center will require additional funding. The National Alzheimer's Call Center provides 24-hour, 7 day a week, year-round telephone support, crisis counseling, care consultation, and information and referral services in 140 languages for persons with Alzheimer's disease, their family members and informal caregivers. Trained professional staff and master's-level mental health professionals are available at all times. Since 2003, the National Alzheimer's Call Center has served more than 2 million people in the community. Additionally, it is important to note that the Alzheimer's Disease Centers, funded by NIA, are only available to certain areas of the country. As such, we urge HHS to include a solution in the final plan to ensure areas without resources have access to assistance, such as the Call Center.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.B.2: Identify and disseminate appropriate assessment tools</em></strong><br />
					To diagnose an individual with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment must first be detected in a clinical setting. As discussed, the ACA created the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) which includes the detection of cognitive impairment. To enhance the AWV, the Association believes the CDC should revise the model Health Risk Assessment (HRA), which is part of the AWV, to include questions about memory and other indicators of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>We also recommend including a strategy on enhancing detection in a clinical setting in addition to the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. While the draft plan refers to some of the issues involved in detecting cognitive impairment -- namely, assessment tools -- we believe it is important to emphasize detection of cognitive impairment as the precursor to a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.C.1: Educate physicians and other healthcare providers about accessing long-term services and supports and Action 2.C.2: Enhance assistance for people with AD and their caregivers to prepare for care needs</strong></em><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association strongly believes health care providers should be educated about available supports for newly-diagnosed individuals and their caregivers to provide better counsel through this difficult disease. This should include information medical and non-medical supports and services. Further, the Association believes Medicare should cover a visit in which a health care provider discusses current and future care planning, with the caregiver, with or without the beneficiary present, to ensure families receive vital information to navigate this difficult disease. The Alzheimer's Association stands ready and willing to partner with HHS to develop a list of appropriate resources to share with the provider community. In fact, our chapters are currently conducting outreach on the local level to make providers aware of the available supports in their own community.</p>
<p>As stated in the Association's <em>2012 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures</em>, at least 800,000 individuals with Alzheimer's disease live alone and as many as half do not have an identifiable caregiver. We strongly encourage HHS to further develop assistance for this particularly vulnerable population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.D.1: Explore dementia care guidelines and measures</em></strong><br />
					While developing dementia care guidelines and measures, it is important to develop Alzheimer's disease-specific quality measures so that care can be evaluated. In addition, the guidelines should include criteria and provisions for quality palliative and end-of-life care, including hospice care.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to build on existing quality initiatives, such as the Alzheimer's Association's <em>Campaign for Quality Residential Care</em>, which takes a person-centered approach and covers the basics of good care in six areas. The Association supports the development of additional quality measures and evidence-based care guidelines, and can serve as a resource in this effort.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.E.1: Evaluate the effectiveness of medical home models for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					While the medical home model holds promise, these models of care would need to be flexible to accommodate the specific needs of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, as they may require additional time and services to be effective for the Alzheimer's community. Moreover, it is recommended that care coordination designed specifically for Alzheimer's disease be highlighted for evaluation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, models should focus on aspects that seem to be particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices. Due to the nature of Alzheimer's disease, coaches and telephone disease management may not be particularly effective for this population.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.F.1: Identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with AD</em></strong><br />
					Acute care settings should implement Alzheimer's disease training for all health care practitioners to facilitate greater safety for people with the disease.</p>
<p>While it is critical to identify and disseminate models of hospital safety for people with Alzheimer's disease, there should be similar action on identifying and disseminating models of safety to be used by nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other residential care settings. Additionally, there should be similar action on this for emergency personnel and first responders.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 2.F.2: Implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions for people with Alzheimer's disease</strong></em><br />
					Most notably absent from the discussion of improving care transitions is the importance of making a documented diagnosis in an individual's medical record. Further, an individual should have a list of relevant medications documented in their medical record, especially prior to any care transition. The use of electronic medical records may also facilitate the availability of this information and should be explored particularly in the context of safer care transitions for patients with dementia.</p>
<p>Some individuals have behavioral problems related to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, appropriate community mental health services should be developed to include systems that strengthen the care needs of individuals with behavioral disturbances.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.1: Review evidence on care coordination models for people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					As mentioned in Action 2.E.1, the focus of these models should include aspects of the models are particularly beneficial for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, including face-to-face meetings with care coordinators and care coordinators located in primary care provider offices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.G.2: Implement and evaluate care coordination models</em></strong><br />
					Individuals with Alzheimer's disease who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid are likely to use more health care services and have less desirable outcomes without quality care coordination. For example, people with serious medical conditions and Alzheimer's or another dementia are more likely to be hospitalized than those with the same medical conditions but no Alzheimer's or dementia.</p>
<p>Initially, the evaluation of these integrated models of care should be weighted towards effective care coordination, rather than cost-savings, since individuals may have increased access to services that didn't have before. This is especially important when considering cost increases, which may occur in Medicaid services since individuals with Alzheimer's may not have had previous access to long-term care services and supports due to long waiting lists and state fiscal constraints.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 2.H.1: Create a taskforce to improve care for these specific populations</em></strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan must identify specific action steps to be undertaken to improve the care of those disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate the acknowledgement that people with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease, racial and ethnic minorities, and people with intellectual disabilities are disproportionally burdened by Alzheimer's and related dementias.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 3: Expand Patient and Family Support</strong><br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan provides a unique and important opportunity to widely deploy effective, evidenced-based strategies to help family caregivers. Often, financial barriers prevent families from accessing the support they need to provide care for their loved one. Although there are a number of strategies and actions to address support for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their families, the plan does not clearly address additional funding for respite care -- whether it be in day centers or within the home.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.A.2: Distribute materials to caregivers</em></strong><br />
					As HHS considers which agencies, federal departments, and state and local networks to distribute materials, it should also consider including the CDC's Healthy Aging Program.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.5: Provide effective caregiver interventions through AD-capable systems</em></strong><br />
					In addition to developing more services, the Alzheimer's Association believes existing services to support caregivers should be promoted, supported, and expanded. Furthermore, while this action mentions respite care, it does so only in terms of providing referrals and does not include increased funding so that families can access such services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.B.7: Support caregivers in crisis and emergency situations</em></strong><br />
					HHS should look for ways to promote the National Alzheimer's Call Center and its services as a crisis resource for caregivers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.C.1: Examine awareness of long-term care needs and barriers to planning for these needs and Action 3.C.2: Expand long-term care awareness efforts</em></strong><br />
					We encourage the plan to consider addressing all aspects of long-term care, including financial planning, driving, and safety issues. Increasing the awareness of future care planning could help individuals and their families address challenges earlier and help avoid crises later.</p>
<p>We would encourage HHS to examine the barriers to long-term care, which may include studying the availability and impact of long-term care insurance as people with Alzheimer's disease, particularly those with younger-onset, may face unique challenges when trying to purchase insurance.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.D.1: Educate legal professionals about working with people with Alzheimer's disease</em></strong><br />
					The education of legal professionals should be expanded to include other entities in the legal system, including law enforcement, first responders, prosecutors, and judges.</p>
<p>Broader awareness of Alzheimer's disease may help prevent or reduce arrests of individuals with Alzheimer's who are charged with crimes for which they have no intent, such as unintentional trespassing. Further, it may help legal professionals and first responders to spot abuse -- physical and non-physical -- against people with the disease. In addition, State Adult Protective Service (APS) agencies are overburdened and understaffed, resulting in a limited ability to provide any support except in the most dire of circumstances. We encourage the plan to address the need for additional resources dedicated to protecting the safety and rights of individuals with Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Finally, the plan must acknowledge the large number of individuals with Alzheimer's who live alone -- many of whom do not even have an identifiable caregiver. In maintaining the dignity, safety, and rights of those with the disease, special attention must be given to this population. We hope that the plan considers guidance for legal professionals seeking to balance autonomy and individual safety.</p>
<p><em><strong>Action 3.D.2: Monitor, report and reduce inappropriate use of anti-psychotics in nursing homes</strong></em><br />
					Individuals living with dementia may experience behavioral and psychotic symptoms (BPSD) during the course of their disease due to the alterations in processing, integrating and retrieving new information that accompanies dementia. Non-pharmacologic approaches should be tried as a first-line alternative to pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of BPSD. The Association recommends training and education for both professional and family caregivers on psychosocial interventions. Further, we recommend the plan call for similar monitoring and reporting in assisted living facilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 3.E.1: Explore affordable housing models</em></strong><br />
					At least 800,000 Americans with Alzheimer's disease live alone. Compared to those with Alzheimer's who live with someone else, on average, people with Alzheimer's who live alone are more likely to live in poverty and require assistance performing tasks such as managing money, shopping, traveling, housekeeping, preparing meals and taking medications correctly. We encourage HHS to explore affordable housing models that will allow this unique population to live safely within their communities.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 4: Enhance Public Awareness and Engagement </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Action 4.A.1: Design and conduct a national education and outreach initiative</em></strong><br />
					The public awareness campaign in Action 4.A.1 must be culturally-sensitive and reach those in underserved locations.</p>
<p><strong>Goal 5: Improve Data to Track Progress</strong><br />
					Obtaining a more definitive picture of Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and related caregiving burdens is essential to any successful strategy to combat the disease. Public health surveillance and comprehensive data collection will not only assist the federal government in addressing policy questions and planning new initiatives, they will provide the research, caregiving, and public health communities a better understanding of people with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and identify opportunities for reducing the impact of the disease at all levels of government.</p>
<p>At a minimum, this should include state-by-state public health surveillance on cognitive impairment and caregiver burden, preferably through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), coordinated by the CDC. Moreover, this strategy should also include improving existing federal surveys such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the National Health Interview Survey so that they can adequately capture information about those with Alzheimer's and other dementias.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.1: Identify major policy research needs and Action 5.A.2: Identify needed changes or additions to data</em></strong><br />
					The CDC has been a leader in incorporating measures of cognitive health into other population health monitoring efforts. The CDC Healthy Aging Program has worked on identifying databases, worked with partners to add questions on cognitive impairment and caregiving to the BRFSS and added questions on cognitive impairment to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) The CDC is currently analyzing data from these datasets as they become available. In particular, BRFSS data are unique and allow for state- and local-level data that can highlight the needs of diverse populations in the United States.</p>
<p>The CDC Healthy Aging Program developed a 10-question BRFSS module on Perceived Cognitive Impairment. Twenty-two states included the module on their state BRFSS in 2011 and an additional 16 states are including the module in 2012 for a total of 38 states, including the District of Columbia. The CDC Healthy Aging Program is working with partners, including states, to expand the module in 2013 to all 50 states. They are also producing reports and publications regarding these data to inform decision-makers about the perceived impact of cognitive impairment at the state and local levels.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.A.3: Make needed improvements to data</em></strong><br />
					Using data to improve and track progress is essential and we commend its inclusion in the draft plan. This critical information should be publically available, as well as to the Advisory Council. In monitoring progress, it would be useful to have de-identified data that corresponds to the disease stage (preclinical through end-of-life) to identify areas for improvement in care and services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.1: Designate responsibility for action implementation</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association commends the intent to designate responsibility for each action step. However, we urge designation of individual accountable for each action, rather than simply a "contact person."</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.2: Track plan progress</em></strong><br />
					Tracking on plan progress as described in this action step should be provided to the public on no less than a quarterly basis. In general, we urge that the reporting on progress regarding each action be paired with greater clarity and specificity regarding desired outcomes than has been provided in the draft plan.</p>
<p><strong><em>Action 5.B.3: Update the National Plan annually</em></strong><br />
					The Alzheimer's Association urges that updates to the plan be done with the same transparency and opportunities for comment that has characterized the formulation of this initial National Alzheimer's Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:<br />
					The National Alzheimer's Plan should allow us, for the first time to answer this simple question: <em>Did we make satisfactory progress in the fight against Alzheimer's disease?</em> For too many individuals living with Alzheimer's and their families, the system has failed them, and today we are unnecessarily losing the battle against this devastating disease. A successful National Alzheimer's Plan offers us the opportunity to change that, and set a new trajectory for this rapidly expanding global epidemic through American leadership.</p>
<p>As we all know, a plan accomplishes nothing without thorough and effective implementation that is coupled with transparency and accountability for those actions. The Alzheimer's Association looks forward to a final National Alzheimer's Plan that is urgent, transformational, achievable and accountable. The recommendations listed above, <strong>combined with the recommendations of the Advisory Council subcommittees</strong>, will help to build the strongest possible National Alzheimer's Plan to overcome the escalating burden of Alzheimer's disease on American families.</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate this opportunity to comment on the <em>Draft National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</em>. If you wish to discuss any of these issues further, please feel free to contact Rachel Conant, Alzheimer's Association Director of Federal Affairs.</p>
